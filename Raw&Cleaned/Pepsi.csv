possible within the hour, we have kept our prepared r
emarks relatively short 
this morning, and we are going to have a one question limit, so we should 
be able to get through the full queue of analysts when we get to Q&A.
 
Before we begin, please take note of our cautionary statement. This 
conference call incl
udes forward
-
looking statements, including statements 
regarding 2013 guidance based on currently available information. Forward
-
looking statements inherently involve risks and uncertainties that could 
cause our actual results to differ materially from thos
e predicted in such 
forward
-
looking statements. Statements made on this conference call should 
be considered together with the cautionary statements and other 

periodic reports filed w
ith the SEC.
 
Unless otherwise indicated, all references to EPS and total operating profit 
growth are on a core basis. In addition, references to organic revenue 
results in this call exclude the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, 
structural changes, a
nd foreign exchange translation. To find disclosures and 
reconciliations of non

GAAP measures that we may use when discussing 


stors section 

results today, please keep in mind that our Q1 reporting period is the 12 
weeks ended March 23 for North America businesses and is the months of 
January and February
 
for the vast majority of our businesses outside North 
America.
 

 
Indra Nooyi
 
Thanks Jamie, and good morning everyone. Last February, we announced 
and then executed a number of important actions to strength
en and ensure 
the long
-
term success of our business. Since then, we have driven greater 
productivity, significantly increased our advertising and marketing 
investments, and upped our execution in the market. Today, I am very 
pleased to report strong first 
quarter results. We had mid single
-
digit organic 
revenue growth, double
-
digit core EPS growth, and a significant 
improvement in cash flow. We feel good about these results in what has 
been, and continues to be a competitive landscape and a volatile macro 
e
nvironment.
 
The first quarter has us confident that we are on track to meet our 2013 
financial guidance. Our organic revenue growth was 4.4% right in line with 
our mid single
-
digit long
-
term target, with particularly strong growth at 
Frito
-
Lay North Americ
a, Latin American snacks, international beverages, 
and snacks and beverages throughout Asia, Middle East, and Africa.
 
Organic revenue growth reflected a good balance of volume and net pricing. 
Our overall servings increased 3%, with snacks volume growth of
 
4% and 
beverage volume growth of 1% in an organic basis, but our international 
beverage volume growth was very strong, up 9% on a reported basis and 
6% on an organic basis. More specifically, developing and emerging markets 
volume was particularly impress
ive with snacks volume growth of 5.5% and 
beverage volume growth of 7% of an organic basis. North American 
beverages volume was negative driven by specific decisions we made to take 
pricing and sustain it during the quarter.
 
We had good profit flow through
 
with core gross margins improving almost 
130 basis points in the quarter, core constant currency operating profit up 
9% and our core operating margin up more than 80 basis points. Each of our 
four business units grew core gross margins, expanded our healt
h core 
operating margins and grew operating profit, and we remain focused on cash 
flow and cash returns. Management operating cash flow excluding certain 
items was more than $460 million a significant increase over Q1, 2012. In 
addition we returned over 1.
4 billion to shareholders in the quarter in the 
form of dividends and share repurchases up more than 50% year
-
over
-
year.

line.
 
Innovation was a strong contributor to our overall organic sales growth and
 
we continue to see positive signs in terms of both improving brand equity 
scores of our global brands and market share results. And our productivity 
program is squarely on track. We have targeted $900 million in savings this 
year which is a second year of
 
our three year $3 billion productivity 



new 
processing technologies that enable us to both increase asset utilization and 
reduce input cost. We are well on our way to achieving our current 
productivity goal of $3 billion and we have our team now focused on 
identifying and planning the next gener
ation of projects that would extend 
our productivity savings well beyond the current program.
 

like advertising and new product launches and to simultaneously drive 
margin improvem
ent. This was evident in the first quarter where A&M 
expense increased by 50 basis points while delivering an 80 basis point 
improvement in core operating margins.
 
Turning now to our businesses, let me comment briefly on them in four 
buckets, Frito
-
Lay in 
North America, North American beverages, all other 
developed markets businesses and then developing and emerging markets. 
Let me begin with Frito
-
Lay North America. Frito had a good first quarter, we 
generated mid
-
single digit volume and revenue growth and
 
going forward 
we expect modest pricing to create a bit more of a spread between volume 
and revenue than you saw in the first quarter. We expanded core operating 
margins by 40 basis points even as we increased advertising and marketing 
expense. More import
antly in Q1, Frito
-
Lay gained volume, unit and value 
share across major channels in the United States. We feel good about Frito
-


er macro snacks like 
cookies, crackers, nuts and seeds. For example our Tostitos Cantina is 
sourcing cracker occasions while Doritos Jacked is sourcing occasion from 
microwavable snacks.
 
Additionally with our focus on the growing premium snacking occasion 

realizing additional growth and profitability. For example in Q1, Sabra dips 

premium offerings which give us additional space in the produce and deli 
sections of the grocery stores. So 
as we look at Frito we believe it's in good 
shape.
 
Let me turn now to North American beverages. Our goal in North American 
Beverages is to judicially balance share and profitability. Now this is very 
important because we compete in every sub
-
category of th
e LRB segment 
and any growth we achieve in one business comes largely at the expense of 
another sub
-
category where we also compete.
 
So we have to be very careful to compete in this large and profitable LRB 
business in a responsible way focused more on inno
vation marketing, 
balancing share and profit. It's our experience that short term volume 
driving activities merely rent share and is not a value creating strategy.
 
Now, let me talk about the category itself and our performance in it. As you 
all know, about
 
[65%] [ph] of category is non
-
carbonated beverages, and 
this segment continues to show growth potential. In the first quarter, we 
had good performance in teas and chilled juices, ready
-
to
-
drink coffee and 
sports drinks, all supported by successful innovat
ion. Our Pure Leaf product 
under the Lipton trademark, Tropicana Farmstand, Naked, our super
-


despite less than favor
able weather in many parts of the country.
 

made up of colas and about 18 points are made up of flavored CSDs. Within 
flavored CSDs, Mountain Dew continues to perform well significantly 
outperforming the overall CSD category and gaining four
-
tenths of a share 
point in the quarter bolstered by the launch of Kickstart, and the momentum 
of Kickstart continued into April. However, the cola category continues to be 
a challenge. We took pricing
 
in this declining category and continued to 
invest in R&D to break some of the compromises that caused consumers to 
leave the cola category. While this work progresses, we are managing the 
business responsibly and profitably. We are supporting Pepsi with 
package 
and product innovation to drive price realization and investing appropriately 
in A&M.
 
And this is what you see reflected in our first quarter PAB performance. We 
had good disciplined net price realization. Our revenue performance was 
generally in l
ine with the category. A&M expense increased by 30 basis 
points versus Q1 of 2012. We expanded core operating margins by 50 basis 
points, and we grew core constant currency operating profit 4% in the 
quarter. So, as we go forward expect us to continue to p
lay a responsible 
game in North American beverages to be competitive of course, but to also 
enhance our financial performance. And across the beverage business, we 
are taking out costs to drive margin and improve returns under our current 
structure, while 
we continue our work to explore sensible opportunities to 
unlock incremental value through meaningful structural alternatives. And as 
we told you in the last earnings call, we do not intend to talk about this until 
early next year.
 
Let me now turn to our o
ther developed markets outside the United States. 
We saw good performance in some of our larger markets. The UK had 5% 
organic revenue growth, Germany was up 8%, France grew 10%, but 
Western European macros overall continued to be challenging, and we 
expec
t it will continue to put pressure on consumer spending going forward.
 
Emerging and developing markets, we saw very good growth in these 
markets in Q1 with organic revenue growth of 12%, made up of 14% in 
snacks and 9% in beverages driven by execution of o
ur strategy to increase 
household penetration and frequency of consumption. We had terrific growth 
across each of our major developing markets with organic revenue growth of 
6% in Mexico, 8% in Turkey, and 12% in Brazil. And our emerging markets 
performanc
e drove the continued great results in our EMEA sector, where 
organic volume grew double
-
digits in each of snacks and beverages, and 
organic revenue grew 15%. Within our emerging markets, organic revenue 
was especially strong in Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, Vie
tnam, and the Philippines 
with each growing in excess of 20%. And organic revenue grew 19% in 
Jordan and 18% in Egypt. And China performed especially well with organic 
volume growth of 17% in beverages and 47% in snacks. Importantly, we 
also saw nice impro
vement in core operating margins in EMEA with a 450 
basis point increase even as we continued to invest in brand building and 
capacity to drive future growth.
 
So, overall, we feel good about the state of the business and our first 
quarter performance. Top 
line was strong. We continued to invest in our 
brands to fuel growth. Productivity is on track. And we saw solid core 
operating margin improvement and core operating profit growth. With the 

r degree 
of confidence in delivering our 2013 financial guidance in a global micro
-
economic environment that continues to be volatile. To summarize, PepsiCo 


re being disciplined and responsible across the 
board in balancing value share and profitability and the overall portfolio is 
working in terms of scale, geographic reach and product diversity covering 
snacks and beverages and different day parts, need stat
es and cohorts. So 
with that let me turn the call over to Hugh.
 
Hugh Johnston
 
Thanks Indra and good morning everyone. I will spend just a minute 
covering the financial results and guidance in a little more detail and then we 
will open the lines to your que
stions. For Q1 organic volume grew 4% in 
snacks and 1% in beverages with international organic volumes up 6% in 
beverages and 5% in snacks. Organic revenue grew 4.4%, our core gross 
margins improved by about 130 basis points and we reinvested almost 50 
bas
is points in A&M. core operating margin improved by 80 basis points and 
core constant currency operating profit grew 9%. Net interest expense 
increased by $12 million reflecting higher debt balances, our core effective 
tax rate was 24.5% approximately 220 
basis points below Q1, 2012 and 
core constant currency EPS grew 13%.
 
So between core constant currency division operating profit growth of 7% 
and core constant currency EPS growth of 13% we got about six points of 
leverage, one point from corporate unalloc
ated some of which is timing 
related. Slight leverage from net interest expense, three points from tax rate 

approximately 27% and one point from weighted average share count which 
was
 
down 1% year
-
on
-
year. Overall the quarter came in as expected with 
pricing actions, commodity inflation and productivity all in
-
line with our 
expectations. On a reported basis net revenue was up 1%, and that was 
driven by a 0.5 point drag from 4x and at 3
 
point negative impact from 

operating profit and EPS included to be $111 million net monetary asset 
write down in Venezuela that we talked about on the Q4 call. We generated 
over $700 m
illion in cash flow from operations in the quarter, a $1.4 billion 
positive swing versus last year. This was driven by lower pension 
contributions, stronger working capital improvements and a reduction in net 
capital spending.
 
Management operating cash flo
w excluding certain items was $464 million 
an increase of $385 million over Q1 of last year and we returned over $1.4 
billion to shareholders this quarter in the form of dividends and share 
repurchases of 52% increase year
-
over
-
year. Now turning to guidanc
e, for 
2013 we expect core constant currency EPS growth of 7% of a core 2012 
base of $4.10. More specifically we expect organic revenue growth of mid
-
single digits, core constant currency operating profit growth of 
approximately 6% and approximately 1 poin
t of leverage below the 
operating profit line driven by share repurchases offset somewhat by higher 
net interest expense of approximately $90 million from higher debt balances. 
And we expect our core effective tax rate to be approximately 27% for the 
full 
year.
 
Within these expectations we assume positive price mix, low single digit 
commodity inflation, productivity of $900 million and A&M growing at least 
in
-
line with our net revenue growth. Our productivity assumption is 
completely in
-
line with the 
three year $3 billion program that we launched 
last year and the savings will be used to help offset inflation as well as to 
provide funding for investment back into the business. One of our key 
investment areas is supporting our brands with advertising an
d marketing, 
where we will grow A&M investment at least in line with net sales meaning 
you should expect A&M spending of at least 5.7% of sales, which was our 
2012 baseline investment.
 
In addition, we are also accelerating our investment in R&D and innovat
ion. 
Based on current market consensus, we anticipate foreign exchange 
translation to have approximately a 1 point negative impact on our net 
revenue, operating profit, and EPS for the full year, including the impact of 
the Venezuela devaluation. Our ForEx
 
outlook is marginally more negative 
than what we shared with you on the Q4 call, but still rounding to 1% at this 
point. And we anticipate structural changes will have a negative impact on 
our full year net revenue growth of approximately 1 point driven b
y China 
and Vietnam.
 
Overall, we are pleased with how the first quarter came in and that increases 
our confidence in delivering our full year guidance. I would encourage you 
not to increase your estimates however. The world remains a volatile place, 
and we
 
may also choose to incrementally invest in the long
-
term value 
building initiatives, such as advertising, innovation, and in emerging markets 
growth capacity.
 
As you model out the second quarter, we expect foreign exchange 
translation to have up to a nega
tive 2 point impact on second quarter 
revenue and EPS based on current market consensus rates. We expect 
revenue in the second quarter will have an estimated 1 point negative 

China an
d our recently announced refranchising of Vietnam. We will also 
have a gain on the Vietnam transaction, which we intend to reinvest in the 

guidance. Commodity inflation will ramp 
up sequentially from the first 
quarter, but our full year outlook remains unchanged from our original 
guidance of low single
-
digits.
 
In Europe, given the timing of expenses and continued challenges in 

mance may 
moderate from the Q1 performance, and we expect higher A&M expense will 
negatively impact margins around 

 
across the business. From a cash flow 
perspective, we expect full year core management operating cash flow, 
excluding certain items of more
 
than $7 billion. We will continue to drive 
cash flow through even more efficient working capital management and 
continued tight controls over capital spending. And for 2013, we expect to 
see continued improvement in our key working capital metrics and to 
manage net capital spending to approximately $3 billion, which is well within 
our long
-
term target of less than or equal to 5% of net revenue. As a result, 
we will continue to return strong cash flow through our shareholders. In 
total, we expect to return 
approximately $6.4 billion to shareholders in 
2013, $3.4 billion in dividends, and $3 billion in share repurchases.
 
Net, our outlook for 2013 is consistent with our long
-
term targets for net 
revenue, operating profit, and core constant currency EPS. We exp
ect to 
drive improved margins and net ROIC and generating and returning cash 
flow to our shareholders remains a top priority for the company. So, with 
that, operator, we will take the first question.

Thank you. (Operato

Good morning Bryan.

Just a question on the operating leverage in the quar


sense for how much of it was driven just simply by commodity disinflation, 
how much of it is driven by the pricing 

 
pricing actions, I guess, in Lati
n 

 

productivity kind of drop to the bottom
-

for when we look at the margin expansion in the quarter and t
ry to look at it 
going forward just the weightings in terms of what those items contributed 
to the margin expansion.
 
Hugh Johnston
 

little bit difficult to parse all of that. No
 
doubt they were all contributing 
factors, we clearly did have some pricing in excess of inflation for the 
quarter but we also got more than our share of the $900 million of 
productivity in the quarter and that was flowing through as well. Instead of 
break
ing the specific pieces down what we really try to do is just give you 
guidance on what we expect the outputs to be and at least give you a sense 

happening in operating margin. What I w
ould just say is at both price in 

that margin expansion.
 
Operator
 
Your next question comes from the line of John Faucher with JPMorgan 
Chase.
 
John Faucher 
-
 
JPMorgan
 
Just want t
o follow
-
up a little bit Indra on your comments on North America, 
if we look at the scanner data pricing which is really what we have to work 
with, your pricing in CSDs accelerated a little bit through the quarter and on 

th of your largest competitors in terms of 
pricing in CSDs and I guess the big concern given the weak volume number 
is profits without a balanced algorithm really are not sustainable and people 


heading into 2012. So how do we think about that balance going forward 


back in order 
to get the volume moving? So any sort of follow
-
up there?
 
Indra Nooyi
 
In the last call I think we talked about Q1 always being sort of a funny 
quarter because all the weather related impacts hit us on Q1. So it's very 
hard to read the year from Q1 alone bu
t having said that let me tell you that 
we look very carefully at this trade
-
off between volume, pricing and profit, 


here you 


approached it. We saw some interesting pricing activity in the first five or six 
weeks of the quarter an
d at the second half of the quarter we started to put 
in the right actions on pricing, very granular, very targeted still with an eye 
towards profitability to make sure that we balance volume, revenue and 
profitability very carefully and if we look at the 
last six weeks or the last nine 
weeks the performance is very different. So believe me John, your point is 

the end of the day I think this industry requires responsible behavior
 
and 

-
carbs portfolio 
very carefully while getting ready for this reinvention of carbonated soft 

declines for the balance 
of the year to be at the magnitude of the first 
quarter.
 
Operator
 
Your next question comes from the line of Judy Hong with Goldman Sachs.
 
Judy Hong 
-
 
Goldman Sachs
 
On some of your emerging market or developing market, performance I 
guess it's been now a fe
w quarters where your profitability is starting to 
really ramp up. So can you just give us some perspective on the 
sustainability of that kind of profit improvement, your level of investment 

 
guess 
profitability, improvement how much of that is going to really drive your 
overall profit growth performance.
 
Indra Nooyi
 
Judy, emerging and developing market have been growing robustly from a 
GDP perspective and the differential between 
developed markets and 
emerging and developing markets tend to be about between three and six 
points in terms of GDP growth. So if you look across the world, emerging, 

Over the past fiv
e or six years, as you well know we have been investing to 
shift our portfolio to be more balanced between emerging and developing 
markets and developed markets because prior to 2006 we tended to be 
more of a developed market predominantly U.S based compan
y. So the last 
six years we have been working very hard to diversify the portfolio. So what 

beginning to pay off bit by bit. When you first make the investments it is 
dilutive to profit
ability but you have to make those investments between 
M&A and organic investments we had to do it. Now, bit by bit, as developed 

-
2005, and as the developing 
and emerging market investments start to payoff, the 
combination is 
beginning to yield results. Now, if you are asking for projection, I mean, 

PepsiCo algorithm works, because we have this nice mix of developed and 
developing and e
merging markets, and as margin improves in those markets 
and developed markets also continued to grow the overall portfolio works, 
the overall financial profile works.

Your next question comes from the line of Ali Dibadj with Sanford Bernstein.

Hey, guys. Thanks.

Very good. Thank you.
 
Ali Dibadj

Sanford Bernstein
 
Good. Want to ask a little bit about this balancing act that is 
certainly going 
on in North America, it sounds like successfully, particularly on North 
America CSDs, where you are seeing volume as what volume is, we are 
going to try to do better, but it is what it is, and we are going to try to drive 
profitability to t

 
Indra Nooyi
 
And so the question being Ali?
 
Hugh Johnston
 
I think he is asking the balancing act between profit and market share.
 
Indra Nooyi
 
Yeah, good ahead.
 
Hugh Johnston
 
Yeah. So, Ali, I guess, what I would say is this, as Indra mentioned in her
 
opening remarks, we are basically trying to do two things. Number one, we 

something that we think is important for the long
-
term of the business. At 
the same time, we do think that this is a
 

 

business that generates a lot of cash flow, and obviously, we are looking for 
it to generate profit growth as it did in Q1 with PAB delivering 4% profit 
growth, which is certainly a positive, I think in the industry. The bal
ancing 
act that we are ultimately going to manage to is ensuring that within the 
categories we are being smart about how we manage each of the categories, 
where we choose to gain share, where we choose to hold share.
 
The second thing that we are going to b
e doing is we will be playing a price 
package game to ensure that we do look to across the package portfolio to 
get price realization, where we can, and in that vein one of the things that 
you know we are doing this year is what we have called our hybrid E
DD, 
which is to try to balance out holiday and non
-
holiday pricing to try to send 
the message to consumers that not to buy only when the product is deeply 
discounted. And then obviously the last decision that we have made is a 
decision to invest in researc
h and development to address some of the core 
dissatisfiers with some of the products with the belief that innovation is the 

what we are looking to do in the North American beverage
 
space, and we 

 
Indra Nooyi
 

because the North American beverages we participate in every sub
-
segment 
of the North American beverage business. So, 
we have to be careful that we 


 
take pricing down too much in one category and 
source from a more profitable part of the other sub
-
category. So, we have to 
make sure we play this overall category game very, very carefully. And 
because w
e have owned the operating businesses around the world in 
snacks, we are very, very cognizant of how you play the game in a big 


ound the world from our 
various operating businesses. And I think we are borrowing a page from that 
playbook to participate in this NAB, in the North American Beverage 
business.

Your next question comes from the line of Dara Mohsenian with Morgan 
Stanley.
 
Dara Mohsenian

Morgan Stanley
 
Good morning.
 
Indra Nooyi
 
Good morning, Dara.
 
Dara Mohsenian

So, Hugh, given that the 9% core profit growth in Q1 despite the 11% ad 
increase, your full year guidance implies a few hundred 
basis point slowdown 
at least in the balance of the year on core profit growth, and I know you 
mentioned commodities get worse, but I was hoping for a bit more detail on 
why you would expect that level of deceleration. And also can you quantify 
what you ar
e expecting on commodities in the balance of the year relative to 
Q1?
 
Hugh Johnston
 
Yeah. So, I think a couple of things to keep in mind on that, Dara. The first 

as we look forw
ard into the balance of the year, we are certainly thinking 
about our guidance in the context of the world being a volatile place and at 
the same time ensuring that we deliver our guidance through thick and think 
in terms of the challenges that we might fa
ce.
 
The second piece to consider is given that we have seen some success in 
terms of moving the top
-
line with investments that we have made in the 

shareholder value but to the degr
ee that there are opportunities to invest in 

to be looking towards doing that as well. And then the last piece I talked 
about core division operating profit growth of 7% for the qu
arter and core 

point gap and frankly with the timing of the A&M expenses, with the timing 
of commodities that gap isn't so large that just sort of the general quarterly 
movements in
 
those expenses would move the number from a 7 through a 6 

hopefully that gives you a little bit of a sense of the context as to how we 
are thinking about it as well.

Your 
next question comes from the line of Bill Schmitz with Deutsche Bank.
 
Bill Schmitz 
-
 
Deutsche Bank
 
Can you just give us some color on the organic growth rate and some of the 
bigger country? So Russia, China, exiting the partnership, Brazil and Mexico 
and m
aybe Gatorade on the organic side too and then the second part of the 
question is maybe how March is looking at some of the international markets 
because I know (inaudible) in February so maybe some update on what is 

r view is going forward?
 
Indra Nooyi
 
So organic growth pretty much in every one of those markets was strong 
and we talked about it in our earnings. China, volume grew organic revenue 
grew, if you look at the UK, you look at Russia; you look at every countr
y 
pretty much across the board we had organic revenue growth whether it was 

world they will wear. We did not have some organic growth. So we feel good 
about the growth rates even thoug
h many of these international markets 
were just two months. India grew 9%, Egypt grew 20%, Saudi grew 21%, 
Pakistan grew 37%. I could go on and on but every one of these grew mid
-
single digits or even in the 20s or 30s. So good revenue performance across 
t
he board. The first quarter is a two months quarter, it's a lowest, it's the 
smallest quarter in the year and so the cost and the profits are not fully 
balanced. So what I would say to you is that we had very good growth 
margins in EMEA for example we had 
438 gross margin basis point 

how that evolves through the year but all that I tell you is that Latin 
America, EMEA doing well margins expanding profit going well, Russia doing 
wel
l.
 

macroeconomic environment and North America we have talked enough 
about it. So overall I would say it's a good outlook for our developing and 
emerging markets.

Your next 
question comes from the line of Caroline Levy with CLSA.
 
Caroline Levy 

 
CLSA
 
I wonder if you could actually just the last part of the last question was 
around Gatorade and Trop and talk about the strategy for this year and 
longer term the repositioning th
at happened at Gatorade and what the 
volume was like this quarter.
 
Indra Nooyi
 
Actually Gatorade and Tropicana had very good quarters and sequentially 
the performance is sustaining itself. Again as you well know and Gatorade 

game between Gatorade Juice, Gatorade 
Hydration and Gatorade Recover and as a system that business is doing 
well. We are staying very true to our premium sports nutrition positioning 

 
and sports nutrition even though we had low priced competition come in 

gain shares. So we feel very good about our sports nutrition strategy. In the 
case of Tropicana between Tropic
ana Trop 50, name of the Tropicana 
franchise also includes Naked, but let me just speak to Tropicana. Again, 
coming out of the first part of Q1, going to the second part, and now going 
into Q2, we are beginning to gain share in the chilled juice category, 
just a 
lot of great advertising, incredible execution focus in all of our traditional 
strongholds. And we are seeing impressive performance gains in Tropicana. 

innovation into the Tr
opicana franchise and the launch of Tropicana 
Farmstand, which is our fruit and vegetable product is also doing very, very 
well. So, continued to look for innovation from Tropicana, we feel good about 
tailwinds of those categories, because they are more in
 
the nutrition space 
coupled with the fact that our brands are very strong.

Good morning Indra. I am good. Thank you. Two
-
part question, it looks like 
in C stores, there is an increasing divergence between what you are seeing 
on the snacks side of your business and the beverage 
component of your 
business and how do you say, we have only got two months here. So, 
perhaps on the beverage side, we should not make too much of that. Can 
you speak to how accurate that assessment is and kind of what kind of 
promise these tie
-
ins with AB 
and the promotions you have kind of 
incrementally from a (indiscernible) perspective, how you feel they might 
address that issue? And then kind of related to that, but could we speak a 
little bit more about how this large format effort on the promotional s
ide, 
changing the promotional calendars is actually going, it sounds like the aim 
is good and you have had some success to an extent, but perhaps the pace 
of success in terms of getting a better promotional environment is a little 
slower than you would hav
e thought about a year ago?

Convenience stores in the first quarter, especially the first part of the first 

talking about our business, as a channel, convenience stores 
did not perform 
very well, because weather impacted convenience stores significantly, and 

perform well, but now as the weather is improving across the country little 
bit slower than w

that good. But we are seeing trends improving convenience stores, and we 
are very strong in convenience stores both in beverages and snacks. And we 
are beginning to see sequential improvement. An
d because of the 
underperformance in the first part of Q1 of the channel itself and now that 
we are seeing sequential improvement, we think the year for C stores would 
still end up with sort of 3.5%, 4% growth in the channel. And if the channel 
grows at th
at rate, you should expect to see good performance from PepsiCo 
in that channel. I would be honest with you the divergence between snacks 
and beverages, is not that much both our businesses are doing fairly well in 
the convenience stores. And I think that 
as the year goes on, you start to 
see better performance in the convenience store channel. And in terms of 

 
you wanted to add something Hugh?
 
Hugh Johnston
 
Yeah, if I can add just particularly to the convenience store please as well. I 
mean, as Indra ment
ioned, that the weather lapped in convenience is 
particularly challenging for beverages. I mean, we had a particularly warm 

just going to have a more natural effect on beverages t
han it will on the 
snacks business. And I think the divergence that you are referring to can be 

the overall performance of the convenience channel, which was down 
obviously in 
the first quarter. And as Indra mentioned, we expect the full 

weather as much of a conversation piece, but I think in this case, because 

gnificant impact on that channel 
in that particular set of businesses, it is a relevant factor.

Hi. I just had a follow
-
up on the C store channel and then Frito

Lay. I was 
actually hoping you could give us a little more color in some of the new 
initiatives in this channel such as your individual store plan
 
events that you 
started to implement, curiously how broad
-
based this initiative will be, and 
then maybe could you talk about any other changes you have been making 
in the important channel?
 
Indra Nooyi
 
Well, Frito
-
Lay has always had the convenience store 
as a very, very strong 
go to market outlet and continues to be that way. Frito had terrific 
performance in Q1 and to get to that level of detail on how individual store 
planograms are working on. My suggestion is that at some point if you want 
to visit Fri
to
-
Lay and get a better sense of what they are doing in these 
stores we invite you to do that.
 
Bonnie Herzog

Wells Fargo
 

obviously have made the move with certain packages in te
rms of moving 
into a larger volume on size and in addition to that we got some terrific 
innovation out in convenient stores right now and that innovation obviously 
really does help Frito
-
Lay, it is so sensitive to flavor innovation and 
convenience is where
 
you tend to get a lot of trial on that stuff early on. 
Frankly if that works really well and we feel very, very good about it.

In the past you have called the U.S. pricing environment probably one of the 

changed your mind about that with what happened over the last couple of 
years and pricing seeming to b
e a little bit more rational and then the 
second part is are we seeing any of that in the international markets 
especially ones that are growing and getting bigger?
 
Indra Nooyi
 
I made that comment a couple of years ago when pricing was crazy but I 
would sa
y that it's become rational. I would say in burst it becomes 
irrational and I think if we continue to focus just on volume and mainly on 

growth it does lead to some irrational pricing es
pecially when quarters have 
to end or when people are trying to make some volume number just to 
report something good. I think in this LRB category in particular it's very, 
very important. We thread volume and value very carefully. It's a big 
profitable ca


hope that how the industry gets played out. We see burst of responsible 
behavior then at times we see action that 

this is part of free markets and competition so we will keep playing this.

Your final question comes from the line of Ali Dibadj with Sanford Bernstein.

My question is a little bit b
roader which is really around whether we should 
philosophically think of the global portfolio being one of part generating cash 
and profit in North America beverage in particular, particularly North 
America CSD to then take that and invest in parts of the 
global business that 
are actually growing more robustly. So emerging markets, snack markets in 
particular, is that the model you guys explicitly think about and talk about 
internally like some other CPG companies and retail companies do or is that 
just mor
e organic in the way it's been happening.
 
Indra Nooyi
 

needs, if you go back to road share metrics that Boston Consulting came up 

cash cows to go off and inv

to play the portfolio because a portfolio complete comprised of growth 

to be able to invest in growth engines. Having said that I th
ink that mature 
low growth businesses especially if they are big and have consumer appeal 
and also right to reinvention and I think it's very important that established 
players reinvent their categories as opposed to allowing others to reinvent it 
and push
 
them out and there are examples, many, many examples of big 
companies especially companies based here in the U.S. that did not reinvent 
their categories. So I think we adopt today behave responsibly, generate the 
cash in the North American business, grow 
responsibly and wait for 
international growth but reinvent North America simultaneously, which is 
why we have stepped up all our R&D investments in sweeteners, flavoring 
agents, new processing technologies. Unfortunately, the timing is a bit off, 
because R

timeframe with which you can manage responsibly. So, you got to give it 
little bit more time to yield results. So, you are absolutely right in saying you 
have got to play the overall portfolio car
efully. And what I feel good about 
the PepsiCo portfolio, we have a very good mix of growth businesses, 
businesses that generate cash and good returns to keep funding this growth. 
And I think our portfolio is so well
-
balanced in terms of snacks, beverages,
 
geographic mix, different growth rates, that we are able to manage it 
sensibly and deliver the kind of profits that I think this portfolio is capable of 
generating well into the future.

back over to Indra 
for any closing comments.
 
Indra Nooyi
 
Thank you all. In closing, I just like to say that we are pleased with the way 
we are navigating through an uncertain and volatile environment. We have 
taken all the steps necessary to strengthen and
 
position ourselves for 
sustainable long
-
term growth. I think the first quarter of 2013 is an excellent 
example of how well constructed and developed portfolio coupled with 
disciplined execution and reinvestment can drive high
-
quality top and 
bottom line r
esults. So, I thank you for your time and for the confidence you 
have placed in us with your investment. Have a great day.

Indra K. Nooyi
 
Thank you, Jamie, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining 
us in person here today. My goal is to cover 5 topics this morning. I'm going 
to very briefly cover 2011 results and take a little journey back over the last 
5 years and
 
tell you what we've accomplished. And then we'll give you an 
overview of PepsiCo and outline our strategic priorities very briefly. We're 
then going to spend quite a lot of time reviewing the results for 
comprehensive review of our businesses that we rece
ntly completed. Then 
we'll provide you our financial outlook for 2012 and beyond, and then 
introduce to you a scorecard, which we will use to measure our progress.
 
So with that, let me start with our 2011 performance. We issued our 2011 
results this mornin
g, and I'm not going to spend too much time going into 
details except to tell you that 2011 on balance was a good year. Snacks 
volume grew about 8%. Beverages volume grew about 5%. Net revenue was 
up 14%, and both core division operating profit and core EP
S grew 7%.
 
We had broad
-
based gains in snack and beverage volume and net revenue. 
And we were able to achieve net price realization that partially offset the 
extraordinary commodity inflation we faced. More importantly, in 2011, we 
made disciplined investm
ents in the business to generate long
-
term growth. 
We drove productivity through cost management. And more importantly, we 
were able to offset the impact in some of our markets, our skittish economy, 
natural disasters and political unrest with gains from s
ome selective 
disposals of noncore businesses.
 
And of course, we benefited from the acquisition of Wimm
-
Bill
-
Dann, which 
is a critical addition to our Russia business that further strengthened our 
already strong position in this key developing market. Impo
rtantly, we also 
continue to generate strong cash flow. Management operating cash flow 
exceeded $6 billion. And as a result, we were able to return $5.6 billion in 
cash to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividends.
 
So that's 2011. For 2011 r
eally caps a 5
-
year performance that delivered 
core net revenue compounded growth rate of 13%, core operating profit 
growth of 9% and core EPS growth of 8%. This performance also drove 
terrific cash returns. Dividends per share grew at 12% annually. And ou
r 
cash return to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases totaled 
$30 billion over the past 5 years.
 
This is the financial scorecard. What's not evident from the 5
-
year financial 
performance is the incredible transformation that took place in P
epsiCo 
during the same time. When I came into the CEO job in late 2006, I realized 
that PepsiCo had to make some bold transformative moves to remain 
successful well into the future. Because most the tailwinds of the first part of 
the decade were not going 
to be around in the second half, and in fact some 
of them became headwinds in the second half of the decade, so we got to 
work.
 
Starting in 2007, we began to scale up our emerging and developing market 
business. In fact, our emerging and developing markets
 
revenues went from 
$8 billion in 2006 to $22 billion in 2011, with the mix increasing from 22% of 
revenues to 34% of the revenues over that same time frame.
 
Over that period, we also addressed a number of business issues that faced 
us. First, we had to re
configure our North American bottling operation in 
order to address the serious structural issues of not having an integrated 
bottling operation in this increasingly diversifying but slow growth liquid 
refreshment beverage market. We had to restate the Gat
orade brand and 
return it to growth, following significant volume declines in 2007 to 2009. 
Then we had to restructure and refranchise our Mexican beverage operation 
to create a single entity with capable partners so that we can restore that 
business to gr
owth.
 
And then to kickstart the China business to a level 
--
 
beverage business to a 
level that was higher than the past, we refranchised our business to Tingyi, 
which is now in the midst of government approval. And with this 
partnership, I think we really 
take our whole China beverage growth to a 
whole new level.
 
I think all of this creates tremendous vehicles for sustainable profit growth 
across many of our markets. But beyond that, we also increased our 
investment in R&D by 50%, boosting our core capabili
ties and making 
substantial talent additions and partnership investments in areas such as 
advanced retail technology; packaging, where we came out with the first 
100% plants derived bottle; and equipment innovation, where we're going to 
be alpha testing a 
very exciting food service beverage dispenser in 2012.
 
In 2007 to '11 period, we also significantly expanded the health and wellness 
offerings of our portfolio. And I know some of you have expressed some 
concern, whether the pendulum swung too far in the d
irection and whether 
we took our eye off the core offerings. What I'd like to tell you is that, the 
direct answer is this is an and game not an or game. We have to focus on 
both growing the core, which is the Fun
-
for
-
You products and the Better
-
for
-
you pro
ducts and step up our investment in Good
-
for
-
You products. And I 
assure you that, that's what we've done and we'll continue doing. So let me 
provide some context on what we've done in the whole health and wellness 
space.
 
First, we increased the permissibil
ity of our core salty
-
snack and beverage 
products by reducing sodium, frying them in heart
-
healthy oils, using natural 
ingredients and reducing sugar and reducing calories. The second thing we 
did was dialing up the sales of our baked products and snacks a
nd 0
-
calorie 
beverages, which is really capitalizing on a sustainable consumer trend. And 
the third thing we did was focus significant attention resources on our Good
-
for
-
You businesses to make sure that we're fully capitalizing on their global 
growth pote
ntial.
 
In North America, for example, we've been very successful in restoring 
momentum to Gatorade. We've made good progress with Tropicana. And the 
next one we have to address is Quaker Oats, especially North America. 
Internationally, we've had strong dou
ble
-
digit growth over the past 5 years 
for both Tropicana and Quaker, and we've expanded this well through juice 
and dairy acquisitions.
 
Importantly, we've targeted resources working on nutrition platforms 
globally, the benefits of which we will start seei
ng over the next few years. 
As a result of these efforts, we've enhanced our core offerings and our 
Good
-
for
-
You portfolio. And the Good
-
for
-
You part has now increased its 
share in our portfolio from 17% to 20% of our revenue over the past 5 
years. So that
's our narrative on our product shift.
 
But the other thing we did over the last 5 years was continue our investment 
in SAP. And we did that without taking any chance to the P&L. We just kept 
investing because we believe that we had to really fix the techno
logy base of 
the company, so that we can have more opportunities for productivity 
improvement.
 
And beyond financial investments, we made a major commitment to start 
shifting the culture of the company. The first thing we did was put in place 
an organizatio
n structure that leverages the scale of PepsiCo in a much more 
substantial way. And I believe the change was absolutely necessary. 
Because with this shift, we've gone from decentralized silos, decentralized 
regional silos, to what I would call now as much 
more of a connected 
autonomy structure.
 
And if you look at the chart, the primacy of the P&L still stays with the 
regions, the geographies. And that's the fundamental principle of PepsiCo. 

much 
more effectively leveraged ideas, capabilities and scale across the globe.
 
But this organization shift was just one piece of the culture change. We 
began to address other aspects of our culture we just absolutely had to 
change. We're evolving from bei
ng developed market dominant to having a 
truly global mindset in the company. We're also moving from a trade 
spending push model of selling to a more balanced push/pull model of both 
marketing and selling.
 
The other change is that emerging markets in the f
irst part of the decade 
used to largely be a pay
-
as
-
you
-
go approach. But it doesn't work for 
emerging and developing markets, which take a lot of time to build. So over 
the past 5 years, we made deliberate choices to step up our investments in 
key emerging
 
markets because, I think, it's absolutely necessary to fully 
capitalize on the growth opportunities and keep PepsiCo growing well into 
the future.
 
And lastly, over the last 5 years, we started to change our talent 
development process from a traditional mo
del, which has been very effective 
for us, to a more strategic approach to build, buy and bond talent to the 
company. We have tremendous talent within PepsiCo, and we're absolutely 
committed to developing the talent. But it's also important to note, that a
s 
we implement some of the changes in the company into our portfolio, we 
need experienced people with different skills to help us navigate through this 
new volatile environment so that we can remain a growth company.
 
And I want to mention to you that the p
ortfolio changes, the transformation, 
the culture changes, all of these changes were affected in a difficult macro 
environment. So on balance, I believe we've done many of the right things 
over the past 5 years to improve the business and position for sust
ained 
growth and attractive financial results for years to come.
 
Now let me be clear on one thing. I'm not suggesting we executed 
everything perfectly over the last 5 years. Could we have done something 
differently or better? Sure. So we've gone back and l
ooked at every one of 
our decisions and said, what could we have done differently?
 
Let me give you some of these things that I think we could have done 
differently. First, I think we could have used the synergies from the bottling 
acquisition to invest mor
e in growing the top line rather than committing to 
flow it through to the bottom line. Second, I wish we had stepped up our 
overall brand support, especially in North American beverages earlier. Third, 
had we anticipated the commodity volatility that we s
aw in 2010, 2011 and 
going into 2012, we could have gone after productivity much more 
aggressively sooner to help cushion some of those commodity cost 
increases.
 
I also think some of the people moves that I made perhaps could have been 
made a bit earlier s
o that we could have gotten on with this program faster. 
And lastly, I think we could have done a better job establishing performance 
expectations with you, our investors, at a level that we could absolutely 
deliver on. And I think some of these topics, ad
dressed earlier or more 
effectively, would have resulted in even better operating performance. And 
as a result, better stock price performance, an area that I know has been 
frustrating for many of you in this room in this morning.
 
And to be honest, the 
reason I didn't take some of these resets earlier is 
because a CEO gets a chance to make a reset once every 10 years. And you 
only make a major reset when you have a clean line of sight to bounce back. 
And I didn't feel I had that clean line of sight the l
ast 5 years. We have it 
now, and that's why we're doing it today. And that's why, today, as you see 
in the press release, we are taking clear actions right now to step up brand 
investment, increase productivity, reduce capital spending and improve 
sharehol
der returns.
 
So as we pause to look at PepsiCo today, I think we are extremely well 
positioned. We generate $66 billion in annual revenue. We're the second 
largest food and beverage business globally. We have operating margins of 
16%. We have net ROIC of 1
7%, and we have return on equity of 31%.
 
Our mission for the company is clear and focused. We want to captivate 
consumers with the world's most loved and best
-
tasting convenient foods 
and beverages. And we feel confident in our ability to deliver on this m
ission, 
based on the significant structure and capability advantages that we possess 
as a company.
 
We compete in categories with attractive growth, margins and returns, 
whether it's snacks, beverages or the nutritional category, because all of 
these catego
ries have global growth of 5% or more. Our core businesses of 
convenient foods and beverages are highly complementary. They share not 
only common consumers and customers, but they also share resources and 
capabilities like agro sourcing, R&D capabilities, 
packaging, flavoring, go
-
to
-
market systems, finance, HR talent and all the G&A functions.
 
And I think our businesses will continue to benefit from global mega trends 
like on
-
the
-
go lifestyle, a rapidly growing middle class in emerging and 
developing market
s and consumer seeking a repertoire of products that 
spans Fun
-
for
-
You to Good
-
for
-
You. We have a very broad and powerful 
brand portfolio that connects with consumers, including 22 iconic billion
-
dollar brands, a number that's doubled in the past 11 years.
 
And these 
brands span everything from Fun
-
for
-
You to Good
-
for
-
You, and all of our 
brands are typically #1 or #2 in their respective categories.
 
I don't know if you know this little factoid, but Lay's is the #1 global food 
brand. Lay's is the #1 global foo
d brand. And Pepsi, as you well know, is the 
#2 global beverage brand. We also have a truly global footprint with trends 
in more than 150 countries. And as I mentioned earlier, we have a $22 
billion emerging market business. And we have tremendous go
-
to
-
ma
rket 
reach, which is largely enabled by our DSD systems, which have been 
developed over many, many decades. And they're all tailored to suit local 
market dynamics, so that we can efficiently and effectively reach millions of 
points of sale everyday and bil
lions of end consumers.
 
And we leverage all of these strengths to deliver against our 5 strategic 
priorities, which we've been focused on for the past several years. To build 
and extend macrosnacks globally. As most of you know, we have a 10x 
relative mark
et share in salty snacks globally and we are growing the core or 
extending towards adjacencies. We just keep growing this macrosnack 
business.
 
Secondly, we are the #2 player in beverages globally. And our goal is to 
sustainably and profitably grow this bev
erage business worldwide. Third, we 
have 3 of the top brands in health and wellness. And we're going to leverage 
these brands in the health and wellness category momentum to grow this 
Nutrition business. The fourth strategic priority is to leverage the coi
ncidence 
of consumption between snacks and beverages and capitalize on this cross 
category presence to grow our scale in individual countries. And lastly, we 
will manage the financial results and position of this company in a prudent 
and responsible way.
 
T
hese strategic priorities have not changed over the several years, and we 
will remain focused on them going forward. Taken together, we believe our 
mission, the strength of our portfolio and strategic priorities will enable us to 
generate top
-
tier financia
l results for our investors over the long term. 
Revenue growth in the mid
-
single digits. We expect balanced growth 
between Fun
-
for
-
You, Better
-
for
-
You, Good
-
for
-
You. And this growth will be 
predominantly organic. And we expect to continue to benefit from a
n 
increasing emerging and developing market presence. And this portfolio 
translates to high
-
single digit earnings per share growth, with increasing 
margins and return on capital and leads to free cash flow growing in line 
with net income. Which in turn, en
ables strong cash returns to shareholders 
through a combination of dividends and share repurchases.
 
So the key question that U.S. investors have asked us is, can this portfolio 
generate these kinds of returns on an ongoing basis? And that's what 
prompted u
s to undertake a comprehensive review of our business. We 
looked at every aspect of our portfolio and operating practices. And what I'd 
like to do is to share with you the scope, findings and the go
-
forward 
actions, now that the review is complete.
 
So the 
first area we examined was our portfolio. We began with a question 
that's been speculated upon a lot in the recent months. Should PepsiCo split 
its snack and beverage businesses? And the overriding finding from our 
portfolio analysis is that PepsiCo's valu
e is maximized as one company. 
Because the current structure, there's 3 things.
 
First, it provides compelling cross leverage across the value chain from an 
R&D, procurement, consumer insight, sales, merchandising, back
-
office 
functions. It provides compell
ing scale and cost leverage.
 
Second, it enables us to accelerate in
-
market growth. Because in market, we 
benefit from the coincidence of snack and beverage consumption occasions. 
We benefit from the commonality of consumer and the opportunity to cross
-
merc
handise and promote our products. But in emerging markets, in 
particular, our Snacks business benefits massively from the scale of our 
Beverage business, which can be scaled up very quickly. And without the 
presence of our Beverage businesses, our ability 
to establish and grow 
Snacks businesses in emerging markets would be significantly reduced. It 
will take much more time and require a significant amount more of 
investment. That's the second reason.
 
The third reason is that, our operation as one company, e
nables us to share 
capabilities across geographies and sectors and allows us to attract better 
talent. This is important everywhere in the world, but particularly in 
emerging and developing markets where the combined scale of our 2 
businesses helps us be t
he preferred company to work for.
 
I can tell you that in emerging markets, and I travel there all the time, Pepsi 
is such an iconic brand that young people want to come to work for Pepsi. 
You bring them into Pepsi and a little while later, you put them int
o Lay's 
and Coqueiro and those products. So that's the virtuous circle how it works.
 
We estimate that simply on the cost side of the equation, the benefits of 
having an integrated company are somewhere between $800 million to $1 
billion, primarily related 
to in
-
country G&A, procurement, share distribution 
and infrastructure, corporate G&A and financing costs. And this does not 
take into account the profitability associated with top line synergies. And it 
does not factor in the massive disruption that would 
surely occur if we try to 
separate these 2 businesses.
 
So net
-
net, based on this exhaustive analysis we undertook as a 
management team with external advisors, with the involvement of our Board 
of Directors, we are absolutely convinced that PepsiCo's value 
is maximized 
as one company. Well, we didn't stop there. We expanded our portfolio 
review to dig deeper into our portfolio of countries and businesses. And we 
asked ourselves the question, what is the performance trajectory of the 
individual businesses in 
countries and how can we sustain or improve well
-
performing businesses? And what can we do to fix the few underperforming 
business we have? And we looked at what additional options exist to 
strengthen the portfolio and the optimal portfolio configuration t
o maximize 
shareholder value.
 
And to answer all of these questions, we mapped our businesses across 2 
dimensions: margin and growth performance. With performance relative to 
each businesses respective market and whether the business was related to 
our miss
ion. And what we found is that, for the most part, our businesses 
are highly related to our mission and are generally performing well. So this 
chart shows how our division operating profit falls across these dimensions.
 
75% of our profit comes from busines
ses highly related to our mission, and 
performing very well. Noncore businesses comprise a relatively small 
percentage of the overall portfolio, about 5%. And these are well
-
performing 
businesses. The gray box down there represents less than 1% of our prof
it. 
And we have largely addressed these opportunities, and I'll tell you what 
they are. And that leaves 20% that are related to the mission, but with 
some opportunity to improve their growth and/or margins.
 
And we are absolutely clear on what needs to be d
one in each of these 
quadrants. High
-
performing rate of business will be sustained, invested in 
and supported. Higher performing but unrelated business will be managed 
judiciously and they'll be divested, only if it makes financial sense. Because 
most of t
hem contribute positively to our returns and cash flow. Lower
-
performing unrelated businesses should be divested, and will be divested. 
And low
-
performing related businesses will be operationally improved to 
drive better growth and return with clear timeta
bles for improvement. And if 
the underperformance cannot be addressed operationally, then we will seek 
structural solutions to improve return or reduce our exposure. And this 
quadrant is clearly a major area of focus for us.
 
So let me give you examples of 
how our businesses mapped across these 
quadrants. Clearly, on the upper left, you see Frito
-
Lay North America, our 
Quaker, Tropicana, Gatorade businesses, many of our international beverage 
and snack businesses. On the upper right, you'll find some of our 
central 
store food businesses, which are pretty small compared to the size of our 
portfolio. And while they don't really relate to our Convenience mandate, 
they are prolific cash generators with very high returns, and will be dilutive 
to our returns and ea
rnings under any divestiture scenario that we want.
 
In our lower right box, there are a couple of very small businesses, 
Kretschmer Wheat Germ, Coqueiro, our fish business in Brazil, and they've 
all been divested now. Finally, in the lower left, we find a 
couple of our 
emerging market beverage businesses, our North American DSD Beverage 
business and some emerging markets snacks businesses. And we're making 
great progress in addressing each of these businesses.
 
One of the businesses that was in this box was 
Mexico beverages. By 
refranchising it and creating a very strong entity with 2 highly capable 
beverage partners, I believe we've addressed the Mexico beverage 
underperformance issue. In China, the growth of the market is explosive. 
Our growth was explosive
, but we needed a partner to really kickstart this 
growth.
 
We now have a transaction with Tingyi pending. Tingyi will be our 
franchisee, it's pending regulatory approval, and will create an anchor bottle 
in China that will really help PepsiCo take its Beve
rage business to a whole 
new level. We have a few snack businesses in emerging markets, where I 
believe the natural growth of these businesses will improve the results and 
the operating margins of those businesses. That leaves the North American 
DSD busine
ss, DSD Beverage business, which accounts for a lion's share of 
the profits in this quadrant.
 
So I want to set the context for North American DSD beverages. It's a large 
highly profitable category, North American beverages. It's important to 
retailers beca
use of its ability to generate shopper traffic, and because it's 
profitable and an excellent cash
-
generator even to retailers. As PepsiCo, we 
have a very good competitive position with the #1 share of the liquid 
refreshment beverage category in retail. And
 
most importantly, we own 3 of 
the top 5 LRB trademarks with Pepsi, Mountain Dew and Gatorade. And with 
Mountain Dew, we have the fastest growing major CSD trademark in the 
industry.
 
However, there are some issues. Category growth has been challenging. The
 
marketplace is intensely competitive. Commodity inflation and volatility have 
made this market that much more difficult. And let's not forget, we do face a 
competitor who's emerged from a major reset that they undertook between 
2004 and 2008. And I will t
ell you, between 2007 and 2010, we did lose 
some market share. Recently, our share trends have begun to improve, but 
we are not happy with the pace of improvement and recognized the need to 
accelerate progress. One of the reasons we brought the bottlers ba
ck is 
because we wanted to address the share issue in this business.
 
So against this backdrop, we are totally committed to actions to improve 
both the growth and returns of our North American Beverage business. So 
what are we going to do? We are going to s
ignificantly step up our A&M 
support to reengage consumers with our terrific brand, focusing on our most 
important brands to drive the maximum impact from our investment. And 
you know what's interesting? Over the last 5 years, North American A&M did 
not de
cline, but the spending was supporting too many brands and was 
spread across too many agencies. We allowed nonworking A&M to squeeze 
out working A&M. So we went to work and we cleaned house. We've reduced 
agency relationships in North American beverage fro
m 150 to about 50. So 
it's not just a step up in A&M. The impact of shifting nonworking A&M to 
A&M will be significant and this whole A&M spending will be amplified.
 
We're also accelerating our innovation across product and package with a 
very special focu
s on revenue management. For example, Pepsi NEXT is a 
great example of leading the market in product innovation. And thanks to 
the investments we made in long
-
term sweetener technology. We are 
launching a product that delivers the great taste of Pepsi with
 
60% less 
sugar. We're also going to step up our package innovation. And great 
examples that will drive our revenue management agenda are the 24
-
ounce 
Dew can, which will drive further growth of this $1 billion brand into new 
location. And the Starbucks Re
freshers launch in the 12
-
ounce slim can. 
Grab a can of that Mountain Dew as you leave and the Refreshers are out 
there in the lobby.
 
We're also going to capitalize on the food service opportunity, especially 
local and regional food service. As many of 
you know, this was an area 
where we had a structural disadvantage, relative to our largest competitor, 
prior to our acquisition of the bottlers. We've made the appropriate changes, 
and we're making good progress in food service.
 
We're also dialing up our e
xcellence in execution by shifting distribution 
systems that will improve performance. A good example of that was moving 
Gatorade to DSD in small format. But we're not stopping there. We're 
looking for other opportunities to leverage the right distribution
 
system for 
the right product. We're also going to use our snack business to drive 
greater frequency of coincidence of consumption. And linked to our overall 
productivity efforts, we are stepping up productivity to improve margins and 
create additional fun
ding for future investment.
 
We intend to take out about $500 million to $600 million in costs to the 
North American Beverage business by 2014. We're also accelerating R&D in 
key breakthrough areas like low
-
cost natural sweeteners, more packaging 
innovation
 
and food service equipment innovation. So a lot is happening in 
North American beverages, all focused on one thing: to hold or increase 
value share in this market.
 
And while we work through these operational improvements, we are 
simultaneously exploring s
tructural options to jump shift PepsiCo's returns 
on capital that's deployed into this business. So that's a summary of the 
overall portfolio look that we undertook.
 
While our operational review of the last 6 months went beyond a high level 
portfolio analy
sis, and really took a deep dive on the supporting 
fundamentals that drive our business. We know that success for PepsiCo is 
dependent on world
-
class brand building and innovation. It's dependent on 
excellence in execution every day and every moment of tru
th, achieving the 
right cost structure and the optimal capital structure and most importantly, 
being a great place to work.
 
We went through and looked at how we stack up against each of these 
requirements. And let me walk you through the conclusions of our
 
review on 
each of these items, what we found and what we'll be doing as a result. On 
brand management. In PepsiCo, our marketing approach has historically 
been highly decentralized with each country introducing brands as needed. 
To prove the point, it may
 
surprise you that we have more than 400 brands 
in our portfolio, and this brand proliferation over the years has diluted the 
incrementality of our initiatives.
 
And there's no point stepping up the A&M investment if it's going to be 
fragmented across 400 b
rands. So we knew there was a consolidation 
opportunity here. So as a result of our deep dive, we'll be refocusing and 
streamlining our brand portfolio, sharpening their positioning with 
consumers, herding a lot of the new innovations of the big brands and
 
slowly 
start shifting volumes from the tail of the portfolio to the core brand 
portfolio.
 
We're going to invest and drive growth behind 12 mega brands: Pepsi, Dew, 
Sierra Mist, 7Up in international markets, Gatorade, Tropicana, Mirinda, 
Lay's, Doritos, Ch
eetos, Lipton, Quaker and the Sun brand. These 12 brands 
will have aligned positioning globally. They'll have consistent campaigns and 
scaled innovation platforms.
 
For example, we'll be launching the first global Pepsi campaign in the 
summer of this year w
ith common iconography, a common approach and 
common positioning. The first global Pepsi campaign in PepsiCo's history. 
We're also stepping up our investment, our A&M investment, behind these 
12 brands by $500 million to $600 million in 2012, which represe
nts about a 
15% increase. And because North America is such a large market, it will 
receive a disproportionate share of this increased funding.
 
And while we are increasing the A&M, we're also streamlining our agency 
relationships. Today, we have about 300 
relationships with strategic vendors 
across the globe. And we're looking to reduce that number by more than 
half, driving greater efficiency of spend. But spend is one thing. We're also 
instituting joined performance metrics with our partners. And we're 
im
plementing a pay
-
for
-
performance model, which makes sure that we get 
the best talents and agencies devoted to PepsiCo's businesses.
 
So what all of this will do is allow us to shift more of our overall A&M from 
nonworking A&M to working A&M, which means red
uce what we spend on 
production costs and agency fees to actually consumer facing A&M. And this 
target of shift of spending to more working A&M will add considerably to the 
brand presence consumers will feel, than just the $500 million to $600 
million in i
ncremental spending.
 
And beyond just the spending increase and the shifting of A&M, we've 
developed one common way to measure brand equity across the world. And 
our goal is to track the brand equity evolution of each of these global brands 
regularly and in
tervene, when appropriate, to make sure we hold or increase 
the brand equity with our overall consumers in every one of the key 
countries in the world. And that was all the brand work we did.
 
The next area that we reviewed was innovation. And innovation is
 
our 
lifeblood, we need that to keep growing. But as we dug deep into innovation, 
no surprise to you, the consumer environment has changed radically. Retail 
shelf space is scarce. Consumers have become more demanding. 
Competition has intensified, especiall
y with the emergence of pure
-
play 
competitors fragmenting the market a lot.
 
PepsiCo is a prolific innovator. And there's a lot about our innovation that we 
should feel great about and you should admire. IRI consistently ranks us as 
a leader in innovation i
n their center [ph] report. And in 2011 alone, we 
have 11 of the 15 top
-
selling items in C
-
stores, and a lot of them were new 
products that came into the market in 2010 and '11.
 
But the problem is that, yes, we are a prolific innovator, but the staying 
pow
er of this innovation can be much better. Some of it relates to the 
quality of the innovation. Sometimes it also relates to our lack of patience 
and a bit of Darwinian mindset that's engendered by the DSD go
-
to
-
market 
system. So as we sat back and looked a
t all of our innovation, we realized 
that something had to change in what we were doing in PepsiCo. We don't 
believe we are delivering enough incremental innovation. And we can do 
better. So we are rebalancing our approach.
 
We have now set very specific go
als for 3 innovation types: refresh 
innovation, which is mostly line extensions; reframe innovations; and 
breakthrough innovations. And our goal is to drive a higher mix of reframe 
and breakthrough, which have the potential of being a lot more incremental.
 
So examples of reframe innovation would be Trop50. Which has brought 
back users into the juice category who left the category because of the high 
calories of juice. And Tostitos Scoops. We've solved the issue of getting dip 
on your tie or dress when you e
at a regular Tostitos. An example of 
breakthrough innovation would be products based on the work we're doing 
with natural 0
-
calorie sweeteners. Our belief is that, when that 
commercializes, which I hope is pretty soon, it will really start reframing the 
ca
rbonated soft drink category.
 
And to enable all of this, we've improved the stage gate process to allow for 
greater incubation of new products. And we're doing one more thing, we are 
leveraging a Frito
-
Lay North America best practice. They have something 
c
alled a new growth ventures model. They incubate products in a second 
distribution system and it reaches a certain size, bringing it in to DSD if 
necessary. We're going to lift and shift that idea to North American 
beverages, because I believe we have a lo
t of great innovation which are 
smaller volume and tend to die in the DSD system if you put it in there right 
away. So we're going to incubate it into a second distribution system in 
PepsiCo and then bring it into DSD.
 
More importantly, the fact that we've
 
now created a horizontal structures 
with the global groups is enabling the creation and development of more 
innovation platforms, as opposed to products. And we're also able now to lift 
and shift ideas across the globe, so we don't keep repeating what we'
re 
doing country after country.
 
And the other amazing thing is in somewhat of a role reversal. We're 
explicitly taking innovation from our developing market, especially their 
great work on value innovation and bringing it back to the developed 
markets. Sti
la Bars and Quaker cookies from Mexico is one example of a 
developing market innovation that's being launched very successfully in 
North America.
 
The last thing we've done on innovation is we restructured our relationships 
with our consumer insights provid
ers. And what we've told them is we're 
going to pay for insight, not data. So we've given them specific questions, 
and we want them to answer those questions, as opposed to just buying 
data and allowing us to troll for it.
 
So our priorities here are to dri
ve higher top line, get better price realization 
but most importantly, increase our value share. And that's the result of our 
brand and innovation look.
 
Let me turn to the third area we looked at in great detail, which is our 
execution. Some of you asked i
n the reports you wrote or in meetings we've 
had with you, whether we've lost our execution edge especially here in North 
America. I would say no, but we went back and looked at it in great detail 
anyway. Generally speaking, this is an area where we are ve
ry good at. And 
in many cases, I'll argue we have best
-
in
-
class execution.
 
Frito
-
Lay North America in particular is awesome at execution. But we have 
to push the boundaries and not just be complacent that we're very good. 
And we also have to learn to share
 
best practices across the company. So in 
the case of our North American bottling, this is going to be a renewed area 
of focus having just spent the last 2 years with an appropriate focus on 
getting the integration complete and delivering against the syner
gy targets.
 
And we know there's a lot of best practice sharing that can go on between 
North American bottling and Frito
-
Lay, both ways. So our execution focus 
going forward has several elements. In terms of driving inventory share in 
the store, our Beverag
e business as one company is beginning to align 
marketing and sales to one set of programs on promotional inventory.
 
In terms of ensuring perfect orders and on
-
time delivery, our Beverage 
business will be creating a centralized dispatch headquarters in ord
er to use 
sophisticated dynamic routing algorithms currently being used by Frito
-
Lay 
to improve service levels and reduce costs. And in terms of new product 
execution, our Beverage business will start to deploy Frito
-
Lay's industry
-
leading tools to ensure 
disciplined store
-
level execution and tracking of all 
new products.
 
And these programs respond directly to the measures most important to our 
customers, and they have the highest correlation to increasing sales. We're 
also going to leverage data we've coll
ected for our top accounts across both 
snacks and beverages to drive continuous improvement, and perhaps 
stimulate some healthy internal competition to ensure that we're best in 
class in this critical area.
 
And the last thing we're going to be doing on exe
cution is driving and 
tracking coincidence of purchase between snacks and beverages. We have 
told you many times that our snacks and beverages are highly 
complementary and are consumed and purchased together. For example, 
30% of CSD shopper occasions inclu
de salty
-
snack purchase and 30% of 
salty
-
snack purchases include a CSD. So the opportunity for PepsiCo is 
tremendous as we drive incremental core purchases. And every point of 
additional share is worth $120 million in retail sales. So we intend to exploit 
this coincidence a lot more.
 
Finally, now that we have food service in our control, we are increasing our 
push on gaining both local and regional food service accounts. And in 2011, 
we had real progress. We gained 2 points of market share in food 
service. I 
mean, that's a lot on this business. We converted key accounts from our 
primary competitor Papa John's, Chuck E. Cheese, Tim Horton, to name a 
few. And most importantly, we achieved a 98% contract renewal rate for our 
existing customers.
 
We laun
ched new product innovations in food service. For example, oatmeal 
in McDonald's and Burger King and culinary innovation at Taco Bell via Fritos 
Burritos. I hope you've had a chance to enjoy the product. And we acquired 
35,000 new food service accounts, as
 
a result of expanding the use of broad 
line distributors to secure new local and regional beverage accounts and all 
of our field acquisition efforts.
 
So let me assure you, if you had any doubt, execution excellence is what we 
are about, what we're really 
good at and we will ensure that we drive 
ourselves and each other to be best in class uniformly. And that's execution.
 
Now let me turn to the whole area of cost and productivity, which is another 
area that we spent a lot of time on as part of this operatin
g review. 
PepsiCo's always been known to be a highly productive and cost
-
efficient 
company, and we aggressively manage our cost year in and year out. We 
know that we're in a new environment with tremendous macroeconomic 
volatility, including commodity cost
 
volatility. So we knew that we had to get 
even more productive to create the breathing room to deliver our numbers. 
So let's just take a quick look at our cost structure.
 
About 29% of the cost structure's raw commodities, a little over 5% is A&M 
and 50% i
s manufacturing and SG&A excluding A&M, which results in this 
operating profit of 16% of revenues. Our goal is to increase that operating 
profit number. So let me just walk you through each of the pieces.
 
From a commodity cost standpoint, the way we manage
 
risk is through 
systematic forward buying so that we can get more cost certainty and 
increase cost visibility. But we're going to keep reviewing our commodity 
procurement approach to make sure that we have the optimal balance 
between risk management and v
isibility.
 
On A&M, we're going to grow it from 5.2% of sales to 6% of revenues by 
2015. And in 2012, with the increase in A&M, it'll actually go up to 5.7% of 
sales. So the focus then is on this 50%, the big bucket. Our goal over the 
next 3 to 4 years is t
o take out 250 to 300 basis points of cost from this 
bucket.
 
And today we announced a 3
-
year plan to double our ongoing productivity, 
which will generate over $1 billion in cost savings in 2012 and $3 billion by 
2014. And $1.5 billion of the $3 billion is 
incremental productivity versus our 
historical run rate. These productivity initiatives are multifunction, cross 
sector, and they're going to be delivering benefits throughout the entire 
value chain.
 
Our plan will become the new norm for PepsiCo by creatin
g an ongoing 
global productivity culture. And this productivity program just didn't happen. 
It's been months of efforts across people, across the world, across all of our 
businesses involving all of the functions, all of the businesses, all of the 
sectors.
 
We are taking actions to significantly reduce our G&A by 
implementing simplified organization structures. We're going to wider spans 
of control, fewer layers of management with consolidating facilities. We are 
accelerating the development and deployment o
f global projects impacting 
our products, packaging, manufacturing, transportation, how we grew our 
various factories and much more.
 
We set up a global operations group. And that's been a critical unlock, 
because they've been able to coordinate all of thes
e new ideas and facilitate 
the lift and shift of current best practices across all of our businesses. And 
we have a program management office to track each of these initiatives, 
monitor progress, manage priorities, review achievements, identify key risks 
a
nd develop mitigation plan for the global leadership team.
 
A critical aspect of this program is a focus on increasing operational 
productivity into 3 key areas of make, move and sell. And what we plan to 
do here is to drive world
-
class efficiencies through
 
the deployment and 
execution of what we call global playbooks. Because these global playbooks 
are targeted to positively impact areas such as yield, change over times, 
labor and asset utilization across geographies and key lines of businesses.
 
Now as I me
ntioned to you the financial results of all of this work is that, 
we're going to take our 250 to 300 basis points of operating cost over the 
next 3 years. Now these productivity efforts will impact about 8,700 
associates worldwide. Let me tell you the most
 
difficult part of this whole 
productivity program has been the fact that we have to take out people. It's 
never easy when we have to take out people from the organization. The 
8,700 people represent about 3% of our workforce. And we have to make 
these tou
gh choices if we are to create the breathing room to keep 
reinvesting in the company.
 
And the other thing we did, just to give you comfort, is that we were very 
careful to make sure that we were not impacting the core operations of the 
business in taking o
ut these people. We looked very carefully to make sure 
that we had all of the right functions, staffed with the right people and have 
the right resources so that we can keep the growth of the company going in 
the future.
 
Well, we didn't stop just with prod
uctivity and the P&L. We also looked at 
capital productivity. Over the last 5 years, CapEx has been about 5.5% of 
revenue. For 2012, we've reduced CapEx to 4.5% of net revenues. Now 
some of you might say, ""Oh, you must have just cut it."" Now we reduced it.
 
We took a very granular approach to understand where the capacity was in 
the organization, where the underutilization was, how can we get lower 
capital into emerging markets so that we can match capital cost with the 
economies, of the economics of that ma
rketplace. So we took a very 
granular look at our capital, and that's what allowed us to cut the CapEx into 
2012. And our goal beyond 2012 is to run our business with the CapEx level 
of about 5% of net sales.
 
But it's not just capital expenditures, we're a
lso looking at working capital. 
We believe we do a pretty good job with our cash conversion cycle. But 
again, as we looked at our cash conversion cycle in a lot more granularity, 
we think there's improvement in our days in inventory, DSO and DPO days. 
And 
we think there's an opportunity to reduce this whole cash conversion 
cycle by 10%, which will actually generate about $200 million of cash 
annually, incremental cash.
 
And to institutionalize capital productivity in the company, we will implement 
an EVA app
roach at the operating unit level, an economic value
-
added 
approach at the operating unit level, so each of our businesses can see the 
direct cost of the capital they deploy, whether it's normal capital 
expenditures or tuck
-
in acquisitions they propose. Th
is is going to be part of 
our ongoing performance management system, and all of these efforts are 
designed to increase management operating cash flow and improve ROIC.
 
Finally, let me turn to last and most important part of our operating review, 
which is o
ur organization and people. We looked at every aspect of the 
company in terms of morale, succession, organizational structure. We looked 
at everything. And let me start by telling you that PepsiCo is, and will always 
remain, an academy company. We are a hi
ghly desirable place to work. And 
in fact, according to the Chief Executive Magazine, we just moved up on the 
list of leadership companies from #17 to 7. And we've been named the 
Fortune's Top 10 Companies for Leaders.
 
But as a company we don't just rest o
n those laurels. We actually assess the 
morale of the company every year because we conduct an annual 
organization health survey, which we then augment with a midyear pulse 
survey, just to get a sense for how people are feeling. And then we compare 
it on a
 
cross
-
sectional basis across the company over years. We look at it by 
function, across genders, ethnicities, and we benchmark ourselves against 
the peer group of companies who conduct similar org health surveys.
 
I'm pleased to report to you that our org h
ealth survey results show that by 
and large, we are doing better than the peer group, and the basic morale of 
the organization is pretty good. So from an organization perspective, we feel 
good about where we are.
 
From a succession perspective, for the top 
200 roles in the company, we 
have a 5 deep bench. We identify people who can fill the job if somebody is 
hit by a bus, ready in 1 to 2 years or ready in 3
-
plus years. And coming out 
of this exercise, we have identified 500 high
-
potential executives who we 
are 
going to 
--
 
we've developed 10
-
year development plan for them and we're 
going to accelerate their progress with the company.
 
Let me briefly touch on CEO succession. CEO succession at PepsiCo started 
day 1, when I became CEO. We've updated our Board of 
Directors every 
year and we provide midyear updates, as necessary, on this topic of CEO 
succession. This is very much on top of my priority list, has been since 2006. 
And I believe we have outstanding leaders running each of our major 
businesses who are al
l CEO capable. So from an organization perspective, 
from a people perspective, succession perspective, we feel very good about 
where we are.
 
So that was the summary of our detailed operational review and a look at all 
the drivers of our performance. Once a
gain, based on this very detailed look, 
we are comfortable with our long
-
term targets, grow revenues in mid
-
single 
digits, deliver high
-
single digit EPS growth, grow free cash flow in line with 
net income and deliver attractive cash returns to our sharehol
ders.
 
This performance will be balanced across our geographies and our 
categories. And as you can see, we plan to do a lot of things differently in 
2012 and going forward. We're going to increase A&M spend by $500 million 
to $600 million, and total marketp
lace spend by $600 million to $700 
million. We're going to focus our brands, reduce the numbers of agencies 
and strategic partnerships we have. We're going to focus on improving brand 
equity for our key brands, and you're going to start seeing stepped
-
up 
i
nnovation levels in the marketplace.
 
We will deliver incremental productivity of over $500 million this year and a 
total of $1.5 billion of incremental productivity over the next 3 years. We will 
reduce CapEx to 4.5% of net revenue, which is about $300 mil
lion lower 
than it was in 2011 while still growing the top line.
 
We'll generate more than $6 billion of management operating cash flow and 
return $3.3 billion in dividends, which is about $100 million increase over 
2011, and we'll repurchase at least $3 bi
llion in shares, which is an increase 
of about $600 million over 2011. And we'll do all this while navigating 
through incremental commodity costs 
--
 
or additional commodity costs of 
$1.5 billion.
 
Finally, in terms of operating and reporting transparency, h
istorically, we 
provided you data on Pepsi Americas Foods, Pepsi Americas Beverages 
Europe and EMEA. Going forward, we will provide additional data on global 
snacks and global beverages. And within that, we will provide you top line 
numbers volume revenue 
on our global nutrition business also.
 
So that's the comprehensive summary of our operating review, the findings, 
and what we're going to do differently going forward. With that, let me turn 
it over to Hugh Johnston to talk in detail about 2012 and go thro
ugh all of 
the financial information. Thank you.
 
Hugh F. Johnston
 
Great. Thank you, Indra, and good morning, everyone. As discussed earlier, 
2012 is a year of transition with EPS down 5% on a core constant
-
currency 
basis. As we compare 2012 to our high 
single
-
digit long
-
term growth 
targets, there are several key drivers for this gap. I'll cover them briefly 
here, and then we'll look at each individually.
 
First, we face another year of higher
-
than
-
normal commodity inflation driven 
by the lag effect of our
 
forward
-
buying program. This negatively impacts our 
EPS growth by 9 points. Second, the extraordinary investments we are 
making in the marketplace, both A&M and to a lesser degree in racks and 
routes, drives another 8 points of EPS gap. To help offset thi
s marketplace 
investment, we are, as Indra mentioned, embarking on a multi
-
year 
productivity effort, which is expected to deliver over $500 million in 
incremental productivity savings in 2012 for cumulative incremental 
productivity of $1.5 billion through 
2014. This initiative is expected in 2012 
to contribute 7 points of EPS growth.
 
Below
-
the
-
line pension cost will increase as a result of the lower discount 
rate we used to calculate pension expense. And finally, our net interest cost 
also rises. We increas
ed our borrowings and term out debt in a low interest 
rate environment, and our tax rate will be slightly higher at 27%. The net 
impact of the latter 2 items is a reduction of 3 points. Note at this point, 
based on market consensus forecast, we anticipate 
FX to be a 3
-
point 
headwind in 2012.
 
Now I'd like to take a moment to go a little bit deeper on some of these. 
Overall, we are anticipating 7% commodity inflation for this year. Our 
commodity spend consists of 3 components: raw commodities, which we 
purcha
sed via a systematic forward
-
buying program; raw commodities for 
which there is no active traded market; and then finally, cost our suppliers 
incur to convert raw commodities into ingredients and packaging materials.
 
On non
-
traded raw commodities, we will 
have moderate inflation of 4% this 
year. And on conversion costs, we are actually benefiting from 5% deflation 
as a result of value engineering and productivity efforts with our suppliers. 
But we are facing a steep 16% inflation in market trade and commodi
ty 
purchases. Because we secure coverage in advance of the start of the year 
via our systematic forward
-
buying program, 35% of our commodity 
purchases were already locked by July 2011, more than 40% by September 
and almost 2/3 by the end of December 2011.
 
As a result, we are not fully benefiting from the recent declines in raw 
commodity prices yet. While this program proved to be very beneficial to us 
in the past 2 years and over a cumulative period, we are still ahead of the 
market. Our cost for traded com
modities are unfavorable to the market in 
2012 on a percentage basis. It's important to note though that we expect 
our actual prices to be at or below the market prices on many commodities, 
but the rate of inflation will be higher because of the different 
prior
-
year 
basis.
 
The commodity inflation is highest in the first quarter and mitigates as we 
move forward through the year as you would expect with the lagging effect. 
Regarding our productivity program, as indicated earlier, we expect to 
deliver $3 billi
on in savings over the next 3 years, which is double our 
historical productivity run rate. Our productivity program will touch virtually 
every aspect of our business, including manufacturing, distribution and 
SG&A.
 
Specifically, we are heightening our abil
ity to execute best practice sharing 
across our organization, leveraging new technologies and processes across 
our entire cost structure and will increase yield and throughput and reduce 
waste throughout the value chain. In addition, we are consolidating a
 
number of manufacturing warehouse and sales facilities, and we're 
implementing a more simplified organization structure with wider spans of 
control and fewer layers of management, which will enhance our cost 
competitiveness and drive more effective accoun
tability.
 
The restructuring actions will have a onetime cost of about $910 million, of 
which about $750 million is cash. As mentioned earlier, overall below
-
the
-
line costs are a 3
-
point drag on EPS. Our pension costs are increasing by 
almost $100 million t
his year as a result of a decrease in the discount rates. 
This is after a $1 billion discretionary pretax contribution to the pension and 
retiree medical plans, which reduced the expense by $100 million.
 
In addition, our net interest costs are increasing b
y about $200 million as we 
term out debt to benefit from long
-
term low interest rates. Borrowing 
increases generally in line with cash, which sits internationally. All other 
corporate G&A costs are flat as reductions in corporate G&A are being 
redeployed t
o support the global productivity initiative.
 
Turning to capital allocation and cash return. We announced this morning 
that we will increase our dividend by 4% to $2.15 with the June dividend 
payment, and we intend to step up our share repurchase program t
o at least 
$3 billion in 2012. Simultaneously, we will term out debt, taking advantage 
of that low interest rate environment. This will increase our leverage, which 
we are comfortable with because we intend to limit both our number and 
size of tuck
-
in acqu
isitions and to do them only in emerging and developing 
markets.
 
Net, we expect to increase our borrowing, but again, it will only increase in 
line with our growth in cash. This cash is largely offshore and is, therefore, 
tax inefficient to repatriate. Wit
h this, despite a year of earnings decline, we 
expect to return about $6.3 billion to shareholders this year, up from $5.6 
billion in 2011.
 
Turning to the portfolio review. I'm sure many of you focused on the lower
-
left quadrant of the matrix that Indra sh
owed you earlier and have questions 
about how we will scorecard that. For these businesses, we expect them to 
hold their grow of share, begin to achieve profitable growth and improve 
their ROICs within a 12
-
 
to 18
-
month time frame. If they don't, we will s
eek 
structural solutions as an alternative, collaborations, JVs, refranchisings or 
divestitures are all on the table, all with the objective to improve PepsiCo's 
shareholder value creation.
 
Summarizing 2012, we're targeting EPS to decline by approximately 
5% on 
a constant
-
currency basis. Based on current market consensus ForEx, this is 
a 3
-
point headwind resulting in an 8% decline in EPS on a USD basis. As you 
model out the quarters, please keep in mind that commodity inflation is 
steepest in the first quar
ter and consequently, we anticipate first quarter 
earnings to decline high
-
single digits.
 
We expect CapEx to be approximately $3 billion, a 10% reduction from our 
2011 CapEx level. Management operating cash flow is targeted at about $6 
billion, an amount s
imilar to our 2011 management operating cash flow 
despite an earnings decline in 2012. And we have plans in place to return 
over $6 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.
 
Long term, as many of the headwinds we are experiencing in 
2012 moderate 
and as our A&M investments take hold, we anticipate returning to our long
-
term targets of 6% to 7% core constant currency growth in division 
operating profit, core constant currency EPS growth in the high
-
single digits, 
CapEx investment of no
 
more than 5% of net revenue and core 
management operating cash flow growing in line with net income on a rolling 
3
-
year basis.
 
Now let's turn to how we'll measure progress on our performance scorecard. 
We will measure our performance along 8 key metrics, 
4 of which relate to 
what we do to deliver results, and 4 of which reflect the results of what we 
do. Let's talk first about what we do or what I call our input metrics, which 
include brand strength, execution, cost and CapEx efficiency and innovation.
 
For
 
brand strength, we expect brand equity on our top 12 global brands to 
improve year
-
over
-
year, and we expect A&M spend as a percentage of 
revenue to increase or stay flat after 2012. In terms of execution, we will 
track 2 key measures: inventory share and 
coincidence of purchase. These 
each have a strong correlation with sales growth and do so in a cost
-
efficient 
manner.
 
Cost and CapEx efficiency are critical to our ability to deliver profit and 
returns to shareholders. We are confident that our productivit
y programs in 
both P&L and CapEx investments will enable us to deliver on these targets.
 
Last, we'll measure the success of our innovation defined as new product 
sales as a percent of total PepsiCo sales. While we expect the first 3 metrics 
to deliver in l
ine with our long
-
term target in 2012, we are not counting on 
an increase in innovation as a percentage of sales in 2012. For these 
metrics, we expect to share our performance with you on a semiannual 
basis, and we expect to perform against these targets b
eginning in 2012.
 
Obviously, we'll also measure our performance against key output metrics 
that are highly relevant to investors. The metrics are value share, EPS, ROIC 
and operating cash flow. Our guidance and performance targets are 
consistent with these
 
long
-
term targets, and we'll continue to report to them 
--
 
to report them to you as we currently do. Because 2012 is a transition 
year, however, we expect to achieve only the value share targets in 2012. 
We believe that this scorecard is well
-
connected to
 
both operating 
performance and shareholder value creation and will enable you to clearly 
understand our results.
 
With that, now I'll turn the meeting back over to Indra.
 
Indra K. Nooyi
 
Thank you, Hugh. Thanks to all of you for your attention this morning.
 
And 
before we open it up for questions, let me just recap the key points we'd like 
you to takeaway this morning by returning to one of our earlier slides.
 
We're excited about the initiatives we shared with you this morning and look 
forward to sharing with
 
you our progress as the year progresses. And as I 
said as I close my talk this morning, you should expect to see the following: 
a substantial increase in our brand support and focus, improvement in our 
brands' health, delivery of significant incremental c
ost productivity, greater 
efficiency in capital spending, strong cash flow generation and attractive 
cash returns to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.
 
Now as I turn it over to you for Q&A, and if I could just have John, Zein, Al 
and
 
Saad join me here on the podium, and we will take questions from you, 
and then we'll toss it to our sector heads so that they, too, can share their 
thoughts with you. So with that, it's over to you. Yes? Go ahead.
 
Question
-
and
-
Answer Session
 
Unknown Analy
st
 
Indra, how do you know this is enough? And I say that in the context 
particularly around the spend back so $500 million to $600 million A&M only 
gets you kind of halfway to where you were at the beginning part of this 
decade even if you pull out PB 
U.K. asset [PH] and Wimm
-
Bill
-
Dann. How do 
you know that's enough? And in particular, what does it tell us about the 
ROI of the overall business and the trend of the ROI in the overall business 
as you're spending more and more and more, you're doing more a
nd more, 
but you're getting to the same number from a growth perspective. How 
should we feel about that?
 
Indra K. Nooyi
 
I'll make a couple or 3 comments, and I'm going to toss it to Al to talk about 
how they're reorienting the advertising spending especial
ly 
--
 
you focus 
more on North American beverages, right? Let me start by saying to you 
that over the last 5 years, the A&M has not been cut. That's the interesting 
part of the whole North American beverage discussion. So the dollar amount 
has not been cut.
 
The non
-
working A&M squeezed out the working A&M. 
That's the big issue. What you see is measured media. We look at total A&M 
in the North American beverage business, nothing has changed. The thing to 
be careful about Gatorade, for example, the working med
ia that you see, the 
ads are a very small portion of Gatorade. A lot of Gatorade is more what 
they do with sideline presence and what they do with athletes and what they 
do to market the product to them. So you've got to look at the overall A&M 
bucket. Ove
r the last 5 years, the single biggest trend is that we had non
-
working A&M squeezed out working A&M because inflation and contracts and 
we had too many agency relationships. And the second is that we supported 
too many brands. I mean, in North America, be
cause we are a total 
beverage company with a large portfolio of non
-
carbon, carbonated brand, 
we supported too many brands. So the first thing they're doing is first, 
focusing our effort behind a few brands 
--
 
and Al's got a list of brands he's 
really goin
g to focus on. And by shifting more non
-
working to working A&M, 
what you're going to see is that 15% to 20% increase in visible dollars that 
we're talking about is going to feel like hell of a lot more in North America. 
So that's the top line number. But t
hat's not enough. If you don't support 
the A&M with innovation and execution, you can talk about the brands all 
you want, but you need news to drive incrementality, so that's why we're 
going to focus a lot more on innovation. And Al, maybe you can talk abo
ut 
some of the innovations the second point, and execution on the ground is 
going to really go up when we start tailoring assortments by store so we can 
actually get that incremental growth. Lastly, on total growth, the 
marketplace in North American Bevera
ge business is only growing 1% in 
volume; and in value, maybe 3% to 4%. In the last 4 to 5 years, the new 
entrants in the pure plays have taken a lot of the growth and the big 2, 2.5, 
3 have not really had as much of the growth as the pure plays. So we hav
e 
to figure out how to be a pure play within our own company, and it's not for 
not having the innovation. We have had tons of innovation. We just kill it too 
fast, and this new growth ventures that Al is setting up now, mirroring what 
we've done with Frito
-
Lay will allow us to incubate these new products so 
that it doesn't always have to be a $50 million, $100 million case innovation 
the first year. We can actually start smaller and build up the business. So let 
me turn it to Al to give you his perspective.
 
Al, it's all yours.
 
Albert P. Carey
 
Okay. Indra's mentioned already 
--
 
spent the money on many brands, not 
the 5 core brands. So this coming year, you'll see on Pepsi, Mountain Dew, 
Gatorade, Tropicana and Lipton, substantial increases, not the usual just
 
double
-
digit increases in these campaigns. And the campaigns are not going 
to be just increases in media television, also digital is 
--
 
shows tremendous 
promise. I think not just digital but customer digital. Some of our customers 
are on the leading edge 
of digital shows some remarkable new ideas that we 
could probably tie into and drive business much more directly and focused to 
those consumers. So if we're looking at selling Gatorade to athletes or 
families that have young athletes, we can get to these c
onsumers much 
more directly by using, let's say, the Safeway card and the digital 
approaches that they use. But let me go back on a couple of the key things 
that we're going to be working on at PepsiCo beverages North America. I 
don't believe 
--
 
my observa
tion is the business is not broken. It needs to be 
--
 
I would describe it as a focus on the back to basics, and that means 
investment 
--
 
substantial investments in the top 5 brands. And then the 
other thing we need to do is significantly improve the innova
tion that we 
have going into the marketplace, both on healthy and core. So this year in 
2012, you're going to see a substantial improvement in innovation, but the 
2013 pipeline is the one that we really expect to see some really big gains. 
But this year as
 
well, you'll see things like this that I would call not giant 
innovation, but we've worked with customers on this particular product right 
here, it's a 24 ounce can of Mountain Dew. Our initial test market, we blew 
out every can that we made, and it appea
ls not only to Mountain Dew users, 
but also to energy drink users. So if they normally pay $2.99 for a can like 
this, this will be a lot less. Then I'd call it mid
-
type of innovation like Pepsi 
NEXT, and Pepsi NEXT will have 60% less calories than a normal
 
Pepsi, and 
I'd ask you to try some of it on your way out. I think you'll find that it tastes 
exactly like a regular Pepsi. I'm a regular Pepsi drinker, and it really is the 
same. We've made a substantial progress on that product. And then big 
innovation i
s all
-
natural sweeteners, big breakthrough in fountain 
equipment. And those things are towards the end of this year and really into 
2013. And we'll have the 
--
 
what I would call the proper investments against 
those brands. One last thing I'd mention, putti
ng a local structure in place 
that allows us to get the most out of these big national ideas but also to 
capitalize on these granular opportunities that exist in the marketplace. 
Today, I believe we call too many of the plays out of the center, meaning in 
my group. We're going to have a structure that's announced very quickly 
here, where we'll have general managers in the marketplace. They will have 
regional resources for marketing, and we'll be able to work with our 
customers on things that are going on sp
ecifically in Los Angeles. I just don't 
think we're able to make these calls out of the center as good as the people 
who were down in the marketplace in the Californias, and in Texases and in 
those kinds of markets.
 
Indra K. Nooyi
 
And let me just add one l
ast point. As I said to you in the opening 
comments, this is the first time we're going to have global management of 
big brands. I mean, it might seem unusual to you, but Pepsi was never 
managed as a global brand. It was managed in a much more fragmented 
w
ay. Brad Jakeman, who joined us 6, 9 months ago is doing a fabulous job 
thinking about Pepsi as a global brand, and you'll start seeing the results of 
this global brand work in summer of this year. And so the leverage of all of 
this investment is what give
s us confidence that 
--
 
at first step, hold share, 
start slowly moving this value share to pick it up. And then would be 
technology breakthrough, really start thinking about how to gain share. But 
the real important thing in all of this is to play in this 
market in a responsible 
way. I think this category has been played in interesting ways by the 
competitors, too much pricing action even when commodities have gone up. 
So it's very important that pricing is responsible, and that's what we've been 
trying to 
do in the last 6, 9 months. Go ahead.

A couple of questions, one is on China. It's such a strategically important 
market for lon
g
-
term growth. And having met with Tingyi over the last 
couple of years, a number of times, they've always said, ""We don't think 
carbonated soft drinks are a good business in China."" People like teas. 
People like this. So, there was 
--
 
I don't know if they
've changed their tune, 
but it scares me that that's been their attitude in the past. So my question 
would be, I see the short
-
term benefit of getting losses of the income 
statement from the refranchising. But what are the measurements that 
you're putting 
in place to make sure that Tingyi doesn't do a blast to target 
all the volume benefit, but actually delivers over time in this critical market? 
And then a question for John. Just on the volume growth at Frito, which was 
the slowest it's been in the last, a
s I remember the 1%, what do you think it 
looks like over time and why?
 
Indra K. Nooyi
 
So, Saad, you want to take the Tingyi question because you meet with 
Chairman there on regular basis...
 
Saad Abdul
-
Latif
 
Yes, we're extremely very pleased about the alli
ance if approved by the 
Chinese government with Tingyi. The CSD category in China has been 
growing. And, in fact, in 2011 has grown faster than NCBs. And Tingyi and 
their portfolio, it doesn't have that. So our alliance with them actually is 
complementary.
 
It will give us access to wide areas where we don't have 
production facilities with them. So we have planned our CSD business there. 
It's an alliance between the #1 ready
-
to
-
drink tea, the #1 water, the #1 
cola and the #1 flavor. So I think now we've set 
and transformed, if 
approved by the Chinese government, this alliance, our Beverage business 
on trajectory for growth for many, many years to come. How are we going 
to measure the performance of Tingyi going forward? We have a joint 
planning with them. We 
operate as we operate with the franchise there, 
bottler. Every year, we set up the annual operating plan. We measure it 
quarterly. We adjust where we need to adjust, and then so forth. Most of our 
people running our business will be working with Tingyi on 
this, so there is 
no change. So we're not like giving our business with these people. Actually, 
we're moving a lot of our people in operation to Tingyi. The beauty about 
this alliance is we get access to distribution points, we get access to wide 
areas whe
re we've never existed before. There was a structural 
disadvantage on operating plants. We had 22, Coke have 34. With this now, 
probably we will be set for good, for sustainable growth. And once approved, 
we will be the #1, actually, beverage company with 
Tingyi overnight.
 
Indra K. Nooyi
 
Caroline, that's a great question. And when we went into the alliance with 
Tingyi, I mean, we've all had a chance to meet with Chairman Wei, who we 
adore. I want to tell you, that was the thing we worried about the most. An
d 
what we found that was refreshing was Chairman Wei actually 
--
 
I don't 
know what he told you, but he sought us as much as we sought him. He 
wanted this business because he realized that this business had more price 
incrementality than tea where there's s
o much local competition. So this 
actually gives him some insulation. PepsiCo also provides him a lot of best 
practice sharing from all of the stuff we do around the world, whether it's 
marketplace investments, how we grow the business, how we put in coole
rs, 
how we put in the route. There's a lot of sharing of knowledge and know
-
how. And he genuinely believed that carbonated soft drinks will actually 
grow as a percentage of sales in China, may not be to the U.S. level, but it 
will grow. It's about 20% toda
y, it will grow. So this was a mutually sought 
after marriage, and we feel very good about the prospects for this business. 
So now let me toss it to John to talk about the...
 
John C. Compton
 
So let me 
--
 
2 weeks ago, I gave a big speech to an industry conf
erence of 
the Food Marketing Institute, and I was challenging the group on how to 
rethink growth because if you look at all food and beverage in the fourth 
quarter of 2011, volume declined 1.5%. Revenues grew 5%, but there was 
almost 7 points of pricing be
hind that 5% revenue growth. So I look at Frito
-
Lay North America and say 1% volume growth in the quarter compared to 
everyone else declining 1.5% I think is pretty good. And the algorithm for 
the quarter of a 1 7 10, I would say, is world
-
class. Ongoing w
hen we took, 
as you know, almost 6 points of pricing and drove 1% volume growth in that 
business. Ongoing we said for Frito
-
Lay, is a low single
-
digit volume growth 
company. We expect a positive spread between volume and revenue and a 
positive spread betwe
en revenue and profit, and that's our expectation. 
We're very proud of Frito
-
Lay.
 
Indra K. Nooyi
 
Judy?
 
Judy E. Hong

Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division
 
Just in terms of commodities, the $1.5 billion step up in 2012, a little bit 
more color just i
n terms of maybe key inputs or by
-
product categories where 
you're seeing the most pressure? And then as related to that, the inflation 
impact for 2012 that you won't be able to cover price 
--
 
with pricing just 
seems a little bit larger. So is it really a c
onsumer issue? Is it 
--
 
is there an 
element of a brand equity issue that you're really trying to address here? 
And then how much is also driven by perhaps maybe your hedge position 
being a little bit of a disadvantage versus your competitors?
 
Indra K. Nooy
i
 
Hugh, go ahead.
 
Hugh F. Johnston
 
Sure. So in terms of the key commodities, obviously, we tend not to talk 
about specific commodity pricing for obvious reasons. That's information 
we'd rather not share with competitors. What I would say to though, Judy, i
s 
it is very much driven by the lagging effect of the timing of purchases. We 
do think based on the pricing that we have, and we obviously have 
knowledge of what the marketplace prices are with 1 or 2 notable 
exceptions, the pricing that we're paying is be
tter than what's in the market 
or equal to what's in the market right now. Relative to competition hedging 
strategies, that's hard for me to speculate on. Obviously, it's just difficult to 
say what competition is doing. We've seen, obviously, a number of C
PGs 
come out and start to share guidance. And I think we've seen people talk 
about anything from low
-
 
to mid
-
single digits. Obviously, the number that 
we shared is a notch above that. I guess generally speaking, the more 
you're exposed to agro, you probabl
y have a bit more commodity inflation as 
opposed to being exposed more to energy. So the food and beverage 
company is probably a little bit higher than the HPCs. And the longer you 
tend to hedge, and we've been pretty open about the fact that we tend to 
wo
rk about 9 months out, the more the effect will hit in 2012.
 
Indra K. Nooyi
 
In terms of pricing behind the brands, we actually lead pricing in many parts 
of even North America. None of our snack businesses are an issue. But in 
beverages, we've been trying 
to take pricing up. It is a very competitive 
market out there. And if the market place behaves in a sensible way based 
on commodities, I think the pricing will go up. This has nothing to do with 
our brand. One example I'll give you is in the cold channel, 
and Al you can 
talk about it. We've taken pricing up and it stuck. And our cold channel 
volume is up significantly.
 
Albert P. Carey
 
Yes. Our cold channel business right now for probably the last 12 weeks is 
very solid, and a good indicator of the 
brand strength as we put some 
programs in place on Mountain Dew and Pepsi. But the pricing in the 
marketplace even on large format is rational right now, which is a good thing 
for all of us.
 
Indra K. Nooyi
 
Let me take a question here and then come there.
 
U
nknown Analyst
 
Indra, could you talk about why you have a line of sight now and it's the 
right time to reset? So why do you have it now? Why didn't you have it 3 
years ago? Is it due to the macro, or can you just explain that a little 
further? I have a fol
low up.
 
Indra K. Nooyi
 
Good question, and I tell you, 2007, '08 
--
 
let me 
--
 
just typically, when new 
CEOs come, they just like to sort of throw everything in the kitchen sink and 
reset. I was looking at the portfolio and saying, ""Hey, you can reset all yo
u 
want, but developed markets are getting a little soft."" We don't have much 
emerging and developing markets in my portfolio. And sometimes, when you 
have a problem in the portfolio overall, you take a gigantic reset. The issues 
that I was facing at that t
ime required transformation, which was going to 
take several years. I'll be honest with you. Had we not had this 
macroeconomic meltdown and this commodity cost volatility, this whole 
reset would have happened earlier, and the transformation could have 
happ
ened earlier. The problem is, we faced the worst crisis, and we had to 
reset in the middle of this crisis. The other problem was anytime we wanted 
a reset for North American beverages, there was this giant sucking sound 
where the bottling systems took out 
all of the extra funding and demanded 
bottle funding, okay? And so we had to address that structural problem we 
had with the bottling systems so that we didn't have 2 companies fighting 
over a shrinking profit or a flat profit pool. So I had to wait for th
at bottling 
system integration to happen, okay? And so finished the bottling system 
integration 2010; in 2011, brought the management of all of it under one 
person, Al Carey, and said okay, now is the time to go off and make the 
reset happen because now we
 
know that every dollar of shareholders' 
money we put behind the reset will actually yield results as opposed to you 
put the money 
--
 
and as I said, every CEO gets an opportunity once in a 
decade to make a reset. It's like running a car race. You got to ta
ke a pit 
stop at some point, and you don't get too many chances to take a pit stop 
and then still win the race. We want to win the race. So this was the pit 
stop, and we had to pick it very strategically. So that's what we did. Talked 
through about it ever
y year, I'll be honest with you.
 
Unknown Analyst
 
Got you. And then Hugh can you just talk about volume was a little tight into 
this year and maybe the long term because I don't think it was mentioned in 
any of the slides.
 
Indra K. Nooyi
 
Revenue was at mid
-
single digits this year, too.
 
Hugh F. Johnston
 
Yes, we said mid
-
single on revenue.
 
Unknown Analyst
 
And then no volume?
 
Hugh F. Johnston
 
Yes, revenue is probably the more relevant thing at this point.
 
Indra K. Nooyi
 
Because of the pricing, yes. Can I take a
 
question, then come to you?
 
Unknown Analyst
 
Yes.
 
Indra K. Nooyi
 
A question there, please.
 
Unknown Analyst
 
Yes, Indra, 2 questions. One on North America beverages. You talked about 
the opportunity through structural change to jump shift ROIC. Could you 
ela
borate on that comment? Are you rethinking about how you're thinking 
about wholly owning the bottling assets for the long term? What did you 
mean by that comment is question one. And then question two is, as you 
think about the larger organization, the who
le of PepsiCo and as the 
Chairman of the company and its CEO, how do you think about a, kind of 
internal versus external candidates for key leadership roles; and b, how are 
you thinking about those 2 roles being occupied by one person?
 
Indra K. Nooyi
 
Let m
e first turn to Hugh on the structural issue.
 
Hugh F. Johnston
 
Sure. Well, as we laid out in the scorecard, I think we're open about how we 
are going to look at the business. Regarding alternatives to increased 
returns, first of all, from an operating perspective, we're obviously going to 
be looking at capital investm
ents with extreme scrutiny when the business is 
challenged from a growth perspective. Working capital, the same. We do 
think that there are lots of opportunities to manage inventory more tightly, 
and as Indra said, to reduce days both on the payables and 
-
-
 
or on the 
receivable side and increase on the payable side. From a structural 
alternative perspective, I think it's fair to say that there's a variety of items 
on the table. And we're going to look at each of the options and determine 
what makes sense if
 
we don't see internal operating performance of the 
business and the returns of the business improve over time. That can be 
anything from collaborations right through to all variety of other options as 
well.
 
Indra K. Nooyi
 
Let me talk to you about organiza
tion. We do a great job developing our 
internal talent for succession at the senior
-
most level. You see an 
outstanding group of leaders here, who've all grown up in the PepsiCo 
system doing outstanding job, but I think the mark of a good company is to 
be a
ble to bring in external talent when needed at the right level, whatever 
the level of the company is, if the belief of the leadership of the company is 
that this external talent will significantly improve the thinking of the 
company and help us position ou
rselves to perform in a new and changing 
environment. I think all of us are in an extraordinary period of change. Many 
of the skills we had over the 
--
 
that we learned over the last 10 or 15 years 
don't apply in the future. So very often, you have to buy s
ome of this talent 
to just improve the overall knowledge base in the company. I mean, I'll give 
you an example, Enderson Guimaraes. Where are you, Enderson? Enderson 
came to us from Electrolux, and he was running a big piece of Electrolux. 
Now he's running
 
global operations for PepsiCo. The thinking that Enderson 
brings to us challenges the way we do things in PepsiCo, which is great 
because it makes us all a better company, a better group of leaders. So I 
think any good company, the mark of a great company
 
is to be willing, to be 
open to bringing an external talent when needed, assimilating them, 
learning from them and then getting better as an overall company. On the 
last thing on the Chairman and CEO roles, look, I've been Chairman and 
CEO, and I've seen 
the benefits of being both the Chairman and CEO being 
able to manage the board, external constituencies and be able to run the 
company. If you have a Chairman and CEO that runs a very flat 
organization, 20 reports, and they're not of the caliber of being C
hairman 
and CEO themselves, then you have a problem. I have the unusual benefit 
of having 4 sector heads who each of them can be Chairman and CEO in 
their own right and a phenomenal CFO. So I look at my team and say, ""I 
work for them, they are all Chairman
 
and CEOs in their own way."" And so I 
think in PepsiCo, this role combination actually works. I promised to come 
here. Yes, right here on the first row.
 
Unknown Analyst
 
Indra, can you discuss your level of confidence that you will get returns 
behind this m
arketing spending in beverages? And also, as we look at 2013 
and '14, I'm assuming that your EPS growth will be in line with your long
-
term goals. Why would that be if you're getting a return on the marketing 
investment in 2012 versus depressing the earnin
gs base, and you've also 
got incremental cost cutting in those years?
 
Indra K. Nooyi
 
Your question is why isn't it higher in 2013?
 
Unknown Analyst
 
Yes.
 
Indra K. Nooyi
 
Look, what we've given you is the long
-
term algorithm. We said high
-
single 
digit. We'll c
ome to 2013 guidance as we get to the early part of 2013. Let's 
see what the environment is like, what all of the cost situation looks like. 
Why do we believe that we'll get a return on investment? I'm going to use 
Pepsi Max as an example. We invested heav
ily behind Pepsi Max and the 
restaging of Pepsi Max last year and this year. Pepsi Max is up more than 
50% in volume between last year and this year. Now it's off a small base, 
but it's up 50%, and it's almost one share of the carbonated soft drink 
busines
s. So you can't run 20 brands and try to invest behind all of them 
and expect them to cut through the clutter. But if you take a focus group of 
brands, that actually belong in different aisles in store, look at the brands 
that Al talked about. You've got P
epsi, Dew in the CSD aisle. You've got 
Gatorade in the sports aisle. You've got Tropicana sitting in the refrigerated 
aisle. If you invest behind each of these sitting in different parts of the store 
and put the appropriate media rates, our testing shows t
hat you can actually 
get growth in each of these brands. And that's the model we've been using. 
We have tested that, and we believe we will get a return on it, okay. I have 
to go to a question there. Yes, go ahead.
 
Unknown Analyst
 
Two questions. One, 
just implied in your long
-
term model, is there an 
expectation that gross margins will expand over time, or is all the leverage 
going to be below the gross profit line?
 
Indra K. Nooyi
 
Hugh?
 
Hugh F. Johnston
 
To be perfectly candid, a little tough to say give
n commodities have been so 
volatile. We will clearly see margins below the line improve where the impact 
of lower cost below the line. NVA, which is the non
-
commodity portion of 
cost of goods sold, we clearly expect to see productivity there. How 
commoditi
es shakeout and how that balances out to me is very much an 
open question. Under normal circumstances, yes, I would expect to see 
gross margin improvement as well, but...
 
Unknown Analyst
 
So you'd expect to be able to start to 
--
 
or be able over time to cov
er some 
level of commodity inflation with pricing, I guess, is my 
--
 
did the company 
loss pricing power, is what I'm asking.
 
Hugh F. Johnston
 
Yes. The way I think about it is, when I think about commodities, I tend to 
think about them longer term growing r
oughly in line with global GDP, and 
so somewhere in 3%, 3.5% range. At that level, certainly, we would expect 
to be able to price the cover. What happens in any individual year, tough to 
ascertain further out than a few months before the year begins.
 
Indra
 
K. Nooyi
 
The thing to be careful about just, say, on pricing, I'd be careful about 
assuming that the brands don't have pricing power. I'll tell you why because 
this is a tough economy. It's not that the brands don't have pricing power. 
Consumers don't hav
e the buying power. Okay, if you had a normal year, we 
would be looking at a very different dynamic. In countries where consumers 
have buying power, the emerging market of EMEA, Asia and Middle East, we 
have been able to price. We are getting the value 
--
 
volume growth and the 
value growth, not an issue. The last thing I'd tell you is on gross margins. As 
the mix of countries changes and as we get more growth in emerging and 
developing markets, which is what all of us should want because that drives 
long
-
te
rm growth, sometimes the gross margin picture starts looking muddy 
because in those markets, we're still in the early stages so the gross margin 
is a little bit lower and then they ramp up. So when you have a large 
company and you're looking at a combinati
on of different businesses, 
categories, countries with different dynamics and a combination of franchise 
and operating business, there's not a linear relationship on the gross margin. 
So it requires explanation. And we'll provide it to you in our quarterly
 
calls. 
Okay, I'll take a question on this side. Is there a question on this side? No? 
Go ahead. I'll come back again for you.
 
Unknown Analyst
 
Hugh, thank you so much for your commentary around balancing your 
leverage increase in tuck
-
in acquisitions. If I
 
could just dig in to that a little 
bit. When you look at your short
-
term borrowings and your access to 
commercial paper, do you see a need to maintain Tier 1 CP access, or could 
you look for increased balance sheet flexibility by moving towards Tier 2?
 
Hu

It's a good question. At this point, in terms of commenting on specific 
ratings, it would probably be inappropriate for me to do that right now. I've 
-
-
 
we've shared with you what our plans are and what our leverage roughly 
looks like. Beyon
d that, I probably rather not get into it. I wouldn't 
necessarily take anything off the table.
 
Indra K. Nooyi
 
A question there. One back, and then you, John.
 
Unknown Analyst
 
Yes, I just wanted to ask you, you have an increased budget for 
advertising. 
Just wanted to know which sectors are you targeting? Are you moving more 
or less towards the Internet, print or TV? And also, do you have any hand in 
the Olympics with your Gatorade drinks and so forth?
 
Indra K. Nooyi
 
I mean, the advertising s
pending is broad
-
based. As Al mentioned, it's a 360 
degree activation. So each of those elements you talked about will get an 
increase in advertising spending. And no, we are not in the Olympics. We 
were the proud sponsors of the NFL and the outstanding Su
per Bowl we just 
witnessed where we had phenomenal results with our advertising campaign. 
And that's what we're doing.
 
Hugh F. Johnston
 
And I would not say, we're not in the Olympics, but we have 3 substantial 
campaigns this summer. One on Gatorade, one on
 
Pepsi and Mountain Dew.
 
Indra K. Nooyi
 
Yes, John?
 
Unknown Analyst
 
So you talked about one of the targets that you are going to keep for 2012. 
You had those targets when you talked about the bottom the page. One of 
them was value share growth. So going bac
k to Dara's Question, I guess, 
historically, advertising takes a little bit of time to seed. And so can you talk 
about what you see as the key drivers of those values 
--
 
of that value share 
growth? So advertising takes a little time seed, the innovation is
 
a little 
back
-
end loaded. Taking less price relative to raw material inflation sounds 
like we could actually see price gaps widening from that standpoint. So how 
much of that short
-
term value share growth do you think comes from 
potentially widening of pr
ice point gaps?
 
Indra K. Nooyi
 
Hugh?
 
Hugh F. Johnston
 
John, from that standpoint, we 
--
 
and let me focus more on North America 
because that's sort of the more logical area of emphasis. We really did get 
our pricing in place in the fourth quarter, particula
rly in the Beverage 
business. And we were comfortable with where we are right now, and I think 

 
Indra K. Nooyi
 
Any other question this time? Yes, go ahead, Damian.
 
Damian Witkowski

Gabelli & Comp
any, Inc.
 
Indra, just a 2
-
part question. On 
--
 
just give us your global perspective in 
terms of what's happening around the globe currently, what do you think of 
each market in terms of is it getting better or worse? And then I don't know 
if I missed it, b
ut if I look at your goal for Good
-
for
-
You, the $30 billion by 
2020, is that still a target? And since you sort of said no big acquisitions, do 
you think that you can still get there with organic or mostly organic growth?
 
Indra K. Nooyi
 
I'm going to answer
 
that question, and then what I'm going to do, Damian, 
is give you a gift. I'm going to have Saad, Zein talk about their regions, and 
then I'm going to have John and Al talk about Latin America because they 
also cover Latin America. Currently, our Good
-
for
-
You portfolio is about $14 
billion in PepsiCo. That market category is growing between 89% globally. If 
we just keep growing at that rate between now and 2020, we will be a $30 
billion business. So we don't need any extraordinary intervention to grow 
that
 
business. What we need to do is to invest, to grow in those markets we 
are in and go into new markets with just our Quaker, Tropicana, Gatorade 
and where appropriate, our Naked Juice brands. So we're not looking at any 
dramatic expansion through acquisiti
ons at this point. So let me turn 
--
 
Zein, 
let me turn it to you to talk about what you're seeing in Europe, especially 
Western Europe, Eastern Europe, Southern. Give us your perspective.
 
Zein Abdalla
 
Yes, well, I mean, clearly, you all read the news. Euro
pe is going through a 
lot of challenges. And you almost see either issues unfold by the week, or 
some issues just repeat by the week. One of the, I think, wonderful things 
about our business in Europe is it's very finely balanced between the East 
and the W
est. We're pretty evenly split between the emerging markets of 
Europe and the developed markets of Europe. And what that tends to do for 
us is in good times, allows us to accelerate growth and move ahead of the 
pack. And obviously, in more challenging time
s when the developed markets 
tend to be more stable, it allows us to hedge against the challenges. So even 
in a very difficult year like 2011, we still delivered very, very solid top line 
growth. I would say looking back 2011, obviously, the developed mark
ets 
are more stable and performed better. Russia had a particular challenge. 

FMCG companies, not so much drive by their economy where they actually 
had good GDP growth, but much more d
riven by the excessive inflation in 
the country because they suffered both from the global inflation but also 
particularly in Russia a very severe crop shortage in 2010 as a result of a 
very hot summer that played out into basic commodities, hurt consumers
 
really in terms of their basic, basic purchases. And you saw a decline in 
disposable incomes. Now we do see that normalizing in Russia, and we do 
see the market coming back. And we will see a stronger performance in 
Russia in 2012. Now again having said t
hat, we're very pleased with the top 
line performance around Russia growing double digits in 2011. And again, 
the wonderful hedging of that business across the multiple categories in 
which we compete. Following the Wimm
-
Bill
-
Dann acquisition and the 
integr
ation, we're nearly 12 months into that now and the integration of it 
into our business. I can tell you, we've gone in 12 months from essentially 
serving consumers between about 12:00 midday to about 6:00 in the 
evening. They're now serving them from the m
oment they wake up to 
actually, the moment before they go to sleep. And the traditional drink in 
Russia before you go to bed is a glass of Kefir, which is a fermented yogurt 
drink. It's a digestive. It helps you sleep, and that's actually one of the 
fastes
t
-
growing beverage categories. When you talk about snacking, and we 
all tend to think about nutrition versus Fun
-
for
-
You, well, one of the fastest
-
growing snacking areas in many of these emerging markets is as the meals 
deconstruct and as people move from 
formal breakfast at home before they 
leave home, to needing that midmorning snack or that second breakfast. 
And again, products like value
-
added dairy play very, very strongly in that 
segment. So yes, I mean, a challenging macroeconomic picture in Europe, 
challenging consumer picture. But we've always, I think, said to you that the 
good news is people have to eat and drink. The really good news is we have 
a balanced portfolio, both geographically and in terms of the categories and 
the consumer needs and occ
asions that we service.
 
Indra K. Nooyi
 
Saad?
 
Saad Abdul
-
Latif
 
Yes. Well, EMEA is a vast territory, as you know, and I have three
-
quarters 
of the world's population, and...
 
Indra K. Nooyi
 
Then we want 3 quarters of the profits of the company come from 
your 
group.
 
Saad Abdul
-
Latif
 
We're working towards that. I'll tell you, we called engine for growth for 
PepsiCo for a reason. First of all, the economies are growing, where China 
and India they're growing at high single
-
digits GDP. The population is young,
 
and the per capita consumption of both snacks and beverages is a fraction of 
the developed world. So we have a huge runway to grow in both businesses, 
and we are poised to capture that growth. We have outstanding businesses 
in beverages and in snacks, and
 
I'll just tour around the area with you area 
by area. So if we take the Middle East, we are the overwhelming choice of 
consumers there in beverages and in snacks. But that's been happening 
lately in the Middle East while it would set us back a little bit 
for a year or 2. 
However, for the long term, it's great because it will bring a lot of 
transparency and governance and it will bring a lot of employment at greater 
stage to our businesses. And we are very well positioned to capture that 
growth. India has b
een great. We have fantastic businesses in beverages 
and in snacks. In fact, in 2011, we out grew our competitor by 6, 7 factor 
points in LRB. Our snacks business is 
--
 
close to 100,000 tons [ph] and then 
doing great. And we're capturing all the growth of 
the GDP. It slowed a little 
bit down, but not at the level that really worried us. There is a lot of 
consumers coming in with purchasing power into that as in China. In China, 
our snacks business is doing great. We are growing in high, high teens. And 
in t
he beverages, when the government approves the alliance with Tingyi, 
we have really set our beverage business on sustainable growth path. As I 

cola and #1 flavor. So coming together
, we put that business on a trajectory 
to growth. And with snacks, it's a very fragmented market. And we are very 
well poised with the capability of people that we have there to grow. Asia
-
Pacific is the mixture of countries there we have developed such as
 
Australia. Like the other developed world, there have seen some challenges 
there, but we are managing these challenges and actually, we are growing 
on the snacks business. And we have a lot of emerging markets that we are 
doing extremely well, such as Vie
tnam where, actually, we are the choice of 
consumer there for both snacks and beverages. Pakistan, which is part of 
the Asia
-
Pacific there, is also growing. So overall, we have the great 
businesses in foods and beverages. The economies are growing. The 
pop
ulation is young, and we are very well poised to capture that growth for 
the future.
 
Indra K. Nooyi
 
John, can you talk about Latin America, but stay with the macroeconomic...
 
John C. Compton
 
Yes, Latin America remains 3% to 4% GDP growth. Obviously, that's
 
driven 
by Mexico and Brazil. Mexico for the year was around 3%. Brazil slowed 
some, but I think as you look forward, you've got to believe that, that 
economy is going to continue to grow 4%, 5%, maybe 6% going forward 
with the Olympics and the World Cup c
oming there. And our business 
collectively grew volume about 5% during the year, so strong. And in Brazil, 
our snack business was up 8%, and I think it's 
--
 
to Indra's point about the 
dis
-
synergies of the 2, it's one of our best markets with the Power of O
ne 
where we leverage the Frito
-
Lay's system to distribute many of the beverage 
brands. So very optimistic about Latin America.
 
Indra K. Nooyi
 
Yes?
 
Eric R. Katzman 
-
 
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division
 
Indra, 2 questions. One, I didn't hear a lot about mix 
on a consolidated 
basis. I think you touched on the fact that emerging markets are in negative 
to mix, but if you're no longer doing as much M&A, I would assume that's no 
longer going to be as much of a drag. And if you're focusing on the top 12 
global bra
nds, I assume they typically have a higher
-
than
-
average mix 
benefit. So maybe you could touch on those, and then I'll follow up.
 
Indra K. Nooyi
 
Yes. Mix, I think, our expectations again depends on how the economies 
evolve, Eric. But right now, emerging mar
kets 
--
 
emerging and developing 
markets about 35% of the revenue of PepsiCo. We think it'll get to 50% by 
the end of the decade, okay. That's the range. And it takes that long only 
because our developed markets business is also growing, okay. So that's 
how
 
we think it will evolve. The good news is, in emerging and developing 
markets, once they get to a certain scale, their margins escalate quite fast. 
The best example is Sabritas in Mexico. It's a developing market. But if you 
look at the margins we get in 
our Sabritas business, it's very attractive. And 
so because we have scale, we are the largest salty
-
snack player there. So I 
think it's a couple of dynamics. One, we'll keep moving the emerging and 
developing markets up, get it to half
-
and
-
half and there s
hould be even 
more skewed to emerging and developing markets based on the world 
population. But let's start with 50
-
50. And then, hopefully, sometime around 
2015, the profit acceleration from emerging markets will start picking up 
even more because the inv
estments to build scale now are returns from the 
scale investments. So I hope that change will happen.
 
Eric R. Katzman 
-
 
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division
 
And then in looking at that 4
-
quad grid that you put up, so basically, in the 
top left quadrant, it
 
was 74% to the business and the other 26% had issues 
one way or the other. And I'm kind of wanting to think about that like 
--
 
or 
how should we think about that relative to the Power of One? Because it 
seem like the top
-
left quadrant was what really benef
ited from Power of 
One, whereas the others were more difficult to kind of see where that 
--
 
where the benefit comes in there. And then to the extent that you get a 1% 
lift from the Power of One quantified, I guess, is like $120 million in sales, I 
mean, yo
u're talking relative to a business that's got $60 billion, $70 billion 
of sales. So how is that like incremental?
 
Indra K. Nooyi
 
So Eric, the Power of One increment we're talking about in North America, 
all right, that number was a North American coincide
nce number increasing 
about 1%. Believe me, our normal businesses grow. Frito
-
Lay grows, North 
American beverage grows. Over and above that, if we can get an additional 
$120 million sales, 2 or 3 points from that in North America, that's a 
bonanza. I mean,
 
to get $300 million, $400 million from an over
-
the
-
top co
-
merchandising activity, co
-
promotion activity is gigantic for an overall food 
and beverage business market that's not growing as robustly as it used to 
grow. I have looked at the portfolio differen
tly. I actually 
--
 
when putting it 
together, I looked at it very carefully, the businesses on the lower
-
left 
quadrant, okay, some of the emerging market snack businesses, they're 
only there because we don't have the scale as yet. They're going to use the 
B
everage business to plus up their scale. They'll quickly move into the top
-
left quadrant, okay. But we need to make sure that we manage that 
business to drive the growth, make sure that we leverage the Beverage 
business to drive the growth, get the right p
eople, and we have to do that. 
That's why we put it there, honestly. The 
--
 
some of the emerging market 
Beverage business, we've done the Pareto. We have looked at each of these 
businesses and said, ""Do we have an operational line of sight to get to the 
to
p quadrant, or do we have to consider structural option that is 
refranchising into a well
-
capitalized bottler, who has a reason to 
refranchised?"" And let me speak to that a little bit. In the past, one of the 
mistakes we made as a company, I'll go back, wh
en we gave Mexico, Russia 
to PBG, all right, we gave it to them because we felt they needed a growth 
market. Well one of the big lessons, Eric, was that you give a growth 
market, which is not the whole market, to a bottler only they have reason to 
combine 
with something else they have and get scale. You just don't throw a 
growth markets to them, okay. And that's why the whole international 
experiment of PBG wasn't wildly successful. So when we think about 
refranchising some of these emerging market Beverage
 
businesses, we have 
to find a bottler who has other businesses so that they can leverage the 
scale like AmBev in Brazil was a great example. And we have partners like 
that in Asia
-
Pacific. I look at our Japanese bottlers who are absolute terrific 
partners
, taking them to other parts of Asia
-
Pacific. I think there are lots of 
opportunities there to think about how to move emerging market Beverage 
businesses to the top box. The biggest elephant there is North American 
DSD in that bottom box. If commodity inf
lation wasn't prevalent, we 
wouldn't have put it in that bottom box because margins for that business 
normally are in the teens. It shouldn't have been a problem at all. And then 
we bought the bottlers back, I mean, we were thrilled at the synergies and 
wh
at we can do. What we need to navigate through now is how do you 
manage a Beverage business, which is not growing too much, but not a 
commodity inflation? How do you reset that whole business? And if you can't 
reset it through a technology breakthrough, th
rough a different way of 
operating it, through innovation, through brand building, then you have to 
think about structural options. And that's what we're going through. So what 
I would suggest is, just focus on the percentage of profitability from North 
Am
erican DSD beverage that belongs in that box. The rest of it will take care 
of itself because of the growth and the way we are managing it today, okay. 
Caroline, I think we have to shut it down, but one last question. Go ahead.

--
 
well, a good 2 for Al, or maybe both for Al. On feet on the street, 
you've got a lot of layoffs coming. How do you feel about the capability of 
the Pepsi system right now? Do you need more people rather than less? 
And 
the other is, do you think you should be doing more targeted Hispanic 
marketing given the growth rate in consumption of beverages by that 
consumer group?
 
Albert P. Carey
 
Now those are good questions. I 
--
 
let me just say, with the layoffs that will 
occ
ur at Pepsi North America, very few will be at the front line. Most will be 
focused on middle and above management. So I'm not worried about this 
feet on the street. But as time goes on, there are a few gaps in service and 
those are being taken care of, I 
believe, in customer service just like at the 
Frito
-
Lay system. So I feel very good where we are there. On the Hispanic 
opportunity, I think probably more than 60% of the growth in the category 
is going to come from the Hispanic consumer, and I have seen s
ome 
estimates that are quite a bit higher than that. And this whole local 
campaign that we're putting together in our local region markets, very 
focused on that as opportunities come up in the Texas, Florida, California 
market. And actually, that opportuni
ty is becoming bigger in almost every 
city, not just in those Southwest cities that we typically talk about.
 
Indra K. Nooyi
 
Thank you, Caroline. So let me just close by saying thank you again to all of 
you for coming to our meeting this morning, and 
thank you for your 
attention over the past couple of hours. We look forward to seeing a lot of 
you over the next few weeks, and certainly reconnecting with all of you at 
CAGNY later this month. But as you leave, I just want you to take a picture 
of PepsiCo
 
back with you. $66 billion of revenue, 16% operating margin, 
17% net return on invested capital, 31% return on equity, a prolific cash 
generator and a company with 22 brands, each one generating over $1 
billion in retail sales, and a company with terrific
 
people and great growth 
prospects. So with that, thank you for your time and hope to reconnect with 
you soon. Thank you.

2/14/20,Pepsi,"Good morning and welcome to PepsiCo's Second Quarter 2013 Earnings 
Conference Call. Your lines have been placed on listen
-
only until the 
question
-
and
-
answer session. (Operator Instructions). Today's call is being 
recorded and will be archived at 
www.pepsico.com.
 
It is now my pleasure to introduce Mr. Jamie Caulfield, Senior Vice President 
of Investor Relations. Mr. Caulfield you may begin.
 
Jamie Caulfield
 
Thank you, operator and thanks to all of you who are listing on the call for 
your 
patience this morning as we implemented a solution for technical issues 

 
With me today are Indra Nooyi, PepsiCo's Chairman and CEO; and Hugh 
Johnston, PepsiCo's CFO. We'll lead off today's call with a review of our 
secon
d quarter performance and 2013 outlook and then we will move on to 
Q&A. Because of the delayed start to our call and the fact that I know that 
this is a busy earnings day for all of you, we've kept our prepared remarks 

ve one question limit and we may not 
be able to get through the full queue of analyst questions. If that's the case 

be happy to take your questions individually.
 
Before we begin
 
please take note of our cautionary statement. This 
conference call includes forward
-
looking statements, including statements 
regarding 2013 guidance and our long
-
term targets based on currently 
available information. Forward
-
looking statements inherently 
involve risks 
and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from 
those predicted in such forward
-
looking statements. Statements made on 
this conference call should be considered together with cautionary 
statements and other inf
ormation contained in today's earnings release and 
in our most recent periodic reports filed with the SEC.
 
Unless otherwise indicated all references to EPS and total operating profit 
growth are on a quarter basis. In addition, references to organic revenue
 
results in this call exclude the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, 
structural changes and foreign exchange translation. To find disclosures and 
reconciliations of non
-
GAAP measures that we may use when discussing 
PepsiCo's financial results, please
 
refer to the glossary and other 
attachments in this morning's earnings release and to the Investors section 
of PepsiCo's website under the Events & Presentations tab. As we discuss 
our results today, please keep in mind that our Q2 reporting period is the
 
12 
weeks ended June 15 for our North America business and the months of 
March, April and May for the vast majority of our businesses outside of North 
America.
 
Now, it's my pleasure to introduce, Indra Nooyi.
 
Indra Nooyi
 
Thanks Jamie and good morning every

another quarter of strong results. In Q2 we had our sixth consecutive 
quarter of mid
-
single
-
digit organic revenue growth. We generated double
-
digit core EPS growth and drove significant improvement in cash flow. Our 
organic 
revenue growth in the quarter was 4.2%, in line with our mid
-
single
-
digit long
-
term target, with particularly strong growth in international 
beverages, at Frito
-
Lay North America, Latin American snacks, and snacks 
and beverages throughout Asia, Middle East
, and Africa.
 
We are encouraged by the continued strength in the top line with our 
marketplace investments playing an important role in driving solid growth, 
brand equity and market share results. Organic revenue growth reflected 
each of our full business 
units achieving positive net price realization in the 
quarter. Our overall servings increased 4% with snacks volume growth of 
3%. Beverage volume grew 1.5% on an organic basis and our international 
beverage growth was strong, up 11% on a reported basis and
 
5% on an 
organic basis. We had good profit flow through with core gross margins 
including 120 basis points in the quarter. A&M up 55 basis points, core 
constant currency operating profit up 11%, and our core operating margin 
up 120 basis points.
 
Ex the Vi
etnam gain and incremental investments, our core constant 
currency operating profit was up 8% and core operating margins improved 
by 60 basis points. Our productivity program remains clearly on track. We 
have targeted $900 million in savings this year whic
h is the second year of 
our three
-
year program and we are well on our way to achieving our current 
goal of $3 billion. Year
-
to
-
date management operating cash flow excluding 
certain items was more than $2.3 billion, a significant increase over the first 
hal
f of 2012. And we returned over $2.7 billion to shareholders in the first 
half in the form of dividends and share repurchases.
 
These results are especially pleasing in the context of some very difficult 
market conditions worldwide. Particularly, tough macr
o challenges 
challenging the consumer in developed markets, especially in Western 
Europe, slowing food and beverage growth in the United States, political 
unrest in several important markets most notably Egypt and Turkey, and 
adverse weather in the U.S. an
d Western Europe. We are able to continue to 
deliver in these trying conditions largely due to the strength of our portfolio, 
both the geographic diversity and product diversity. We have a wonderful 
balance of developed and emerging markets, with the devel
oped markets 
providing strong cash flow generation and scale
-
enabled capability that we 
leverage globally.
 
Now emerging markets provide tremendous potential of top line growth and 
margin expansion. This is important. We have a diverse but highly 
complement
ary portfolio of brands and products. The high coincidence of 
snack and beverage purchase and consumption provides numerous 
commercial opportunity and our nutrition portfolio provides new growth 
avenues to capture expanding consumer demand. We continue to 
exploit the 
potential of our portfolio by sharpening our efforts against a few key 
platforms. We have stepped up our investments in advertising, marketing 
and R&D to further strengthen our brands and to accelerate our product 
innovation.
 
We have stepped ou
r market based execution across the board. For 
example, we are driving even greater partnership with our customer by 
engaging in joint business planning that aligns our product, brands and in
-
store merchandizing capability with our customer's growth strate
gy. The 
scale and complementary nature of our categories makes us a clear partner 
of choice with our customer to drive their growth. We continue to refine our 
revenue management capability to drive both greater values for our 
consumer and price realization
 
for PepsiCo. And in a number of international 
markets, we have improved the effectiveness of our go to market systems 
by driving synergies in selling and distribution systems across snacks and 
beverages.
 
We continue to execute against our productivity age

stepped up marketplace investments, and at the same time expanding our 
margins. We now have our team focused on identifying and planning the 
next generation of productivity projects that will extend our productivity 
savings beyond 2014.
 
We have also strengthened our global bottling 
network and systems scale in a number of key markets through our new 
partnerships with Tingyi in China, with (inaudible) and Polar in Mexico, and 
in just this past quarter, our partnership with Suntory in Viet
nam. And we're 
driving high returns in invested capital and cash returns to shareholders 
through highly disciplined capital allocation.
 
Let me now turn to specific businesses. All our business units performed well 
financial and in the marketplace in Q2. Le
t me share with you some of the 
highlights. At Frito
-
Lay North America, we generated 3% volume growth and 
mid
-
single
-
digit organic revenue growth, with net price realization widening 
sequentially from what we reported in Q1. We gained volume share and 
main
tained value share across major channels in the United States. And we 
expanded core operating margins by 40 basis points even as we increased 
advertising and marketing expense.
 
In Beverages Americas, we achieved another quarter of solid price 
realization i
n the United States. We held CSD share in U.S. major channel, 
with pricing and retail ahead of the category. We drove growth and core 
operating margin expansion while we increased advertising and marketing 
spend. We generated 4% core constant currency oper
ating profitability.
 
And innovation was encouraging, with Mountain Dew Kickstart, Tropicana 
Farmstand and Starbucks iced coffee each demonstrating potential to 
become $100 million plus at retail platforms and contributing to positive 
price utilization and 
value share gain. And strong marketing and 
merchandising led to value share gains by Gatorade sports drinks in our 
coffee, tea and chilled juice business.
 
In other developed markets, despite the tough macros, we saw good 
performance in some of our larger m
arkets. France grew organic revenue 
9% and the UK and Germany each posted 3% organic revenue growth. 
Innovation played a large part of our success with the launch of the naturally 
sweetened Pepsi Next in France and Trop50 in the UK. We saw very good 
growth
 
in our developing and emerging markets in Q2, with organic revenue 
of 11%, made up of 11% in snacks and 10% in beverages and this was 
driven by execution of our strategy to increase household penetration and 
frequency of consumption.
 
We had terrific growt
h from each of our major developing markets, with 
organic revenue growth of 7% in Mexico, 15% in the rest of Latin America 
and 12% in Turkey. And we are especially pleased with our beverage volume 
performance in Russia where we grew Pepsi, Lipton, 7UP and 
Russky Dar 
kvaas each in the double
-
digits. And we saw the benefits of our Russia 
platform with strong results in Ukraine. Our emerging markets performance 
drove the continued great results in our EMEA sector, where organic volume 
grew 6% in snacks and 9% 
in beverages and organic revenue grew 14%. 
Within our emerging markets organic revenue was especially strong in 
Pakistan and the Philippines, with each growing in excess of 20%.
 
Organic revenue grew high teens in Jordan, mid
-
teens in India and Egypt 
and 12
% in Saudi Arabia. We'd like to point out one of our emerging star 
brands in the region, Mountain Dew. It posted another quarter of double
-
digit volume growth in the region, marking the 10th consecutive quarter of 
double
-
digit volume growth in the region. 
And Mountain Dew is now our 
largest carbonated soft drink brand in Pakistan and growing rapidly in India.
 
And China performed especially well, with organic revenue growth of 22% in 
beverages and 23% in snacks. We are particularly pleased with our CSD 
perfo
rmance in China, with year
-
to
-
date volumes up 10%, significantly 
outpacing the category. In addition, our beverage volume grew 24% in the 
Philippine, 13% in the in Pakistan, 11% in India and high single
-
digits in 
Egypt and Saudi Arabia.
 
So overall we feel 
very good about our results in the state of the business. 
However, in any portfolio there are always areas that need some attention. 
So let me cover the two areas that we're especially focused on, North 
American Beverages and Quaker North America. Now, I m
ust say we're 
making good progress at North American Beverages to accelerate 
innovation, improve our marketplace execution and drive productivity to 
improve our competitiveness and profitability. But the fact remains the 
beverage category in the U.S. has i
ts challenges, especially carbonated soft 
drinks. Against this challenging backdrop, we are pleased with the progress 

repositioning our business for long
-
term sustainable growth. We have made 
s
olid progress on brand building and innovation. We have improved 
marketplace execution. We've stepped up productivity, which coupled with 
disciplined pricing drove solid bottom line performance.
 
We are leveraging the strength of the portfolio which is well
 
balanced 
between CSDs and non
-
carbs, and within CSDs we possess the fastest 
growing mainstream brand, Mountain Dew. We will continue to invest in 
breakthrough innovation and new technologies that have the potential to 
reframe the beverage category by remo
ving some of the compromises that 
consumers face with regard to calories and ingredients. In addition as we've 
said in the past, we're also exploring every possible alternative, including 
structural alternatives, to further improve our margins and returns 
in this 
business and we'll provide an update on our efforts in early 2014.
 
The second area is Quaker North America, This is a business with great 
brands, high margins, high returns on capital, and it generates a lot of U.S. 
cash flow. So there is a lot to 
like about this business. But a good deal of 
this business lives in the center of the store and the center of the place, and 
that makes it a challenge to grow especially as consumers increasingly see 
convenience. To be short, we've made good progress in th
is business with 
improved marketing and execution and we've had some recent innovation 
wins.
 
Real Medleys is being extended from a successful new product to a 
successful new brand platform. It's expanding into bars with double
-
digit 
revenue growth and has 
a lot more potential for growth. Plus the 
international Cracker business is doing exceedingly well and grew volume 
5% in Q2. But we're still in the early innings of capturing the full potential of 
this business in North America. We are focusing on driving 
innovation that 
truly excites consumer and for us it's a work in progress and we have the 
right resources and talent dedicated to getting this business on a firmer 
footing.
 
You know the fact that PepsiCo continues to perform well even as it 
addresses these
 
opportunities, speaks to the power of our portfolio. We have 
the products and geographic breadth to participate and thrive in categories 
in markets that are growing and that gives us the flexibility to address all 
opportunities in a sensible, responsible 
way without disrupting our overall 
financial results. So, as we look ahead to the balance of the year we are 
confident in our ability to achieve our full year 2013 financial goal. And as 
we look beyond 2013, we believe we're positioned well to deliver our 
long
-
term financial goals which we believe will translate top tier shareholder 
returns on a sustainable basis.
 
With that, let me turn the call over to Hugh. Hugh?
 
Hugh Johnston
 
Great. Thanks, Indra, and again good morning, everyone. I will spend just a 
minute covering the financial results and guidance in a little bit more detail 
and then we will open up the lines for your questions.
 
For Q2, organic volume grew 3% in snacks and 1.5% in beverages. Organic 
revenue grew 4.2%. Our core gross margins improved
 
by about 120 basis 
points and we increased A&M expense by 13%. Core operating margin 
improved by 120 basis points and core constant currency operating profit 
grew 11%. As we've previously disclosed and mentioned in the release, we 
realized $137 million pr
e
-
tax gain on our Vietnam refranchising and 
incrementally invested $46 million pre
-
tax in the quarter. Excluding the 
impact of the Vietnam gain in incremental investments, core operating 
margin improved by 60 basis points and core constant currency operati
ng 
profit grew by 8%.
 
Our core effective tax rate was 24.5%, approximately 335 basis points below 
Q2 2012. And core constant currency EPS grew 19% and 13% % excluding 
the Vietnam gain and incremental investment. So, between core constant 
currency division 
operating profit growth of 11% and core constant currency 
EPS growth of 19%, we got about 8 points of leverage. About 1.5 points of 
that came from net interest expense, 5 points came from tax rate which will 
reverse in the second half as we're forecasting 
the full year tax rate to come 
in at approximately 27%, and 1 point from weighted average share count 
which was down 1% year
-
on
-
year. Overall, the quarter came in as expected 
with pricing actions, commodity inflation and productivity all in line with our 
e
xpectations.
 
On a reported basis, net revenue was up 2% and that was driven by a 1.5 
point drag from ForEx and 1 point negative impact from structural change 
reflecting the China and Vietnam re
-
franchisings. We generated over $3 
billion in cash flow from o
perations in the first half, a $1.8 billion positive 
swing versus last year. This was driven by lower pension contributions and 
strong working capital improvements. Management operating cash flow, 
excluding certain items was more than $2.3 billion, an incr
ease of 
approximately $1 billion over the first half of last year. And we returned over 
$2.7 billion to shareholders in the first half in the form of dividends and 
share repurchases.
 
Turning to guidance. For 2013, we expect core constant currency EPS 
growt
h of 7% off a core 2012 base of $4.10. We expect organic revenue 
growth of mid
-
single
-
digits, core constant currency operating profit growth 
of approximately 6%, approximately 1 point of leverage below the operating 
profit line driven by share repurchases 
and we expect our core effective tax 
rate to be approximately 27% for the full year. Within these expectations, 
we assume positive price mix, low single
-
digit commodity inflation and 
productivity of $900 million. Our productivity assumption is completely i
n 
line with the three year, $3 billion program that we launched last year and 
the savings will be used to help offset inflation as well as provide funding for 
investments back into the business.
 
One of our key investment areas is supporting our brands with
 
advertising 
and marketing where we'll grow our A&M investment at least in line with 
sales, meaning you should expect A&M spending of at least 5.7% of net 
revenue which was our 2012 base line investment. In addition, we're also 
accelerating our investment 
in R&D and in innovation. You should also take 
into account that we intend to incrementally invest the balance of the 
Vietnam gain in the second half of the year which will impact operating profit 
growth and margins. We expect the full year operating profi
t impact of the 
gain to be offset by incremental investments.
 
Regarding ForEx, based on current market consensus, we anticipate foreign 
exchange translation to have an approximately 1 point negative impact on 
our net revenue and a 2 point negative impact o
n operating profit and EPS 
for the full year, including the impact of the Venezuela devaluation. Our full 
year ForEx outlook for EPS is 1 point more negative than what we shared 
with you on the Q1 call, which is an incremental $0.04 versus where we 
were at
 
the end of Q1. As we anticipate structural changes driven by China 
and Vietnam, we will have a negative impact of approximately 1 point on a 
full year on our net revenue growth. Overall, we're pleased with how the 
second quarter and first half came in.
 
Fo
r the full year, we are maintaining our constant currency guidance. The 
world remains a volatile place and we may also choose to incrementally 
invest in additional long
-
term value building initiatives such as advertising, 
innovation and in emerging markets
 
growth capacity. As you model out the 
third quarter, we expect foreign exchange translation to have up to a 
negative 0.5 point impact on third quarter revenue and 1 point impact on 
EPS based on current market consensus rates. We expect revenue in the 
thir
d quarter will have an estimated one
-
half of percentage point negative 
impact from structural changes due to the Vietnam re
-
franchising.
 
Division operating profit will be impacted by commodity cost inflations 
sequentially higher than in the first half as w
e expected. Incremental 
investments funded by the Vietnam gain, increased A&M expense and 
negative ForEx. Below the division operating profit line, corporate costs in 
Q3 will be above Q2 levels based on the timing of investments, primarily in 
R&D. Net inte
rest expense will increase sequentially from Q2, reflecting 
primarily higher rates. And our tax rate will be significantly higher than our 
half one tax rate as we trend toward our full year estimated tax rate of 
approximately 27%.
 
From a cash flow prospect
ive, we expect full year core management 
operating cash flow, excluding certain items, of more than $7 billion. We'll 
continue to drive cash flow through an even more efficient working capital 
management program and continued tight controls over capital sp
ending. 
And for 2013, we expect to see continued improvement in our key working 
capital metrics and to manage net capital spending to approximately $3 
billion which is well within our long
-
term target of less than or equal to 5% 
of net revenue . As a resul
t, we'll continue to return strong cash flow to our 
shareholders.
 
In total, we expect to return approximately $6.4 billion to shareholders in 
2013. $3.4 billion in dividends and $3 billion in share repurchases. Our 
outlook for 2013 is unchanged from our la
st call and it's consistent with our 
long
-
term targets for net revenue, operating profit and core constant 
currency EPS. We expect to drive improved full year margins and net ROIC, 
and generating and returning cash flow to our shareholders remains a top 
pr
iority for the company.
 
Operator, we will take the first question.

(Operator Instructions) Our first question is coming from John Faucher from 
JPMorgan.
 
John Faucher

Hugh, I want to talk a little about the gr
oss margin. You talked about sort of 
more cost pressures flowing through in the back half. I'm assuming some of 
that's sort of corn in the cadence of the hedging and things like that, as well 
as may be some of the shorter term raw material impacts. Can you
 
talk 
about how you see that playing out a little bit further forward? Will there be 
a corn benefit at some point over the next 12 to 18 months, do you see that 
roll out? And can you talk just about what you're seeing on sort of the resin 
side as well as s
ome of the more chemical or petroleum based raw 
materials? Thanks.
 
Hugh Johnston
 
Yeah. Sure, John, happy to. Again a lot of the impact that we're seeing is, 
we were in the first half overlapping a higher inflation from 2012 and we're 
lapping lower inflatio
n in the back half of 2012. As to the commodities, it's 
really a combination of a couple of areas. Some of it is in the whole Ag 
complex and corn obviously is a piece of that, and some of that is also PET 
as well in the back half, again driven more by the 
overlaps than anything 
else. It will be roughly even between Q3 and Q4 and it should play out as we 
mentioned earlier. Regarding 2014, it's really premature to comment on 
that. We're still six months away from that. We try not to get into 2014 until 
we get
 
to the guidance on that and for me to just start talking about pieces 
of it probably wouldn't be beneficial to do right now. So, we'll hold on that 
until we get to our Q4 call in next February.

Our next question comes from the line of Bryan Spill
ane from Bank of 
America.
 
Unidentified Analyst
 
Hi this is [Maria Golop], good morning. I'd like to ask about the Vietnam 
gain. So it's giving you some incremental funds to spend. You previously had 
a funding budget for 2013 and this adds to it. So my quest
ion really is, sort 
of what type of specific activities are you spending on and in what 
geographies? And then related to that, why shouldn't we expect sort of an 
incremental boost to sales in the near term from these investment activities?
 
Indra Nooyi
 
Hugh
, you want to?
 
Hugh Johnston
 
Yeah, I would be happy to handle that. So where you're going to see us 
invested is largely in international and it will be geared towards top line 
driving types of activities. Now when we do these things they typically 
don't 
pay back immediately, you typically see the payback in one to two year 
types of time frames. So I wouldn't necessarily expect to see a short term 
acceleration in revenue driven by all of that. What we're really doing here is 
extending both the durati
on and the durability of our strong top
-
line growth 
as well as flowing it ultimately through to stronger bottom
-
line growth. So 
we feel these are the right decisions to make for the franchise as well as to 
enhance and solidify our operating performance.

Our next question comes from the line of Caroline Levy with CLSA.
 
Caroline Levy

I just wondered if you could comment since your international and even your 
domestic quarter ends a little earlier than many other companies on how 
June looks and
 
just volume wise, particularly in beverages if you still face 
huge challenges that then carry through to the third quarter giving you some 
pause on any recovery in beverage volumes looking out this year
 
Indra Nooyi
 
Caroline, we don't really comment on one
 

talk more about it in our Q3 call.
 
Operator
 
Our next question comes from the line of Dara Mohsenian with Morgan 
Stanley.
 
Dara Mohsenian 

 
Morgan Stanley
 
Indra, you mentioned in your remarks that you're looking for ways to dr
ive 
margin improvement on the beverage side of the business and obviously the 
strategic piece of that you probably will be hesitant to comment on. But I 
was hoping you could comment on what you can do internally to boost 
beverage margins as you look out ov
er the next few years. And as you look 
at that business, do you think the lower margin structure that exists versus 
beverage or CPG peers in general, is that more due to structural reasons 
such as scale et cetera? Or are there significant cost savings oppo
rtunities 
you can go after internally on that business beyond what you've already 
outlined?
 
Indra Nooyi
 

when I was talking about margin improvement opportunities I was talking 
about Nor
th American beverages. Just roughly speaking, our franchise 
business has got much better margins than an operating business in the 
beverage world, because you've got the entire cost line to work with. I think 
in the North American beverage business, as we'
ve mentioned before Dara, 
we've been investing in many technologies, whether it's processing 
technology, packaging technology, ingredient technology and one
-
by
-
one 
some of these technologies are beginning to start being commercialized. So 
as we look at our
 

[branch] of productivity, some of that next branch of productivity is from 
North American beverages. And that comes from some of these technologies 
beginning to get implemented in the marketplace. And t
hat's what gives us 
confidence that there are opportunities to improve margin performance.
 

combination of the new innovation coming to the marketplace driving top
-
line in a category that ha
s slowed down a lot. But our goal is to use the 
power of our portfolio to drive the top
-
line growth. Coupled with these new 
technologies and different ways of working within North America to improve 
the productivity of the operations is what gives us confi
dence that we can 
improve the margins in North American Beverages.

Our final question comes from the line of Bill Schmitz with Deutsche Bank.
 
Bill Schmitz

Deutsche Bank
 
Hey, can you just elaborate a little bit more, just update us on the 
acquisi
tion strategy. I think you're still sticking with just smaller niche fields 
that fill in strategic holes. And then maybe just some commentary on some 
of the noise recently in the press.
 
Indra Nooyi
 

emely well 
architected portfolio geographically. From a product perspective, we are 
hitting our stride. Every part of the business is functioning well and we do 
not need large scale M&A to deliver on our financial goals. We do have a 
strategy to focus on t
uck
-

-
in acquisitions 
in any year will be $500 million or less. And that's all we are focused on. And 
I would look beyond the noise and let's just focus on PepsiCo and the 
performance of the company. And we feel very good
 
about it. Thank you, 
Bill.
 
So thank you all for your questions. In closing, let me just say that our 
performance for the second quarter and through first half of 2013 are 
excellent indications of how our well constructed and developed portfolio, 
coupled w
ith disciplined execution reinvestment, can drive high quality top 
and bottom line results on a sustainable basis. That is the purpose of 
PepsiCo. And I thank you for your time this morning and for the confidence 

Have a great day.

Conference Call. Your lines have been placed on listen
-
only until the 
question

and

recorded and will be archived at 
www.pepsico.com.
 
It is now my pleasure to introduce Mr. Jamie Caulfield, Senior Vice President 
of Investor Relations. Mr. Caulfield, you may begin.
 
Jamie Caulfield
 

and Hugh 


to Q&A. In an effort to get to as many analyst questions as possible within 
the hour, we have kept our prepared rema
rks relatively short this morning, 
and we are going to have a one question limit, so we should be able to get 
through the full queue of analysts when we get to the Q&A.
 
Before we begin, please take note of our cautionary statement. This 
conference call inc
ludes forward
-
looking statements, including statements 
regarding 2013 guidance and our long
-
term targets based on currently 
available information. Forward
-
looking statements inherently involve risks 
and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to 
differ materially from 
those predicted in such forward
-
looking statements. Statements made on 
this conference call should be considered together with cautionary 

in our most recent p
eriodic reports filed with the SEC.
 
Unless otherwise indicated all references to EPS and total operating profit 
growth are on a core basis. In addition, references to organic revenue 
results in this call exclude the impact of acquisitions and divestitures,
 
structural changes and foreign exchange translation. To find disclosures and 
reconciliations of non
-
GAAP measures that we may use when discussing 


lease and to the Investors section 

our results today, please keep in mind that our Q3 reporting period reflects 
the 12 weeks ended September 7 for our North America businesses and the
 
months of June, July and August for the vast majority of our businesses 
outside North America.

Thank you, Jamie and good morning everyone. I am pleased to report good 
results for the third quarte
r despite significant volatility experienced in a 
couple of our AMEA region markets. From a top line perspective, our 
business largely maintained the top line momentum we saw in the first half 
and our year
-
to
-
date and expected full year organic revenue gro
wth is right 
in line with our long
-
term mid
-
single
-

Our organic revenue growth reflected each of the four business units 
achieving positive net price realization in the quarter and we had particularly 
good organic revenue growth at Frit

digits. And this 
was both in the quarter and year

revenue growth both in the quarter and year

9% organic revenue growth both in the quarter and year

Turkey, where we had 7% organic revenue growth in the quarter and 9%

beverage volume grew 1% on an organic basis globally both in the quarter 
and year

Our international beverage volume growth was strong, up 4% on an organic 
basis in the quarter and 5% year
-
to

date. Operating performance wa
s solid. 
We had good gross profit flow through with core gross margins improving 70 
basis points in the quarter. We improved core operating margin even as we 
continued to invest in A&M with A&M as a percent of sales up 40 basis points 
and we made increment
al marketplace investments of almost $30 million as 
part of the incremental investment program we announced last quarter. In 
addition our three year productivity program remains on track; we project 
delivering $900 million of productivity in 2013 and expec
t to deliver the full 
3 billion three year target by year end 2014.
 
Our productivity is funding our growth initiative and is contributing to our 

value chain through the acceleration o
f global procurement initiatives and 
coordination of our global supply chain which in turn is enabled by the 
investments we have made over the past decade in our SAP platform.

As you all know the macro environment continues to be challenging. 
Developed markets remain sluggish and emerging markets are 
volatile 
particularly those experiencing political and civil unrest. In challenging times 
such as these it's especially important to stay focused on execution and 

sustainable perfo
rmance. Additionally, we have performed well because our 
portfolio of brands are extensive and strong, our products are on trend and 
relatedly diverse. And we have a broad geographic footprint, let me talk to 
each. Our brand portfolio as you know has been 
well architected. We have a 
great line
-
up of iconic brands that cover everything from treat to healthy 
eats. Our brands worldwide stands for safety, quality, taste and affordability. 

investm
ents have resulted in even stronger brand equity scores.
 
More importantly the strength of our innovation, design capabilities and 
revenue management skills which are all foundational building blocks are 
applied across our categories to sustain top
-
line gro
wth and profitability. 
Just to give you some examples, in innovation we had six of the top 25 new 
food and beverage product introductions across all measured U.S. retail 
channels year
-
to
-
date and we have seven new products this year that are on 
pace to ach
ieve $100 million each in annual retail sales in the United States, 
Mountain Dew KickStart, Tostitos Cantina, Quaker Medleys platform which 
has been expanded to ready
-
to
-
eat cereals and bars, Starbucks Iced Coffee, 
Lipton Pure Leaf Tea, Muller Quaker Yogur
t and Gatorade Frost Glacier 
Cherry. We continue to see positive results from my investments in 
innovation. Innovation as a percentage of net revenue is more than 8% 
year
-
to
-
date, a 100% basis point improvement year
-
over
-
year. We have 
recently opened our i
nnovation design center and they are looking to 
increase the pace and incrementality of innovation with more reframed and 
breakthrough innovation as we move forward.
 
In addition our geographic footprint allows us to fully capitalize in the 
diversity of our
 
portfolio including the solid top
-
line performance, high 
margins, high returns and healthy cash flows of our developed market with a 
high top
-
line growth and future marginal return expansion potential of 
emerging and developing markets as we drive greater
 
scale by fully 
capitalizing on the related diversity of the portfolio.
 

or the number two food and beverage supplier and this scale is so important 

tailers competition for share of the shoppers 
basket and manufacturers competition for share of retail sales is 
intensifying. The scale, ubiquity and related velocity of our categories make 
us an essential partner for retailers and consequently we relied u
pon to drive 

increasingly seek us out for joint business planning activities to explore 
mutual creative ways to drive our respective businesses. So all the benefits 
of our scale and prod
uct and geographic portfolios enable us to deal with 
headwinds and capitalize on the tailwinds within categories and across 
geographies.
 
So with that as a background, overall our business is on track and we are 
pleased with the progress we have made streng
thening our competitive 
position across our key developed, developing and emerging markets. We 
have managed the business as a portfolio and we have remained highly 
disciplined in our approach leveraging our combined scale and capabilities to 
build sustaina
ble value rather than overreacting to short
-
term pricing 
pressures or local value brand initiatives. As a result over the past six 
quarters in both salty snacks and beverages, we have seen increases in 
aggregate market share for our top strategic internati
onal markets that 
account for approximately 80% of our total international business. And year
-
to
-
date in the United States, we have grown value share at Frito
-
Lay and 
sequentially improve the value share in beverages even as we have 
outpaced the industry i
n net price realization at retail.
 
Let me comment now on our individual operating segments. Each of our 
businesses performed well financially and the marketplace in Q3. Just to give 
you some highlights. At Frito
-
Lay North America, we generated 3% volume 
gr
owth and mid
-
single
-
digit organic revenue growth with 2 points of net 
price realizations and the performance was very balanced with volume and 
revenue performance positive across each major U.S. channels. We gained 
value, volume and unit share in salty sna
cks in the quarter and year
-
to
-
date. 
We expanded core operating margins by about 25 basis points in the quarter 
and 35 basis points year
-
to
-
date even as we increased advertising and 
marketing expense.
 
Our advertising initiative was focused on our core bran
ds, for example, 

TV, digital and social media and was supported by new Doritos logo and 
updated packaging. And our Lays 75 and Sunny campaign sort of celebrated 
75 summers of Lays and 
we continued to capitalize on a highly successful 
consumer driven Do Us a Flavor campaign with a winner Cheesy Garlic Bread 
launched at retail in Q3. And our innovation continues to perform well led by 
Tostitos Cantina, Doritos Jacked Ranch Dipped Hot Wing

Ups,

Lay North America.
 

you some perspective in the North American beverage industry, which is 
much watched and mu
ch talked about. First, the beverage category in North 
America remains the largest category in food and beverages here in the 

relevant to retailers and is one of the first cat
egories retailers look to when 
overall growth slows. As many of you know, the LRB category has slowed 
and the shift from the CSDs to non
-
carbonated beverages has accelerated. 
CSD is now comprised approximately 40% of the U.S. LRB category volume 
versus app
roximately more than 50% a decade ago. We have a competitive 
position in CSDs and we have a very strong leadership position in the faster 
growing non
-
carbonated beverages. This advantage enables us to hold or 
grow overall measured channel LRB value share a
s we manage the 
challenges of the CSD category in a responsible and sustainable way. Our 
strategy is to compete on the basis of innovation and marketing and to 
manage the business responsibly and profitably. We are convinced this is the 
right strategy to i
ncrease shareholder value given category realities. And as 
we have said in the past, we continued to explore the potential for structural 
changes in our North American beverage business to create further value. 
So we continued to achieve attractive net pri
ce realization as we 
simultaneously invest in brands and R&D.
 
So with this as the backdrop, let me now talk about our performance at 

We achieved another quarter of solid net price re
alization with net price 
realization up 3 points. In the U.S. our LRB value share slightly out 
performed our primary competitor and measured channels lead by our 
advantage non
-
carb portfolio with value share gains and ready to drink 
sports drink and chille
d juice. Our retail pricing in LRB and in CSDs led 
overall pricing in those categories and our key new product launches are 
performing very well. Mountain Dew KickStart, a product targeting morning 
energy needs of Millennials is expected to significantly e
xceed a $100 million 
in the first year retail sales. Capitalizing and momentum of the morning 
platform, we will be expanding Kickstart as an evening energy occasion in 
early 2014. Lipton Pure Leaf Premium Tea continues to perform well and has 
reached a 9% 
value share and ready to drink tea and is also on track to 
exceed a $100 million in retail sales in its first year. Tropicana Farmstand is 
a delicious chilled 100% juice of one serving of fruit plus one serving of 

 
well and Starbucks Iced Coffee is 
performing ahead of expectations, it has reached a 7.5% value share 
position ready to drink coffee and is on pace to achieve approximately a 
$100 million in retail sales in it's first year.
 
And of course our businesses, w
e continue to sharpen how we leverage our 
scale and capabilities to drive incremental value. As a focus and integrated 
food and beverage company we are able to better serve our consumers and 
retail customers by providing unique value to them through powerf
ul 
properties like the NFL. Our partnership with the NFL continues to be among 

partnership to the NFL to a new level with NFL activations that include Pepsi, 
Gatorade, Tostitos, Quake
r, Tropicana, Aquafina and Sabra brands.
 
Let me now move on to developing and emerging markets, organic revenue 
grew 9% in the quarter. Most of our developing and emerging market 
continue to perform well. As we build our business by driving greater 
penetra
tion. Organic snacks volume increased 4% in developing and 
emerging markets in the quarter led by particularly strong growth in China 
which is our 15%, Pakistan of 23%, and Turkey which grew 11% just to 
name a few. Year
-
to
-
date organic snacks volume in dev
eloping and 
emerging markets also grew 4% led by double digit growth in China and 
Pakistan and high single digit growth in Egypt, Turkey, South Africa and 

responsible way by focusing on prof
itable growth in segments where brands 
and quality matter.
 
Organic beverage volume grew 4.5% in developing and emerging markets 
led by double digit growth in China, Philippines, Pakistan, Poland and South 
Africa. Year
-
to
-
date organic beverage volume in dev
eloping and emerging 
markets grew 5.5% led by double digit growth in China, Philippines, Pakistan 

important markets and excited by the long term growth prospects they 
present. We have b
uilt extremely strong businesses across every important 
developing and emerging market, in large part by leverage the presence of 
the beverage businesses we established decades ago. So for example today 
we have an integrated food and beverage business in U
kraine with sales 

in the Middle
-
East and along with our partner Tingyi has the number one 
beverage business in China. As we continue to drive greater consumer 
penetration frequency i
n these markets we build scale which makes us more 
efficient. This allows us to continue to invest in these markets and at the 
same time increase our operating margins. However as we mentioned in our 
earnings release there was a meaningful slowdown in the 
third quarter in our 
businesses in Egypt and India which accounts for the deceleration of organic 
revenue in AMEA from the double digit rate of growth we saw in the first half 
of the year.
 

 

to note early trends in Q4 have improved. The potential for volatility 
especially in developing and emerging markets is in part why we provide 
annual but not quarterly targets. Th
e important thing to remember is that 
we fully expect to achieve a mid
-
single digit organic revenue growth goal for 

to deliver our long
-
term financial goals, which we believe will t
ranslate to top 
tier total shareholder return on a sustainable basis.
 
With that, let me turn the call over to Hugh. Hugh?
 
Hugh Johnston
 
Great, thanks Indra. I will spend just a minute covering the financial results 
and guidance in a little more 
detail and then we will open up the lines to 
your questions. For Q3, organic volume grew 3% in snacks and 1% in 
beverages. Organic revenue grew 3.3%. Commodity inflation was up low 
single
-
digits. Our core gross margins improved by about 70 basis points and
 
we increased A&M expense by 8%. Core constant currency operating profit 
grew 3%. Incremental investments totaled $28 million pre
-
tax in the 
quarter. Excluding the impact of incremental investments, core constant 
currency operating profit grew 4%.
 
Our core
 
effective tax rate was 25.5%, approximately 80 basis points below 
Q3 2012. And core constant currency EPS grew 5% and 6% excluding the 
incremental investment. So between core constant currency division 
operating profit growth of 3% and core constant curre
ncy EPS growth of 5%, 
we got about 1.5 points of leverage including nearly a point of de
-
leverage 
from higher net interest expense, 1 point of leverage from a lower tax rate 
which will reverse in the fourth quarter as we are forecasting the full year 
core 
effective tax rate to come in at approximately 27% and 1 point from 
weighted average share count, which was down 1% year
-
on
-
year. Overall, 
the quarter came in largely as expected with pricing actions, commodity 
inflation and productivity all in line with o
ur expectations.
 
On a reported basis, net revenue was up 1.5% reflecting over a 1 point drag 
from foreign exchange and about a 0.5 point negative impact from the 
Vietnam refranchising. We generated over $6.6 billion in cash flow from 
operations year
-
to
-
dat
e, an improvement of $1.5 billion versus last year. 
This was driven by lower pension contributions and strong working capital 
improvements. Year
-
to
-
date management operating cash flow excluding 
certain items was approximately $5.5 billion, an increase of a
pproximately 
12% year
-
over
-
year reflecting the growth in earnings, disciplined capital 
expenditure investment and continued improvement in working capital 
management. And we returned $4.6 billion to shareholders year
-
to
-
date in 
the form of dividends and sh
are repurchases.
 
Now, turning to guidance, consistent with what we have said throughout this 
year, for the full year 2013, we expect core constant currency EPS growth of 
7% off of a core 2012 base of $4.10. And consistent with our previous 
guidance, we exp
ect mid
-
single
-
digit organic revenue growth, core constant 
currency operating profit growth of approximately 6%, approximately 1 
point of leverage below the operating profit line driven by share repurchases 
and we expect our core effective tax rate to be a
pproximately 27% for the 
full year. Within these expectations, we assume positive price mix, low 
single
-
digit commodity inflation and productivity of $900 million. Our 
productivity assumption is completely in line with the three
-
year $3 billion 
program tha
t we launched last year and the savings will be used to help 
offset inflation as well as provide funding for investment back into the 
business.
 
And as we mentioned on the last conference call, you should also take into 
account that we intend to incremental
ly invest the balance of the Vietnam 
gain in the balance of year, which will impact operating profit growth and 
margins. Regarding foreign exchange based on current market consensus, 
we anticipate foreign exchange translation to have approximately a 2 poin
t 
negative impact on our net revenue and at least a 2 point negative impact 
on operating profit and EPS for the full year including the impact of the 
Venezuela devaluation. As we anticipate structural changes driven by China 

ive impact of approximately 1 point on our 
full year net revenue growth. As a reminder the world remains a volatile 
place as evidenced in our AMEA region this quarter. Despite the volatility we 
continue to expect investments in long term value building ini
tiatives such as 
advertising, innovation, and in emerging markets growth capacity. As you 
model out the fourth quarter these are our expectations, foreign exchange 
translation should have an appropriate three point unfavorable impact on 
fourth quarter reve
nue and upto a four point unfavorable impact on fourth 
quarter EPS based on current market consensus rates. Revenue in the fourth 
quarter will have an estimated 1.5 of a percentage point negative impact 

chising. Division 
operating profit will be impacted by higher sequential commodity cost 
inflation as we had expected, incremental investments funded by the Q2 
Vietnam gain increasing A&M expense and negative foreign exchange. Below 
the division operating p
rofit line corporate cost in Q4 will be above prior year 
levels based on the timing of investments primarily in R&D.
 
Net interest expense will increase versus last year primary reflecting higher 
rates. And our tax rate will be significantly higher in Q4 as
 
we approach our 
full year estimated rate of approximately 27%. From a cash flow perspective 
we expect full year core management operating cash flow excluding certain 
items of more than $7 billion. We will continue to drive cash flow through an 
even more e
fficient working capital management and continued tight 
controls over capital spending. And for the full year 2013 we expect to see 
continued improvement in our key working capital metrics and to manage 
net capital spending to approximately $3 billion whic
h is well within our long 
term target of less than or equal to 5% of net revenue.
 
As a result we will continue to return strong cash flow to our shareholders. 
In total we expect to return approximately $6.4 billion to shareholders in 
2013, $3.4 billion in 
dividends and 3 billion in share repurchases. Net our 
outlook for 2013 is unchanged from our last call and it's consistent with our 
long term targets for net revenue, operating profit and core constant 
currency EPS. We expect to drive improved full year ma
rgins and net ROIC 
and disciplined capital allocation coupled with returning cash to our 
shareholders remained a top priority for the company. With that operator we 
will take the first question.

profitability in the quarter the margins held up you know
 
pretty consistent 
with last year even despite the volume declines and understanding that 
there is some price that help that, could you talk a little bit more about the 

much prod
uctivity is actually helping most margins and maybe connected to 

structure of that business as we all begin thinking about you know whether 
you refranchise or do something structural
ly different with the business 
going forward, just trying to understand I guess what types of changes 

what we would have known before you put it together?
 
Indra Nooyi
 

m going to answer the second part of the question and then 
Hugh is going to answer the first part of the question. So you know when we 
talked to you about structural options way back in February of 2012 we said 
we would look at range of structural options,
 
JVs, collaborations, any sort of 
structural separation we look at every option and at the end of the day we 
will do something that makes sense for PepsiCo for the beverage business 
globally and for North American beverage business. So we want to approach 
this in a very sensible way because buying, spinning, buying, spinning is lot 
of sustainable way to run any business especially one that has terrific 
possibility and generates extraordinary U.S. cash flow and more importantly 
houses some of our most import
ant global beverage brands. So we are 
approaching this in a very, very sensible way and we are looking at every 
structural option possible that will allow us to manage the global beverage 
business in a sensible way, not jeopardized PepsiCo overall by any s
ort of 

-
term shareholder value 
creating. So we are looking at fundamental operational improvements in the 
North American beverage business also.
 
And our strategy has been very simple focus on innovation, f
ocus on R&D 
investments to create disruptive innovation so that we can get incrementally 


important t
o retailers, but in 2012 second half and 2013, it did go through a 

price. This category has been competing on price for years. And last couple 
of years, we have been trying our best 
to become a lot more disciplined and 

what we have been doing. So with that here, let me turn it to Hugh to talk 
about the mix between pricing and productivity and everything else 
in 
between.
 
Hugh Johnston
 
Yes, sure, happy to do that, Indra. Good morning, Bryan. If you look at the 
margin performance, you really do have to look at it from three 
perspectives. First is from kind of net pricing in the marketplace and from 
that perspecti

in it, we do believe the right and responsible way to manage this category is 
for us to be very consistent in taking that price. We have been consistently 
articulate about that over the couple 
of years. And I think if you look back at 
our performance, we have consistently led the industry in ensuring that we 
do take that net price and we have taken in an appropriate and responsible 

 
Driver number two is net reven
ue management. We have gotten more 
sophisticated on that over the course of the last couple of years. I think 

into PepsiCo. And I would look at it from two perspectives. One is pac
kage 
management, where the array of packages that we have and the opportunity 
to extract incremental margin from those packages has actually increased 
substantially compared to where we were three or four years ago, where we 
were much more heavily focused 
on just 2
-
liters and 12
-
packs. And then 
second from a channel management perspective, I think we have gotten 
much more granular using technology and much more specific in the way 
that we price cross channels in a manner that allows us to also drive margin.
 
The third area as you mentioned is productivity. There is little question that 

you think about the way that we historically looked at productivity, it was a 
very manufacturing c
entric point of view in terms of consistent year
-
over
-
year productivity and then episodically there would be productivity coming 

doing any of that, but I think what we have added t
o it are a couple of 
components. Number one, value engineering, we have gotten much more 
sophisticated in terms of our use of materials. And as a result of that, we 
have really doubled the impact of value engineering, which is essentially two 
things. Numbe
r one, using less of a commodity or number two substituting 
commodities to enable us to get better productivity out of the prettier [ph] 
goods that we get. So our value engineering capability has stepped up 
substantially. Number two is the distribution sys
tem. I think typically in the 

have clearly gotten a lot sharper on that both from the standpoint of labor 
management and in addition to that using technology in the warehouse. 
T



driving the solid margin impr
ovement in the phase of what are obviously a 
not growing category right now.
 
Indra Nooyi
 


category. Th
e velocity of this business is somewhere between 40 and 80 
turns a year. So it is the retailer who generates an enormous amount of 


the industry to margins range 
from low to mid
-


American beverage business, which actually is a pretty damn good busin
ess 
today in terms of generating U.S. cash and profitability. So I would frame 
that with that context.

Our next question comes from the line of John Faucher with JPMorgan.
 
John Faucher

JPMorgan
 
You highlighted the $30 million of I believe it's $
30 million of extra spending 
in Q3 related to the gain, can you give us a little bit more of an indication in 
terms of where those investments are going, you know are you still planning 
on spending the full gain back as we look into the fourth quarter and 
you 


 
Hugh Johnston
 

areas, number one is whe


AMEA region then you will anywhere else so some of it clearly plays back 
into the developed markets as well. The secondary where we have chos
en to 
make investments is in the growth markets and it's largely going to be in 
opportunities to expand distribution, leveraging cooler, leveraging racks 
again to enable us to further accelerate our growth and to create further 
advantage in those markets w
hich obviously still have lots of growth 
potential left in them. Regarding your question about doing tend to fully 
spend back the gain the answer is absolutely yes. We intend to fully spend 
back again. So the investments are really going fundamentally to w
hat we 
believe are the volume and growth and ultimately shareholder value creating 
drivers for the business. We think they are good investments for 
shareholders for the long run and we feel quite comfortable in making them 

get a good return on them. In terms of 
timing typically those types of investments have about a 1 to 2 year 
payback.

Your next question comes from the line of Ali Dibadj with Bernstein.
 
Ali Dibadj

Bernstein
 
I did want to focus a little bit 
more on PB so just mid
-
single digits decline 
okay you can there are a lot of reasons for that potential one can argue but 
the non
-

is really your internal plan giving some of the indust

described as substitution into non
-
carbs. And in particular where there any 
bright spots in non
-

step back can you say okay look going forward sounds like pricing 
aggressiveness i
s behind us competitively on the safety front what should 
we think about both the non
-
carb and the CSD business growing going 
forward for you?
 
Hugh Johnston
 
Regarding non
-
carbs I actually think they were quite a number of bright 
spots, we have seen year
-
to
-
date the Gatorade business continued to 
perform very well. It's been gaining share, we certainly feel good about 
where Gatorade is and even more importantly feel good about the fact that 
we have repositioned the business very strongly for within consumers


number one. Number two the ready to drink tea business is certainly doing 
quite well in particular Lipton Pure Leaf, the innovation that we have had 
there both in terms of the 
smaller and the larger packages is performing 
extremely well and that business is now back on track in terms of market 
share.
 
The chilled juice business as well both in terms of Tropicana as well as the 

op50 all continued to 

-
carb 
number the volume as we mentioned was a low single digit decline, the real 
challenge therefore is in the packaged water business, we look at that 
business as somethi
ng that is scale enabler but we also look at it as a 



usly going to be in the 
space with our distribution system, we will continue to sell packaged water 
but it's not a priority for us from an investment perspective. So as you see 
the balance of the market at various times choose to invest in bottled water 
of

numbers swing in overall non
-
carbs because the water category is so big. 
What it will do though is significantly impact our profitability. So I think we 
certainly feel good about non
-
car
bs from that perspective. On the CSD front 
I think the biggest thing that we feel very good about right now is Mountain 
Dew. The Mountain Dew franchise is performing terrifically well in the United 
States. We feel good about the base Dew business, the Diet
 
Dew business 
has been performing extremely well. And I think one of the things we are 
most heartened by is Mountain Dew really travels well to international 
markets, whether you look at India, whether you look at China, the Dew 
franchise is clearly a glob
al franchise and we feel terrific about that.
 
Regarding your question on what the future of CSD growth is, very hard to 
estimate, obviously, we have taken a perspective that by virtue of investing 
in R&D around package and around products specifically swee
tener, we think 
that will benefit the category. The important thing I think from our 
perspective is we have got an LRB portfolio that works really well. We think 
we have an advantage set of brands. So regardless of where the overall LRB 
market goes, we do 
feel like we will be competitively well positioned by 
virtue of the portfolio that we built over the course of 10 or so years.
 
Indra Nooyi
 
But there is no question that there has been an industry dynamic which has 
seen a shift away from CSDs to non
-
carbs a
nd we have talked about that 

potentially settle at that number.

health and wellness concerns and wha
t are the strategies to combat those 
issues going forward? You sounded optimistic that innovation could help 

update on the innovation side. And then on the pricing side, appreciat
ing the 
focus on disciplined pricing, but you did see a mid
-
single
-
digit volume 
decline on the CSD side in North America in the quarter. So do you think 
that pricing balance has gotten out of whack at all versus competitors might 
you need to make some adju
stments going forward? And also can you give 
us an update on promotional levels in the industry post the Labor Day 
discounting and if you are seeing any improvement?
 
Indra Nooyi
 
Let me speak to the first part of the question Dara. Couple of years ago, we 
s
tarted to see the decline in full sugar CSDs, no question about that, 
especially in colas, we started to see the decline in full sugar colas and diets 
were holding up. Recently especially in the last, I would say, six months to 
nine months, there has been 
an accelerated decline in diet drinks as people 


sweeteners, they want to go back to sugar in some cases. So we are seein
g 
a fundamental shift in consumer habits and behaviors. We anticipated some 
of these the diet slowdown has been a little more rapid than we expected. 
The good news is that our overall portfolio as Hugh mentioned is very 
balanced. And our diet 

 
I am sorry 
our Dew consumer likes regular Dew, 
likes Diet Dew, likes Kickstart. So our Dew consumer is very different than 
the consumer for colas and consumer for lemon lime. We are staying on the 
path of innovating along natural sweeteners and thinking about flavori
ng 



got a launch date. Once we h
ave a launch date, you will hear a lot more 
about it. And our goal is to bring to the market a product that tastes great. 



 
Regarding pricing and let me add to that I have mentioned this I think at 
one of the conferences maybe Barclays or something or Bernstein, the 
category has been declining about 3% a year, CSD category, especially in 
the last couple of years.
 

years, we come up with significant disruptive innovation if you want to hold 

news of course is that our portfolio is so diverse not jus
t within beverages, 
but also between beverages, snacks and good
-
for
-
you products that we feel 
incredibly well insulated against any sort of headwinds in this category.
 


 
the industry not just 
PepsiCo,
 
the industry has seen years and years of ridiculous pricing where 
for the last 10th of a share you know there would be a pricing war which has 
impacted the whole category and this has been on for almost a decade and 
that is not the right way to create sha
reholder value in this category. It 
cannot be that one company has you know almost 8 or 9 years of problems 
because of you know destructive pricing habits and then they take a big 
reset and then they start coming up and then the other company has to take 
a
 
reset this kind of back and forth (inaudible) does not work in shareholder 

category dynamics we have to behave in a value creating way in this 


hope that at some point in the overall category there is sensible behavior 
and all of us are focused on sustainable long term shareholder value creation

Our next question co
mes from the line of Caroline Levy with CLSA.
 
Caroline Levy 

 
CLSA
 
Couple of questions, internationally I was just wondering if you could talk to 
us introduce us a little bit to the new head of international after your sad 
loss, and tell us about how the m
oves have been. I believe that he came out 
of India and you know just to give us some confidence in that important 
market that you know your team is strong and I know that [indiscernible] 
also came out of Russia so your two big important markets have proba
bly 
new leadership and then just secondly in your U.S. CSD business, do you 

declines or do you think it just sort of slows declines is this something you 
think will come with some 
premium pricing, will it be truly differentiated, is 
really the question.
 
Indra Nooyi
 
So let me start with our Head of AMEA it's not international it's just Head of 
Asia, Middle
-
East, Africa. You know Saad was an amazing leader and we 
truly miss him but as
 
you know the strength of PepsiCo is that we have very 
good succession plans, literally every position in the company. Sanjeev 
Chadha has been in PepsiCo forever almost 20 years if I recall and started 
his career in PepsiCo India then went on to Asia
-
Pacif
ic was a Commercial 
Director there. From there he came to our Middle
-
East business and was 
running the Middle
-
East business. So essentially he has run every aspect of 
Asia, Middle
-
East, Africa, knows the region very well and is a great successor 
to Saad an

the Asia, Middle
-
East, Africa. He knows snacks, he knows beverages, he 
knows franchise, he knows company owned operations because he has done 
both in India in ASPAC and the Middle
-
East which 
is a big franchise market 
for beverages as well as company owned operations in Jordan and Egypt and 
we have a big company owned snacks business. So Sanjeev is a very 
seasoned executive, has done turnarounds, has done big growth, so I think 
as all of you ge
t introduced to him we will certainly bring him around. I think 
he is going to be very pleased how well the succession has worked. He 
knows everybody in the region, the bottlers, the employees, they all know 

e any issue in the AMEA 
region. Quite a seamless transition. In terms of Europe, Zein was the Sector 
Head for Europe. The good news is Russia we have a phenomenal talent 
base of Russian managers, you know Silviu Popovich who came to us from 
Wimm
-
Bill
-
Dann,
 
[indiscernible] who came to us from bottling business who 
was with PepsiCo before all of these are terrific leaders running our Russian 
business and they in turn report to Ramon Laguarta who has been in 
PepsiCo for decades and Ramon is running the develop
ing markets in Europe 
he has got all of Russia, the FSUs, all the way to Turkey doing very well and 
replacing Zein in Europe is Enderson Guimaraes who came to us out of 
Electrolux, again an executive who ran a big piece of Electrolux comes to us 
with a ver
y different perspective and has managed businesses with 
enormous volatility as you know hard goods, the white goods rather go 
through bigger volatility and economic downturn than any of our staples 
businesses.
 
So Enderson is a seasoned executive in 
that dimension and is adding a lot to 

He is right here down the corridor, so he is always there looking at all of 
these businesses. The good news is that we have a great team in PepsiC
o 
and we take a lot of pain to make sure our succession planning is done well.
 

what we are talking about. In most of the international markets, especially 
in Asia, there is still
 
lots of room for growth. Will our innovations stop the 

keep betting on innovation both for creating breakthrough products and also 
innovation to reduce costs through creative in
gredients. And I think in 

they are spending the money, retail dynamics, etcetera, etcetera, the best 
insulation is to have a diversified portfolio, relatively diverse, not too 
divers
e, but relatively diverse have a great brand portfolio that covers all 
eating and drinking occasions and not be overly dependent on a category 

today. And as we mentioned earlier in the 
notes in our script, our brand 
portfolio is diverse, geographic portfolio is diverse, but most importantly, our 
product portfolio is diverse and CSDs per se in North America is not a 
gigantic driver of our profits. So we feel pretty good about where we sta
nd 
today.

Your next question comes from the line of Judy Hong with Goldman Sachs.

So first on the emerging markets Indra, so obviously many c
ompanies have 
talked about the slowdown that they are seeing in the emerging markets 
and you have talked about the AMEA markets a little bit, but as you think 
about the next 6 to 12 months some of the markets like Russia, China, 
Brazil, can you just give u
s your assessment of how you see those markets 
playing out and whether the differences that you are seeing in snacks versus 
beverages is something to really call out here?
 
And then secondly I just wanted to clarify the comment you have made 
about the North
 
American market and how you think about the structural 
solutions to that market. It sounded to me like on this call, given some of 
volatility that you are seeing in markets outside the U.S. and the increased 

h a lot of the retailers, 
perhaps the sense of urgency in terms of making some of the structural 
solutions may not be there as it was a year or so ago when you made that 
announcement. So I wanted to just clarify if that assessment is appropriate 
or we shou
ld still be thinking about sometime early next year you are 
coming up with a decision on that issue?
 
Indra Nooyi
 
Well, Judy, let me speak to the second one very quickly. As we said we will 
tell you in early next year what we are going to do. And we have to
ld you all 

are looking at structural solutions, but I want to underline sensible, value 
creating structural solutions. So keep that in mind.
 
Let me now come to emerging markets. E
merging markets, emerging and 

where you have got turmoil in the developed markets, I think that tends to 
hail on to emerging markets and that creates more sort of variance around 
t
he mean if you want to call it that. Very quick walkthrough, I think because 
we are on the staples business, the swings in our business are probably 
going to be less than swings you might see in hard goods or, white goods or 
durables. The thing to be very,
 
very careful about, if you just focus on 
market share, especially against local competitors, B brands in those 
markets and start doing crazy things with pricing, what you lose, exacerbate 
the volatility into your business.
 
So again what we have told, so I
 
have told all of the sector heads is to make 


just to drive volume, because in these volatile times, bu
ying volume is like 
renting volume. So we have been directing our people to manage the 
business sensibly, balanced volume, pricing, revenue, profitability and build 
frequency and penetration deliberately and carefully. Do not rent volume, 
build it carefull
y, build the brand equity, build the consumption occasion 

volatility? Yes. But I think for companies like PepsiCo, given our broad 
geographic and product portfolio and brand portfo
lio that company becomes 
a natural hedge against all of these variabilities. So again we feel pretty 
good.

Our final question comes from the line of Amit Sharma with BMO Capital 
Markets.
 
Amit Sharma

BMO Capital Markets
 
I just wanted to focus on 
Frito
-
Lay I mean the business is positioned to post 
the strongest volume growth that you have seen in at least the last five 
years and you have talked about some of the innovation coming through. 
Can you provide us a little bit more color of sustainability
 
of the current 
volume trend and what should we expect in the next 6 to 12 months?
 
Indra Nooyi
 
You know Frito
-
Lay North America is a terrific franchise. The business is well 
run and I think the incredible way that our snacks business and beverage 
business 
works together to really bring solutions to customers is what makes 
that business so successful. And the virtuous circle of driving top line 
growth, focusing on productivity, taking the benefit from that investing some 
back into the company to keep the vir
tuous circle going, putting the rest to 
the bottom line is what has kept Frito
-
Lay business going.
 
What Frito
-
Lay has been known for is every 3 or 5 years looking at 
breakthrough productivity to drive another 3 to 5 years of profit growth. And 
that thinkin
g continues at Frito
-
Lay. But Amit I tell you, the most important 
thing is we have segmented the Frito
-
Lay business in a very interesting way, 
where we look more at demand spaces rather than just cohorts or day
-
parts. 
And looking at demand spaces now, we c
an see how we can expand the 
Frito
-
Lay eating occasions.
 
So, as you look at the overall macro
-
snack environment, we know how to 
push salty snacks into taking away cookie occasions, cracker occasions, 
chocolate occasions by looking at various demand spaces 
and looking to see 
what consumers consume for each of those demand spaces. So we look at 
macro
-
snacks as our feeding ground. Salty snacks is just a sub
-
segment of 
that. And as long as there is lot of space with all macro
-
snacks and we have 
a very strong di
stribution and great innovation capabilities, we feel good 
about the fact that we can go after some of those occasions and that's the 
growth story of Frito
-
Lay.
 
Thank you all for your questions and in closing our performance to
-
date in 
2013 is a good indic
ator of how a well
-
constructed and developed portfolio 
coupled with disciplined execution and reinvestment can drive high quality 
top and bottom line results on a sustainable long term basis and this is the 
purpose of PepsiCo. I thank you for your time thi
s morning and for the 
confidence you have placed in us with your investment. Have a great day.

Indra Nooyi
 
Thanks, Jamie, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to give you my 
perspective on the quarter, share with you how we see the macro and 
consumer picture and then comment on our priorities and outl
ook for the 
balance of the year, including guidance.
 
We delivered good results in the quarter because reported EPS was up 20% 
and core EPS was up 10%. Our worldwide servings increased 6%, with 
global growth across our broad range of convenient food and bev
erage 
platform. We had solid global volume growth in both snacks and beverages. 
Snacks volume grew 10%, and beverages grew 5%.
 
And within that, the global nutrition portfolio grew revenue 10% on an 
organic basis. Net revenue was up 14% overall and 8% on an
 
organic basis. 
I'm pleased that our global snacks performance was particularly strong. We 
had balanced top line and bottom line growth in our snacks business, with 
volume growth momentum accelerating from the first quarter.
 
Frito
-
Lay North America, our la
rgest snacks business, had another very good 
quarter, with 2% volume growth, 3% net revenue growth and 6% operating 
profit growth. In fact, we saw positive performance in snacks in just about 
every one of our most important markets around the world.
 
We gre
w volume, revenue and profits in every one of our top 5 snacks 
markets. We're driving growth in developed markets by providing a wide 
array of innovative products, backed by strong commercial programs. And in 
emerging markets, we continue to grow per capit
a consumption frequency 
with locally
-
relevant products and then by expanding our distribution reach.
 
This is leading to double
-
digit volume growth across a number of markets. 
In the quarter, India grew 22%; China grew 25%; Turkey grew 24%; Saudi 
Arabia and
 
Egypt each grew above 20%; South Africa grew in the high
-
teens; and Brazil grew in double digits.
 
Now to beverages. The international market performance was very good. We 
saw volume outside of North America grow 4.5% in the quarter and 5% in 
the first hal
f on an organic basis, again with gains across many markets and 
double
-
digit growth in key emerging and developing markets.
 
China beverage volume grew 13% in the quarter; India grew 17%; Turkey 
was up 15%; Saudi Arabia was up 17%; Vietnam was up 11%; Franc
e is up 
12%; Germany, 15%. And at the same time we are seeing carbonated soft 
drink volume and value share gains across a number of these important 
markets. This growth is being driven by innovation and by the traction we 
are getting from our brand
-
buildin
g initiatives. The growth in key emerging 
markets like China and Russia is coming directly from the actions we've 
taken to build out our go
-
to
-
market reach and capacity.
 
We are off to a good start with the Wimm
-
Bill
-
Dann acquisition in Europe. I 
am pleased
 
with the progress, and I am monitoring it very closely. The 
Wimm
-
Bill
-
Dann management team and associates, who are now part of 
PepsiCo, are top
-
notch. The integration is right on track. And we are 
confident we'll achieve the synergies as originally planne
d, and the 
fundamental operating performance of Wimm
-
Bill
-
Dann has been rock solid. 
Further, majority of the portfolio is performing very well.
 
Now let me turn to PepsiAmericas Beverages and the North American 
beverage category in particular. In a difficul
t category environment, we are 
encouraged by a number of positives in the business. We are maintaining 
our focus on Pepsi Max and Sierra Mist with good results. Both Max and Mist 
grew in the quarter, with Max volume more than doubling compared to the 
prior
 
year. And we have terrific programming against brand Pepsi for the 
remainder of the year, including the current Summertime is Pepsi Time 
campaign. And later this quarter, our sponsorship of the X
-
Factor kicks into 
high gear.
 
Gatorade had another strong qu
arter of strong growth. And the results from 
the C&G channel, where we're benefiting from our move to direct store 
delivery earlier this year, were especially strong. And Trop50 continues to 
perform very well, with volume up 40%, supported by the new Trop 
packaging and expanding the line with new flavors.
 
Taken together, the positive signs we're seeing in the brands we have 
innovated and executed strong marketing programs give us confidence that 
our brand
-
building initiatives are beginning to pay off. Howev
er, the 
operating and financial performance in North America beverages was below 
our expectations for the quarter, and let me take you to the drivers and 
address what's going on here.
 
As we knew we would, we had exceptionally high levels of commodity 
infla
tion. That said, it's the consumer and competitive picture that's become 
more difficult than we expected. Consumer category demand was lower than 
we anticipated because overall retail foot traffic and basket sizes have 
declined, and the category pricing en
vironment was tough. These factors led 
to lower
-
than
-
expected price realization and a delay in some of our planned 
pricing actions.
 
As a consequence, our North America operating profit performance for the 
quarter was impacted. However, our analysis shows t
hat our North American 
profit growth for the first half compared favorably with that of our primary 
beverage competitor on a pro forma basis.
 
Of the 3 factors impacting North America beverages: inflation, consumer 
demand and pricing, the consumer demand pi
cture is the most concerning to 
us at this point. In fact, the modest pickup in total consumer spending 
almost all U.S. businesses saw earlier in the year has reversed in the past 
several months. And the general consumer weakness is driving reduced 
traffic
 
in key retail channels.
 
These factors are going to impact the discretionary categories like 
beverages, where we all know, consumers have non
-
packaged alternatives. 
And because beverages are also an impulse
-
driven category, the reduced 
traffic is also havi
ng an effect. Given the reduced retail traffic, the fact that 
Frito
-
Lay North America continues to perform well in this environment 
speaks to the relatively high resilience of salty snacks and the strength of 
the Frito franchise.
 
In developing and emerging
 
markets the growth picture is brighter. In most 
of the emerging and developing markets, we are still seeing healthy GDP 
growth. But global commodity inflation is pushing our food inflation in these 
markets, and wages in the short term are not keeping pace
. The disposable 
income and consumer discretionary spending is under some pressure.
 
So as we operate in this environment, we are focused on a few very 
important guiding principles. First, we'll continue to support our brand
-
building and other consumer
-
faci
ng initiatives. Given the stress that many 
consumers are under, and the fact that we're putting more pricing in the 
market, it's more important than ever to communicate the value of our 
brands to our consumers to keep them engaged in our brands and our 
cat
egories. You will continue to see us on air and using digital media to stay 
top of mind with our consumers and keep them engaged.
 
Second, we are staying committed to our emerging market initiatives to 
expand our go
-
to
-
market reach because emerging markets 
growth appears 
to be holding up, and we want to maintain the momentum we have by 
strengthening our franchises in these important growth markets. Third, in 
principle, we will try to cover as much of the commodity inflation as we can. 
As a disciplined operat
ing company, it's critical that over time we've tried to 
cover our costs. This applies in both developed and emerging markets. So 
we are taking more pricing across all of our businesses. In the case of North 
American beverages, our pricing actions have bee
n communicated to our 
customers, and pricing actions went into the market beginning July 11.
 
Fourth, as we deal with many consumers' sensitivity to affordability given 
their limited disposable incomes, we are using every tool we have at our 
disposal, inclu
ding price/pack architecture and efficient targeted promotions 
to continue to provide value to the consumer. We've done a rigorous review 
of our portfolio to make sure we have established price points that appeal to 
the more value
-
sensitive consumer. For e
xample, in the U.S. this includes 
the 1.5
-
liter take
-
home pack and the 16
-
ounce PET bottle in the cold 
channel in beverages.
 
On the snacks side, we have expanded our $2 monthly
-
served value line 
with encouraging results. And we're going to continue to 
put the power of 
our portfolio to work by executing cross
-
brand promotions to increase value 
to the consumer, to motivate higher verticals in total.
 
Fifth, we are focusing on premium innovation to help mitigate the cost and 
pricing challenges. Higher
-
incom
e consumers are in better shape financially 
and are less price
-
sensitive. So it's important we maintain a focus on them. 
We are driving growth in our premium products like our Tostitos Artisan, 
where unique flavor, texture and taste command higher revenue 
per pound, 
or products like the G series, which captures new high revenue and marginal 
cases for Gatorade.
 
And finally, we're accelerating and intensifying all our productivity initiatives 
that can have a positive outcome on both this year and upcoming yea
r's 
financial performance with focus across the entire compressible cost 
structure.
 
But as you all well know, we're going to have to deal with the uncertainty in 
the months to come, and this applies to all CPG companies, I believe, so we 
are not alone in t
his. Many companies have recently announced pricing 
actions, and this will further complicate the consumer outlook and the 
competitive environment. Understanding how all these impacts demand 
elasticity, both within categories and across categories, would r
equire careful 
monitoring and adjustment.
 
Taking these 3 issues into consideration, the uncertain macros and inflation, 
the immediate actions we are taking to mitigate them and our commitment 
to continue to support our strategic initiatives, we've updated 
our financial 
outlook for the year. We announced our updated outlook in this morning's 
release, and Hugh will discuss the guidance in more detail in just a minute.
 
But before I hand it off to Hugh, I want to be clear about my enthusiasm for 
the performance
 
and potential of our portfolio. There are so many good 
signs that our plans are aimed correctly. I believe our global volume and 
revenue growth in the quarter is a good reflection of our portfolio's strength. 
We remain absolutely committed to leading this
 
great company on a path 
that effectively addresses the current uncertainty and at the same time, 
strengthens the long
-
term health of our business and company.
 
Thanks, and I look forward to our discussion in the Q&A after Hugh's 
remarks. Hugh?
 
Hugh Johnsto
n
 
Thanks, Indra. I'll start with guidance.
 
We communicated updated guidance for 2011 in our release this morning. 
Our updated guidance targets high
-
single digit EPS growth on a core 52
-
week basis. Let me highlight the key underlying changes.
 
First, the new
 
guidance of high
-
single digits is on a U.S. dollar basis. Our 
previous guidance of 7% to 8% was on a constant currency basis. Second, 
while the currency neutral growth under our previous guidance was 7% to 
8%, our new guidance would imply 5% to 7% currenc
y neutral growth as we 
expect 2 percentage points of ForEx benefit for the year.
 
So let me address why we made the change. First, our primary beverage 
competitor is benefiting from significant ForEx tailwinds. This gives them a 
lot of competitive flexibili
ty, and it isn't logical for us to hold ourselves to a 
constant currency standard that our primary competitor isn't using.
 
Second, the commodities environment has been quite challenging this year, 
and our commodities forecast is a headwind that has moved t
o the high end 
of our range. These commodities have appreciated in part due to the 
depreciation of the U.S. dollar.
 
Our international earnings, on the other hand, benefit from U.S. dollar 
depreciation when they are converted, but we don't get that benefit 
when 
we measure our performance on a constant currency basis. The combination 
of these 2 items actually causes ForEx to be a performance drag on PepsiCo 
results under our old constant currency measurement.
 
Finally, as Indra mentioned, we, along with a numb
er of other CPGs, have 
announced price increases for the back half of the year and are doing so in a 
relatively weak U.S. consumer environment. While we're implementing this 
pricing, which we began to do on July 11, we'll also need to gauge the 
consumer re
action in this uncertain environment and make adjustments 
accordingly.
 
As such, predicting the ultimate pricing realization for the back half of 2011 
is more challenging than it would be in a more stable consumer 
environment. I expect that we might have so
me questions on guidance later, 
but thought it would be useful to provide this context before we engage in a 
discussion.
 
Because Indra has covered many of the operating trends in our business, I'll 
comment briefly on the below
-
the
-
line items for the quarte
r. Our tax rate for 
the quarter came in better than expected, driven largely by recognition of 
tax benefits in our international business. These were anticipated in our full 
year guidance, but were realized earlier in the year than we had previously 
antici
pated. Consequently, our Q2 tax rate was lower than we had expected 
but our full year outlook remains unchanged at approximately 27%.
 
On share repurchases, year
-
to
-
date, we repurchased approximately $750 
million of shares against our full year target of $2
.5 billion. So our pace of 
share repurchase is expected to accelerate in the second half. The timing of 
share repurchases is completely consistent with what we communicated at 
the beginning of the year.
 
As you model out the balance of the year, I want to c
all your attention to a 
few items. First, incremental pricing actions will be realized during Q3 and 
into Q4, so they'll have a more meaningful impact on the fourth quarter 
because of that timing.
 
Second, timing of concentrate shipments will likely be a ne
t negative in the 
third quarter as we expect bottler inventories to be a net drop. Third, as we 
intend to implement a number of accelerated productivity actions that we 
plan for the balance of the year, and they will also have a bigger impact on 
the fourth
 
quarter than the third quarter because of the timing of execution. 
The net of all that is we anticipate a much stronger operating profit EPS 
growth rate in the fourth quarter than in the third quarter.
 
With that, we'd be happy to take your questions.
 
Ques

Answer Session
 
Operator
 
[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Christine Farkas of 
Bank of America.
 
Christine Farkas

BofA Merrill Lynch
 
A couple of questions. First thing on C
-
stores. I just wanted to clarify the 
strength in Frito
-
Lay because we didn't see that in the scanner data but 
certainly the dollar channels seem strong. I wonder if you can take us 
through a little bit why the snacks are holding up so much better in the 
immediate consumption. And then my second question was o
n organic 
growth in Russia. It wasn't listed in the countries with double
-
digit growth on 
your beverage review, but wondering if you're seeing difficult consumer 
trends that seems to be hitting juice for some of your competitors.
 
John Compton
 
Christine, th
is is John Compton. On the single
-
serve business at Frito
-
Lay, 
we're benefiting from a new line of flavor that we've launched behind Ruffles 
and the Hispanic line of flavors that we've launched across the entire 
portfolio of brands, Doritos, Cheetos, Lay's
 
and Ruffles. And that's the 
Tapatio products that we've launched in about half the country. That 
combined with 
--
 
we have 2 different price points, as you know, that we use 
in the marketplace, a $0.99 line and a $1.29 line, and the combination of 
those 2 
with the flavors helped us to offset traffic declines. And our single
-
serve business grew mid
-
single digit for Frito
-
Lay overall. So I'm very 
pleased with the performance of the single
-
serve business and the up
-
and
-
down
-
the
-
street business.
 
Indra 
Nooyi
 
Regarding Russia, Christine. The overall beverage category in Russia was 
soft in the second quarter, and I think we had 2 kinds of behavior. One, the 
noncarbonated beverage business and juices in particular is a gigantic 
market in Russia, bigger than
 
the carbonated soft drink business. And within 
that, the lower
-
priced juices 
--
 
our juices in Russia run the whole gamut of 
pricing from value brands to premium brands. The value brands are better 
than the premium brands although, growth across the portfo
lio was okay. It 
wasn't at levels that we would like to see, but the growth wasn't bad on an 
organic basis. On the CSD side, there was some interesting behavior in the 
marketplace because some people decided to buy some volume in the 
marketplace so you saw
 
some very heavy price discounting in the 
marketplace, and we chose not to play that game because we decided that 
we're going to focus on juices and maintain our pricing in the marketplace. 
So overall I'd say our organic growth in Russia was in the very lo
w
-
single 
digit but that's a number that we deliberately decided to focus on because 
we did not want to use significant pricing drops to buy volumes.
 
Christine Farkas

BofA Merrill Lynch
 
Okay, slower but positive, it sounds like. And if I just could follow
-
up with 
Hugh on the guidance. You didn't 
--
 
correct me if I'm wrong, you didn't 
change your outlook for the commodity hit in 2011 on just the ongoing 
inflation. Or was there an uptick in your view for that pressure this year?
 
Hugh Johnston
 
No, Christine, 
we had previously communicated, as I'm sure you remember, 
$1.4 billion to $1.6 billion. And we're still in that range. Now within that 
range, we've moved to the higher end but no change in the $1.4 billion or 
the $1.6 billion range.

Your next ques
tion comes from John Faucher of JPMorgan.

JP Morgan Chase & Co
 
Taking a look at your decision 
--
 
and I want to focus on sort of your decision 
in terms of the FX piece, understanding the context that it's coming through. 
I guess the question 
becomes do you believe that this is a move to dollar
-
based earnings guidance for the foreseeable future? Is this a move to dollar
-
based earnings guidance for this year? And I guess the question becomes, if 
the dollar turns the other way, how should we look
 
at how this plays out on 
the other side? So again, understanding the context of what you're doing it 
for, but think that I guess I'm trying to figure out how you plan to manage 
this going forward?
 
Hugh Johnston
 
Yes, so John, this is Hugh. Let me talk abou
t that in 3 pieces. Number one, 
certainly in terms of the short
-
term dynamic, you're aware that our primary 
competitor has substantial ForEx, which seems to be playing its way back 
into the business, particularly in North America. And we think that to not 
be 
competitive with that is not a good long
-
term solution for the PepsiCo 
shareholders. Number two, as we think about the long
-
term earnings of 
PepsiCo, I expect that we will be looking at that on a USD basis. And then 
number three, for 2012 
--
 
too early t
o talk about anything as it relates to 
2012 at this point.

Your next question comes from Bill Pecoriello of Consumer Edge Research.
 
William Pecoriello

Consumer Edge Research, LLC
 
Recognize your comment that it's hard to know exactly what the pri
ce 
realization is going to be. Recently you had announced the 3% to 5% 
incremental pricing in CSDs. How much is that are you planning in the 
guidance to realize in the P&L given the competitive environment that you 
cited? And on the snack side, what is the
 
magnitude that you're expecting to 
realize and given the weak consumer environment, how are you modeling 
that volume impact in the back half?
 
Indra Nooyi
 
You're asking for a level of details that we're not comfortable sharing, but let 
me give you some bro
ad observations based on everything we've seen in the 
marketplace. As it gets closer to essentials, things like what we sell in our 
global nutrition portfolio, Tropicana, Quaker, foods products, even Gatorade 
in this scorching hot weather, people are willi
ng to pay up for those. Snacks, 
there isn't much of an alternative for snacks. It's just a great crisp, and 
people are willing to pay for that. In the case of beverages, we have to be a 
lot more careful because there are alternatives. Where you can stop tr
ading 
down pricing you can go from packaged beverages to first of all, bottled 
water then to tap water. So when you look at the repertoire of beverages, 
when you take 7 or 8 packaged beverages drinking occasions, people might 
cut that back to 4 or 5 depend
ing on how they want to allocate their dollars 
through the day. So I'd say that it's the beverage category we have to watch 
very carefully, along with the fact that sometimes in these environment, 
some people might choose to buy volume, and we saw that in 
the month of 
June or July. So I think what we have to be very, very careful about is not to 
give you any specific indication of exactly what price utilization we're going 
to get by category. But all that we can tell you is generally, this is what we 
are se
eing. And we're going to watch these over the next few weeks and 
months to see what kind of price utilization we get. Early indications in Frito
-
Lay are positive. I mean, John, do you want to talk about that?
 
John Compton
 
Yes. Bill, as you know we've said 
all along that we're going to price to cover 
commodity, and I think if you look in the second quarter, our gross margin 
in Frito
-
Lay was up 10 basis points. So we essentially did that and going 
forward, that's our intent. As you know we have multiple lever
s that we pull, 
different pack sizes, laid out price, et cetera. But we're not pricing to grow 
profits, we're pricing to cover our commodity costs. And so far, as 
understood, we put pricing into the market 
--
 
incremental pricing into the 
market on July 10,
 
and 2 weeks does not a year make, and but I'm 
encouraged at what I'm seeing.

Your next question is comes from Ali Dibadj of Bernstein.
 
Ali Dibadj 
-
 
Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., Inc.
 
Just a couple of questions. One is 
--
 
so I think it's fair and yo
u made a point 
that when you compare your results to your peers between North America, 
it's basically in line if you try to strip things out. And of course, you're facing 
a lot of these externalities. You mentioned obviously macro, consumer, 
commodities, c
ompetition, et cetera but these are just externalities. I'm just 
trying to get a better sense of 
--
 
do you see things specifically internally that 
you're not doing well whether it be Power of One not happening enough 
whether the integration 
--
 
maybe you ca
n push that further? You mentioned 
some productivity improvements. Obviously, there are a lot of changes in 
the marketing function in beverages. Are there things internally that you 
--
 
all of you look at and say, ""Gosh, we could do things better here."" Of 
course, 
there are many, but really that has been driving or that could drive some 
improvement here.
 
Indra Nooyi
 
I think that's a great question. So let me address some of these and Hugh if 
you want to chip in, go ahead. You're absolutely right in saying a 
lot of the 
externalities. I wish we could control but we can't. I wish we could manage 
the economies but we can't. So we have to live with them. We have to live 
with the uncertainty. I think what bothers us most is the uncertainty, not the 
economy itself. 
But we have to live with it. Let's talk about the internal 
structure. I'd say by and large, we're doing a very good job managing our 
internal P&L and our execution. Although I'd say, we are never happy with 
what we do. I mean, we are one company that's con
stantly in a state of 
discontent because we think we can do better. So let me give you some 
areas where we are working hard. Clearly, in our North American beverage 
marketing organization there's been changes. And as we've said before, we 
had to make those
 
changes, and the changes we made not because we had 
bad people or people who are not qualified, it's just the business changed 
around us, and we wanted to make sure we had people who are ready to 
sign up to the new agenda and had the skills required to pe
rform in this new 
world. And I think all the people we're getting in the company 
--
 
first of all, 
we have no trouble recruiting people, and the people who come in are top 
quality. I hope you guys get a chance to meet the Brad Jakeman who is 
running the glo
bal CSD franchise now, and Lorraine Hansen, who's running 
Global Hydration. I think you'll be extremely impressed by the caliber of 
these people. So we have absolutely no issues attracting the best and the 
brightest. So we have to go to those changes in th
e North American 
marketing organization, and we make them gradually to upgrade the talent 
and make sure we have the right people for the new environment. And you 
would start seeing the results of their work as we going to the balance of the 
year and next y
ear. In terms of productivity, as Hugh said, we are working 
hard to look at our compressible cost to see if we can get even more 
efficient. And this is not squeezing the cost because that's the worst thing 
you can do, to squeeze the cost, get rid of people
 
and make whoever's left 
work harder because that's a burnout strategy. We're actually looking across 
the company to say: Can we do things differently? Can we approach the 
market differently? Can we distribute differently? Can we even change the 
form funct
ion of our products? Could we invest in productivity tools that in 
fact saves us a lot of money and allows us to do more with the people we 
have? So that as we grow, we can just deploy the existing labor force to do 
a better job. Pricing, across the compan
y, we have teams looking at this 
right now, and some of the early indications are there is some additional 
opportunities to improve the productivity of the company. So here is a 
company that's always restless, is always beating itself up rather than 
pattin
g itself on the back, and we are turning over every stone in the 
company to see if we can be even more efficient than we are. Hugh, did you 
want to add anything?
 
Hugh Johnston
 
Yes. I think in many ways, I'd echo Indra's point that I think we have a 
healthy
 
level of dissatisfaction in PepsiCo for the way we currently do things. 
And the good news is I think we see opportunities consistently to do them 
better. I'll talk about the productivity side in particular. We're always looking 
at benchmarks in terms of h
ow we do things across our processes, whether 
it be manufacturing or procurement or distribution. And as we benchmark, 
we're always looking at the top quartile and saying, ""Why can't everything 
be like that?"" And sometimes there are structural reasons but 
sometimes we 
just need to learn from ourselves internally and to get better at it. To Indra's 
point, I do think sometimes we're very hard on ourselves and maybe, at 
times, we talk about that a little bit too much externally, when in fact I do 
feel like com
petitively we use our resources pretty efficiently compared to 
most companies that you would contrast us to. But I think that healthy level 
of dissatisfaction is also one of the things that's enabled PepsiCo to be as 
successful as it's been and I'd expect 
we'll continue to have that healthy 
level of dissatisfaction.
 
Indra Nooyi
 
And Ali, one other point. You talked about Power of One. We have lot of 
Power of One ideas at the shelf, the consumer shelf. What we are trying to 
be very careful about is to 
execute the Power of One program, which is profit 
dilutive, it's not a very good idea. We want to make sure it's top line 
accretive, and it leads neutral on the profit side at a minimum. There's lot of 
ideas or profit
-
dilutive ideas. So we want to make sur
e that we execute 
Power of One in the back office to the extent that it makes sense. But when 
it comes to consumer
-
facing activities, it doesn't dilute our profit margins, 
and that is what we're looking to very carefully.
 
Ali Dibadj

Sanford C. Bernstein 
& Co., Inc.
 
Okay, that's helpful. And maybe to segue way to perhaps a scenario of 
discontent or expected improvements but it's great to have John and Eric 
both on the call. And if you focus in on North America, it still remains kind of 
almost a tale of two
 
cities, right, with FLNA doing a lot of the heavy lifting in 
North America and in fact the, I think, for the whole company. Right? At 
least the majority of the operating profit growth for the company. And as we 
look at that, how do you think about the bal
ance between those 2? At what 
point do you think PAB starts to, I guess, pick up the slack, so to speak? 
And/or should we continue to expect FLNA to really continue to deliver 
higher and higher margins from the place that we are now? How should we 
think ab
out that balance going forward in North America, of course, as it 
relates to the whole company?
 
Indra Nooyi
 
I'll make some opening comments, and I'm going to have Eric talk to them 
and John talk about Frito
-
Lay. I think Frito
-
Lay is our star in the portfol
io. 
Just a fantastic business, great market position, tremendous numbers of 
layers of advantage and a very well
-
managed business. I'd say it if it were a 
stand
-
alone company, Frito
-
Lay North America might well be the best 
consumer products company. So I th
ink FLNA is just a wonderful 
organization with a great franchise and great attention to detail. I'd say our 
North American beverage business 
--
 
and I'd say it's not just PepsiCo I'd say 
the overall North American beverage environment has been an interestin
g 
one, and I've made all kinds of comments in what I see as behavior in the 
North American beverage business. But this is not a business that, as a 
category, has been sensible for years. There has been trading of a sensible 
point of share at the margin at 
huge cost for many, many years, and we've 
all been through an environment where for almost 20 years, there was no 
commodity inflation of any significant proportion. And in the last couple of 
years, we are beginning to see huge commodity inflation and a dep
ressed 
economy. So the North American beverage business in total, not just 
PepsiCo, requires a very different mindset and approach to it, which I've not 
yet seen in the industry as a whole. Having said that, let me turn to Eric 
Foss to give you his comment
s on what we are trying to do to approach this 
category and then we have to watch and see how the overall marketplace 
evolves. So Eric, take it away.
 
Eric Foss
 
Ali, just a couple of comments. First, let just me talk a little bit about our 
progress post the
 
merger. I mean, if you think about our North America 
beverage business, really post the merger in 2010 and then through the first 
quarter of this year, we had really 4 straight quarters of volume top line and 
profit improvement. So if you look at second q
uarter, I think we were 
dealing with and the business was impacted by 3 extraordinary issues. One, 
unprecedented commodity inflation that Indra mentioned. Second, I think 
it's important to recognize that there was a prior
-
year value investment at 
the retai
l level that we were lapping that largely impacted second quarter 
and is now behind us. And then third, the competitive environment. So let 
me tell you what we feel good about, let me tell you what kind of core issues 
we need to address and kind of how we'
re trying to play the game going 
forward. I think first of all we feel good about the kind of our balanced 
approach to top line growth, which, on a year
-
to
-
date basis is up a couple of 
points, certainly in line with the category and our competitors. We con
tinue 
to improve our share position. We continue to improve the health of our 
brands, which we stated was a must
-
do coming out of the merger. We 
continue to feel great about the synergy capture and our cost and 
productivity efforts, and we continue to sell
 
service and execute very well at 
the point of sale. The issues we need to address are actually isolated, pretty 
simple to say but tougher to do and that is we have to price to cover COGS 
to make sure we have the right margin structure going forward, and w
e 
have to do that right now and balance that with a pretty difficult consumer 
and economic environment that you've heard Indra and Hugh refer to. So 
the game we're playing is as we go forward the second half, price to cover 
COGS. It's the prudent and right
 
thing to do for the long
-
term health of the 
category in this business. Second, we're going to continue to make the 
incremental investments, particularly around strengthening our brand and 
building our core brands. And third, continue to maximize the poten
tial of 
the merger and the synergy unlocks, including not just capturing cost 
synergies but revenue synergies like G2, DSD, Power of One, food service, 
et cetera. That's kind of what we feel good about, what we have to address 
and kind of the game we're pl
aying going forward.
 
John Compton
 
On Frito
-
Lay, there's nothing in the first half of this year that would cause us 
to change our optimism about this business going forward. We continue to 
believe that there's volume growth in the core business. I believe t
he 
demographic changes that are taking place are actually in our favor. We've 
learned on how to build adjacent businesses through Stacy's and Sabra 
particularly. We're successful in that venture now. Historically, we've had a 
terrific productivity mindset 
at Frito
-
Lay. We ramped that up incrementally 
with the GES initiative that we're beginning to implement and roll now. And 
so no, I don't want anyone 
--
 
I appreciate your comments about Frito
-
Lay, 
but I don't want anyone to take away that we're milking that
 
business 
because of the temporary softness in one business right now. That's not the 
case at all. It's a great business for running the business for the long term. 
We're making the necessary investments. We took our media investment up 
this year because w
e knew that we were going to take pricing, and that we 
thought we needed that to sort of cover any sort of consumer softness that 
we potentially would see. And Latin America, across the board, as you now, 
the snacks businesses have performed well. We had 5
% volume growth and 
double
-
digit profit growth.
 
Indra Nooyi
 
And we are nicely focused on top line growth at Frito
-
Lay and across the 
company.
 
Operator
 
Your next question comes from Dara Mohsenian of Morgan Stanley.
 
Dara Mohsenian 
-
 
Morgan Stanley
 
John, can
 
you discuss your top line expectations around Frito
-
Lay North 
America in the back half of the year with the higher pricing? Are you 
expecting to see a significant volume slowdown in the business? And also in 
terms of looking at your pricing, how much of i
t will be rate versus weight 
out and how that compares versus history and how that would play into your 
volume expectations?
 
John Compton
 
Yes, certainly. As incremental pricing comes in, our net revenue performance 
should improve and most likely our volume
 
performance might slow 
somewhat. Versus the pricing actions when we saw this high
-
commodity 
inflation environment from 2008, less of our pricing actions are going to be 
laid out and more of our pricing actions this year are a combination of trade 
promotio
n practices and some visual pricing. So back half of the year, I think 
the net revenue line will grow faster than it has in the first half of the year, 
and volume will slow somewhat. But I'll know more about that in the next 6 
to 8 weeks.
 
Dara Mohsenian 
-
 
Morgan Stanley
 
Okay. And can you just talk a little bit about your views around the potential 
demand elasticity given there's more visual pricing this time around and 
compare it versus demand elasticity you've seen in the past?
 
John Compton
 
As I said, I'll
 
know more as the pricing gets fully into the marketplace. But 
the biggest brands, I'll take Lay's and Doritos as an example, are also quite 
frequently sold on deals. So we have a way of managing our net pricing 
through the marketplace. If we see the visua
l pricing starting to slow a little 
bit, we can adjust our promotion practices.
 
Indra Nooyi
 
The other thing, Dara, is the amazing thing is around the world 
--
 
in pretty 
much every country of the world, the snacks businesses is very resilient and 
is doing w
ell. And so we take great comfort in the fact that it's a faulty 
category and the strength of our franchises across the world that seems to 
be holding up very well in an economy where pricing is going up for all 
consumer products and economies have mixed p
erformance across the 
world.
 
John Compton
 
And to add Indra's point, the other thing that gives me confidence so we can 
get this pricing through is the innovation on the core business that we have 
coming. And so all the flavor work that we've done in Dorito
s and Ruffles 
particularly is and will continue to work well. And it flows through our big 
bag business straight to our single
-
serve business into our variety pack 
business, and that gives me confidence that we can get the pricing through.

Your ne
xt question comes from Carlos LaBoy of Credit Suisse.
 
Carlos LaBoy

Crédit Suisse AG
 
I was hoping that Hugh could give us some insight on the financial value of 
the PBG and Gatorade assets you sold in Mexico and the expected size of the 
checks that are 
likely to come your way as the deal closes. I think this asset 
sales should be worth several hundred million dollars. Are you going to 
deploy that money when it comes in toward funding higher rate of 
investments? Or do the asset sales offer you unexpected 
money to 
accelerate investments even more?
 
Hugh Johnston
 
Yes, Carlos, this is Hugh. Carlos, as we mentioned in some of our earlier 
communications, the terms of the deal and the specifics around the 
financials of it are confidential, and we're not going to 
be sharing that at this 
time. When the deal closes, obviously, to the degree that cash comes in, 
that represents a substantial change to PepsiCo's overall cash picture. 
Obviously, we'll be talking to that piece of it at that point. But right now, the 
terms
 
of the deal are confidential, and that's an agreement between the 
parties.
 
Carlos LaBoy

Crédit Suisse AG
 
And maybe Eric can expand on the 1.5 liter take
-
home pack that Indra 
mentioned. It's being priced at parity, it looks like, with Coke's 1.25. Can 
yo
u speak to the fact that you're having to give an extra quarter liter for free 
on a very similar package. And I guess where I'm going with the question is, 
do you worry that this opens up a slippery slope of holding price parity with 
your competitor on sim
ilar packs as they start plowing forward on package 
innovation and on new packs?
 
Eric Foss
 
Sure, Carlos. It's Eric. Let me make a couple of points on pricing. First of all, 
I think you've heard us talk before that as we approach anything, certainly 
1.5
-
lit
er, our pricing approach starts and ends with the consumer. And I 
think if you think about our success on 1.5
-
liter, what we're really trying to 
do is to make sure there's an entry point for the consumer to enter the 
category at a great value. And we punch
ed this 1.5
-
liter in June. We've had 
very strong execution. It's tied to meal deals, and the reality is if you look at 
any success metric, distribution, volume, share on 1.5 liter or share on a 
combined multi
-
serve basis, 1.5
-
liter and 2
-
liter, we are extr
emely happy 
with our success relative to the competitive entry on this package. So we 
feel very good about it and it's something that again as we look at taking 
pricing, I think you'll see the whole industry look to reconceptualize and re
-
architect the who
le price/pack architecture. So I think you'll see more to 
come on that front.
 
Operator
 
Your next question comes from Judy Hong of Goldman Sachs.
 
Judy Hong 
-
 
Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
 
Just going back to North America beverages. If I just look at the profit 
d
ecline on a year
-
over
-
year basis, can you just walk through the 
components of the profit decline. How much was the pricing lagging 
inflation? How much did spending go up? What was the cost synergy 
capture? And then as we think about going forward, just fro
m an inflation 
perspective, does it get worse and then it gets better? Or have we kind of hit 
the peak in terms of inflation just on a quarterly basis?
 
Indra Nooyi
 
You're talking about North American beverages, Judy?
 
Judy Hong 
-
 
Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
 
Ye
s.
 
Hugh Johnston
 
Yes. Let me start on it a little bit and then Eric to the degree you want to 
add, please feel free. Judy, relative to our expectations, the costs are largely 
in line with what we had expected. Inflation in beverages is a bit higher than 
wh
at was in our plans but not significantly so for the first half. It really is 
--
 
pricing and volume is really where the gap is, and we've talked about some 
of the reasons why, from a competitive perspective. On a year
-
over
-
year 
basis, obviously, commoditie
s are up substantially. And we expected to get 
more pricing in the marketplace, but it's proven to be a pretty competitive 
market and as a result of that, that's really what's driving the year
-
over
-
year. But everything else, the synergies are largely in li
ne, and the 
commodities piece, while up year
-
over
-
year, are only a little bit higher than 
what our expectations were.
 
Judy Hong 
-
 
Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
 
So in Q2, what was the cost synergy capture?
 
Hugh Johnston
 
Yes. We hadn't disclosed the 
synergies specifically on a quarterly basis.
 
Indra Nooyi
 
But just assume that the commodities are well above any synergies.
 
Hugh Johnston
 
Correct.
 
Judy Hong 
-
 
Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
 
And then just in terms of pricing versus the commodities out 
--
 
within 
A
mericas Beverages, can you just talk about where's the pressure's coming 
from just in terms of CSD versus noncarbs versus juice? And where are you 
seeing sort of the most pronounced gap? And where do you have the most 
confidence that, that gap will close a
s the year progresses?
 
Hugh Johnston
 
Why don't I talk to that briefly, and then, Eric, if you want to add in, that's 
fine. I think Judy the biggest gap is in carbonated soft drinks and primarily 
in the big volume packages. That's where we haven't seen 
pricing at the 
levels that we expected it to.
 
Indra Nooyi
 
Single
-
serves, up
-
and
-
down
-
the
-
street seems to be okay.
 
Hugh Johnston
 
Seems to be fine.
 
Indra Nooyi
 
Take
-
home, large pack. Eric, you might want to talk to the extent you can 
provide some detail.
 
Eri
c Foss
 
Sure. Let me give you some color commentary on the pricing topic. Again, 
Judy, the way we think about this is there is a balance here, so we are trying 
to get price appreciation. If you look at it, if you really look at our business, 
you can look at
 
it in 2010, we had 2 points of pricing, Q1 another 2 points, 
Q2 another 2 points, first half 2 points. You've seen us really try to take a 
disciplined and balanced approach to the top line. You've seen our retails 
both on cans and 2 liter go up despite th
e fact that our competitors are 
down year
-
over
-
year. And again, right now, we feel good that we've 
descended and are growing our share position, and we have good mix 
management as well. So I think the core issue is largely on CSDs, cans and 
multi
-
serve pac
k.
 
Judy Hong 
-
 
Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
 
Okay. And Hugh just a quick follow
-
up on your guidance. You continue to 
talk about guidance on a 52
-
week basis. At this point can you tell us what's 
the 53rd week will provide you just in terms of whether you'll inve
st that 
back into the marketplace or would we see higher earnings as a result of the 
53rd week? And then just on the tax rate because the Q2 tax rate actually 
came in a little bit lower. So for the full year, does the back half tax rate go 
up?
 
Hugh Johnsto
n
 
Yes. So the tax rate Judy will actually be pretty well in line with what we said 
previously, which was 27%. This was really a timing switch. So to the 
degree that our first half tax rate is under that, then obviously, the back half 
will be a little bit h
igher than that. In terms of the 53rd week, we had 
previously talked about that as non
-
core, in line with past practice. So in 
terms of plans on that, we hadn't said anything publicly at this point.

Your next question comes from Caroline Levy of CLSA.
 
Caroline Levy

Credit Agricole Securities (
USA
) Inc.
 
I have just a
 
couple. Could you talk to Wimm
-
Bill
-
Dann's performance, just 
the business itself versus your expectation rather than all of Russia? What's 
better, what's worse, is there any you could add? The second is on media 
spend. I was hoping to hear some specifics 
on whether that's actually been 
ramped up year
-
over
-
year, and what the plans are for the back half, 
particularly on the beverage side in North America. And then just finally, has 
Tropicana turned at all?
 
Indra Nooyi
 
Great, 3 questions. So Wimm
-
Bill
-
Dann. W
imm
-
Bill
-
Dann is performing 
exceedingly well. In fact the more we get to know the Wimm
-
Bill
-
Dann 
business, the people, the strength of the franchise, the technologies they 
have, they are really, really, really impressing us. So the business is a top
-
notch 
business. I'd say it's performing exceedingly well. It's had its share of 
commodity cost inflation because grain prices go up, the cows have to eat 
grain in order to produce the milk, in order for us to produce the dairy 
product. So there is some of that. 
But you want to add something on Wimm
-
Bill
-
Dann before I ...
 
Hugh Johnston
 
Yes, I was actually just over there with Zein a couple of weeks ago. Clearly, 
you have things going on in terms of value versus premium products like 
you do with the rest of Russia.
 
But as Indra said, the business is performing 
very well. We went through a full integration review. And the integration, the 
synergies are on track. The marketplace performance is good. And Zein and 
I actually went out to visit the cows, and they seem to 
be doing fine as well.
 
Indra Nooyi
 
And you know, there's still opportunity because in Almarai, which is our joint 
venture with the Saudi dairy company, they have the highest yield per cow, 
and we haven't yet transferred those yield technologies from Almarai to 
Wimm
-
Bill
-
Dann. So we see a lo
t of upside going forward, and the 
management team at Wimm
-
Bill
-
Dann is top
-
notch. We retained pretty 
much all of them, I think, say, except one. But we retained everyone of 
them, and they're doing a great job. They've integrated wonderfully with 
PepsiCo. 
The last time they were all here for an all
-
day dairy review. I must 
tell you, you couldn't tell the difference who is Wimm
-
Bill
-
Dann and who is 
PepsiCo. Our European team has done a terrific job, Zein and Ramon, 
working with the Wimm
-
Bill
-
Dann people, int
egrating them into PepsiCo. So 
those are all the good news. And again, Power of One
-
wise exploiting the 
coolers, exploiting our existing infrastructure in snacks and beverages along 
with Wimm
-
Bill
-
Dann, that work is just beginning. And at this point, 
Carol
ine, we are only seeing upside from the Wimm
-
Bill
-
Dann transaction. 
Let me get to the media question. Across PepsiCo, in 2011, in spite of the 
economic issues we are increasing our overall A&M spend, and we are 
increasing our media spend. In fact, second h
alf is a pretty significant step
-
up even in North America, and we've decided not to back off that increase 
because as I said in my opening comments it's even more important that 
when you take up pricing, you keep getting the message out on your brand 
so pe
ople stay engaged to the brand. So North American beverages, for 
example, the summertime advertising will continue. The expected 
advertising will be pretty big step up, and in Frito
-
Lay North America, second 
half of the year we'll continue to invest. Europ
e, we'll still continue to invest. 
EMEA is investing. Quaker Foods is investing. So across the board we're 
going to continue to keep investing in A&M and media. And on Tropicana, 2 
things, let me separate Trop50 and cold Tropicana. Tropicana50, as I said i
s 
growing 40%. It's doing very well across the country so we feel very, very 
excited about the prospects for Trop50, as the product is today and all of the 
spinoffs of Trop50 that could come in as innovation next year. On cold 
Tropicana itself, we resisted
 
going to the plastic carafe because we thought 
environmentally, staying with the gable
-
top was a better idea. And the 
consumer wants the plastic carafe, so we launched a beautiful plastic carafe 
in the West, and where we've launched the plastic carafe, we
 
are gaining 
share handsomely. We feel very, very good, and this is now beginning to roll 
to the whole country. And in some parts of the country, as expected, we 
believe the gable
-
top also for those consumers who are very 
environmentally
-
conscious as they 
should be. But I think that early signs, 2 
or 3 months of the Tropicana carafe in the West Coast, we feel very good. 
And overall, because of the G&G and all the innovation platforms we've 
come up with on fruits and vegetables, the pipeline for Tropicana go
ing into 
next year and beyond is looking very good. So this is a great franchise, a 
very strong, still has great revenues for the consumer. And we feel good 
about the prospects.

If I can add one comment around the media question, Caroline, as
 
well. I 
would not assume that the level of A&M increase is the same as the media 
percentage spending increase. In fact, media spending increase has been 
much higher. One of the things that we've done, I think very effectively, 
inside the company is add a 
significant productivity program, to shift dollars 
from what we refer to as nonworking to working. And as a result of that, as 
we found that productivity, we have put it right back into media. So while 
you'll see A&M up, the media spending levels will be u
p meaningfully more 
than the A&M spending level overall.

Our final question is comes from Kaumil Gajrawala of UBS.

First question on, Hugh, on your 
--
 
are there forecasts on your commodity 
cost outlook such t
hat if there's 
--
 
if commodity cost would have come down 
there could be some benefit or based on the hedges that you have or the 
numbers that you provide essentially how the year will play out?
 
Hugh Johnston
 
Very little at this point. We're largely hedged 
at this point through the end of 
the year.
 
Indra Nooyi
 
At this point to the end of the year.

Okay, got it. And then, John, I think you mentioned single
-
serve was up low
-
single digits. Could you talk a little bit about
 
what's driving that given the 
current environment? And then Eric, if you wouldn't mind commenting on 
the single
-
serve business in beverages?
 
John Compton
 
Kaumil, the single
-
serve business for us is being driven by the fact of the 
new flavors that we put i
nto the marketplace. Largely behind Ruffles 
because, as I said, also the Tapatio line of products that we launched behind 
Doritos, Lay's, Cheetos and Ruffles in about half the country. So just core 
flavors are driving our single
-
serve business. We haven't 
taken pricing yet 
on that business. So it's really unit growth is driving the growth.
 
Indra Nooyi
 
Eric?
 
Eric Foss
 
Beverages, Kaumil. our cold drink business was really driven and was 
slightly positive in the quarter really driven by 16 ounce CSDs, as well 
as 
Gatorade. So I think we've had 5 straight quarters of growth. We grew our 
cold drink share, and although we did see and are starting to see fuel prices 
impact the consumer from a traffic standpoint and indications in C&G.

Okay, got 
it. And then just final question. As it relates to the incremental 
productivity, is any of it structural, meaning joint ventures, changes in 
distribution structure or is it simply more G&A types of things?
 
Indra Nooyi
 
Right now, we are working on compressi
ble costs within the company, 
beyond G&A, it's all of the compressible costs in the company. And despite 
the single
-
structure changes, as they happen we'd be out there to talking to 
you guys. At this point, we are not looking at that.
 
Let me just close by 
saying that as a company, we're all operating in a 
highly uncertain environment, especially in the developed markets. In this 
difficult macro and consumer environment, I believe our portfolio is being 
managed sensibly to deliver good short
-
term results, wh
ile continuing to 
invest in our future. And all 300,000 associates in PepsiCo remain extremely 
committed to the company and are excited about the prospects of the 
company in the short term and the long term. Thank you.

Indra K. Nooyi
 
Thank you, Jamie, and
 
good morning, everyone. This morning, I'd like to 
give you my perspective on our third quarter performance and share with 
you my thoughts on our progress against our key priorities. So let me start 
with our performance in the quarter. We grew global volum
e in both snacks 
and beverages, which, combined with strong pricing, drove net revenue 
growth of 9%, excluding Wimm
-
Bill
-
Dann. Our global nutrition portfolio, 
which is a subset of our snacks and beverage business, grew revenues 8%, 
excluding acquisitions. 
Core division profit was up 6%, and core EPS was up 
7%. We are encouraged by these volume and revenue gains. We 
implemented incremental pricing actions in the quarter as planned, and the 
net pricing and volumes were in line with our expectations.
 
As a comp
any, we remain committed to our 5 strategic imperatives. So let 
me review our performance against each of them, starting with snacks. 
Global snacks volume rose 8%, and excluding Wimm
-
Bill
-
Dann, revenue 
increased 12% with steady growth coming from our large
r, more developed 
markets and even faster growth in emerging markets. In our largest snack 
business, Frito
-
Lay North America, we delivered 4% revenue growth and 6% 
operating profit growth on a 1% volume gain. We achieved positive price 
realization, largely
 
as a result of the pricing actions we implemented, and we 
are pleased with the consumer response. It's a testament to the strength of 
Frito
-
Lay's brands and product portfolio and to the organization's ability to 
execute.
 
In fact, we delivered top line gro
wth in most of our largest snack brands. 
Lay's, Doritos, Cheetos and Ruffles each posted solid revenue growth, driven 
by strong core innovation. And our growth in our potato chips business, in 
particular, is worth a comment. This segment grew net revenue m
id
-
single 
digits on the strength of our Ruffles Bold flavors sub
-
line and Lay's Kettle 
innovation. Lay's Kettle revenue was up over 20% in the quarter, and year
-
to
-
date, we outperformed all other kettle competitors in both volume and 
value share growth. Ou
r performance across channels is well balanced, with 
growth both in retail and food service channels.
 
Within retail, small format performance was especially good with mid
-
single 
digit volume and revenue growth in our single
-
serve packages. Our growth 
in C&
G has been driven by innovation, where we have 6 of the top 7 new 
food items in the channel. I'm proud to note Frito
-
Lay's 50th anniversary in 
business. The company was founded in 1961 through the merger of the Frito 
Company and the H.W. Lay Company (sic) 
[H.W. Lay & Company]. At the 
time, we had 4 brands with combined sales of just over $100 million. Today, 
we've grown to be a $30 billion global leader in snacks with 7 billion
-
dollar 
snack brands and the #1 global food brand, Lay's. So we're very proud of 
this business.
 
Turning to international snacks. We increased snacks volume in 8 of our top 
10 international snack markets and delivered double
-
digit revenue growth in 
19 of our top 20 snack markets, with especially strong performance in 
emerging markets. S
pecifically in the quarter, China snacks volume grew 
31%. India grew 26%. Saudi Arabia grew 24%. Egypt was up 15%, and 
Turkey grew 22%. And in Russia, excluding the Wimm
-
Bill
-
Dann impact, 
snacks revenue has grown more than 70% over the past 2 years. It's c
lear 
that innovation is fueling our international snack growth. For example, in the 
United Kingdom, we've had the biggest category launch in 10 years behind 
Walkers Crinkles, a savory, rich potato chip, which has already achieved 
25% household penetration.
 
In Turkey, our new products include Lay's olive oil and Ruffles Burger King 
flavor, which is part of a broad innovation effort to drive incremental sales 
through broader variety. And in China, we've expanded our Lay's brand 
portfolio by launching a new mu
ltigrain snack line in popular local flavors like 
chili pecan and spring onion. So I think we've delivered good results against 
our goal to build and expand our macro snacks portfolio.
 
Let me turn now to global beverages. We delivered 4% volume growth and,
 
excluding Wimm
-
Bill
-
Dann, 6% revenue growth. We achieved strong net 
price realization, largely through pricing actions to partially offset commodity 
inflation. Top line growth was well balanced across markets. We achieved 
volume and revenue growth in both
 
our developed markets and emerging 
markets. Emerging markets growth continues to be generally strong, as we 
drive both penetration frequency through investments in our go
-
to
-
market 
systems and a focus on providing affordable options for consumers.
 
Across 
many of our emerging markets, we saw double
-
digit beverage 
volume gains. Just to mention a few, India grew volume 19%, Turkey grew 
16%, Saudi Arabia grew 12%. And in China, we delivered double
-
digit 
revenue growth and very strong unit growth behind our int
roduction of a 
value
-
oriented 500 ml package, which largely replaced our 600 ml offering in 
that market. And our developed markets as a group also achieved steady 
volume and revenue growth in beverages.
 
So let me comment briefly on North America, where we 
are making good 
progress on a number of our highest priorities. First, we gained LRB volume 
share in the United States in the quarter, and we remained the LRB share 
leader in measured channels. Second, we've largely completed the 
integration of PBG and PAS
 
into PepsiCo. We've achieved synergies above 
our original targets and ahead of schedule. Importantly, we have not had 
any disruptions to the business as a result of the integration. Third, our 
strategic restages of Gatorade and Tropicana have shown good r
esults, and 
the performance of these 2 key trademarks gives us confidence that we're 
moving in the right direction.
 
Let me talk of Tropicana. Two key points: we've completed our national 
introduction of the carafe packaging that our consumers prefer, and o
ur low
-
calorie natural
-
sweetened Trop50 line continues to perform exceedingly well. 

expanded the line to include apple, lemonade, pomegranate, blueberry, 
pineapple mango and raspberry lemo
nade. The Trop50 line grew volume 
50% in the quarter, and that's on top of the 37% growth we had in the third 
quarter last year. We are selling everything we can make, and that's a good 
challenge for us to meet.
 
Gatorade continues to perform very well with
 
volume up 9% in the quarter, 
lapping 15% growth last year. And all elements of the Gatorade plan are 
contributing to growth. Our refocus on the core athlete consumer, the brand 
restage to G, the introduction of G Series, our expansion to the FIT and Pro 
l
ine, and our transition of go
-
to
-
market for small formats to DSD. If you're 
closely following the late rounds of the Major League Baseball playoffs and 
the early weeks of the NFL season, I'm sure you've seen our ubiquitous 
dugout and sideline presence. The
 
net result of our efforts in the quarter and 
year
-
to
-
date is that Gatorade has delivered the greatest absolute volume 
growth of any trademark in the U.S. liquid refreshment beverage category.
 
Turning to CSDs. We are pushing forward with our aggressive gam
e plan to 
engage consumers through innovation, marketing and value and, at the 
same time, navigating high
-
input cost inflation. Our innovation and 
marketing programs are focused directly on our big trademarks: Pepsi, 
Mountain Dew and Sierra Mist. For examp
le, Pepsi's marketing partnership 
with the X Factor kicked off with the show's premiere on September 21, 
driving high levels of consumer awareness for trademark Pepsi, while it 
reinforces Pepsi's strong emotional ties to music and pop culture. X Factor 
has
 
been particularly effective in creating highly positive social media buzz 
for the Pepsi brand.
 
And we are making progress with our other CSD initiatives as well. Pepsi 
Max continues to perform well with volume nearly doubling over 2 years 
behind our messa
ge of 0
-
calorie maximum Pepsi taste. We've launched 
Mountain Dew Game Fuel as a limited time offering. And together with 
Doritos, we are partnering with Activision on their introduction of Call of 
Duty: Modern Warfare 3, which is expected to be the biggest
 
entertainment 
launch ever.
 
We're using price/pack architecture to more effectively target locations, 
consumer cohorts and channel opportunities. In large
-
format channels, we 
have reached national distribution of our new value
-
oriented 1.5
-
liter PET 
take
-
h
ome package. And in the cold channel, we have a broad package 
lineup including 16
-
ounce, 20
-
ounce and 1
-
liter packages to address a 
variety of consumer price points and occasion needs.
 
And as I mentioned earlier, we implemented pricing actions broadly acro
ss 
CSDs in the third quarter, above the industry average based on syndicated 
retail data, and we did this to help partially offset commodity inflation. So in 
beverages, do we have more work to do in North America beverages? Yes, 
we do. This is a competitiv
e business in a tough environment, and there are 
no quick fixes. We're intensely working away at it, and we're approaching it 
deliberately and sustainably.
 
Our third plan is to grow our nutrition business. Our nutrition products grew 
net revenue 8%, exclud
ing acquisitions. Our growth is coming from the 
success of Gatorade and the Tropicana initiatives I mentioned earlier and 
from strong Quaker international growth. In addition, our dairy platform 
continues to perform very well, notably in Russia through the
 
Wimm
-
Bill
-
Dann business, and in the Middle East through our joint venture with 
Almarai.
 
Our fourth plank is to unleash the power of Power of One. Over the past few 
months, our Power of One initiative has been the topic of speculation, largely 
fueled by a 
number of high
-
profile corporate split
-
ups. I firmly believe that 
PepsiCo's value is maximized as one company. It was created as an 
integrated snack and beverage business, and its success is tied to this 
combination. This has been true in the past and will
 
remain in the future.
 
So allow me to explain. In many international markets, we build an extended 
scale of our overall business with beverages by ourselves and with our 
franchise partners. Our snacks businesses in these markets then follow well, 
whether t
hrough greenfield or acquisition, benefiting from our beverage 
scale. Our beverage scale also allows us to attract great talent, makes us 
highly relevant to retailers and gives us visibility to consumers and other 
important local constituents.
 
Outside the 
Americas, our beverage and snack leadership is comprised of 
one team, and deeper into the organization, talent flows seamlessly between 
snacks and beverages. In fact, in some countries, we have very fully 
integrated snack and beverage business models with 
snack and beverage 
products carried on the same route truck.
 
Let me now turn to the Americas and focus particularly on Power of One in 
North America. To understand how we operate in North America, it's best to 
look at all elements of our value chain across
 
snacks and beverages. In our 
back office operations, we have shared services across accounting, 
transaction processing, call centers, IT. In R&D, we have synergies across 
multiple platforms, including flavorings, packaging, environmental initiatives. 
And 
in procurement, we have one global center of excellence with deep 
capability. In sales, we align with our key customers' strategic priorities by 
executing on top
-
to
-
top summits and joint innovation calls that utilize our 
full portfolio to share unique shop
per and consumer insights and provide 
cross
-
category product and merchandising solutions.
 
And in go
-
to
-
market, we are piloting promising in
-
store merchandising 
models, designed to reduce out
-
of
-
stocks in high
-
volume stores. Even in 
those areas where we fin
d the benefits of focus to outweigh scale, like many 
manufacturing and marketing, we're able to realize the Power of One benefit 
by sharing best practices and the transfer of ideas and talent between these 
2 businesses.
 
So in North America, we are 
already realizing some of the potential of Power 
of One, and we'll continue to deliberately and systematically pursue every 
opportunity area to realize its full potential as we go forward. Net
-
net, 
PepsiCo is an integrated company with 2 highly focused and
 
complementary 
businesses: snacks and beverages, with the nutrition business nested within 
these 2 segments. It is simply a clean, focused company that derives its 
strength from a world
-
class snacks business, augmented by a geographically 
diverse, iconic, 
profitable beverage business. Our success is absolutely 
linked to the Power of One.
 
So with that, let me turn the call over to Hugh to cover our fifth slide, 
prudent financial management. Hugh?
 
Hugh F. Johnston
 
Great. Thanks, Indra, and good morning, every
one. Let me comment on our 
financials for the quarter and our outlook. Core EPS was up 7% in the 
quarter, reflecting 6% core division operating profit growth, and 
approximately 1 point of corporate leverage. Core division operating profit 
growth was driven
 
by strong top line growth. We had good net price 
realization in the quarter across our businesses, as we took incremental 
pricing on top of this year's earlier pricing actions to partially offset 
commodity inflation.
 
As you know, commodity inflation has r
amped up as we moved in the 
second half of the year as we expected, so some of the incremental pricing 
is simply offsetting the incremental inflation. In addition, we experienced the 
reversal of the concentrate shipment timing benefits that we experienced 
in 
the second quarter. These items negatively impacted Europe's and EMEA's 
operating profit by about 4 and 9 percentage points in the quarter, 
respectively. As a consequence, operating margins compressed somewhat in 
the third quarter as we anticipated. Bel
ow the core division operating profit 
line, we had some deleverage from corporate unallocated costs, where we 
were lapping a gain in the prior year of approximately $60 million related to 
our post
-
retirement benefits program.
 
The tax rate in the quarter wa
s lower year
-
on
-
year based on an adjustment 
to our estimate of geographic profit mix, and our fully diluted share count for 
the quarter was approximately 1% lower year
-
on
-
year, reflecting the impact 
of our share repurchases. Net, the impact below the divis
ion operating profit 
line of lapping the gain in corporate costs, the lower tax rate and the 
reduced share count provided approximately 1 point of core EPS leverage.
 
Now let me comment briefly on pricing. Our third quarter pricing actions 
were implemented 
as planned, and the elasticities we've observed so far are 
largely in line with what we'd modeled. Looking now to the fourth quarter, 
we've reaffirmed our full year target for high single
-
digit core EPS growth on 
a 52
-
week U.S. dollar basis.
 
Our outlook fo
r commodities for the balance of year has not changed since 
the time we spoke to you on the Q2 call, and that's because by mid
-
year, we 
had the full calendar year substantially locked in through our hedging 
programs. The magnitude of commodity inflation ra
mps up consecutively 
from Q3 to Q4, and we have incremental pricing planned in the fourth 
quarter to partially offset the incremental inflation.
 
In part, our Q4 net price realization will be driven by recognizing a full 
quarter's impact of the actions we t
ook mid
-
Q3, and we're also considering 
some incremental actions for Q4. Currency will not provide the full year 
benefit we anticipated on the Q2 call, given the recent strength of the U.S. 
dollar, and for that reason, we've called down our estimate of the 
full year 
FX benefit from 2 points for the full year to 1 point for the full year.
 
On share repurchases, we're on track to achieve our share repurchase target 
of $2.5 billion for the full year with over 1.9 billion in share repurchases 
completed year
-
to
-
da
te through the third quarter. Now looking ahead, here's 
what we'll be focusing on for the balance of year. First, we're going to 
continue to support our brand building and consumer
-
facing initiatives. With 
the pricing we've put in the market, it's more imp
ortant than ever to clearly 
communicate the value of our brands and to keep our consumers engaged in 
our products and categories. Second, we're staying committed to our 
emerging markets initiatives, especially those extending our go
-
to
-
market 
reach and inc
reasing our level of consumer engagement. Third, we'll 
continue to carefully balance pricing and value as we manage through 
commodity inflation. We're doing this through pricing, price/pack 
architecture and providing products that appeal to the broad consu
mer 
spectrum from the value
-
conscious through premium seekers. And finally, 
we're accelerating and intensifying our productivity agenda across our entire 
compressible cost structure.
 
We're reducing packaging costs, energy use, empty miles, to name a few, 
s

consumers' experience with us. We're making progress here, but we believe 
there's still lots of opportunity to do more.
 
Looking further out, I know many of you are interested in hear
ing our 
outlook for 2012. We're right now in the process of finalizing our plans, 
which will occur over the next few weeks. We plan to get back to you by 
conference call in early December once our plans are finalized to review our 
outlook with you. This wi
ll include a game plan for 2012 and our views on 
commodity costs, investments, productivity programs and foreign exchange.

Can we just talk about Russia a bit? I think you mentioned it was up 70% 
over the last 2 years. Can you maybe comment on how Russia's d
one a bit 
more recently? And then also with how much you've invested in that market 
over the last few years, it sounds like you may have withdrawn some 
television advertising through the end of the year. So if you could just talk 
about some of the context 
on that decision.
 
Indra K. Nooyi
 
Yes, we have Zein Abdalla here, Kaumil, and he stands ready to answer your 
questions. Go ahead, Zein.
 
Zein Abdalla
 
Kaumil, look, it's always an absolute pleasure to talk about Russia. As you 
know, it's one of our largest bu
sinesses globally and a market that we really 
believe has an enormous long
-
term potential. The fundamentals in Russia 
are very strong. It's one of the countries that has got, I think, a very robust 
set of economic indicators, low debt ratios, good foreign 
exchange reserves 
and strong and, obviously, continuous leadership. Now, nonetheless, it has 
gone through some short
-
term challenges, as we've seen how commodity 
inflation and disposable incomes have challenged some of the consumer 
markets. And also, Russi
a has experienced some of its own local inflation. If 
you'll all recollect in 2010, they experienced a very hot summer that had a 
detrimental impact on their agricultural programs, and certainly, things like 
wheat and potato cost, and basic commodities wen
t up quite radically in 
terms of price. But against that backdrop, I have to say we're delighted with 
the performance of our business, competitively, very strong. We've 
continued to manage our pricing carefully to protect gross margins and to 
continue to d
rive revenue growth. And that's across all of the diverse 
categories in which we operate. Now, clearly, there will be a few more 
challenging months still ahead in Russia, and this is where scale of your 
operating business and the strength of your operating
 
businesses really, 
really counts. At more than 2x the scale of our nearest competitor, with this 
very diverse operating model across a diverse set of categories and really 
just a tremendous Power of One model, both in terms of the supply chain 
that we ope
rate across that geography, the strength of our go
-
to
-
market 
systems, both in traditional trade and organized trade. So yes, a very strong 
performance competitively in Russia. Now let me just turn to the comment 
you made about advertising. I mean, clearly,
 
in these type of volatile 
conditions and in a developing market, one of the key things is stay agile 
with where you make your investments. We've continued to make 
investments in Russia, but we have emphasized in our investments in go
-
to
-
market systems and
 
our selling capability. We've expanded significantly the 

that very broad
-
based business. We've continued to invest very strongly in 
coolers and racks because driving our single
-
serve 
business, driving our 
traditional
-
trade business and having a platform to leverage all of those 
categories across is critical to our long
-
term future. So we're pleased both 
with the short
-
term performance. We are maintaining investment, but a 
slightly diff
erent emphasis in the shape of that investment.

Hugh F. Johnston
 
Dara, I appreciate the question. And of course, there's desire to hear it right 
now. But I think to get int
o any level of specificity that would be helpful to 
you in 2012 is just simply premature. With the commodities markets as 
volatile as they are, with the economies as volatile as they are, to start 
getting into where we might go, I think, would probably jus
t

it's too early 
as we sit in mid

--
 
and as we think 
about not just 2012 but Q4 as well, the things we clearly need to do are, 
number one, we clearly need to ensure that our brands are sharply defined 
and well support
ed; we need to make sure that our pricing is competitive; 
we need to make sure that our innovation is well supportive; and to fund all 
of that, we need to be sure that we absolutely max out on productivity. So 
when you talk about what are the things that w
e're working on, it's truly 
working on those things. And if we do those things successfully, I'm 
confident we'll win in the marketplace, and we'll win financially, and 
investors will be well

standpoint, would i

international too?
 
Hugh F. Johnston
 
Yes, it's really the things that we've talked about up to now. So the Gatorade 
pricing, of course, is going in, in Q4. The single

serve pricing in Frito

Lay is 
going in, 
in Q4. And then there are some select areas internationally where 
we're pricing. But by and large, even by now, it's in the marketplace pretty 
much.

John A. Faucher

JP Morgan 
Chase & Co, Research Division
 
Was wondering if you could sort of go through by the divisions and talk 
about the elasticities. It sounded like when you presented at the Barclay's 
Back
-
to
-
School Conference back in September that you were more 
concerned about
 
the elasticities, and that didn't show up as much as I think 
maybe I had feared in the volumes. So can you talk a little bit about what 
you're seeing in your different divisions, particularly in North America?
 
Hugh F. Johnston
 
Sure, John, I'd be happy to.
 
Up at Barclays, John Compton and I were both 
there and what we had talked about in the snack world was we thought at 
the time that the elasticities were a little bit 
--
 
were shallow or that 
consumer response was a little bit stronger than we had expected 
on large 
bag. And we've sharpened some of our price points and some of our 
promotional strategies in order to address that. Single
-
serve, on the other 
hand, which has gone into the market more recently, and we hadn't talked 
about that up at Barclays, we've
 
actually 
--
 
and it's early days, but we've 
actually seen that pricing stick well. In fact, if anything, the elasticities have 
been a little bit more favorable to us than we'd expected. Beverages, as you 
know, and particularly, in North America is a comple
x evaluation because 
there's category elasticity as well as cross
-
competitive elasticity. I think 
we're, at this point, seeing that as we've gotten through kind of the initial 
period of pricing, I think we've seen the elasticity settle in about where we 
ex
pected. From an international perspective, I don't think there have been 
any particular surprises. The comments that we made up at Barclays were 
probably more North America oriented. So I think we've gotten to a point 
now where the pricing is reasonably se
ttled in. Of course, in beverages, it's a 
competitive marketplace, and we'll always have to address that as a part of 
managing the business.
 
Indra K. Nooyi
 

taking in the marketplac
e puts us in uncharted territory. We haven't had this 
amount of pricing in a long time, and so I think pricing actions require 
courage. You've got to stick with the pricing actions and let it stick and not 
let any short
-
term share changes disrupt your long
-
term direction. And so 
our experience is that when you put in place significant pricing actions, it 
takes several periods before it takes root. And as leaders in many of the 
categories, we just have to have the courage to stick it out. And that interim 
pe

positive benefits that accrue to us from the pricing actions.
 
John A. Faucher

JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division
 
Great. And so as we look out, you talked about taking even more
 
pricing as 
we look out into the fourth quarter. So should we expect another tick down 
into the volume? Any sort of 
--
 
any thoughts as we look out sequentially 

there's not big im
pacts incrementally from the next round?
 
Hugh F. Johnston
 
Well, it's always tough to project where competition is going on that. 
Obviously, that has an impact as well. But I feel like we've gotten the pricing 
reasonably burned in. I think what we're doing 
right now with Gatorade and 
with single

Crédit Suisse

Indra, you have Gatorade and juice marketers that surely want more 
funding, and you have newly hired soft drink marketers that need funding to 
close competitive gaps and to win. Do you have enough efficiency and cost 
reductions identi
fied to fund the step
-
ups that are necessary for these 
marketers to win and still hit the long

term guidance? And similarly, do you 
also have enough funding sources identified to step up the U.S. marketing 
programs that you like internationally?
 
Indra K. N

Carlos, I think Hugh touched on this when he answered one of the earlier 
questions. One of the things we do is we focus a lot on productivity, and we 
look at every aspect of the cost structure of the company. We look to see 
where we can take out layer
s or inefficiencies, make the company more 
agile, more flexible. And in making the company more productive, we take 
these productivity savings and then we use some of it to cover commodity 
costs, and the rest of it goes into investments. But the priority i
s 
investments in the brands and driving innovation and making sure our 
businesses are well supported first, and then it is on covering commodities. 
And that's the game that 
--
 
Hugh outlined that we want to play going 
forward, and that's what we're focused 
on right now. As you look at our 
North American beverage brands, Gatorade needed immediate attention 
about 3, 3.5 years ago, and that's where we started. We put the money, we 
put the effort behind it with enormous success. Then we went to work on 
Tropicana
, again, success. We went to work on Pepsi Max. We went to work 
on Sierra Mist. We bolstered Mountain Dew. And every one of these, 
deliberately invested behind in a very difficult environment, is yielding 
results. Our next effort is to focus on brand Pepsi
 
and to keep all of the other 
initiatives we're doing going. So I think we are focused on the right things. 
And as a company, we are focused on unleashing enough productivity to put 
back into the brand.

captured. As I mentioned earlier, we've certainly sharpened some of
 
our

Mark Swartzberg

Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division
 
Indra, a question on North America as we think of the strategy in beverages 
looking forward. Could you give us an update about how you think the 
business stand
s in terms of the price/pack positioning today versus what it 
might be in light of consumer needs? And then, secondly, as you think about 
Power of One, how is that in any way preventing or aiding even your ability 
to work with other suppliers beyond snacks
 
to promote your beverage 
brands?
 
Indra K. Nooyi
 
Let me start with the second one then come to the first one. I think on 
Power of One, beverage into snacks works very well together now with John 
Compton leading the Power of One Council and with Al Carey ru
nning 
beverages. Al Carey was the father of Power of One, which started 12 years 
ago. And now with Al Carey running Pepsi Americas beverages, I think 
you're going to see a level of cooperation and idea generation that's going to 
be quite impressive. So I r
emain very, very optimistic about Power of One 
now beginning to start driving the top line even more than it used to before. 
Doesn't stop us from working with other people. I'm going to have John talk 
about that because with a lot of our customers, we do P
ower of One 
programs, which cover multiple categories. So John, do you want to touch 
on Power of One with other categories and whether our beverages and 
snacks prevents you from working with anybody else?
 
John C. Compton
 
Yes, Indra and Mark, within consume
r packaged goods, I think we're best 
suited to work with ourselves in terms of food and beverage product because 
we haven't fully tapped that potential out. Clearly, there are other related 
categories that make these holidays stronger for the retailer that
 
we can 
bundle with. And to your point, Indra, having Al running the beverage 
business and now Tom Greco, who also worked in the Power of One center in 
the past, working together across North America, where you'll see us 
beginning in Q1 begin to unleash, I
 
think, some new benefits behind Power 
of One. Customer, channel, consumer promotion and looking at ideas that 
can grow horizontally, paying off a consumer benefit from snacks to 
beverages.
 
Indra K. Nooyi
 
But you've also worked with many other retailer pro
ducts. Game Time 
included multiple products...
 
John C. Compton
 
Multiple products.
 
Indra K. Nooyi
 
So again, it's retailer specific. You don't do it on a blanket basis. But there 
are multiple retailer specific programs we do, which cover multiple 
categories.
 
And so 
--
 
and they've all been very successful. So Power of One, 
I think, is the unique differentiator for PepsiCo. We are an integrated snack 
and beverage company, and so that's what we are. Let me talk a bit about 
North America. The North American bever
age business is a terrific business 
and a tough business, the 2 Ts. And I'd say that it's a business, which is 
large. We are the largest liquid refreshment beverage player. We have 23, 
24 share of this LRB market, and we have leadership brands in this busi
ness. 
This business has also, for many, many years, been one where it's very 
profitable, but the profit pool has not grown. Between the bottlers and the 
franchise company, the profit pool has not grown as much as it needs to, 
and that's been the challenge 
for this business because it's a repertoire 
category. There's no clear demarcation between each business. It's a 
repertoire category, and how you play this business between the 2 or 3 big 
players and with the pure plays determines how you perform quarter i
n and 
quarter out. From PepsiCo's perspective, I think that especially in the period 
about 2004 to 2006, I think we hit the volume pedal a little too much when 
we perhaps could have invested more in the brands. And then we went into 
this tremendous economi
c downturn, and now, what we are looking at since 
about 2007, how do we take each of our brands and make sure they're 
supported correctly and we are driving them to remain the leaders in their 
categories? We started with Gatorade, tremendous success; Tropi
cana, 
success. We are now beginning to work on Sierra Mist, which again is now 
growing. Pepsi Max doubled in size. We started to invest behind Diet Pepsi, 
trademark Pepsi, Lipton Tea. Brand by brand, we're beginning to work on 
brand investments. And along 
with brand investments, given the new 
economic realities, we are beginning to think about creative ways to 
implement revenue management and price/pack without creating a problem 
with retailers, with consumers trading down, because we have to make sure 
that
 
any price/pack architecture we do makes 
--
 
keeps the retailer whole. So 
this is not an easy one to just put in new packaging. We have to work very 
carefully with retailers to make sure there's no trade down in the category. 
So we are working through all o
f these strategies as we speak. And the good 
news is that we are seeing success when we invest behind the brand, when 
we focus on execution. We're seeing success in each of the brands and their 
performance. But this category's so big, it has so many brands
 
and so many 
categories, you can't try to address all the businesses in one broad brush. So 
I think it's a deliberate sustainable strategy, Mark. And we're feeling 
cautiously optimistic about where we are headed in this North American 
beverage business.

That's great. And if I could, on one follow

up, could you speak

could you 
just build on what you said, Indra, there, specifically, as it relates to the 
convenience channel, that concern abo
ut consumers trading down, but that 
interest in improving revenue management?
 
Indra K. Nooyi
 
Again, I think every time you put a package

and remember, the 20

great value. We
 
sell a lot of it, and we are

John C. Compton
 
11 out of the 15.
 
Indra K. Nooyi
 
11 out of the 15 top products in convenience stor
es are PepsiCo products. 
So this is a very 
--
 
it's a wonderful channel. It's still growing. Even in this 
economic situation, it's growing because the up
-
and
-
down
-
the
-
street 
consumer is still using soft drinks and snacks as their moment of pleasure. 
So we l
ike this business a lot. We have to make sure that we don't trade 
down volume, or we don't trade down packages, which make consumers go 
to a different package size without getting the appropriate value benefit 
from that. So we are looking through what's th
e right package to give 
consumers enough beverage to drink at a price that delivers unbeatable 
value to the consumer. And we're doing it in beverages. But more 
importantly, we're looking at doing it in a bundled way between snacks and 
beverages, so the con
sumer can go into the store and get a phenomenal 
PepsiCo beverage and a Frito

Lay snack at a combined price that generates 
enormous value to the consumer rather than just go head

it's 
nice to have 11 out of the 15 top new

Lay North America. It sounds like the 
unmeasured channel performance is much stronger
 
than what we're seeing 
in the measured channel data, so maybe a little bit more color around sort of 
the unmeasured channel performance. And John, maybe just talk a little bit 
about the competitive dynamics that you're seeing in the marketplace. 
You've ta
lked about sharpening the promotional price points. But in the 
measured channel data, at least you're starting to see the gap widening 
again versus some of the smaller players. Is that a concern? Is there more 
work to do just in terms of just tackling the 
competitive dynamics?
 
John C. Compton
 
Judy, thank you for the question. Let me start with the bigger picture first 
around what Frito
-
Lay does so well is we go where the consumer is 
shopping, and we've talked about low, medium and high
-
income consumers. 
And
 
as you saw in our release, more than our 
--
 
more than normal of our 
growth came out of channels that are unmeasured. So the C
-
store channel, 
the club channel, the dollar channel. Those disproportionally drove growth 
for us this quarter. Within the ""tradit
ional measured channels,"" it is true that 
our share was down roughly about 1 point on dollar share. Most of that went 
to private label. And in this down economy, we chose not to price down to 
cover private label, okay? There is some growth in sort of highe
r income 
products that we are going to address in Q4 going forward. And you'll see 
that when I do the Back

Okay. And then, Hugh, just fourth quarter, obviously, you're sticking to the 
27% tax rate for the full year. So sounds like the tax rate will ramp up in the 
fourth quarter, and then the corporate expenses, maybe it's 
not going to be 
up as much as what we saw in the third quarter. And then I'm just 
wondering about the impact of the 53rd week. I know your earnings 
guidance is really on a core 52
-
week basis, but is there some element of the 
--
 
having the 53rd week actuall
y beneficial to looking at a 52

week numbers, 
because on the 53rd week, it's not as profitable?
 
Hugh F. Johnston
 
Yes. So, Judy, 3 questions there. Let me take them one at a time. From the 
standpoint of the tax rate, you're right. We've said that we'll be 
a
pproximately 27%, so that implies a higher tax rate in the fourth quarter. 
That's correct. Number two, you asked about the corporate expenses. From 
a growth standpoint, the numbers won't be as high because we're 
overlapping a big credit last year. From a r
un rate perspective, you can 
probably expect them to be reasonably consistent with what you've seen in 
the first 3 quarters. And then number three, in terms of the 53rd week, 
anything 
--
 
you're right. We talk on a 52
-
week basis, and anything that we 
would 
think about doing with the 53rd week, if we were going to do anything 
with that, we'd probably get back to you on the December call. So no news 
there to talk about on the 53rd week.

Sanford Bernstein.
 
Ali Dibadj

Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division
 
Just wanted to ask a little bit more about investments and elasticities 
because it looks like if you back out Latin America for this quarter at least, 
U.S. beverages was do
wn something like 2%, and CSD is probably higher 
than that, given Gatorade, which has, longer term, been somewhat of a 
trend. So what do you really need to do longer term, and maybe your peers 
too, to see this trend abate? And you said in an earlier questi
on that when 
you do focus on a business, when you do apply resources, then you show 
success, and I think that's been clear. But how many of those holes are 
there still to plug, particularly, given your drop in asset sales over the past 
several years at the
 
company? And again, it's kind of a question of what's 
the right level of add to sales and price growth that, longer term, you need 
to deliver to show what you want from a volume perspective? And again, I'm 
not asking a 2012 question. So, hopefully, you do
n't use that as an excuse. 

positioning in it.
 
Hugh F. Johnston
 
Yes, Ali, this is Hugh. That was certainly an impressive question. Let me try 
to parse it and address some of the pieces. You
 
talked about CSDs, and 
obviously, CSDs are an important part of our portfolio. But keep in mind, we 
do play an LRB game, and that's 
--
 
we've been doing that for more than a 
decade. We were certainly the first to go and do that. But undeniably, CSDs 
are an
 
important category. So what do we need to do in CSDs? Obviously, 
we've got a price to be competitive. And in doing that, we've got to balance 
commodity costs, we've got to balance consumer, and we've got to balance 
input 
--
 
commodity cost, consumer and co
mpetitor. Those are the 3 pieces 
that we balance in dealing with that. In doing that, we also need to make 
sure that our brands are sharply defined, and we need to make sure that our 
innovation is very strong. The category, obviously, it's a challenging 
ca
tegory. Clearly, anyone that looks at the numbers can see that, and that's 
true for the broad category. I'm not just speaking of PepsiCo's business. 
Now what are the things that we've tried to do for the long run? The long 
run in consumer categories always
 
comes back to innovation, and the thing 
that we've obviously done is we've innovated from a flavors perspective to 
drive some level of incremental growth. We've innovated from a branding 
perspective in order to create interesting positioning for consumers
. And 
then as we've discussed in the past, we're innovating from a sweetener 
perspective, which we do think is a meaningful unlock in the category, and 
we've gone down a couple of paths with that. First, around the newer 
sweeteners, such as stevia. And the
n, obviously, we got some relationships 
with flavor
-
enhancer companies, which have enabled us to try products like 
Pepsi Max and to be able to do those things successfully. So I think in terms 
of CSDs and, for that matter, the broader LRB category, the key
 
to being 
successful here is going to be making sure our pricing is competitive, making 
sure that our brands are very sharply defined and innovating on product 
over time to ensure that we actually can differentiate ourself clearly from 
competition. That's 
the strategy we're following, as Indra referenced on the 
script that we read earlier. We think we're successful in moving that agenda 
forward, but we also fully acknowledge that we've got more work to do on 
that, and that's what we'll 
--
 
we're going to con
tinue to work at. We view it 
as a terrific business, and we view it as one that generates a lot of cash for 
shareholders that we feel very, very good about. So it's certainly one that 
we're going to continue to compete vigorously in.

How much does it cost to do what?

To do all of that. So does margin compression kind of have to be an outcome 
of this? I mean, you've clearly increased investment pretty significantly 
again with successes, but you've increased the investment.
 
So as you go 
forward for the categories you operate in and maybe disproportionally CSDs, 
is the investment return kind of getting worse as you go forward here and 
forever will be, I guess?
 
Hugh F. Johnston
 
Yes, I don't think so. I think what we're 
trying to do right now 
--
 
and 
obviously, we're thinking about 2012. We're certainly assessing all of those 
things. One of the questions that was asked earlier on the call was around 
marketers looking for more money, and we feel very good about the 
marketin
g team we have. And listen, it's been my experience over 25 years 
that good marketers always ask for more money. It's tradition in effect. I 
think as we go through our planning process, we'll determine what we think 
are the right investments in order to ge
nerate competitive success, as well 
as to generate financial success. And to talk about 2012 and beyond at this 
point, it would probably just be a bit premature.
 
Indra K. Nooyi
 
Yes, Ali, I think the other thing too is I wouldn't separate out any costs and 
talk about what does it cost in North America, because investments we make 
in technology, Hugh talked about sweeteners, enhancers. I can talk about 
processing technologies that we're investing in to take down the cost of 
processing in all these products, a
pply across our global beverage portfolio. 
So some of these investments we are making are not just for North America. 
We've got to think of it as how can we drive the overall beverage business. 
So I think in the context of all of that, given the size and t
he profitability and 
the cash flow generation that we get from our North American beverage 
business and global beverages, we feel pretty good about where we're 
headed. And all that it takes is a couple of breakthroughs which, as I said in 
one of our earlie
r interactions, we are very, very close to these 
breakthroughs. It's always the last 5% or 10% that you've got to sweat the 
details on, which is what we are doing now. But when these do 
--
 
these 
breakthroughs do get commercialized, it's quite a breakthroug
h. And so we 
feel quite optimistic about the prospects for this business.

Okay. Just one quick one. It sounds also that you're a lot more optimistic, at 
least, versus what we've heard on pric
ing rationality in North America versus 
kind of the language that was in Q2. Is that a fair read, again, pricing 
rationality in the U.S. in particular versus your competitor?
 
Hugh F. Johnston
 
Ali, pricing is sort of a week
-
by
-
week, period
-
by
-
period thing i
n this business 
and particularly in the beverage business. So I think what we're saying is we 
feel comfortable that we're getting pricing in place, but we'll see what 
happens.
 
Indra K. Nooyi
 
Let me just summarize this call. We're encouraged by the balance 
of top line 
and bottom line performance in the quarter across snacks and beverages, 
and we are totally focused on and committed to our 5 key planks, and we're 
encouraged by the progress we're making on each of them. And as we said 
on our earlier comments, 
we'll come back to you in early December to 
provide our outlook for 2012. Thank you very much for your interest in our 
company and for your time this morning. Thank you.

Indra Nooyi
 
Thank you, Jamie and good morning everyone, and thank you very much for 
joining us thi
s morning. As we close our 2013 and look ahead to 2014 and 

 

sustained performance. We are executing on our plan to deliver on ou
r 
stated goals. This execution has enabled us to deliver and in many cases 
exceed all of our financial goals in 2013.
 
Our portfolio is complementary and our geographic and product portfolio 
positions us well for sustainable growth. We believe that our port
folio, as 
currently constructed, positions us to maximize value creation. As a result, 
we are not making significant structural changes, including to North 
American Beverages.
 
We are extending our $1 billion annual productivity savings target through 
2019.
 
Our 2014 guidance is in line with our long term financial targets, and 

confidence in the long term durability of these targets.
 
Consistent with our commitment to disciplined capital 

increasing our cash returns to shareholders by 35% in 2014, significantly 
stepping up both our dividends and share repurchases to a total of $8.7 
billion while maintaining appropriate capital investment in the business.
 
Finally, and most 
importantly, our recently completed [all health] survey 
tells us that our associates are motivated, engaged, and positive about being 
part of, and the future of, PepsiCo.
 
So let me walk you through each of these themes. As you know, over the 
past few years

reshaped and will continue to shape our industry. We made the required 
investments and changes to preemptively transform ourselves to capitalize 
on the opportunities these shifts presented and to po
sition the company for 
long term growth and value creation.
 
First, we expanded our presence and plans to grow in developing and 
emerging markets in response to a shift in the [unintelligible] of global 
growth.
 
Second, we continue to balance our portfolio o
f offerings to include more 
nutrition and healthy offerings while increasing the [permissibility] of our 
social snacks and beverages by reducing calories and sodium in key products 

 

e stepped up investment in R&D, digital capabilities, and food 
quality and safety in acknowledgement that social media is an ever
-
increasing powerful force with greater availability of more sophisticated tools 
and product formulations and food safety and s
ecurity are now greatly 
enhanced by more tools providing ingredient traceability.
 
Fourth, we invested to enhance the equity of our $22 billion brand, which 
together accounts for more than 70% of our total revenue. We also 
upgraded our revenue management sk
ills to give us the ability to take 
pricing.
 
Fifth, we built a cultural productivity into the company to deal with the 
reality of a volatile and inflationary commodity environment.
 
Sixth, we designed sustainability into our operations in response to growin
g 
environmental consciousness.
 
And lastly, on the talent front, we upgraded our skills through selective 
hiring in several new and emerging areas, and we completely revamped our 
talent management processes and training curriculum with a view to 
equipping o
ur people with the skills needed to perform better in a volatile 
environment.
 
Through these transformative actions, we have fundamentally changed the 
profile of the company. Our product profile has grown from fun for you to a 
more balanced offering of good
 
for you, better for you, and fun for you 
products.
 

global footprint, and our culture has shifted to a decentralized one with 
businesses operating completely independently through what
 
we refer to as 

entrepreneurial ownership culture with the benefits of global scale and 
coordination.
 
As a result, PepsiCo today is positioned to deliver, over the long term, top
-
tier financial per
formance and value creation for our shareholders. Our 2013 
results demonstrate our portfolio strength and execution capabilities. 
Despite a challenging macro
-
environment, we delivered strong and well
-
balanced operating performance in 2013. Organic revenue 
grew mid
-
single 
digits, both gross and operating margins expanded, cash flow is very strong, 
and we managed our portfolio of businesses effectively.
 
Let me comment briefly on each of our businesses, beginning with North 
American beverages. We are 

North American beverages but the category remains challenged. We have 
managed the business responsibly, achieving 2.5 points of price realization 
at retail while stabilizing our share performance in measured chann
els and 
generating profit growth.
 
We were especially pleased with the successful innovation in North American 
beverages with four products, Mountain Dew Kickstart, Gatorade Frost 
Glacier Cherry, Starbucks Iced Coffee, and Lipton Pure Leaf, on track to 
achi
eve $100 million in annual retail sales. This success was realized with 
strict execution against initiatives and the stepped up investment levels we 
made in 2012. We feel good about North American beverages.
 
Frito Lay in North America delivered consistent,
 
solid performance 
throughout 2013. Organic revenue growth of 4% in the quarter and for the 
full year was well
-
balanced between volume and price. Our innovation was 
also very strong at Frito Lay, including Tostitos Cantina, Lays Do Us A 
Flavor, Cheetos Mix
 
Ups, and the new flavors of Doritos Jack and Tostitos 
Artisan.
 
And the business delivered solid operating leverage and margin expansion, 
with core constant currency operating profit growth of 7% for the quarter 
and 6% for the full year. We have good momen


brand, and go
-
to
-
market systems. So again, we feel very good about the 
outlook for this business.
 
Our other developed markets also showed solid perfo
rmance during 2013, 
with organic revenue growth in our overall Western Europe business. While 
macroeconomic data shows signs of improvement, developed world 
economies outside the United States remain sluggish. We have relatively 
limited exposure to slow gr
owth areas such as Southern Europe and Japan, 
so the shape of our portfolio shields us from these challenges to a degree.
 
Turning now to our developing and emerging markets, these continue to 
perform well, despite some volatility in key regions. As a group
, our D&E 
markets posted 10% organic revenue growth for the year, with double
-
digit 
growth in China in both snacks and beverages, double
-
digit growth in 
Pakistan, high single
-
digit growth in Saudi Arabia, Brazil, Mexico, and 
Turkey, just to name a few.
 
The
se markets have a long run rate for growth, driven by increasing demand 
for our convenient, on
-
trend, affordable products supported by rapidly 

place us in an advantaged position.
 
The sh
ape and resilience of our portfolio, combined with strong execution 
across the value chain, enables us to meet, and in many instances exceed, 
our 2013 financial goals. Organic revenue grew 4%, in line with our mid
-
single digit target. Core operating margin
 
expanded 40 basis points, in line 
with our goal of 30 to 50 basis point expansion.
 
We delivered over $900 million of productivity savings, slightly ahead of our 
target. Core constant currency EPS grew 9%, ahead of our 2013 guidance, 
and at the high end of
 
our long term, high single
-
digit goal.
 
Free cash flow, excluding certain items, was $8.2 billion, well ahead of our 
2013 goal, driven by exceptional working capital management and 
disciplined capital spending. Core net return on invested capital improved 
110 basis points, 60 points ahead of our target, and cash returns to 
shareholders were $6.4 billion, right in line with our target.
 
So, we feel very good about the financial performance of the business. Just 

 
business to ensure the 
sustainability of our performance well into the future. [A&M] as a percentage 
of sales was up 70 basis points compared to 2011, and we continue to invest 
in innovation. Our R&D spending has increased over 25% since 2011.
 
We improved
 
our capabilities in food quality and safety, invested in multiple 
process technologies, both to reduce cost and deliver new capabilities, and 
we invested in product innovation. In 2013, we had one of our most 
successful years ever in new product launches,
 
with six new products in the 
United States, on track to achieve $100 million in annual retail sales. And 
this is a first for PepsiCo.
 

distributed across snacks and beverages, both o
f which are attractive global 

of nutritious products, including brands like Quaker in grain, Tropicana in 
naked fruits and vegetables, and Gatorade in sports nutrition.
 
Our geog
raphic footprint is very well balanced, with 35% of our net revenue 
in high
-
growth developing and emerging markets and about two
-
thirds in 
stable, highly profitable developed markets.
 

 
power 

products are purchased together and consumed together. Our presence in 
beverages supports our snacks growth, and the heft of our portfolio 
positions us as the largest food and be
verage business in many of our key 
markets, and this makes us a key partner to retailers and food service 
customers.
 
We realize $800 million to $1 billion in annual savings by operating our 
business as one. Our priorities for managing the portfolio are ver
y clear. In 
developed markets snacks, where we have an incredibly strong business 
that combines high market share and high margins, we intend to defend and 
grow our share of salty snacks.
 
We want to grow organically into the broader macro snacks space, and
 
this 
will leverage our core salty snacks foundation capabilities to capture a 
broader range of day parts and locations. And we want to leverage our 
beverage business to increase our snack trends in the large, profitable food 
service business.
 
In developed
 
market beverages, a huge category where we have good 
competitive positions in many markets, here we intend to sensibly defend 
our LRB share and improve margins and returns with an intense focus on 
unlocking productivity, especially in North America. And w
e are focused on 
achieving product disruption and differentiation through science
-
based R&D , 
especially in the area of sweetener innovation.
 
In our developing and emerging markets, where we have strong salty snack 
shares in most markets, and leadership of
 
[parity] system beverage 
positions in many key markets, we intend to continue to build our share 
positions, capture our fair share of growing beverage locations, and 
selectively pursue tuck
-
in acquisitions to build out our scale and our 
geographic footpri
nt.
 
And in the nutrition arena, where we are one of the leading [unintelligible] 
globally in everyday nutrition, we intend to benefit from the high growth of 
this category, leveraging the presence and scale of our existing businesses.
 
Now, these category c
ountry combinations, with their demographic tailwinds 
and related product diversity, give us line of sight to our mid
-
single digit 
organic revenue growth goal. From a category perspective, we expect our 
global beverage business to grow revenue in the low t
o mid
-
single digits and 
global snacks and nutrition to grow revenue in the mid
-
single digits.
 
From a market perspective, we expect developed markets to grow revenue 
low to mid
-
single digits and our developing and emerging markets to grow 
revenue high singl
e to low double
-
digits.
 
Based on this growth profile, and because we have full operating businesses 
in snacks, we expect about two
-
thirds of our revenue growth to come from 
snacks, and from a geographic perspective, about two
-
thirds of our revenue 
growth t
o come from developing and emerging markets.
 
As a result, over time, our business mix will gradually shift to be more 
heavily weighted toward snacks and more heavily weighted towards 
developing and emerging markets than we are today. This revenue growth 
pr

 
So how does this all translate to future results? From a geographic 
perspective, each market type plays an important role in our portfolio. 
Emerging markets have primarily top line growt
h drivers, with some 
potential for margin improvement in the short term. Developing markets 
drive balanced top line growth and margin and ROIC improvement, and 
developed markets contribute relatively less to top line growth but at very 
attractive margins a
nd returns, and are prodigious cash flow generators, and 
this is true of both snacks and beverages.
 
So, holistically, this portfolio provides a platform for balanced growth, 
margin, and return improvement for sustainable future growth opportunities, 
cement
ing the durability of our long term core constant currency EPS 
algorithm and superior cash returns to shareholders, all of which leads to top 
tier total shareholder return.
 
But as many of you know, we did commit to reexamine our North American 
beverage bus

challenges in the category. So let me start off by saying that our highly 
integrated food and beverage portfolio positions us as a vital supplier to our 
retail trade customers, where we are
 
the single largest supplier in many 
instances.
 
Decoupling our beverage and snack business in North America would 
significantly reduce our relevance to our customers. Within most of our 
largest grocery channel customers, we would fall from being the top su
pplier 
to a top four or below supplier, and in the mass merchant drug channels, we 
would drop below the top 10.
 
In addition, we would forfeit a number of synergies within North America, 
including shared procurement, consumer and customer insights 
organizations, joint advertising, and use of major properties like the NFL and 
Major League Baseball, and joint promotional and display activity and 
coordinated national account activity.
 
So, with all of this as a background, we undertook our evaluation of
 
the 
overall category and our competitive position within it. Let me provide you 
with some facts. First, liquid refreshment beverages in North America 
continue to be the largest food and beverage category by a wide margin. It 
drives tremendous traffic and 
cash flow for retailers. It also plays a very 
important role in food away from home, where food service customers are 
increasingly using beverage offerings to drive excitement and profitability.
 
And PepsiCo is relatively well
-
positioned within the LRB cate
gory. We are the 
LRB leader in measured channels. We are the clear share leader in non
-
carbs, with leading positions in many segments. Our CSD portfolio has a 
0.8x relative market share, with Mountain Dew the fastest
-
growing CSD 
trademark. We are making sl
ow and steady progress growing our share in 
food away from home. We believe the opportunities are many.
 

has slowed, and within this overall industry, the cola segment is particularly 
challenged, as consumers look for alternative beverage offerings.
 

beverage portfolio, and less than 15% of our total North American business. 
We believe that the cola category is stil
l relevant to consumers, but is going 
through a secular change as consumers look to address the twin issues of 
calories and artificial sweeteners.
 
We have several great tasting cola product variations using zero calorie 
natural sweeteners blended with suga

in the world. And so far, these test results are promising. However, our U.S. 
launches of these sweeteners will begin this year, primarily with non
-
cola 
products, to build and test consumer acceptance before we launc
h low
-
calorie naturally sweetened cola products.
 
Additionally, we are encouraged by the progress we made in 2013 in our 
North American beverage performance. Our objective was to hold or grow 
LRB value share relative to our primary competitor. And as you ca
n see, our 
LRB value share performance for the full year 2013 was even with primary 
competition, based on IRI all measured channel data.
 

realization at retail across virtually every major 
subcategory, while holding 
our value share position. Net
-
net, we feel cautiously optimistic about our 
prospects in the North American LRB market.
 
So when we reevaluated structural alternatives for the North American 
beverage business, we established very c
lear principles to guide our 
decision. First, we would not return to the contracted franchisee/franchiser 
model of the past. We needed a structure that ensures rapid decision 
making with low coordination costs and friction. We needed to limit value 
chain d
ecoupling and operating redundancies.
 
We did not want to competitively disadvantage our North American beverage 
business, and we wanted to maintain control over core strategic activities of 
our global beverage business, such as marketing, innovation, and R
&D. We 
knew we had to maintain or advance our alignment with national accounts, 

PepsiCo system.
 
So our assessment was driven by a highly objective consideration of what 
structure woul
d create the greatest, most sustainable shareholder value. 
And we studied numerous structures, from a full separation of North 
American beverages from PepsiCo to a separate of some elements of the 
traditional bottling operations, and everything else in bet
ween. We used the 
best bankers and consultants to think about structural alternatives, all with 
an eye to creating long term shareholder value.
 
And after an exhaustive analysis and review with our board of directors, 

erages creates value and is 

among other things, result in loss of significant synergies, both between 
snacks and beverages in North America and between North American 
beverages an
d the balance of our international beverage operations.
 
It would significantly decrease our relevance to U.S. retailers and jeopardize 
our ability to grow in food service. It would make our remaining international 
beverage business less competitive, and fi
nally, it would forfeit the potential 

benefits realization of our A&M investment and year
-
end productivity 
savings.
 

ican 
beverage business in its current form maximizes shareholder value, because 
our current ownership structure allows for optimally aligned objectives and 
execution, allows us to capture potential upside from innovation and 
productivity, enables us to con
tinue to benefit from scale advantages, and 
finally, it continues to provide access to the U.S. cash flow that is so 
important to our shareholder cash return model.
 

know, back in 2012, w
e announced a major three
-
year, $3 billion program 
enabled in part by our SAP investments, which began in 2002 and our new 
operating model, which we put in place in 2011, that allows us to lift and 
shift best practices across the company to improve both th
e efficiency and 
effectiveness of our enterprise.
 
Last year, we also told you that we had begun work on the next tranche of 
productivity, mostly enabled by our operating model, which is gaining 
traction in the company, and the availability of new technolog
y and tools. So 
today we are pleased to announce this next productivity program, $5 billion 
over five years, beginning in 2015, and also to tell you that we are on track 
to achieve the $3 billion, three
-
year program we announced in 2012.
 
So as we enter our
 
next phase of productivity, let me provide some color to 

operations to replace labor with capital. An example here would be further 
automating packaging in our snack plant, where se
condary packaging hot of 
products remains a highly manual process.
 
The second area is expanding shared services, including global financial 
shared services for the handling of routine back office transaction 
processing. The third area is restructuring manu
facturing to optimize our 
global manufacturing footprint. Examples here would be evolving from local 
to regional manufacturing networks and adopting more third
-
party 
manufacturing.
 
And the fourth area is restructuring our go
-
to
-
market systems to optimize 
o
ur distribution network. Let me give you a couple of examples under the 
go
-
to
-
market systems. The first is our global enterprise system, or GES, at 
Frito Lay North America. GES is significantly reducing the amount of manual 
handling of our products up and 
down the supply chain.
 
Because we have such a high transaction rate, every touch of a case or a 
bag drives a lot of labor cost. GES minimizes product touches between the 
plant and customer location through streamlined distribution center 
networks, in some 
cases delivering direct from the plant to the store. The 
benefits extend to capital, labor, inventory, and fleet fuel reductions.
 
This model continues to roll out across Frito Lay North America and is now 
being applied to the North American beverage busine
ss, where we are 
maximizing asset utilization by reducing distribution centers, leveraging 
automation, deploying fleet and route trucks more efficiently, and reducing 

with the progre
ss being made, and have a long runway of savings 
opportunities ahead of us.
 
Another initiative is implementation across PepsiCo of the global 
transportation management system, a leading example of global IT systems 
driving productivity at PepsiCo. GTMS ena
bles the data, analytics, and 
processes to effectively manage our consolidated transportation network. We 
can model different asset choices, consider inbound freight to optimize traffic 
lanes and maximize every load, and we can do this regardless of whethe

a common carrier or company owned fleet.
 


being expanded to Egypt, Saudi, Australia, and other pa
rts of South 
America. So these are some of the examples of initiatives that enable the 
five
-
year, $5 billion productivity program.
 
A portion of these savings will be generated from labor cost efficiency. As 
you can understand, such initiatives have people 
implications globally at all 
levels. In addition to providing transition support, PepsiCo is establishing a 
fund for eligible front line employees to provide job training to assist them in 
their pursuit of employment opportunities outside the company. Over
 
the 
next 60 days, we will finalize the details of how this fund will be 
administered. The cost of this fund is captured within the economics of our 
productivity program.
 
So let me sum up before I hand off to Hugh for the 2014 guidance. First, 
execution of
 
our strategy enabled us to meet and exceed our 2013 financial 
goals. Second, we are confident that our continued execution will enable us 
to do so again in 2014. Our geographic and product portfolio positions us 
well for future growth and at the same time
 
provides an attractive 
shareholder cash return model.
 

-
year, $5 billion productivity program through 
2019, strengthening the durability and duration of our expected financial 
performance. And finally, we are substantially increa
sing our cash returns, 
up 35% versus 2013, consistent with our commitment to disciplined capital 
allocation.
 
So let me now turn it to Hugh Johnston. Hugh?
 
Hugh Johnston
 
Thank you, Indra, and good morning, everyone. Let me spend a few minutes 
discussing our outlook for 2014, which is in line with our long term 
objectives. We expect another year of mid
-
single digit organic revenue 
growth.
 
We expect operating margin expansion as top line growth and productivity 
should offset negative geographic m
ix and cost inflation. Below the division 
operating profit line, we expect corporate cost efficiency and approximately 
25% core tax rate and a reduced share count.
 
All
-
in, we expect core constant currency EPS growth of 7%. Foreign 
exchange is expected to i
mpact revenue and core earnings per share by 
approximately 3% and 4% respectively, based on current market consensus 
rates.
 
Taking our 2013 core EPS of $4.37 and applying our guidance implies a 
2014 core EPS of approximately $4.50. Our outlook appropriatel
y factors in 
both tailwinds and headwinds. To the positive, we expect to generate over 
$1 billion of productivity savings in 2014, which will offset operating cost 
inflation.
 
We feel very good about our innovation agenda, which should enable us to 
sustain 
our organic revenue growth rate. Our share count will benefit from 


with some of the share count reduction fa
lling into 2015.
 
Our tax rate will be lower, and is estimated to come in for the full year at 
approximately 25%, which we expect to be able to sustain for the 
foreseeable future. And we will realize a modest benefit from pension 
expense, due to a higher di
scount rate.
 
In terms of headwinds, the food and beverage taxes enacted in Mexico will 
impact both top line growth and profitability. The rate of our commodity cost 
inflation will be higher in 2014 than in 2015. Foreign exchange translation, 
and to a lesse
r extent transaction, will be a significant drag on our U.S. 
dollar results and we expect continued challenges in demand for colas.
 
Finally, as you model out the quarters for 2014, please note the following. 
For the first quarter of 2014, we expect foreign
 
exchange translation to have 
an approximately 4% impact on net revenue and 6% impact on core 
earnings per share based on current market consensus rates. In addition, we 
expect structural changes, primarily the refranchising of beverage operations 
in Vietn
am, to impact first quarter revenue by approximately half a 
percentage point.
 
The second quarter of 2013 included a $137 million gain from the 
refranchising of our Vietnam operations, the majority of which was invested 
back into the business during Q2 thro
ugh Q4. The phasing of this gain 
versus reinvestment will impact core EPS growth during Q2 through Q4. 
Finally, our stepped up share repurchase activity will occur throughout the 
year but should have a more pronounced impact in the back half of 2014 
and in
to 2015.
 
Our long term goals remain intact: mid
-
single digit organic revenue growth, 
core operating margins expanding 30 to 50 basis points per year, high 
single
-
digit core constant currency EPS growth, free cash flow, excluding 
certain items, growing roug
hly in line with earnings, and core net ROIC 
improving 50 basis points per year.
 
We intend to responsibly manage the business for top line growth, drive 
productivity, and reinvest appropriately to position PepsiCo for sustainable 
growth for the long term. 
And, we plan to remain highly disciplined toward 
capital allocation, with the vast majority of free cash flow after capital 
spending being returned to shareholders in the form of dividends and 
buybacks.
 
So, based on our assessment of the strong and sustain
able cash flow 
generation capacity of the portfolio, driven by our expectation of mid
-
single 
digit organic revenue growth, robust productivity programs, and efficient 

increase our
 
cash returns to shareholders in 2014. This decision is consistent 
with our commitment to disciplined capital allocation and our strong bias to 
returning cash to our investors.
 

2014 
June payment, to $2.62 on an annualized basis. This represents the 
42nd consecutive year of annual dividend increase, and approximately 60% 

3.2% yield and will bring our 10

year a
nnualized dividend per share 
compound annual growth to 11%.
 

targeted $5 billion share repurchase target. This represents a 67% increase 
over our 2013 repurchase, and is approximately 4% 
of our market 
capitalization. While doing so, we expect to maintain tier one commercial 
paper access, enabling us to retain low cost, highly accessible, financing.
 
Taken together, these actions reflect a 35% increase in total shareholder 
cash returns compa
red to 2013, and will bring our cumulative 10
-
year cash 
returns to shareholders to over $60 billion. As many of you know, we have 
stated disciplined capital allocation as a top priority for our management and 
our board, and we trust these actions will be s
een by our shareholders as 
tangible evidence of this commitment.

On the NA beverage side, it sounds like the decision to not pursue structural 
options is more of a permanent one, as opposed to a decision just for now, 
given the current environment. That could change down the road. Is that the 
right way to
 
think about the decision? And then also can you give us more 
insight on how you expect to turn around trends in NA beverages going

we were disadvantaged. In [unintelligible], which is measured channels, we

ed the game very responsibly, which is what you 
do when categories are going through the volatility that LRB was going 
through. And importantly, in many subsegments of the LRB business, we 
gained share. And even within CSDs, products like Mountain Dew did 
exceedingly well.
 

On food service, which is, as you know, a good size of the market, these are 

carefully. And wh
ere we did bid on food service accounts, we did win them. 
And so we feel good about the fact that our integrated portfolio of snacks 
and beverages is now giving us some wins, and I think this has term run

you went through the a
nalysis on North American beverages, you know, the 

Potential to sell product over the internet. Coke is going to experiment with 
more single serve product or potential for single serve 
product at home. So 
that, plus the potential to use technology to change the production in 
manufacturing, make it more efficient.
 
How do you fit your franchise bottlers into that changing market? Is the next 
step here, or an important step, to really impro
ve NAB, to make some 
changes with the way you interact with the franchisees, to get the 
franchisees to sort of come along as you kind of bring them into a different 
world, a more modern world? Do the franchisees become an impediment, or 
in some way how are
 
you going to change the way you interact with them?
 
Indra Nooyi
 

important that you own the system, because with the amount of disruptive 

n in the system so that you 
can actually go with the flow. Having said that, on the online, shipping 
things through various fulfillment companies, we are looking at all of that 
and in fact doing tests with all of them.
 
In terms of single serve products at 
home, we are participating with multiple 

we ultimately commit and play with people where we know the technology is 

 
technology 
that actually works.
 
And finally, you know, our franchise bottlers are also seeing all the changes. 
We have a good relationship with our franchise bottlers. I think 
[unintelligible] has done a terrific job building the relationships with the 
fr

they want to work with us to make sure that together we grow the overall 
franchise.
 
So I think this is not about conflict. This is about how we work together to 
solve a market disruptio

The good news is that 75% of the system, we own. So we have far fewer 

overhang of a big independent bottler to deal with anymore.

Hugh, could you talk a little bit about your earnings target? Instead of giving 
a range, you gave sort of a 7% number here. So can you talk about this? Is 
this sort of 7% plus or minus? And then to sort of keep on the North 
American beverage bandwagon here, but a little more micro, can you talk a 
little bit about how you guys are perceiving the pricing environment, less so 

e market right now, but more so what you 
guys are building in heading into the summer selling season?

f price 
[unintelligible] last year, and our goal is to make sure that we take the price 
increases that we have to, because in categories that are going through the 
kind of change that the cola category and CSDs is going through, 


lot of the research is showing that just taking down pricing is not going to 
drive consumption.

to talk about the earnings target.

Obviously we give long term guidance of high single

digits in order to be as 
transparen
t as we can in terms of what we think the portfolio is capable of 
generating. And then as we get to the beginning of the year, we really try to 
give you a four quarter target as best we can estimate in this volatile, 
uncertain world of what we think is a l
ikely delivery. This year, as we looked 
at that, we pinned 7% as the likely number, and I know it sounds specific, 
but I think our investors appreciate the specificity in terms of what we do.

The first is just if you could quantify the Mexico tax effects? Because if we

FX growth rates. Do you think that this kind of running very fast on cost

that we have to keep growing in emerging and developing markets. You 

 
all the competitive positions are being 
established. So as you grow rapidly in emerging and developing markets, 
the margin profile is different, and cost inflation is very different than it is in 
developed markets.
 
You have a slowdown in developed markets

Obviously 2013 was a terrific year for Frito, both in terms of growth and 

in 2014? A

up, especially North America, in marketing spending. So do you still intend 
to obviously increase that [unintelligible] in 2014?
 
And then one very quick one after that. Do you have any in
terest in home

We re

looked at the insights model. We tried to understand what was going 
on in the 
consumer landscape. How should we think about our product 
positioning, our brands, which composition to go after, this was a 
fundamental relook at everything we did at Frito Lay. We re

looked at the 
costs, [unintelligible] really took root during that time

And in 2012, we stepped up investment behind this whole model on demand 


and 2016, because we have the ent
ire macro snacks space that we can go 

after certain demand moments with the salty snack base that we have.
 
The good news is that a lot of that insight work, the demand spaces wo
rk, 
that was done at Frito Lay we are now taking to beverages. And since 2013, 

get to the Frito Lay North America level. So we have great optimism for how 
this whole North American b
usiness is going to think about consumers, 
brand, innovation, demand growth. I think the future looks good.

Indra Nooyi
 
Thank you, Jamie, and good morning, everyone. We are quite pleased with 
our Q1 results. Top line growth was balanced and 
strong, and profitability 
was right on plan. We delivered organic volume growth of 3.5% in 
beverages. And excluding the foods volume, we delivered 4% in core salty
-
snacks.
 
We're especially encouraged by our growth in North America where core 
salty
-
snack vo
lume growth at Frito
-
Lay was up 2.5%, and organic beverage 
volume growth was 2%. Internationally, we delivered volume and revenue 
growth in each of the geographies. International organic volume growth was 
7% in core salty
-
snack and 5% in beverages. Global 
foods volume, which is 
included in our set of snacks volume report for external reporting, declined 
4%, driven primarily by Quaker Foods North America while internationally, 
our foods volume grew 2%.
 
Despite inflationary pressures, we continue to invest in
 
brand building in 
emerging markets, and we're beginning to see evidence that our recent 
investments are paying off.
 
Last year at about this time, we set out five key growth imperatives for 
PepsiCo that formed the backbone of our strategy, and I'd like to 
discuss this 
quarter's results in the context of these imperatives.
 
Our first imperative is to build and extend our macro snacks portfolio. Our 
reported worldwide snacks volume growth was 3%, and this included our 
foods volume also. Our underlying core sal
ty
-
snacks volume grew more than 
4% on an organic basis. Growth was well balanced, with strength in both 
developed and emerging markets. And we grew salty
-
snacks volume in each 
of our top 10 global markets.
 
Innovation was strong across the board, which resu
lted in incrementality, 
even in our more developed markets like North America and the United 
Kingdom.
 
In emerging markets, we're building per capita consumption and driving 
frequency, and that's led to strong organic growth in these markets. For 
example, w
e grow snacks volume 18% in India, 13% in China, 26% in 
Russia and 32% in Turkey.
 
Operating margins in global snacks improved about 100 basis points, with 
gains in almost every division. In some countries, we saw value and niche 
players pulse in and out of
 
the market and take some share. We are careful 
not to overreact, choosing to judiciously trade off some share to protect 
profit in the short term. Our goal is to balance volume and profit growth. 
And across the world, our businesses are doing a pretty goo
d job in this 
regard.
 
Our second imperative is to sustainably and profitably grow our beverage 
business worldwide. Our global organic beverage volume growth was 3.5%. 
CSDs grew 2% and non
-
carbonated beverages grew 8%. Every division grew 
organic volume, wi
th emerging and developing markets continuing to show 
terrific results. India was up 20%, Russia was up 13%, Turkey was up 21% 
and China was up 4%, lapping 19% from 2010.
 
Developed markets also generated good growth, with North America organic 
volumes up 2
%, and the U.K. up 7%. We hit the first anniversary of the 
bottler acquisitions in the first quarter, and the synergies are ahead of 
original estimates.
 
We have made the operational organization changes necessary to realize the 
cost synergies, and we're be
ginning to realize the revenue synergies now. 
For example, we moved small format Gatorade onto DSD at the beginning of 
this year, and we're beginning to make progress in growing our business at 
food service accounts.
 
We also focused on improving profitabil
ity in beverages but have to carefully 
address 2 issues: first, commodities are clearly a headwind; and second, we 
intend to continue to invest in brands and in building out our emerging 
markets infrastructure.
 
Inflation has disproportionately impacted our
 
beverage businesses, and thus 
pressured our beverage margins somewhat, especially in EMEA and North 
America. Partially offsetting this, in North America, we achieved almost 2 
points of price mix and intend to pursue higher price utilization for the 
remain
der of the year to more fully offset the commodity cost pressures.
 
In EMEA, we'll also begin to see the impact of pricing actions that they're are 
taking as we move into the balance of the year.
 
I'm confident that we're making the right investments, which 
is being born 
out of the growth we're seeing, and we've got solid pricing plans in place for 
the year to balance volume and profit growth to deliver on our financial and 
operating commitments.
 
The third imperative we articulated is to unleash the power of 
Power of One. 
We're making good progress here. In North America, we've ramped up our 
Power of One activity. For example, in the first quarter, we executed cross 
division basketball teams merchandising in March, we accelerated local UDS 
account promotional 
activity, and we are continuing our pilots where we 
have Power of One merchandisers in selected large
-
format stores, and early 
results are quite promising.
 
And this summer, we're introducing the first ever PepsiCo coupon inserts to 
cross for 20 of our bran
ds across snacks and beverages. And we continue to 
advance Power of One as a strategic volume and productivity driver in our 
international market, where Power of One is already highly developed. In 
this area, I believe overall, we're making progress. We be
lieve there's a lot 
more potential to be realized.
 
Our fourth imperative is to build and expand our nutrition business, and here 
we are pleased with our progress so far. We are focusing our efforts in 2 
areas, innovation and branding. And we're doing this 
to accelerate the 
growth of the nutrition segment of our snack and beverage portfolio. And to 
remind you, it's Quaker in grains, Tropicana/Naked and the many regional 
brands we own in fruits and vegetables, Wimm
-
Bill
-
Dann in value
-
added 
dairy and Gatorade 
in sports nutrition.
 
To do this, we took a group of about 100 R&D and marketing people and 
about a $50 million budget, and focused them against these segments and 
brands. This core group is responsible for building an innovation pipeline 
looking 12 to 24 m
onths out and for maintaining the global brand 
architecture for our nutrition
-
oriented brands.
 
Output from this Global Nutrition Group will start to appear in store shelves 
sometime in 2012. However, in the first quarter of 2011, the revenue growth 
in 
the nutrition segments of our snacks and beverage portfolios outpaced the 
growth of our core Fun
-
For
-
You and Better
-
For
-
You businesses, giving us 
confidence that our focus on this opportunity is well played.
 
The fifth imperative is to ensure prudent, respo
nsible financial management. 
In the first quarter, our financial results came in as we expected. Core 
division operating profit grew 5%, driven by solid volume and net revenue 
performance and synergies and despite inflationary pressures and continued 
inves
tment spending. We had negative leverage below the operating profit 
line from higher year
-
over
-
year interest expense and a higher tax rate, 
resulting in the quarter EPS decline, again as we expected and 
communicated on our Q4 call.
 
Looking forward, commodi
ty cost inflation will be a major factor for all 
companies in our sector in 2011. Through our hedging programs, we have 
good visibility into our cost outlook for the balance of the year. Our plans 
and targets have taken commodity inflation appropriately in
to account, and 
I'm confident we have the right pricing and productivity plans in place to 
deliver on our commitments, and Hugh will give you more detail on this.
 
Next, we are confident we are focused on the right five imperatives, and 
we're making good pr
ogress against them. But before I turn the call over to 
Hugh, I want to touch on 3 topics that seem to be of interest to many of 
you.
 
First, how will we sustain performance at Frito
-
Lay in North America? Two, 
what actions are we taking to accelerate growth
 
in North America 
beverages? And three, how are we thinking about capital allocation?
 
Let me turn to Frito
-
Lay North America first. As all of you know, this is a 
very powerful franchise with tremendous scale advantage. We saw a volume 
growth in the first q
uarter, and that translated to solid operating profit 
growth, with healthy gross margin expansion. As we look to the balance of 
the year, we expect top line growth to be driven by innovation.
 
We've talked a bit about the initiative around all natural, and 
it's off to a 
great start. Just as importantly, we have a strong lineup of core Fun
-
For
-
You 
innovation, with products like Ruffles' bold flavors, Taco and Pizza doritos 
and a line of Tapatio flavors, and we expect these products to do very well, 
especially
 
in single
-
serve in the UDS channel.
 
We'd also drive growth and adjacencies under the Stacy's and Sabra brands, 
where we're expanding the lineup to new product introductions. So we 
expect Sabra and Stacy's to continue to drive highly incremental growth.
 
We
'll begin to see input cost inflation in Frito as we move through the year, 
and we have solid pricing plans in place to cover it, supplemented by solid 
productivity programs.
 
So our expectations for Frito
-
Lay North America: to continue to be a steady 
profi
t growth driver.
 
Let me turn now to North American beverages, where our focus is on 
judiciously balancing volume and profit growth. We believe we are making 
the right kinds and appropriate level of investments to accelerate our long
-
term beverage growth in
 
North America, and this includes a sizable increase 
in our advertising and marketing expense in Q1.
 
Gatorade is a great example of how we've created innovative platforms and 
established brand marketing programs that drive brand equity. We have the 
same fo
cused on our other key beverage brands like Pepsi, Dew and 
Tropicana. We have seen brands score strengthened across the board. And 
volume trends improved, which gives us confidence that we're making the 
right investments.
 
Regarding profit growth in Pepsi A
mericas Beverages. Clearly commodities 
are a headwind, and our intention is to offset these costs with productivity 
and pricing. We achieved some positive price mix in the first quarter out 
ahead of the category, and intend to continue to employ pricing as
 
well as 
mix to drive solid net price realization and profit growth.
 
We intend to price to cover input costs and to maintain brand support, so 
that we can compete in the business of innovation and brand equity.
 
The final topic I want to address before I ha
nd off to Hugh is capital 
allocation. Clearly, the bottler acquisition and the Wimm
-
Bill
-
Dann 
acquisition are major commitments of capital. These transactions were 
carefully analyzed and considered before we committed to them. I'm 
confident that they are j
ustified in their financial and strategic merits, and 
we are absolutely committed to delivering on these important investments.
 
We are now well positioned to generate strong organic growth and going 
forward, anticipate relatively low levels of capital inve
stments deployed 
against occasional tuck
-
in acquisitions, alliances and joint ventures.
 
Our businesses will continue to generate attractive cash flow, and we'll 
reinvest capital in the business only when there's a clear compelling case for 
value creation. 
We have a strong record of an ongoing commitment to 
returning cash to shareholders through both dividends and share purchases.
 
With that, let me turn the call over to Hugh, and I look forward to taking 
your questions. Hugh?
 
Hugh Johnston
 
Great. Thanks, Ind
ra, and good morning, everyone. I'll spend just a few 
minutes reviewing the financial performance before we open it up for Q&A. I 
know today is a busy one for many of you, with so many companies 
reporting, so I'll keep my comments relatively brief.
 
For the
 
sake of clarity before we get to the financials, I want to call your 
attention to a couple of key items that affect the comparability of our results 
for last year. Our financials for the quarter impacted by the bottler 
acquisition into a much lesser exten
t, by our acquisition of a controlling 
stake in Wimm
-
Bill
-
Dann. With respect to the bottlers, we closed on the 
bottler acquisitions on February 26 last year. So in this year's first quarter, 
we have a full quarter of bottler results and net interest expens
e related to 
the transaction comparing to a short stub period of ownership in Q1 2010.
 
The bottler's operating profit in the first quarter is seasonally low and, as I 
mentioned on last quarter's call, the European operations of the bottlers 
historically op
erated at a loss in Q1. So we have 2 periods of low seasonal 
results in Q1, and we have 2 incremental periods of full interest expense, 
associated with the bottler acquisitions, which created a net negative impact 
for the quarter.
 
Regarding Wimm
-
Bill
-
Dann,
 
given the timing of the closing on our 77% 
stake toward the end of the quarter, the impact of this transaction on our 
overall first quarter results is relatively small.
 
Information in the release this morning is meant to provide visibility into the 
fundam
ental performance of the business. Couple of points here. One, we've 
presented organic volume growth for PAB in Europe, the 2 divisions 
impacted by the bottler and Wimm
-
Bill
-
Dann acquisitions, which strips out 
the impact of the acquisitions for those divis
ions from our volume growth. 
Second, we've also provided the pro forma impact on net revenue as if the 
bottlers had been acquired on the first day of Q1 2010. And finally, we 
provided disclosures on the impact of Wimm
-
Bill
-
Dann on net revenue and 
operating
 
profit growth rates.
 
For the first quarter, our core EPS was $0.74, which was in line with our 
expectations. Core EPS was driven by a 5% increase in pro forma net 
revenue, excluding the impact of Wimm
-
Bill
-
Dann and a 5% increase in our 
core division opera
ting profit. The core division operating profit reflects solid 
volume gains, some net pricing, synergies from the bottler acquisitions and 
productivity, partially offset by higher commodity costs, continued 
investments in brand building and in emerging mar
kets, and the seasonal 
losses associated with the operations of the acquired bottlers.
 
Let me highlight on a few items impacting profit performance in the quarter 
by each of our sectors.
 
PAF core operating profit results were up a strong 8%, with good oper
ating 
margin expansion, led by gross margin expansion at FLNA. PAB core 
operating profit was up 9% with positive bottler operating profit overlap, 
volume, pricing and synergies, offset somewhat by inflation and continued 
brand investment. Europe was impact
ed by the inclusion of 2 months of 
bottler results, which historically operated at a loss as I noted earlier. Using 
last year's operating losses of proxy, this accounts for approximately 33 
points of profit decline in Europe's Q1 results. And finally, in E
MEA, core 
operating profit declined 6%. This is a relatively small profit quarter for 
EMEA, and the difference between down 6% and up double digits is about 
$25 million.
 
There were a number of factors that contributed to the decline, including 
investment s
pending, price lagging somewhat behind inflation and some 
temporary business interruption in the Middle East.
 
Commodity cost inflation is a major theme we are managing across the 
entirety of our business. In the first quarter, inflation impacted our 
beverage 
operations more dramatically than our snacks. We covered some but not all 
of the beverage commodity cost inflation with pricing.
 
On the snack side, commodity inflation was less pronounced, and we 
generally were able to cover inflation there.
 
Looki
ng out over the balance of the year, commodities will continue to be a 
headwind. We expect inflation of approximately $1.4 billion to $1.6 billion on 
a base of $18 billion of commodity based inputs. As we explained on last 
quarter's call, our intention is 
to offset a portion of this inflation with pricing 
and productivity.
 
In a year as volatile as 2011, we're closely managing the pricing volume 
productivity equation to ensure we deliver on our financial commitments for 
the year. This was true in all of our 
divisions, but especially so in PAB. As 
we've said before, we intend to be a disciplined, well
-
run bottler. As a part of 
this, we seek to cover our commodity cost with pricing. Given the soft 
consumer environment, and as the industry goes through transitio
n, pricing 
in the first half has not been what we would have liked or expected. But 
because of the ongoing commodity inflation pressures, as we exit the first 
half, we anticipate taking additional pricing in the form of rate increases on 
key packages. This
 
will be necessary to drive acceptable operating profit 
growth, provide the room to continue to invest in innovation and marketing 
and to operate consistent with the principles of being a well
-
run bottler.
 
Turning to cash flow. In the quarter, we generated
 
$78 million of 
management operating cash flow excluding the impacts of merger and 
integration payments and integration
-
related CapEx.
 
Our key working capital metrics of DII, DSO and DPO, are all within target, 
but year
-
on
-
year cash flow comparisons are im
pacted by the seasonality of 
the bottler cash flows.
 
Finally, let me update you on our earnings outlook for the year, which is 
consistent with what we've shared on the first quarter call. We expect core 
constant currency EPS growth of 7% to 8%, and estimat
e ForEx could be a 1 
to 2 point translation benefit to our full year core EPS growth all on a 52
-
week basis.
 
Below the operating profit line, we anticipate negative leverage for the full 
year for the reasons we shared on the last call, namely: higher inter
est 
expense, $50 million of spending at the corporate level on our nutrition 
initiative, higher pension costs related to the amortization of PAS losses, and 
the non
-
controlling interest elimination related to the income of Wimm
-
Bill
-
Dann. In addition, we e
xpect our core tax rate to be approximately 27% for 
the full year essentially even with 2010.
 
On cash flow, we expect CapEx to be approximately $3.5 billion for the year, 
excluding bottler integration CapEx of about $150 million. We remain 
committed to ret
urning cash to shareholders through dividends and share 
repurchases, and expect share repurchases of approximately $2.5 billion in 
2011.
 
In the first quarter, we repurchased $361 million of shares. We expect the 
rate of repurchase to accelerate in the seco
nd half, following repayment of 
acquisition
-
related debt to achieve the full year target.
 
As you model out the balance of the year, please note 2 items: first, 
operating profit growth in the second quarter will be lower than in the 
second half driven by th
e timing of anticipated pricing actions; and second, 
we estimate our Q2 core tax rate will be 90 to 100 basis points above our 
full year estimated tax rate.
 
So to summarize the overall financial picture: first of our Q1 results came in 
line with our expect
ations; second, commodity inflation will be challenge for 
us and everyone else in our industry for the foreseeable future but we'll 
continue to prudently manage the business balancing volume pricing and 
productivity; and finally, we remain committed to our
 
full year financial 
outlook
 
With that, Indra and I will be glad to take your questions.

A couple of questions if I could. Hugh, just to clarify, the commodity 
exposure, the $1.4 billion to $1.6 billion, is still in line with what you've 
indicated in the prior quarter, yet we've seen some inflation since then. So 
I'm just wond
ering if your earlier guidance had incorporated some expected 
PET increased. Or why that level is still there? And then I had a question for 
John on Frito. I know that we have some easier comps. But I'm curious in 
the second quarter, how trends may have ch
anged given higher gas prices?
 
Hugh Johnston
 
Christine, great. Let me just talk a little bit about the commodity piece. 
Obviously, our commodity's purchase is relatively large in complexity, $10 
billion with no commodity accounting for even 10% of the tota
l. We buy an 
awful lot of things. Many of them have moved up. Some have moved around 
and down. And as I've shared in the past, we also have a very active 
hedging program. The net of it is there really is no change to the overall 
guidance of $1.4 billion to
 
$1.6 billion. That number will likely continue to 
move around inside the range a bit, because we do only cover about 80% of 
our commodities purchases. That's the extent to which we can hedge. But 
we're very comfortable with the number that we have previou
sly 
communicated of $1.4 billion to $1.6 billion. So that's where we are on that. 
Then I'll kick it over to John for the second question.
 
John Compton
 
This is John. No, we haven't seen any material changes on higher fuel prices. 
As we've said in the quarte
r, we had 2.5% volume growth at Frito
-
Lay and 
that sequentially improved during the quarter. As Indra mentioned, we just 
completed the final conversion of the all natural launch, and that is just now 
being activated in the marketplace, and we've just recen
tly rolled a whole 
line of Hispanic products underneath the Tapatio subbrand into the 
marketplace. So our expectation is that our volume growth will continue. We 
may see some channel shifting due to the higher prices, of gas prices, but 
we don't expect our
 
volume growth to slow down.

Your next question comes from Dara Mohsenian of Morgan Stanley.
 
Dara Mohsenian

Hugh, can you quantify how much leftover commodity costs pressure, you're 
expecting in 2012 if commodities stay where they
 
are today given you're 
somewhat hedged this year? So what's leftover piece that's not fully 
captured in 2011 given the hedging?
 
Hugh Johnston
 
Yes. Dara, all I'd say at this point is in total, we had about 20% at any time 
in the subsequent 12 months open. 
In terms of the balance of this year, 
there are certain items that we can hedge. We won't get into the details of 
our quantities program. So I really just leave you with the guidance of $1.4 
billion to $1.6 billion in total, and I think we're very comforta
ble managing 
within that range.
 
Dara Mohsenian

Morgan Stanley
 
Okay. And then can you also give us some sense for the level of investment 
in AMP in the quarter versus the prior year? You beat gross profit versus my 
modeling consensus, but SG&A was 
higher than we expected. So I'm just 
wondering if you can give us some granularity on the level of investment 
behind the business versus last year.
 
Hugh Johnston
 
Yes, Dara, from our perspective, probably the biggest investment that we 
talked about is the o
ne that we've made in Global Nutrition Group, and we 
talked about that being $50 million for the year. In terms of the other pieces 
of investment, for competitive reasons, we really don't want to get into the 
details of what countries we're putting it in o
r where it's going into. We did 
share that we had our PAD advertising and marketing expense up 
meaningfully from last year, and that should give you some sense for it. The 
net of it is in terms of the investments that we're making, what you should 
know is 
we're managing that inside the 7% to 8% overall guidance that 
we've given, and we're comfortable managing our investments within that 
overall guidance.

The question on North America snack and beverage pricing, you talked a lot 
about balancing price mix and productivity. How are you thinking about on 
the Frito side, weighed out versus rate, watching the $0.99 price point in the 
C
&G channel? And on the beverage side, are you indicating you'll take 
pricing before Labor Day? And you mentioned taking more mix benefit there 
as well?
 
Indra Nooyi
 
Eric?
 
John Compton
 
So Bill, it's John. Let me take the Frito
-
Lay portion first. I think goin
g 
forward, you'll see us use more visual pricing and more trade promotion 
price point than weighed out that we've typically used in the past, and we 
will start to employ those in the second half of the year as we exit Q2.
 
Eric Foss
 
And Bill, it's Eric. On 
the beverage side again, as Hugh mentioned, what 
we're looking to do is to optimize really the trade
-
off between consumer 
value, volume and margins. And I think if you look at the point he made 
earlier around what do great bottlers do, I'd point you to a c
ouple of success 
metrics that matter most. One is we are looking for price appreciation, which 
we demonstrated in Q3 of last year, Q4 last year, full year 2010 and again, 
in Q1 of this year. Second, you'd look for balance top line, which we feel 
very good 
about the 2% volume and the 2 points of pricing we got this year, 
about a point of that was rate and a point of that was mix. And then finally, 
balancing what happens share wise in the market, which again we feel good 
about where we are year
-
to
-
date and wh
ere we finished 2010. As we look at 
the go forward, it will be a combination of great mix management but we do 
plan to initiate more rate, and that rate will probably hit the marketplace 
sometime after the 4th of July.
 
William Pecoriello

And then both divisions delivered around that 2% or so volume growth as 
you're taking that rate balance a year. Is that a level of volume growth that 
you hope to maintain 
--
 
obviously, you're talking about balancing the price 
mix productivity b
ut that kind of low single digit would be a picture of 
success for you?
 
Indra Nooyi
 
Bill, I think what we plan to do is take the pricing and manage volume and 
share within a corridor because we just have to make sure that we 
judiciously balance the two. So
 
we've drawn up some corridors and we plan 
to manage our business within those corridors.

Your next question comes from John Faucher of JPMorgan.

JP Morgan Chase & Co
 
I'm going to continue to follow up on this pricing environment, w
hich is over 
the last couple of days, it seems as though you guys are a little more, I 
don't know, blase about the pricing environment than I think we've heard 
from some of your competitors. So I guess I'm just wondering what you're 
seeing that they aren't
 
seeing. And then, good to hear that the pricing will 
go up after the 4th of July. That's kind of what everyone has been saying. 
But will prices go up even if they do not take pricing up? Is this something 
where you lead, or you're going to have to see kin
d of what everyone does 
at this point?
 
Hugh Johnston
 
John, let me start on this first, and if I missed anything, John and Eric can 
feel free to jump in on it. I'm not sure I characterize this as blase on pricing. 
Obviously, in the environment we're in righ
t now, we have to look at these 
things very carefully. That said, as we look at the way we manage the 
business, we do think the appropriate way to manage the business is as we 
see commodity inflation, we need to take pricing in order to cover that. And 
we'
re going to do that within corridors of volume and share that we find 
acceptable. And if anything, in terms of leading pricing, I'd actually argue, 
we have been leading pricing all along. That said, we really don't pay that 
much attention to competition on
 
this stuff. As Eric has articulated in the 
past, and certainly John's articulated, we manage the business the way we 
think it needs to be managed the right way in terms of the pricing/volume 
dynamic. And what we're really saying is we intend to take rate 
increases in 
the back half of the year.
 
John Faucher 
-
 
JP Morgan Chase & Co
 
Yes. Hugh, if I can jump in, I guess, obviously, blase was the wrong term 
but sort of unenthusiastic. We've heard people talk about the pricing 
environment being very rational and 
very positive, but it doesn't seem like 
you guys are quite that positive about it. Is that a fair statement? 
Particularly in beverages here.
 
Hugh Johnston
 
Yes. Here's what I'd say on that, John. We've talked about the fact that 
given the challenging consum
er environment, we weren't going to take 
pricing to cover all of our inflation for the year. And in a normal year, we 
would expect to do that. What we're saying now is while we're still not going 
to take sufficient pricing to cover all of the inflation for
 
the year. We are 
going to take more pricing in the balance of the year. And we think that's 
the right thing to do for the way that we manage the business, balancing the 
marketplace result with the financial result.
 
Eric Foss
 
I would just add, John, this is Eric, that we are far from blase, that we are 
very passionate and focused on making sure we get the right rate actions in 
the marketplace. And again, we took pricing post
-
Labor Day. We took pricing 
post
-
Super Bowl. And again
, it's showing up in the numbers as you can see, 
as indicated by first quarter. And again, we intend to do that, as I've 
mentioned earlier, post
-
July 4. So we'll balance that against what's 
happening in terms of consumer value, as I said earlier, the compe
tition in 
commodities, but I would tell you we are very focused and passionate about 
the price and specifically, rate in addition to great mix management, as we 
always have been.
 
Hugh Johnston
 
And John?
 
John Compton
 
At Frito
-
Lay, as you know, as inflation 
comes to the business, we will price it 
through. And to Bill's former question, there's multiple levers at Frito
-
Lay to 
pull. One of which is mix because, as you know, the margin differentials 
between potato chips and tortilla chips are very different. And
 
so we'll use 
the mix, we'll use visual pricing and we'll use some trade promotion pricing, 
but our intent is to pass it through.
 
Hugh Johnston
 
And John, just to kind of close this topic off, I mean I mentioned in my 
opening comments that we're not satisfi
ed with the pricing that we're 
getting. Given what we look at in terms of commodities, we think it's right to 
take more pricing, and that's what we're going to do.

Your next question comes from Judy Hong of Goldman Sachs.
 
Judy Hong 
-
 
Goldman Sachs
 
Group Inc.
 
Indra, I just wanted to maybe take a step back and sort of, from a big 
picture perspective, get your perspective on some of the puts and takes, 
both at the macrolevel and then at the company level today versus maybe 
six months ago. More specifi
cally, we entered the year with a pretty tough 
consumer environment. Commodity obviously a pretty challenging situation. 
So from your perspective at the microlevel, what's gotten better? What's 
gotten worse? And then at the company level, you had a lot of 
initiatives to 
invest more into marketing and branding. Are there any categories or brands 
or countries that you're more pleased with and maybe some of the payoffs 
that you're getting from the reinvestments?
 
Indra Nooyi
 
Judy, that's a broad question. Let m
e try to hit the highlights. Clearly, we've 
come into this year with GDP in the developed markets improving some, 
unemployment rates coming down a bit, but then offset by the very high 
inflation we're seeing on commodities. So every one of these situations
 
has 
a positive and a negative. The good news is that we are in the food and 
beverage space, and people have to eat and people have to drink. And 
therefore, we've become more of a staple than anything and so we get the 
first dibs on the consumer dollars th
at are going out. So that's the good 
news. In terms of the microenvironment, as we've said before, emerging 
markets continue to be very, very strong, but inflation is also very, very high 
in emerging markets. So we're trying to thread the needle and really
 
figure 
out how much pricing we can take and still get the consumer to increase per 
capita consumption and frequency. And that's why even countries like EMEA, 
we have to think very hard about what amount of pricing we can pass 
through to the consumer, and 
the teams are working through those details. 
In the case of the developed markets, our categories are quite well 
developed in these markets. And here again, we are looking carefully by 
product, by package to see how we can get that additional price, some 
t
hrough visible pricing mix, some through price mix, some through some 
channel offerings. And so we're playing this game in a much more nuanced 
micro way to be able to get that consumer dollar in order to drive our top 
line and our margin performance. Do yo
u want to add something, there?
 
Hugh Johnston
 
Yes. Just one other piece to talk a little bit about this question of 
commodities and pricing as well, because obviously we're getting a few 
questions on it. I think there maybe some questions around the aggreg
ate 
level of commodity inflation relative to most CPGs, we had came out earlier, 
and I think with the higher level of commodity inflation than the vast 
majority of others. To that extend, obviously, we anticipated a lot of what's 
gone on in the markets ove
r the last couple of months in terms of 
commodity inflation. As we talk about pricing in response to that, we're 
really talking about that both in the context of 2011 and starting to think 
ahead to 2012 as well. So as you hear us talking about our strategi
es for the 
back half of the year, we're not thinking in just calendars, but we're thinking 
sort of on a multi
-
quarter basis as to where we think we need to manage the 
business. That said, as Indra mentioned, we do really have to be quite 
nuanced about how 
we do pricing so that we can do so effectively. But given 
the aggregate level of inflation in the economy, we do think it's important for 
us to take pricing.
 
Indra Nooyi
 
Yes. And so Judy coming back to 
--
 
and I'm picking up where Hugh left off, 
this is a y
ear where if you look across PepsiCo, we have a large portfolio. We 
have a natural hedge between beverages and snacks, emerging markets, 
developing markets, developed markets, different day parts, different cohort 
groups. So with this natural hedge in the 
portfolio, we can decide what levels 
to tweak in order to deliver on the financial commitments. But this is where 
-
-
 
this is the time you need great execution ability and excellent management 
to be able to navigate through the many headwinds and tailwinds 
that we 
are facing. And I think we are blessed with an extraordinary management 
team. Let me talk about the investment levels. The other big lesson we've all 
learned is that through short
-
term volatility, you cannot back off 
investments you should be makin
g to ensure the long
-
term health of the 
business. Branding investments, absolutely we have to make them, but we 
wanted to make sure we make the investments when we have the right 
programs, the right people, the right proposition. Just as we did for 
Gatorad
e, how we turned that business around, and now it's smoking. And 
so we are making the stepped
-
up investments, especially North American 
beverages and beverages globally. Our investments in the nutrition group. 
The nutrition categories are growing 2, 3x tha
t of the other core Fun
-
for
-
You, Better
-
for
-
You categories. It's a gigantic opportunity, and we'd be 
remiss if we didn't make these investments, and we shouldn't be pulsing 
these investments. You've got to make sure it's steady. And so that's why 
we've put
 
the investments behind on nutrition group, and made it to sealed 
[ph] lab so that they can come up with innovation and we can start bringing 
them to market, because we expect all of these will also turn around the 
commodity costs and the economic world th
at developed markets are going 
through will turn around. And so we intend to keep the investments going to 
ensure the long
-
term success of our company.

Carlos LaBoy

Crédit Suisse AG
 
In
dra, you've spoken of stepped
-
up brand marketing and marketing 
investment for North America and globally. Can you speak to the scope of 
the step
-
up, how it flows through the year? And can you comment on some 
of your thinking on the need and opportunity tha
t encourages you to step up 
your brand marketing investment? Is it mostly nutrition related as you just 
mentioned? Is it all nutrition related or mostly nutrition related?
 
Indra Nooyi
 
Carlos, the biggest step
-
up in brand investments are behind our core 
bev
erages brand. And because Frito
-
Lay North America and all of our snacks 
business are getting quite a bit of brand investments already, they do 
increase their advertising spending. But the biggest step
-
up that we've 
planned for this year and going forward i
s in our core North American 
beverage businesses. So Massimo, do you want to talk a little bit about the 
nature and step out 
--
 
and we don't talk about the exact level, Carlos, that's 
competitively disadvantaging us, but go ahead and talk about where you'r
e 
investing, Massimo.
 

 
As Indra said, the stepped
-
up investment in North American beverage, first 
and foremost, is on Pepsi. And as we have said, we have locked in the 
exclusive partnership with the X Factor property and all of that investme
nt is 
incremental versus last year. From a quarter standpoint also, we were back 
from on Super Bowl as you know with Pepsi Max, which we did not do last 
year. So that's what makes a big difference for the first quarter. In terms of 
the other beverage brand
s we are supporting Sierra Mist at a higher level 
than we did last year. And finally, the support of Gatorade is growing 
proportionately with the growth of the business. And we continue to 
aggressively partner with the right sports properties for the long
-
term 
partnerships, especially for Gatorade and Pepsi.

Your next question comes from Kaumil Gajrawala of UBS.
 
Kaumil Gajrawala

So it looks like there's very solid volume growth at Frito, maybe not as much 
pricing as you had 
wanted but obviously, some solid margin expansion as 
well. Could you talk a bit about the drivers of the margin expansion, 
including if any of that was volume leverage?
 
Indra Nooyi
 
John?
 
John Compton
 
Of course. Kaumil, some of it is volume leverage, but we
 
did have 2.5% 
volume growth that obviously helps to leverage the fixed costs. And as 
we've said back at the Investors Conference in March, we're ramping up our 
productivity levels at Frito
-
Lay, and that's starting to come through. We 
talked about automati
on projects that are taking place. We've talked about 
GES controlling now. We've talked about Lean Six Sigma all through in the 
organization, not just the manufacturing but all the way through the sales 
organization. So volume leverage, yes, and then solid
 
productivity programs 
contributed to the margin expansion.
 
Kaumil Gajrawala 
-
 
UBS Investment Bank
 
And if I could follow up on GES, it's been about a year since the Investor 
Day. I believe at that time, you had one plant. Is there any update that you 
could
 
give us on that?
 
Hugh Johnston
 
We've rolled 2 additional markets. We continue to see positive results from 
the initial markets that we've rolled. We talked at the Investor Day about 
how 2012 would be a year to get the IT systems in place to further the 
na
tional rollout, and that's what we're doing. We'll put in an SAP and 
financially, upgrade our Oracle systems and then we'll get back in 2013 to 
rolling GES.
 
Kaumil Gajrawala 
-
 
UBS Investment Bank
 
Got it. And then if I can ask about Gatorade, I believe one 
of the issues in 
the middle part of the last decade was that it was perhaps growing too 
faster, maybe not growing with the right consumer. So once again growing, 
but it's growing quite quickly at about 20%. Is there any concerns that it's 
maybe growing too
 
fast, or that it's not growing with the consumer you had 
intended?
 

 
Listen, first of all, we are really totally focused on the right target and the 
right location. The growth you're seeing in the first quarter is really driven 
by 2 
factors. First, we launched the G Series in April 2010, so we are lapping 
a quarter where we had no G series last year. And second, a big change has 
been in the transfer of the go to market for small formats, for convenience 
and drugs, from warehouse to DS
D, which has allowed us to really 
accelerate the growth in that channel. But if you look at the pricing data, 
you will see that we are really not chasing volume. We're actually very 
focused on the right target consumer and the right location. So we feel ve
ry 
confident that we are not going back to some of the issues we have had in 
the past.
 
Indra Nooyi
 
And Kaumil, having said that, it's important to note that long term, we're not 
looking for a 20% sustained growth at Gatorade. That would be crazy. So 
we're 
looking at growth in the G franchise in the sports nutrition arena, and 
that's why you're seeing expansion into bites. You're going to see a lot more 
innovation around the needs of the sports athletes from a food and beverage 
perspective before they get in
to a game location, during the game and after. 
And you'll see a lot of niche innovations, a lot of innovation that's going to 
get us more price realization. Will there be some social beverage occasion 
that come into G? Yes, but it's not going to be meaning
ful, and we're not 
going to chase it with trade promotions or dropping off pricing. That's the 
key difference today: innovation, price utilization and a lot of focus on the 
sports athlete. That's the way we're going with Gatorade.

I'd like to just talk a little bit about Quaker and Frito, it looks like you 
reclassified. And I'm just trying to
 
get a sense of what volume growth would 
have been on the old measure, because it looks like the Quaker business 
had very weak volume but also, your margins were up a lot in Quaker, 
despite some top line pressures. So if you could talk a little bit about t
hat. 
Are you going to reclassify last year, so that we can figure out what's the

Jamie Caulfield
 
Caroline, it's Jamie. We put out an 8

restated last year

obviously, the restateme

everything apples

And the margin increase, how did you drive that under the current

at Quaker? And is it sustainable, really is the question?
 
John Compton
 
Carol, it's John. We had a one
-
time accounting benefit in Quaker in the 
quarter. If you were to strip that accounting benefit out, we still would have 
grown profits around 1% to 2% even
 
on declining volumes. So we're trying 
to get the price realization back into the business. We are very focused on 
innovation long term to turn the business around. And the business that 
we've been primarily focused against, the core oatmeal business, did 
grow in 
the quarter. So that gave us some optimism going forward that, that part of 
the portfolio is turning. As you know, we owned Aunt Jemima, Rice

And la
st question, could I just get a confirmation on price mix at Frito? With 
the moving parts, I'm having a hard time coming up with exactly what that 
was for the quarter, price mix, North America?
 
John Compton
 
Essentially, it was slightly negative because aga
in, we didn't take pricing in 
the quarter. So revenue growth could have grown with pound growth. It 
didn't in part because of the mix. Going forward, as inflation comes to the 
business, obviously, as we've said, we intend to fully price that through.

Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., Inc.
 
A couple of questions. One is just a follow
-
up on price mix in particular. 
Historically, in the past couple of quarters, it feels like it was i
n general more 
half
-
and
-
half price mix. With the greater focus going forward on increased 
kind of rate pricing or list pricing, kind of sure pricing as I call it, do you 
expect that, I guess, the mix between price and mix to be more focused on 
price and mi
x going forward?
 
Hugh Johnston
 
Ali, this is Hugh. Obviously, business by business, dealing with price mix at a 
PepsiCo level is a bit of a challenge because of the complexity of it. But in 
general, as you think through the lines of business, I would be thi
nking a 
little bit more rate than just a straight balance between rate and mix going 
forward. And that's what we were indicating this morning.
 
Ali Dibadj 
-
 
Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., Inc.
 
And then within mix, how much do you see it 
--
 
and again, obviously
, it's 
different by segment, by business, but how much do you see it between kind 
of between channel mix versus within channel mix? So C&G, obviously on 
the one hand, but then within C&G from a price pack architecture 
perspective.
 
Hugh Johnston
 
I mean in g
eneral, it's going to be, I think, more between channels than it is 
within channels by package. But that's a very general statement and 
obviously, with a big complicated portfolio. But generally speaking, it's going

And the last question is just, if you could address kind of the concern I have 
been hearing for a while from investors, which is execution on a very 
enticing strategy, right, a strategy that I think makes sense to people.
 
How 
do you philosophically incentivize folks all the way down the line about some 
of the more complex messages? And as you mentioned a couple of times so 
far in answering prior question, a complex company. So for example, Power 
of One, what does that actu
ally mean to the Frito driver? What does that 
actually mean? How do they think about it, and how do you in fact 
incentivize that? As you're focused more and more on that, are you thinking 
about, or have you incentivized folks differently at that level? So 
execution 
of the broad umbrella, but incentivization all the way down the line is a 
philosophical question.
 
Indra Nooyi
 
Ali, I'm going to let John and Eric tell you exactly how they do it, but let me 
put it in a fairly simple way. To the driver, he's also 
a consumer, he needs a 
bag of Lays, he's thirsty, he needs to have a beverage. And so that's the 
simplest expression of Power of One because they live it every day. But 
beyond that, let me pass it to John and Eric to talk about how they actually 
incentiviz
e their route salesmen.
 
Eric Foss
 
This is Eric. I think a couple of things on Power of One. Again, if you really 
think about what we're trying to do from the most senior levels down to the 
frontline is we think Power of One can do 3 things for us. It can a
ccelerate 
growth; it can eliminate or enhance our selling and service advantage, 
particularly at the frontline which you're referencing; and it can help us 
reduce costs and become a more efficient operator. I think we've made a 
couple of moves: One, we do 
have an incentive structure at the senior level, 
where both the Frito and the beverage system is incented on a North 
America wide number. So that's a big change from where we've been 
historically. Second, we've harmonized our field structure so that the Fr
ito
-
Lay structure and the beverage structure geographically are aligned. That 
has not been the case historically. And so I think those 2 things, plus a great 
example is, Sunday for the first time ever, as Indra mentioned in her 
comments, we will have a mom
ents to say, ""coupon drop."" It is a very 
leverageable entity for our frontline to go build joint displays and to actually 
build that team selling effort at the frontline, I think, are great examples of 
how we're trying to implement Power of One from the mo
st senior levels 
down through the frontline selling organization.
 
Indra Nooyi
 
But Eric, is it fair to say that snacks and beverages are a logical bundle, 
therefore, it's intuitively obvious that it should be pulled together.
 
Eric Foss
 
There's not 2 more co
mpatible products if you look at it at the point of 
consumption for the consumer, so obviously, that makes it a very sellable 
proposition for our trade customers.
 
John Compton
 
And the only thing I would add to this is Eric and his team there had been a 
yea
r now into integrating the businesses. First, he had to integrate PBG and 
PAF, PBG and PAS into NAB. And now as a frontline, Frito
-
Lay in the PBC 
teams coming together store
-
by
-
store activating because we're now giving 
them real programs to go activate. We
 
are just beginning, I think, to realize 
that benefit.

Your next question comes from Mark Swartzberg of Stifel, Nicolaus.
 
Mark Swartzberg

Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.
 
I guess 2 questions. First, Indra, on the AMP, you talked in the past 
about 
Coke went through this reset period seven years ago. Is it fair to think that 
your reset period sort of began middle of last year and this year, or do you 
think it's a more extended period?
 
Indra Nooyi
 
Hugh, you want to?
 
Hugh Johnston
 
Yes, sure. Mark
, it's Hugh. I think we've really been investing in that in 
beverages over the last couple of years. If you think back, it was really in 
2008 when we started to redo the packaging. In 2009, we obviously carried 
that forward in a significant way and then ob
viously, brought the bottling 
organization and PepsiCo together. And then in addition to that, we've 
obviously been sort of working our way through the brands with Gatorade, 
and now we've been doing things with Tropicana and Pepsi. So I think it's 
fair to 
say, we've been doing this over the course of the last couple of years 
as opposed to just a year or so. And from what we see, it really is yielding 
results both in terms of the performance of the business from a volume 
standpoint, as well as from the brand
 
equity scores, which we have seen 
strengthened across the vast majority of the portfolio. So I think we're a 
couple of years into it at this point.
 
Indra Nooyi
 
Yes. But Hugh, I think it's also safe to say that we are making these 
additional investments wh
ile delivering great earnings performance.
 
Hugh Johnston
 
That's correct.
 
Mark Swartzberg

Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.
 
I mean, obviously, you're going to be growing it past '11. But in terms of the 
notion of step functioning it, do you believe that you've
 
step functioned it, 
you're done step
-
functioning at the end of this year?
 
Hugh Johnston
 
Yes. I think generally speaking, Mark, we're comfortable with the amount of 
money we have in the business, and we're comfortable that we can manage 
it within our guida
nce and within the portfolio.
 
Mark Swartzberg 
-
 
Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.
 
Okay. Great. And then shifting over to the nutrition business, which is multi
-
geography, multi
-
division. Can you give us an update on how you're 
managing the 
communication, the planning on the tracking of performance 
for that business, which includes multiple managers in multiple regions?
 
Indra Nooyi
 
Mark, to tell you, the primacy of the P&L at Pepsico is the regions. So PAS, 
PAB, Europe and EMEA is the primacy
 
of the P&L, and that's where all the 
execution metrics exist, and that's where they really worry about how you 
bring products to life in each of the channels with each of the customers. So 
that's the primacy of the P&L. If you look at any large multinatio
nal 
company, there's always a matrix. There's a regional organization and global 
segments, and primacy is usually with one or the other. In PepsiCo, it's for 
the region. But in the past, we've never had global segments that 
harmonized platform, harmonized 
brand architecture and really looked at 
how to leverage the power of the company. And in PepsiCo, in particular, 
we've remained regionally focused. We came to the realization that the 
Global Nutrition Group needed to be managed globally, purely from an 
inn
ovation, brand architecture, platform development perspective, not from 
managing the day
-
to
-
day P&L. So the GNG group is responsible for helping 
generate top line growth and ensuring that it's top line growth with good 
gross margin. And then what they have
 
is the regional representatives into 
GNG, where each region or big country cluster gives input to GNG on what 
they need for their regions so that the GNG platform development can be 
consistent with what the regions need. And again, this is not in 200 
coun
tries. We're focused on 15 countries, and that's what we are using as 
the first push to drive the GNG growth. And this sort of wiring started the 
day we formed GNG. And the Global Nutrition Group works with each of the 
sector heads in each of the regions t
o make sure that there's a constant 
dialogue between the 2 to make sure the innovation actually yields top line 
and bottom line results.

And our final question will be from Damian Witkowski of Gabelli.
 
Damian Witkowski

I 
wanted to dive into North America a little bit more, U.S. in particular, and 
get your thoughts on strength across different channels, not just in the first 
quarter but what you're seeing through today. And as the construction 
worker back, is it getting bet
ter in the C&G channel and such? And then 
even if you look at the U.S. across West Coast, East Coast in the Middle, and 
sort of, are you seeing a different pattern of recovery across those regions?
 
Indra Nooyi
 
John?
 
John Compton
 
Our C
-
store business has be
en improving, but remembering it's coming off 
of sort of a declining channel a couple of years ago, and it's rolling again. We 
really haven't 
--
 
the first question I think we had this morning was around 
the gas prices, we haven't seen any massive channel s
hifts so far. We really 
haven't seen major regional shifts. Although within markets, there are ups 
and downs. But in total, I don't see any major shifts taking place. Eric, have 
you seen any?
 
Eric Foss
 
No. I think if you look at our business, I mean and 
particularly in small 
formats, C&G, FoodService dollar, drug, all of those channels were strong in 
the quarter, and those are the channels that we tend to see impacted by the 
construction worker, et cetera. So I think our business in the small format 
chann
el, in particular, is very strong.
 
Damian Witkowski

Gabelli & Company, Inc.
 
So you're actually seeing traffic being positive in those 
--
 
in the C&G 
channel?
 
John Compton
 
Yes, we have seen traffic being positive.
 
Indra Nooyi
 
The net numbers we should look
 
at is overall food and beverage in North 
America was up 2%, 2.5%. And within that, there's a lot of channel shifting 
going. Convenience stores are back in focus because people are using that 
to do fill
-
up shopping right now rather than going to a large re
tailer, because 
they don't have the money to go to large retailer and make whole 
purchases, they're using convenience stores to top up.
 
So let me just summarize our call today. Overall, we are pleased with our Q1 
results because they came in line with our 
expectations, our top line was 
strong. Commodities inflation will continue to be a challenge for us and 
everyone in the industry for the foreseeable future, but we'll continue to 
prudently manage the business, balancing volume, pricing and productivity, 
an
d we remain committed to our full year financial outlook.
 
So with that, thank you for joining us.

In the third quarter, organic revenue increased 4.3%, lapping very strong 
4.9% organic revenue growth during the third quarter of last year. And 
year

organic revenue growth stands at 4.6%, an acceleration 
from 3.4% a year ago. So given the strength of our year

date 

expect to meet or exceed our 4% organic revenue growth target fo

year.
 
Our strong performance in the third quarter was broad

revenue growth generated by each one of our divisions. Frito

Lay North 
America grew organic revenue 5.5%, driven by volume growth and net prize

The breadth of our growth was also evidenced across every key retail

3% organic revenue growth we generated in the quarter, driven by solid net

of last year. And we recently launched Bolt24, a new functional beverage 
that supports athletes around the clock by providing advanced all

Other key parts of t
he business also continued to show progress. Trademark 
Pepsi posted its fifth consecutive quarter of net revenue growth and Bubly 
has continued to post very strong growth and is gaining share in the flavored 
sparkling water category aided by packaging and 
flavor innovation. Other 
notable highlights include double

digit net revenue growth for LIFEWTR and 
Propel and high single

Starbucks.
 
Rounding out our North American performance, Quaker Foods delivered net 
rev
enue growth in the quarter propelled by our light snacks, Aunt Jemima 
syrup and mix, Roni and Near East businesses. With our advertising and 
marketing having increased in the quarter and year

focused on accelerating growth at Quaker Food

Before we move on to international, I want to note the terrific work our 
supply chain and customer teams are doing in North America with our 
snacks and beverages businesses, receiving the two top ranking in the 2019 
U.S. Advantage Survey for Food Multic

annual surveys, where retailers across multiple channels provide feedback

solid organic revenue growth in the third quarter, despite ongoing

growth in Mexico, Saudi Arabia, China, Turkey and Pakistan, and high single

focusing on.
 
First is advancing
 
environmental, social and economic benefits to farmers 
and communities by promoting more sustainable agriculture. Through our 
sustainable farming program in 2018, we achieved a key milestone with over 
half our farmer
-
sourced agricultural raw materials, li
ke potatoes, whole corn, 
oranges and oats, verified as sustainability sourced. Our aim is to reach 
100% by the end of 2020.
 
Second is improving water stewardship across our businesses and in the 

 
efficiency 
and aiming to replenish 100% of the water we consume for manufacturing in 
high water risk areas by 2025.
 
Third is delivering our vision of a world, where plastic packaging need never 
become waste. We recently unveiled a new target to reduce 35%
 
of virgin 
plastic content across our beverage brands by 2025, driven by increased use 
of recycled content and alternative packaging materials.
 
Fourth is improving choices across our portfolio by continuing to reduce 
added sugars, sodium and saturated fats
 
in many of our products. We 
currently offer several choices that address this objective, including Pepsi 

and Sunbites Veggie Harvest. And we will continue to expand our offerings 
o
f more nutritional options.
 
Our fifth focus area is mitigating the impact of climate change by curbing 
greenhouse gas emissions across all our value chain with an ambitious goal 
to reduce absolute greenhouse gas emissions across our value chain by 20% 
by 2
030.
 

respect for human rights, promoting diversity and inclusion in our workplace 
and increasing the earnings potential of women in our communities. This is a 
journey with a lot o
f work ahead of us, but we want all of our stakeholders 
to know that advancing to sustainability and being a more purposeful 

 

 
and our brands, we encourage you to read our most recent sustainability 
report.
 

 
Hugh Johnston
 
Thank you, Ramon, and good morning, everyone. As Ramon noted earlier, 
we now expect organic revenue growth to meet or exceed o
ur previous 
objective of 4% growth for the full
-
year. We continue to expect our core 
constant currency earnings per share to decline approximately 1%, as we 
plan to continue to invest in our business for the long
-
term.
 
All other guidance measures provided 
remain unchanged, including a core 
effective tax rate of approximately 21%, free cash flow of approximately $5 
billion and total cash return to shareholders of approximately $8 billion, 
comprised of dividends of approximately $5 billion and share repurchas
es of 
approximately $3 billion.
 
With respect to the fourth quarter, please keep the following in mind as you 
build out your models. First, our asset division will be lapping gains from a 
refranchising and a strategic asset sale; and second, the higher inve
stments 
in the business will continue, and you will see this again reflected in both our 
operating margin performance and core EPS.

How much is

Hey, good morning, everyone. I had a question, I guess, around NAV. And I 
think as you started this year, the investment was in a few different areas, 
one being marketing and product, another being in route, an
d then also in 
packaging, like getting mini cans into the market, I guess.
 
And I guess, specific to CSD, where do you feel you are in the process of 
having all those investments in place and the effect of those in the 
marketplace? I guess, currently in 

 
l
ike how much more is there to go to in 
terms of having that drive some improvement in market share, as we go 
into next year?
 
Ramon Laguarta
 
Yes. Good morning, Bryan. The success of our beverage business is in 
continuing to drive the 

 
the whole portfolio, 
the non

carbonated portfolio. 
So we need to continue to do a great job in our teas, our waters, our teas, 
our sports drinks and then obviously improve the performance in CSDs.

categories for ads and doing very well with some of our critical brands like 
Pepsi. As we discussed last quarter, we still have a pending matter in 
Mountai

we would like to see.
 

we get you back to a what we think is a more sustainable performance. But 



 

performance of Gatorade in the sports drinks category, this quarter reflects 
bo

innovation behind Zero, which is really a very well received incremental 

investments in that category with Bolt24

there will be a bigger roll out of that brand next year.
 
So, overall, we feel good. Again, Mountain Dew continues to be the pending 
matter, But we feel good about the ideas we have, the resources we have 
allocated to this b
rand and how the teams are thinking about Mountain Dew

Vivien Azer
 
Hi, good morning.
 
Ramon Laguarta
 
So I wanted to follow
-
up please on the commentary that you just offered on 
NAB and the continued improvement. With the CSD volumes down 3%, I 
mean, I think, from a fundamental perspective, it is a structurally challenged 
category. So what do you think is r
easonable from a volume perspective? 
What does success look like on the CSD component of the segment? Thank 
you.
 
Ramon Laguarta
 
Yes, great. As we discussed last quarter, I think, there is a 

 
I think a 
structural change in consumer demand and this category
 
is moving to a 
smaller format, different formats that drive a different volume, net revenue 
construction here. So the net revenue of CSD is up. Part of that is pricing, 
but a lot of that is mix and is mix driven by obviously as becoming, I would 
say, more
 
insightful in what are the different occasions that consumers are 
buying our products and offering the best pack for those locations.
 
But also, I think there is a fundamental change in demand or consumers are 

change in the price per liter of 
the category and price per unit. So that is the 

 
and to reiterate into that to 


 
in 
higher pricing.

thinking like the international growth has been accelerating. And I was 
hoping to hear, how do you feel about both beverages and snacks
 
consumption going forward, given the macro volatility? And also if you can, I 

can kind of explain if investments might be going to that 

 
into that brand as 
well going forward?

Okay, let me start with international. It is a volatile, macroeconomic and 
political situation and more and more geopolitical and the macroeconomic 
discipline. And if you go, our larger businesses are performing very well. I 
mean, like Mexico i

We see high growth, double

digit in China, very high growth in India. Even

digit.
 

e seeing a very, still 

gaining share in many of these markets. Part of that is still the categories 
are very 

 
not not very developed and consumers continue to come to our 
categorie
s as we offer more innovative products and more affordable 
products.
 


little bit differently. For example, 

consumers a little bit 

 
a little more defensive, as you know, with all the 


 

 


seeing the categories still growing very healthy and the demand come into 
our categories in good, I would say, good positive l
evels, right.

it is our pending subject. It is a focus of

As we talk

elaborate a little bit on your SodaStream and the opportunity there. I mean, 
just given, I think, priority number one for many, many companies now 
seems to be reducing plastic. And then, what is t
he cost of recycling 
investments that you see hope, you view as a corporate having to make 
alongside, but perhaps states and governments? And then what role the 

off in the way i
t has in parts of Europe?
 
Ramon Laguarta
 


 
we made a strategic bet, right, when we 
decided to go by SodaStream. We saw this potential consumer change 
stores on plastic beverages in part of the world. And also we saw 
that 
SodaStream adds the opportunities for consumers to personalize their drinks 
or add a personal touch to their drink.
 

better than what we had in our business case for M&A. So it co
ntinues to be 
very successful across multiple parts of the world. So, obviously, Western 
Europe, what is started is very, very strong, Germany, France, Holland, 
Central, Northern Europe as well. It is strong in Japan. It is very strong in 
Canada. And there
 

some organizational changes or upgrading talent.

lot.
 
You will see some, I think, some transformational progress for 
SodaStream next year in the U.S. that I think 

 

the step change in household penetration that will give us. But overall, this 
is the huge strategic opportunity for us
 
as a company.
 

knowledge from PepsiCo to SodaStream. And that will make that company 
better in a very, very innovation and design of the machines and some 
technologies direct

company as part of PepsiCo and PepsiCo will be a better company by having

k very good

from the line of Rob Ottenstein of Evercore.
 
Robert Ottenstein
 
Great. Thank you very much. Ramon, you touched on it a little bit in terms 
of consumers moving to smaller packs for CSDs. But I was just wondering if 
you could kind of step back and and give us
 
your assessment of where the 
U.S. consumer is on health and wellness
-
related issues, sugar, artificial 
sweeteners, and what your company strategy is on that? And then one of 

product,
 
and then 

 
but then you come out with the Bolt24. And if I recollect 


responding to it. Thank you very much.
 
R
amon Laguarta
 
Right, the question 

 


play against each one of the vectors of demand in our categories and not all 
the health a
nd wellness, but every vector of demand.
 


going after health and wellness, but also going after indulgence and 
going to 
many spaces in the convenience, association. So a lot of different vectors 
that drive consumer preference and choices. And then, obviously, a very 
important vector, which is price. So premium value and mainstream being a 
very important segmentatio
n as consumers make choices.
 


 
we 

 


to capture demand from all of the different occasions throughout the day. 
That 

 

 


seeing.
 
The trend towards small packs is not only in beverages, it is also in snacks. 
And actually, it has been going on i
n snacks for several years as well, where 
our variety packs in Frito
-
Lay are growing very fast. And then 
internationally, by far, our smaller packs are the number one packaging of 
choice for consumers.
 
Then to the point on Gatorade, yes, Zero is great. Zer
o has been a great 
addition to the category to the brand. It is capturing consumers that I think 
were very heavy users of Gatorade and had abandoned the brand because of 

relevant
 
brand to many more consumers as they exercise or do other 

us, I think, a lot of great moments going forward.
 
Bolt24 is a very low calorie product and is not no added sugars, 

this sugar that is in the 

 
basically the watermelon water that is that is kind 
of the base of the product. Obviously, we reserve the right to have a Zero 
Bolt24 going forward. I think at this point, the brand is positioned for 
athletes of the
 
field and you will see innovation around functionality more 
than sugar, no sugar, but very, very low sugar levels, actually much lower 
than competitors in that space for sure. And I think is the right way to 
launch the brand. It is below 100 calories per 


levels.

And also, I mean, this growth seems to be coming at the expense of 
operating income, which seems to be a change of strategy versus the last 
few years? Should w
e think about the gross margins to continue to compress 
to sustain the growth here? Thank you.
 
Ramon Laguarta
 
Good question, Laurent. Of course, we want our 

 
each one of our 
businesses to be a positive growth business. So Quaker no difference. We 
will con
tinue to invest to make sure that business continues to grow, maybe 
not at the levels that we have Frito

Lay, but yes, good levels.
 

both in CapEx and kind of cost of goods, specif
ically in the area of improving

In terms of the breadth of growth, it is across all the different brands that

sustainable as we put a bit more focus on the brands, the innovation and the 
execution of tho
se particular brands.

Lay organization, so 
they report to Williams. Now he will bring more operational excellence to 
that organization in terms of both supply chain and sales and I think that per

Question on the Pioneer Foods deal and then M&A more broadly. So the 
Pioneer deal announced back in mid

But perhaps a little background how the deal came together and why 
Pioneer is the right asset to accelerate growth in the sub

Saharan Africa 
region? And then more broadly, Ramon, on M&A. Is it fair to say that 
international and food snacks is 
where investors should expect to see capital 
deployed going forward from an M&A perspective? Thank you.
 
Ramon Laguarta
 
Yes. Listen, Pioneer is 


putting a capital against a market opportunity that will de
liver itself in the 
next 20 years.
 

not only because of you have good products, but you need to have very 
good infrastructure, very good, go
-
to

market, very good manufacturing 
clear
ly closer to the consumer and very good talent.
 
I think, from Pioneer, we get a very good set of brands across multiple 
categories, starting with basic food and 

 
but going all the way to more 
sophisticated breakfast solutions and juice solutions. It gives
 
us great talent, 
great local talent that understands how to operate in Africa. It gives us scale 
for our go

to

market and these will help our beverages and our snack 
businesses. And it gives us a good operating efficiency as we integrate all 
these busines
ses.

like clearly pricing

forward? And 
then broadly for Hugh, we clearly hear you on small packages 
and innovation in beverages. But as you look at your overall portfolio, do 
you feel like you have the brand to meet the evolving consumer demand, or 
do you need to look at M&A for your beverage p
ortfolio as well?
 
Ramon Laguarta
 

part of the question. I think we have a very good portfolio actually in North 
America to cover both existing demands and future demands, right? So
 
if 
you think about our CSD brands, when you think about water brands with 
LIFEWTR, Bubly, Aquafina, if you think about our coffee, Starbucks, if you 
think about our teas, Pure Leaf, I mean, we have the newly acquired value
-
added dairy business, SodaStream
 
going forward.
 
So we have, I think, a very broad portfolio to cover both existing demands, 
future demands. And as I said, indulgent functional hydration, I mean 


e smaller brands to add to their portfolio, like we 

will not be meaningful to the overall breakdown of the portfolio that I think 
we have the big brands that we need to take the bus
iness forward and those 
brands can innovate into multiple spaces, right?
 

has been playing on part of the market. Now we take it to another part of 
the market and we generate $500 mi
llion of additional revenue in one year 
now. So I think we have the brands that we need to keep those brands very 
relevant, keep them modern, keep them attractive to the consumer as the 
new generations come into the marketplace, and then we need to keep 
in

broad enough brands that can cover multiple spaces.
 


I said, keep 
innovating and keep building the brand into more modern ways of 


the other part?
 
Hugh Johnston
 
Yes, re
garding Frito
-

one, the Sabra business. We include Sabra in our volume, but not in our 

revenue. Sabra is growing below the Frit
o
-
Lay average and the product is 
quite heavy.
 

two points of volume if you back out Sabra. That relates more directly to the 
5.5 Frito
-
Lay revenue. So that leaves you about 3.5 p
oints of price mix. 

average over the last couple of years, but not dramatically.
 
So and mix is clearly a tailwind as well as we move more of the portfolio into 
premium products. So I thi

with that relationship. Once you back out Sabra maybe a little bit less, but 
not dramatically so in the Frito

Lay business.

changed some packaging, we improved our communication, we improved 
our execution o

ortunity and we have

to

personalizing consumpti
on for Gatorade to make sure our kind of value 
added to the consumer is higher, more personalized.
 


 

a much broader set of efforts across the organization to make sure that we 
cont
inue to be the preferred house of solutions for sports drinks, Gatorade 

for low calorie hydration. And the same now with Bolt24 we expect to 
innovate going forward.
 

 
looking at this opportunity and physical performance is a big 
going forward consumer need that I think we want to participate not only 
with hydration, maybe other solutions as well.

inherently involves risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to 
differ materially from current predictions and expectations. Information on 
such risks can be found in today's earnings release and our most recent

reconciliations on our website under the Investors section under Events and 
Presentations tab.
 
As a reminder, beginning this quarter, P
epsiCo reported its realigned 
segments. We provided retrospectively revised summary segment results,

And now it is my pl
easure to introduce Indra Nooyi.
 
Indra Nooyi
 
Thank you, Jamie, and good morning everyone. Despite a continued choppy 
global macro environment, we are happy to report another great quarter at 
PepsiCo.
 
In the third quarter, organic revenue grew 7.4%, with Gl
obal Snacks up 
10% and Global Beverages up 5%. Core gross margin improved by 120 
basis points. Core constant currency operating profit increased 12% and 
core constant currency EPS increased 14%.
 
Based on our year
-
to
-
date performance and our outlook for the
 
balance of 
the year, we are increasing our full year 2015 core constant currency EPS 
growth outlook to 9%. Also, we now plan to return approximately $9 billion 
to shareholders through dividends and buybacks with share buybacks at the 
high
-
end of the range
 
we had guided to. Hugh will go into additional details 
of our guidance later.
 
But let me now comment briefly on our results. We again had very strong 
results in North America, and this comprises over 60% of our net revenue 
and approximately two
-
thirds of 
our core division operating profit year
-
to
-
date.
 
North America Beverage had a terrific quarter in which we grew our organic 
volume by 3%, organic revenue by 5%, and core constant currency 
operating profit by 10%. During the quarter, we held value shares in
 
liquid 
refreshment beverages and gained value share across important sub
-
categories including ready
-
to
-
drink tea and water.
 
Frito
-
Lay North America delivered another quarter of solid results with 
organic revenue growth of 2% and core constant currency ope
rating profit 
growth of 7%. Core operating margins increased by 155 basis points, 
reflecting execution of price
-
pack architecture management and ongoing 
productivity initiatives across the value chain.
 
In Quaker Foods North America, organic revenue increas
ed 2% and core 
constant currency operating profit increased 1.5%, and operating profit 
performance is noteworthy given the fact that they are lapping a divestiture 
gain in the prior year. Quaker has gained value share in both hot and read
-
to
-
eat cereal, bo
th in the quarter and year
-
to
-
date.
 
And we are proud to report that during the third quarter, PepsiCo was the 
largest contributor to US retail sales growth among all food and beverage 
manufacturers with over $400 million of retail sales growth in all major
 
channels. This was double the next largest contributor to growth. Notably, 
North American beverages was the key driver of US retail sales growth 
within PepsiCo and the largest contributor to US retail sales growth on a 
standalone basis.
 
On a year
-
to
-
date 
basis, PepsiCo has contributed over $1.1 billion of retail 
sales growth in all major channels, which again was the largest contributor 
to US retail sales growth among all food and beverage manufacturers, and 
this is really 2.5 times the next largest contri
butor to growth.
 
Now turning to our international market. In our developing and emerging 
markets, although we continue to face volatile and challenging macros in a 

competitive in this mark
et 

 
in this marketplace, and we continue to see 
good growth in a number of these markets. For example, our business in 
Turkey achieved double
-
digit organic revenue growth, Mexico achieved high
-
single
-
digit organic revenue growth, and Egypt achieved mid
-
si
ngle
-
digit 
organic revenue growth.
 
And as we mentioned last quarter, in each of our earnings calls, we will 
provide an update on our big initiatives to drive our operating and financial 
performance, brand building innovation, execution, productivity, and c
ash 
returns to shareholders.
 
On our Q2 earnings call, we talked about innovation. Today, we are focused 

environment. With volatile macros globally and increasingly competitive 
landscape w
ith digital technologies disrupting many aspects of our business, 
productivity has never been more important. And as all of you know well, 
productivity enables current financial performance and provides investment 
funding to sustain growth into the future.
 
When we think of productivity, we 
think both in terms of efficiency, which is getting the same result using 
fewer resources and effectiveness getting a greater result using the same 
resources. Our productivity initiatives to
-
date have been largely focused
 
on 
efficiency and we have had pretty good results. We delivered $3 billion in 

year of our current five
-
year, $5 billion program that we started in 2015, 
and this productivity has 
been supported in large part by investments we 
made in technology, starting with our implementation of SAP in the early 
2000s, and this allowed us to establish a common operating language and to 
standardize operating metrics across the globe.
 
We also adopt
ed an operating model that has reduced plans and layers in 
the organization and has promoted the sharing of best practices around the 
world. We also established truly global functions in operations, procurement, 
IT, HR, and finance as well as very lean cat
egory horizontals that are driving 
greater capability building, harmonization and efficiency in new product 
development and global brand management.
 
Together, our technology investments and operating model are allowing us 
to leverage our global scale to a 
much greater extent. With these 
foundational elements in place, we have made progress in multiple areas.
 
First, increased automation. We have installed packaging automation across 
approximately a third of our snacks plant worldwide enabling us to reduce 
pa
ckaging label costs in these facilities by at least 50%. In Frito
-
Lay North 
America, for example, approximately 65% of all production utilizes fully 
automated packaging. In Mexico, we updated the majority of our packaging 
tubes with high speed equipment ov
er the last few years, enabling us to 
increase throughput by approximately 40%. Across the Middle East, we 
installed automated palletizing and warehousing technologies in many key 
markets, resulting in improvement in labor productivities since 2013.
 
Second
, we are restructuring our go
-
to
-
market systems. Since the success 
of our Perry, Georgia pilots in 2009, we have expanded our geographic 
enterprise solutions or GES as we call them at Frito
-
Lay North America to a 
total of 11 projects, which are now at vari
ous stages of deployment across 
locations in both the US and Canada. The consolidation of these plants and 
distribution networks will result in scale that enables economic 
implementation of automated order picking, the reduction of distribution 
centers, an
d a highly efficient direct
-
to
-
store delivery system directly from 
our plant. This model is also being applied to the North American beverages 
business, where they are combining large format and small format routes on 
the same trucks. The plan is to elimin
ate geographic overlap resulting in 
15% fewer routes.
 
Third, we are optimizing our global manufacturing footprint. Since 2010, we 
have reduced the number of company
-
owned beverage plants in North 

ty utilization 
by 20%. In Europe, in the past three years, we closed six plants across our 
beverage and dairy businesses, decreasing our footprint by 7% and 
generating more than $20 million of annual savings and further increasing 
our capacity utilization.
 

centers and selectively outsourcing financial transaction processing, 
accounting, reporting and other back office tasks. To
-
date the program has 
been executed in 18 countries, reduci
ng costs, while improving analytical 
capabilities and service levels and streamlining IT infrastructure.
 
Our efficiency journey is in no way done. In addition to the major supply 
chain productivity initiatives, we have also embarked on our version of zero
-
based budgeting, something we call smart spending. You know, we studied 
ZBB in great detail and we realized that implementing it as currently 
designed, ran the risk of starting resources to drive topline growth 
initiatives. Our version of ZBB or smart spen
ding as we call it focuses on 
rightsizing our operating expenses, now that we are beginning to see 
benefits from our technology investments and global coordination, while 
ring
-
fencing top line driving resources to focus more on deriving additional 
effectiv
eness from them. And this is a balanced approach, one that focuses 
both on a relentless drive for efficiency but preserves investments to drive 
top line growth, which brings me to our focus on increasing the effectiveness 
of our spent.
 
We have expanded our
 
view of productivity to ensure greater effectiveness 

sharpening our capabilities in revenue management to drive greater 

lding the 
required tools and training to realize a greater return on our advertising and 
marketing investments. And we are developing new product platforms that 
can scale across multiple countries rapidly. And all of this is being enabled 
and accelerated b
y our lean global category structures. We believe our 
approach is working and driving meaningful tangible results. Over the past 
three years ending in 2014, we have realized an average of $1 billion of 
annual productivity savings. Net revenue per employee 
is up 10%, operating 
profit per employee is up 9%. This quarter marks our 13th consecutive 
quarter of gross margin expansion.
 
And from year
-
end 2011, Capex as a percent of net revenues went down 
from 4.9% to 4.1% on a rolling four quarter basis. 
Importantly, these 
achievements have contributed to strong free cash productivity and core net 
ROIC improvement. Since the beginning of 2013 to the third quarter of 
2015, we have generated cumulative core free cash flow excluding certain 
items of more than
 
$22 billion which represents 115% of core net income 
over the same time period. And core net ROIC has increased by 380 basis 
points to 19.1% at the end of the third quarter 2015 compared to 15.3% at 
end year 2012. Ultimately, we believe our approach creat
es a virtual cycle 
with productivity fueling the reinvestment and transformation necessary for 
sustainable top and bottom line growth and shareholder value creation.
 
With this, let me turn the call over to Hugh Johnston. Hugh?
 
Hugh Johnston
 
Thank you Indra
 

As Indra mentioned based on the strength of our year
-
to
-
date performance 

-
year 
core constant currency EPS growth target to 9% 
from 8% previously, which 
includes the expected fourth quarter impact of the Venezuela accounting 
change. Additional details regarding the change in accounting for Venezuela 
can be found in our third quarter earnings release and in the soon to be 
released 
10
-
Q. Our other targets remain unchanged. For the full
-
year 2015, 
we continue to expect mid
-
single digit organic revenue growth, core 
operating margin expansion as organic top line growth and productivity 
should offset negative geographic mix and commodity
 
inflation which 
incorporates the impact of transaction
-
related foreign exchange headwinds, 
and approximately $1 billion in productivity savings.
 
Below the division operating line, we continue to expect corporate cost to be 
lower, a core tax rate of approx
imately 25% and a reduced share count. We 
now expect foreign exchange translation to negatively impact net revenue 
and core earnings per share growth by approximately 10 and 11 percentage 
points respectively based on current market consensus rates. Taking 
our 
2014 core EPS of $4.63 and applying our guidance and current market 
consensus of foreign exchange impact implies 2015 core EPS of 

consider the following. First we expect foreign e
xchange translation to have 
an approximate 8 point unfavorable impact on fourth quarter net revenue 
growth and an approximate 8 point unfavorable impact on fourth quarter 
core EPS growth based on current market consensus rates. Venezuelan 
operations contri
buted $0.03 to core EPS in the prior year quarter. Second, 
the North American beverages business will face a difficult core constant 
currency operating profit growth comparison.
 
Below the division operating profit line, net interest expense is expected to 
increase in the fourth quarter versus last year, driven by higher interest 
rates and higher debt balances. From a cash flow perspective, we continue 
to expect full
-
year free cash flow excluding certain items of more than $7 
billion. We expect our capital a
llocation discipline to continue to drive core 

ROIC with core net ROIC up 380 basis points from 2012 to 19.1% through 
the third quarter of 2015 on rolling a four quarter basis. We expe
ct 
shareholder cash returns to be very strong. We now expect to return 
approximately $9 billion to shareholders in 2015, approximately $4 billon in 
dividends and $5 billion in share repurchases. Our current repurchase 
outlook is at the high end of the rang
e we provided last quarter. Our 
annualized dividend is now $2.81 and approximate 60% payout ratio based 
on 2014 core EPS. This represents the 43rd consecutive year of annual 
dividend increases and our annualized dividends per share have grown at a 
10% comp
ound annual rate over the past ten years.
 
So to summarize, our core constant currency earnings per share outlook for 
2015 has improved from our last call and free cash flow, disciplined capital 
allocation and returning cash to our shareholders remain top p
riorities for

Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of 
John Faucher of JP Morgan.
 
Indra Nooyi
 
Good morning John
 
John Fau
cher
 
Good morning Indra. You talked about some of the markets that are doing 
well and you know I think the more 
--
 
where the street is really concerned 
here is in terms of some of the markets where you know Russia, Brazil, 
where we think there is potential
ly a little more macro impact and given the 
fact that you guys are about four weeks into the quarter, can you talk about 

the consumer and how should we think about those markets going 
forward?
 
And then a quick question for Hugh, which is, if we look at this, it seems as 
though Venezuela is about 3% this year on a run rate basis of earnings, 

balance coming out thro
ugh the first three quarters of next year? Thanks.
 
Indra Nooyi
 
John, global macros are volatile as I mentioned in my prepared comments. 
And whenever there is volatility in the marketplace, the consumer behavior 
does reflect some of this volatility. The goo

items or high ticket items; we are basic food and beverage items. So, we 
see a slowdown but not significant. Having said that, I think the most 
important thing is we have a portfolio that we can play between developed, 
and 
developing, and emerging markets, and somehow we balance the 
portfolio to deliver the results, but the macro volatility is here to stay.
 
Hugh Johnston
 
And then, John to answer your question regarding Venezuela, as you 


fourth quarter, and we are covering that as a part of our 9% guidance. For 

What I will share with investors is, in 2015, Venezuela is worth 
about $0.10,

Your next question comes from the line of Dara Mohsenian of Morgan 
St
anley.
 
Dara Mohsenian
 
So, first just a detailed question for Hugh, do you guys have an extra week 
in 2016? And if you do, how much will that add to EPS? And then, the real 
question is hoping for an update on the potato chip revenue management 
program at FL
NA. How is it trending so far versus expectations, how is it 
being received by consumers and your retail partners? And going forward 
from here, should we expect volume growth to improve sequentially or will it 
really take another couple of quarters before 
we cycle the program to see 
sustained volume improvement? Thanks.
 
Hugh Johnston
 
So Dara on the 53rd week, the answer is yes. We do have a 53rd week ever 
fifth or sixth year depending on how the days fall. And 2016 will be a 53
-
week year. As I mentioned on 


handle that right now.
 
Indra Nooyi
 

work we did on that reve
nue management program beginning to take root. 

to manage the SKUs on the shelves which were really getting much too 

 
all of the work 
we did over the last three quarters. Volume growth is beginning to come 
back, and clearly profitability has been helped by the whole revenue 
management program.
 
Hugh Johnston
 
In addition to that there 
--
 
one of the goals of the 
program was to increase 
the number of households that are buying Lays by virtue of recognizing the 
smaller households in the United States and in fact that impact is happening. 
So we feel good about the strategy as well as the revenue management 
implicatio
ns.
 
Operator
 
Your next question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane of Bank of 
America.
 
Bryan Spillane
 
Hey, good morning, everyone.
 
Indra Nooyi
 
Hey, Bryan.
 
Bryan Spillane
 
I guess just two questions related to the comments on productivity. I think, 
first,
 

about $700 million of profit this year. So could you just give us some 
context in terms of how much of that profit growth has come from 
productivity dropping, how much of it is just 
the natural leverage in the 
business and maybe some context in terms of rate of reinvestment this 
year?
 
Hugh Johnston
 
Yeah, Bryan, as always, this is a challenging question to answer, because in 

rom a 
channel and product perspective, isolating one of the variables is a little bit 
tricky. What I would say is this, the combination of the higher productivity in 
addition to that, the benefits that we are relatively getting on commodities 
and then comp

portfolio of 4% and comparing that to the level of fixed cost leverage we get 
through P&L, 60 basis points for the quarter we think is a good number for 

 
and the balancing act of 

a bit difficult to isolate the variable. Suffice it to say, we are investing 
meaningful amounts in R&D and A&M in order to drive the top line growth 
that 
you are seeing.
 
Indra Nooyi
 
And we have new tools and technologies as we get more digital tools that 
are disrupting many parts of our business.
 
Operator
 
Your next question comes from the line of Caroline Levy of CLSA.
 
Caroline Levy
 
Thanks so much. Good mor
ning. I wonder if you could just take us through 
the US beverage environment in a little bit more detail, talking about how 
carbonated soft drinks are doing, particularly diets versus specifics, you 
mentioned how strong tea is, but 
--
 
and how that shift in
 
categories affect 
margins going forward?
 
Indra Nooyi
 
Good morning, Caroline. The US beverage environment is pretty good 
actually. There is good portfolio management happening in the industry and 
I would say that the CSD market continues to be under pressu
re from a 
volume perspective. From a value perspective, because of good revenue 
management and good pricing in the industry, the value numbers are way 
better than the volume numbers. But clearly the big story here is non
-
carbs 
and the non
-
carbs are really 

industry. And again, in non
-
carbs, profitability varies. I mean, it ranges all 
the way from bottled water to other products that have higher profitability. 
So I think the challenge at every point in the North A
merican beverage 
business is really two
-
fold if you want to think about it. How do you play the 
game across the portfolio between CSDs and non
-
carbs and within CSDs 
how do you alternate between a Mountain Dew versus a Pepsi versus a 

e balancing game that we have to go through.
 
But the second part is also channel
-
wise, how much emphasis you play on 
single serves and driving single
-
serve sales which have got a different profit 
profile than large pack or multi
-
serve products. So the chal
lenge in this 

whole game intelligently. Now, I will tell you one thing, the fact that we own 
the bulk of our bottling systems and the fact that most of our bottlers are 
very align
ed, we have very good set of bottling partners, actually allows us 
to be a lot more nimble and effect in the market, the right pricing strategies, 
revenue management strategies and get the right innovation into the 
marketplace.
 
Operator
 
Your next question 
comes from the line of Judy Hong of Goldman Sachs.
 
Judy Hong
 
Thank you. Good morning, everyone.
 
Indra Nooyi
 
Good morning, Judy.
 
Judy Hong
 
So, Indra, you talked about the focus on increasing the promotion of 
spending effectiveness as part of the productivit
y indicatives. I was hoping 
to get a little bit more color just in terms of where do you think PepsiCo is in 

spend effectiveness programs for a while, so how is it different this time
? Is 
it more evolutionary versus revolutionary and then some of the categories 
that you think are kind of life for this to continue within your portfolio. And 
then, Hugh, just a follow up on Venezuela. So it seems like Venezuela 
probably added about 1 to 2
 
points to revenue growth, so can you just 
clarify or quantify the revenue impact and then in the fourth quarter as you 
deconsolidate Venezuela, how much of the organic revenue growth is that 
risk in terms of taking that out of your P&L.
 
Indra Nooyi
 

you are asking us to get into what really drives PepsiCo, but I will just 
roughly tell you that, you have to look at trade spending management and 
revenue management together, becaus
e in a way the two of them are how 
we manage the shelf. And as the digital tools get better and better and more 
tools are available to get more visibility into consumer interaction of 
different packages, the way we do revenue management improves. So if we 
look at Frito
-

spending and revenue management program because in a way, the way we 
manage the packaging there improves the profitability of the retailers in 
addition to improving the whole spending ef
fectiveness.
 
So I think the pace at which we move in this area is a function of the tools 
available for us to have more visibility into consumer buying decisions and 
how we do self
-

in tools, traini
ng, capabilities and we are making sure everybody gets 
trained in these tools, developing market tools, emerging market tools, 
developed market tools, what we do with modern trade, what do we do with 


going to take a few years before we are fully done. But as these tools roll 

in Frito
-
Lay. The Project Drive was a great example of it. And even our North
 
American beverage profitability in a way is a function of how they are 
intelligently managing both their product portfolio and trade spending. So 
with that, let me turn to Hugh to talk about your second question about 
Venezuela.
 
Hugh Johnston
 
Yeah, Judy, 
in terms of year
-
to
-
date, Venezuela is worth about 2 points in 
our numbers. And in terms of going forward into the fourth quarter, when 
we talk about organic revenue growth, we are treating the deconsolidation 
as a structural change, so we will basically t
alk organic ex

Venezuela.

Your next question comes from the line of Vivien Azer of Cowen & Company.
 
Vivien Azer
 
Hi, good morning.
 
Indra Nooyi
 
Good morning, Vivian.
 
Vivien Azer
 
My question has to do with your European segment and 
specifically your 
beverage volumes. I recognize that you are lapping a slightly easier 
compare. But it does look like your volumes inflected nicely, so I was hoping 
you could offer some color on the drivers of that. Thank you.
 
Indra Nooyi
 
We have a largely
 
zero
-
calorie portfolio in Europe and parts of the country, 
parts of the region did well and there were parts where places like Russia we 
focused more on value than we did on volume, because in those markets 

to make sure your price 
through to get the value up. In France, Germany, Turkey, we had very good 
beverage strength. And in countries like Russia, because of inflation, the 
market was tough. But those are all again, I come back to this notion of the 
portfo

capability we, as a company, have to develop and we have is how we 
manage the portfolio intelligently to deliver a set of numbers for the 
company overall. And again managing the company for value

Your next question comes from the line Ali Dibadj of Bernstein.
 
Ali Dibadj
 
Hey, guys.
 
A 
-
 
Indra Nooy
i
 
Good morning, Ali.
 
Ali Dibadj
 
Hi. So I have two basic qu
estions for you. One is when you look at your 
organic sales numbers there seems to be two things that are a little 
unexpected or weird. One is obviously that 33% Latin America pricing 
number and the second is the strong 3% volumes in NAB. So, on the former
, 
can you just give us a little bit more detail about where that comes from? 
Was that really all Venezuela, how much was Argentina and when you 
deconsolidate Venezuela what does that pricing specifically number look like 
if Venezuela isn't in there? On the
 
NAB, good volume numbers, it sounds like 
a lot of that was stills. Can you give us a breakdown on volume growth 
between stills and CSDs, so that's question one?
 
The second question is 
--
 
Indra Nooyi
 
Let's get the question one answered. Go ahead.
 
Hugh John
ston
 
So Ali, two things on that. Ex
-
Venezuela, Latin America was up 9% and 
number two, regarding your question on breakdown on volumes, the 3% of 
overall volume growth, CSDs were down 1.9, non
-
carbs or stills as you call 
them were up almost 10%. And then w
ithin CSDs, regulars were down 1 and 
diets were down 6.5.
 
Ali Dibadj
 
Okay. So super helpful on that one. In terms of the second question, love to 
hear how you guys are thinking about the potential implications of ABI/SAB 
to the PepsiCo business. So 
PepsiCo obviously including the Brazil bottling, 
what might happen there, how are you guys thinking about that, because 

speculations. You guys have clearly done, you usually do good anal
ytics, 
good math on thinking through the implications here for you guys?
 
Indra Nooyi
 
Great question, but we don't comment or speculate on these matters, as it 
relates to specific bottlers, customers and suppliers.
 
Operator
 
Your next question comes from the
 
line of Bill Schmitz from Deutsche Bank.
 
Bill Schmitz
 
A couple of questions on the US, just to sort of drill a little deeper on some 
previous questions. So do you still think the US bottling assets are strategic 
long
-
term assets and how far are you from h
aving them fully optimized?
 
Indra Nooyi
 
Bill, as I mentioned earlier on my comments regarding North American 
beverages, today more than ever, the portfolio is shifting to non
-
carbs. 
Innovation is becoming more fragmented and the life cycle of innovation is
 
being shorter and the trade becoming more and more complex. Having 
control of the manufacturing and distribution systems becomes critical.
 
And when we have independent bottlers, having them aligned is even more 
critical and I'll tell you based on our rece
nt North American bottling meeting, 
Al Carey and the team did a brilliant job and the system is more aligned 
than I've ever seen before. So I think these bottling assets are strategic and 
as I said earlier, this is a journey.
 
As the marketplace evolves, we
 
have to keep evolving and optimizing our 
bottling assets. We've done a lot with the manufacturing assets. As we 
mentioned, the capacity 

 


routes and 
reducing the number of routes by 15%.
 
As equivalent of GES or Geo Box as our beverage guys call it, get 
implemented. We too start thinking about different ways to leverage the 

m and 
they are doing the right things to focus on revenue management, trade 
spending segments, marketing, innovation, training the portfolio, intelligent 
pricing. So I think we are in a good place in North American beverages.
 
Operator
 
Your next question co
mes from the line of Kevin Grundy of Jefferies.
 
Kevin Grundy
 
Indra, so my question to come back to North American beverages, 
specifically carbonated soft drinks. So profit growth in NAB has been 
outstanding this year. From a market share perspective, Indra

spoken in the past about managing that market share within a corridor. And 
as I look at the Nielsen data, it looks like you guys have been losing share 
within CSDs, not just on a four
-
week, 12
-
week, but over the past year and 
I'm just curiou
s, number one, if you're comfortable with the share position 
now or if at some point, more investment is needed here whether that's 
innovation, whether this is trade spend, et cetera. So any comments there 
with respect to your carbonated soft drink trends 
here will be helpful? Thank 
you.
 
Indra Nooyi
 
We're happy with where we are right now and the portfolio is working Kevin. 
That's the most important thing. When the marketplace starts shifting more 
towards non
-

r investment 
in non
-
carbs, our innovation in non
-
carbs, which is really what we've been 
doing.
 
And in case of CSDs, there has been a small share loss, but if you look 
across the portfolio, margin is doing exceedingly well. We are doing very 
well in small f
ormat. Anyway to the question, I think that we've really been 
working the portfolio to make sure that talent management, price back 
management, trade management, innovation management and overall 
portfolio management work to deliver overall LRB share incre
ase.
 
And that's really what we are focused on. I think focusing just on CSDs is 
actually a thing of the past and I would strongly suggest everybody looks at 
total LRB, because that's the right way to look at the market going forward.

Now, your last comment notwithstanding, I do have a question on 

made the switch to aspartame
-
free on diet Pe

the consumer reaction has been to the move?
 

used Stevia in some cases, just where we should look at how this is 
developing and how the consumer is reactin
g to these new products? Thank 
you
 
Indra Nooyi
 
Bill, it's too early to tell you exactly how the consumer is reacting, because 

repeat adoption cycle is. So at the end of Q4, when we
 
go into next year, we 
might be able to give you some more information, but at this point, it's way 
too early to talk about how aspartame
-
free is performing in the marketplace.
 
And in terms of new sweetness, all the information is out there in the 
marketplace. We've been talking about it. I don't see a zero calorie naturally 
sweetened CSD on the horizon in the next few years, but if you want to talk 
about low
-
calorie naturally sweetener beverages, I think combination of 
sweeteners, tools, techniques
, we have probably the best portfolio of 
development tools to enable that to happen.
 
It may not always be in CSDs, but it will be a part of it in non
-
carbs, part in

Your next question comes from the line of Steve Powers of UBS.
 
Steve Powers
 
So Frito
-
Lay volumes were a bit b
etter and I think some investors fear they 
might be just based on the standard data trends. So is there any light you 
can shine on that related to maybe sell
-
in versus sellout timing or strength 
in outside the track channels for example, foodservice, that'
s my first 
question.
 
And then, Indra, longer term, picking up on your commentary surrounding 
productivity, as you look forward over the next four years of your current 
program, how do you see that balance between efficiency and effectiveness 
contributing t
o the next 4 billion? Is it split, is it skewed one way or another 
and then within the efficiency bucket, do the drivers remains supply chain 
restructuring and smart spending or are there other initiatives on the 
horizon that we should be thinking about? T
hanks.
 
Indra Nooyi
 
In fact, I'm going to take the productivity question. I am going to have Hugh 
talk about the Frito
-
Lay volume issue. I think on productivity going forward, 
the next four years, again year
-
by
-
year, it varies. As all of these programs, 
you
 
can measure the efficiency program more directly on productivity and 
the effectiveness you see it more on the top line and you see it in pricing. 
That's how you get the pricing is a function of how we implement all of the 
effectiveness programs.
 

uch harder to isolate the effectiveness part of productivity, but I will 
tell you the way we measure it is in top line growth and the kind of pricing 
we get, so that's where it should manifest itself and now the algorithm is 
talking about mid
-
single
-
digit 

turbulent environment, I think effectiveness oriented productivity program is 

-
single digit growth. Let's talk 
about Frito
-
Lay volumes. Hugh, if you want to take that on
e?
 
Hugh Johnston
 
Yes. Steve, happy to. Absolutely, we did see volumes in Frito
-
Lay a little bit 
stronger than I think what analysts were generally expecting and what they 
were interpreting based off of the scan data. I think the reason for that is 
convenie

-
Lay. We saw volume 
growth in C stores for the quarter of 4.5% and that channel tends to be 

that probably accounts for the data d
ifference.
 
More broadly, I think the important point here is project drive, which has 
obviously suppressed volumes to some degree is going on very successfully. 
As Indra mentioned earlier, from a revenue management perspective, it's 
yielding the results we
 
expected and in addition to that and strategically 
more importantly, the household penetration on Lays is going up and frankly 
that was the goal of project drive and it is working for us quite successfully. 
Obviously, we've got a couple of more quarters o
f overlaps to work through 
in terms of the volume impacts, but we feel very, very good about project 
drive right now.
 
Indra Nooyi
 
So with that, thank you all for your questions. In closing, let me reiterate 
that we are pleased with our year
-
to
-
date results
. We are confident that our 
plans are working and that we will deliver on our financial targets for 2015. I 
want to thank you all for your time and questions this morning and more

2/14/18,Pepsi,"Good morning and welcome to PepsiCo's Second Quarter 2015 Earnings 
Conference Call. Your lines have been placed on listen
-
only until the 
question
-
and
-
answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Today's call is being 
recorded and will be archived at 
www.pepsico.com.
 
It is now my pleasure to introduce Mr. Jamie Caulfield, Senior Vice President 
of Investor Relations. Mr. Caulfield, you may begin.
 
Jamie Caulfield
 
Thank you and good morning. Joining me on the call today are Indra Nooyi, 
PepsiCo's 
Chairman and CEO; and Hugh Johnston, PepsiCo's CFO. We'll lead 
off the call this morning with prepared remarks, and then turn to Q&A.
 
As we begin the call, it's important to note the following. We will make 
forward
-
looking statements on this call. Any forw
ard
-
looking statement 
inherently involves risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results 
to differ materially from current predictions and expectations. Information 
on such risks can be found in today's earnings release and our most recent 
For
m 10
-
K and subsequent SEC filings. In addition, we will discuss results 
using non
-
GAAP measures and you can find the GAAP to non
-
GAAP 
reconciliations on our web site under the Investors section in the Events and 
Presentations tab.
 
Beginning with the third 
quarter of 2015, PepsiCo will realign certain of its 
reportable segments as you saw in this morning's press release. And within 
the next 30 days, PepsiCo expects to provide reclassified summary segment 
reporting for 2013 and 2014 and the first two quarters
 
of 2015 to reflect the 
company's new structure.
 
And now it's my pleasure to introduce Indra Nooyi.
 
Indra Nooyi
 
Thank you, Jamie, and good morning everyone. We are very pleased with 
our performance in the quarter. Organic revenue grew 5.1%, with Global 
Sna
cks up 8% and Global Beverages up 2%. Core gross margin improved 
115 basis points. Core constant currency operating profit grew 8% and core 
constant currency EPS grew 11%.
 
Based on the strength of the quarter, our overall first half results and our 
outlook
 
for the remainder of the year, we are increasing our full year of core 
constant currency 2015 EPS growth outlook to 8%.
 
Our businesses are performing well, both in the top line and bottom line. 
PepsiCo America's beverages had an outstanding quarter. 3% or
ganic 
revenue growth translated to 10% core currency operating profit growth.
 
Frito
-
Lay North America delivered another quarter of very strong results, 
with organic revenue up 3% and core constant currency operating profit up 
7%. And our developing and eme
rging markets delivered 11% organic 
growth in the quarter, revenue growth, despite the ongoing volatility in 
many regions of the world.
 
Looking across some of our key D&E markets, our businesses continue to 
prove resilient. Turkey and Saudi Arabia achieved
 
double digit organic 
revenue growth. China, Egypt and the Philippines achieved high single digit 
organic revenue growth and Mexico achieved mid
-
single digit organic 
revenue growth.
 
Now I assume you have had a chance to read the release this morning. So 
ra
ther than go through the numbers in detail by segment or country, what 
we will do in this call and going forward is to give you an update and provide 
a bit more detail on each of our big initiatives to drive performance, namely 
innovation supported by sens
ible brand management, flawless execution, 
self
-
sustaining productivity, prudent capital allocation, and talent renewal in 
management. But today we will focus primarily on innovation and touch 
briefly on the others. And on future calls, we will highlight o
ne of each of the 
other initiatives.
 
So let me begin with innovation. Our innovation success today is the result 
of significant investments in and changes to our innovation research and 
development capabilities and processes that began about eight years ag
o. At 
that time, we were in an extremely decentralized organization, operating as 
a loose confederation of geographic business units, with each largely driving 
its own development agenda and establishing their own processes. 
Development is focused largely 
on product line extension, and that 
structure, while effective in its time, led to less efficient use of resources 
with redundant projects often being undertaken in different parts of the 
world and suboptimal resource allocation to the most promising ideas
.
 
As a result, much of our innovation lacked staying power. In part, this had to 
do with the quality of our innovation, but it also had to do with our inability 
to appropriately incubate innovation in the marketplace. And to address 
these opportunities, we
 
undertook a major transformation to improve our 
R&D function and innovation capabilities. Specifically, we established global 
category groups charged with coordinating global innovation. This resulted in 
a more focused innovation agenda, a greater emphasi
s on development 
platforms, rather than product line extensions only, and more efficient 
allocation of development resources, as we have significantly reduced 
redundant efforts through better coordination.
 
Two, we globally adopted the proprietary Demand Mo
ments framework, 
originally developed at Frito
-
Lay North America. The framework focuses on 
the triggers of consumption by examining consumer needs based on the 
context of the occasion. This created much stronger linkage between 
consumer and shopper insight
s in the R&D functions, and has led to our 
innovation being more incremental to top line growth.
 
Three, we implemented a common discipline
-
staged gear process to gain 
better visibility into multiyear pipeline of R&D projects, to allocate resources 
to the m
ost promising ideas and new platforms, and to ensure a better 
balance of refresh, reframe and breakthrough innovation.
 
Four, to facilitate more rapid lift and shift of our more successful innovation 
launches from one market to another. We provided our busi
nesses with 
better visibility into new products and their performance around the globe.
 
Five, we increased our investment in R&D starting in 2008. In fact, from 
2011 to 2014 alone, our investment in R&D has increased almost 40%.
 
Next, more recently, we est
ablished a design capability, capped at world 
class design talent. Increasingly, they are involving design in the early 
stages of innovation, taking into account the entire purchase to consumption 
cycle, to create truly memorable experiences for our consum
ers.
 
And lastly, we are using reverse engineering, leveraging our learnings and 
developing in emerging markets, to yield the benefits of thinking more 
holistically about low cost design of new products, packaging and equipment, 
without sacrificing quality.
 
We are pleased with the progress we have made across all these fronts and 
the tangible results we see. Innovation as a percentage of total revenue 
reached 9% in 2014, an improvement of over 150 basis points compared to 
two years ago.
 
Three, PepsiCo produc
ts received the 2015 Nielsen Breakthrough Innovation 
Awards. This award recognizes the most successful and enduring new CPG 
products launched in the U.S. in 2013. PepsiCo was the only company to 
receive multiple awards this year. And over the past three ye
ars, we have 
introduced a number of new products that have achieved or are on pace to 
achieve more than $100 million each in annual retail sales, including Tostitos 
Cantina, Mountain Dew Kickstart, Doritos
-
Cheetos fun multipack mix, and 
Gatorade Fierce Blu
e Cherry and Frost Glacier Cherry.
 
More recently, we are successfully using premium innovation within key 
categories to capture more price realization, to relaunch Caleb's Kola and 
launched DEWshine, a craft premium soda inspired by Mountain Dew's brand 
ro
ots in the backwoods of Tennessee.
 
We are also innovating in packaging, capitalizing on the success of our 
consumer engaging, Lay's Do Us A Flavor campaign. We launched Lay's 
Summer Days campaign, encouraging fans to create custom digital packs of 
Lay's po
tato chips, featuring photos of your favorite summer moments to 
share with friends and family on social media.
 
Adding excitement to this experience, 10,000 lucky fans will receive a real 
life customized bag of Lay's Classic Potato Chips, featuring the phot
o they 
digitally submitted, offering consumers personalized packaging for the first 
time in the brand's history.
 
We are also capitalizing on consumer health and wellness demand. As 
consumers are embracing almond milk and other plant
-
based proteins as an 
al
ternative to traditional dairy milk, Naked Juice has launched two new nut 
milks, Berry Almond Nut Milk and Peachy Almond Nut Milk. And in Quaker 
Foods North America, our new Quick Cook Steel Cut innovation has propelled 
us to the number one market position
 
in the on
-
trend and growing Steel Cut 
Oatmeal segment by making preparation much more convenient.
 
Channel focus innovation is advancing our food service business. We are 
launching a new line of craft soft drinks called Stubborn Soda in fountain this 
summer. The Stubborn lineup includes unique and contemporary takes on 
traditional craft flavors. Flavors include Black Cherry Tarragon, Lemon Berry 
Acai, Agave Vanilla Cream, and Pineapple Cream. They contain no high 
fructose corn syrup and are made with f
air trade certified cane sugar and 
natural flavors. And of course we have continued to refresh and reframe our 
key brands to maintain a high level of consumer engagement and 
excitement.
 
Now innovation has also contributed to good market share performance i
n 
the second quarter in the United States, and I believe our results are 
impressive. We held LRB value share, while delivering strong net price 
realizations. We gained value share across important subcategories, 
including sports drinks and ready
-
to
-
drink t
ea. Gatorade share of sports 
drinks surpassed 80%. Mountain Dew gained 40 basis points of value share 
within the CSD category in Q2. in fact, if you add Kickstart, DEWshine and 
Baja and Sangrita Blast together, it represents more than two points of CSD 
val
ue share in the most recent four week period, placing our recent 
Mountain Dew innovation by itself as a fourth largest flavored CSD behind 
base Mountain Dew, Dr. Pepper and Sprite.
 
In Q2, we grew retail sales in measured channels in the U.S. For regular 
co
las and Mountain Dew within CSD, for Gatorade, Lipton Tea and Naked 
Juice within our non
-
carb portfolio. And at Frito
-
Lay we have a value share in 
savory snacks, and in Quaker Foods, we gained value share in key 
categories, hot and ready
-
to
-
eat cereals, wh
ile expanding gross margin and 
stepping up advertising and marketing at the same time.
 
And our innovation is driving growth for our retail partners as well. In the 
second quarter, PepsiCo was once again the largest contributor to U.S. retail 
sales growth a
mong all food and beverage manufacturers, with over $400 
million of retail sales growth in all major channels. This was more than two 
times the next largest contributor to growth, and represented more growth 
than the next 14 largest manufacturers combined.
 
Notably, North American 
beverages was a key driver of U.S. retail sales growth within PepsiCo, and 
the largest contributor to U.S. retail sales growth on a standalone basis.
 
Our intention is to continue to invest in innovation, build upon our already 
stro
ng capability base and further sharpen our holistic innovation process to 
drive greater growth for our customers, create compelling products for our 
consumers and ultimately, increase the contribution of new products to our 
total revenue. So that's the sto
ry on innovation.
 
Turning now to execution; we have ramped up our execution focus across 
the value chain from seed to shelf. We have established clear consistent 
performance metrics to track and benchmark the effectiveness and efficiency 
of every one of ou
r core value driving activities, from safety to 
manufacturing utilization to transport efficiency to promotional display 
execution.
 
You know, execution is a never ending journey, as there will always be an 
opportunity to raise the game of the below average
 
performance, be it at 
manufacturing lines [ph] or DSD routes. But we are seeing solid execution 
and steady improvement across the enterprise, and this is translating to 
good market based performance and financial results.
 
Turning now to productivity and d
isciplined capital allocation. As you know, 
we have a goal of delivering $5 billion in productivity savings over five years 
from 2015 to 2019, which is approximately $1 billion per year. Our current 
program follows a similarly aggressive three
-
year $3 bill
ion program that we 
successfully concluded in 2014, and overall our productivity initiatives are 
driving meaningful results.
 
Over the three years ending in 2014, despite adverse ForEx, we've realized a 
$1 billion of annual productivity savings, net revenue
 
per employee is up 
10% and EBIT per employee is up 9%. And since 2012, gross margins have 
consistently expanded. Similarly, our capital allocation discipline is yielding 
meaningful results. From year end 2011 to the second quarter of 2015, net 
CapEx as a 
percentage of net revenue has improved from 4.9% to 4.1% on 
a rolling four quarter basis, and this 80 basis point reduction equates to 
approximately $500 million in incremental annual free cash flow. And since 
2012, through the second quarter of 2015, core
 
net ROIC has improved by 
310 basis points to 18.4% on a rolling four quarter basis.
 
And finally, people renewal and development; this is an area that I and the 
board spend a lot of time on. Our focus is twofold here; making sure we 
have the right leaders 
in place today, and that we are developing the next 
two generations of leadership for the company. And as all of you know, good 
talent management does not happen in short burst. It requires taking a long 
term view and very detailed analytical planning.
 
As 
a core of our people renewal and management plan, we have to focus on 
the 200 critical leadership roles in our company. These are the roles that are 
most important to our success, and that provides the greatest experiential 
development for our executives. 
For each of these roles, we have developed 
a pipeline that ensures that we have at least one immediate successive 
candidate; two people in a one to three year timeframe; and then another 
three people ready, four to six years out.
 
As a result of this proces
s, we are deliberately developing top talent, by 
giving them multiple category, geography and job experiences and ensuring 
we have well developed succession plan.
 
The other priority we have is ensuring that we have the right balance of 
home grown talent, t
hat we augment our talent pool from time to time, with 
exceptional executives that we recruit from outside the company, and I 
believe our plans are working. When we have had executive transitions, both 
planned and unplanned, they have been smooth and well 
coordinated. And 
as we look at our current leadership, you will find that executive have had 
very broad critical experiences within PepsiCo over many years across 
functions geographies and categories, people like Tom Greco, Al Carey, 
Sanjeev Chadha, Ramon 
Laguarta and Hugh Johnston. And folks that we 
brought into PepsiCo later in their careers to augment our skill base and 
stretch our thinking. People like Mehmood Khan, Laxman Narsimhan, and 
Tony West.
 
And we are grooming our next generation of leadership, 
by giving them 
critical experiences. People like Mike Spano, who runs our China operations; 
or Eugene Willemsen and Brian Newman, whose promotions we announced 
last night.
 
So to conclude, we are pleased with our financial performance for the first 
half of 
2015, and with the progress we have made across our valued driving 
initiatives. Clearly, there are a number of macro challenges around the 
world, but we believe we have the right strategies and programs in place, to 
enable us to continue to navigate succes
sfully through the current 
environment. The construction of our product and geographic portfolios 
enable us to continue to deliver strong results. In part, because our balanced 
portfolio creates a natural hedge against the global macro and political 
volati
lity that has become the new normal. And all of this bolsters our 
confidence in our ability to continue to achieve our financial target.
 
So with that, let me turn the call over to Hugh.
 
Hugh Johnston
 
Great, thank you, Indra and good morning everyone. Turni
ng directly to 
guidance; as Indra mentioned, based on the strength of our first half results 
and our outlook for the remainder of the year, we have increased our full 
year core constant currency EPS growth target to 8% from 7% previously. 
Our other targets
 
remain unchanged.
 
For the full year 2015, we continue to expect mid
-
single digit organic 
revenue growth, core operating margin expansion as organic top line 
growth, and productivity, should offset negative geographic mix and 
commodity inflation, which inc
orporates the impact of transaction related 
foreign exchange headwinds, and approximately $1 billion of productivity 
settings.
 
Below the division operating line, we continue to expect corporate costs to 
be lower, a core tax rate of approximately 25%, and a
 
reduced share count. 
We expect foreign exchange translation to negatively impact net revenue 
and core earnings per share growth by approximately nine and 11 
percentage points respectively, based on current market consensus rates. 
Our outlook for the year 
assumes translation of our VIM [ph] as well the 
results, at the SICAD rate of 12.8 bolivars per U.S. dollar. Should 
circumstances dictate use of a higher rate, this would also negatively impact 
our U.S. dollar results. Taking our 2014 core EPS of $4.63 and
 
applying our 
guidance in current market consensus of foreign exchange impact, implies 
2015 core EPS of approximately $4.49.
 
As you model up the third quarter, I'd ask you to consider the following; 
foreign exchange translation should have an approximate 1
1 point 
unfavorable impact on the third quarter net revenue growth and 
approximately 12 point unfavorable impact on third quarter core EPS 
growth, based on current market consensus rates. And we expect the profit 
decline in QFNA, as we left last year's gai
n on the sale of the cereal 
business.
 
Below the division Operating Profit line, net interest expense is expected to 
continue to increase in the third quarter versus last year, driven by higher 
interest rates and net debt balances, and our tax rate in the t
hird quarter is 
expected to be higher than the third quarter of 2014.
 
From a cash flow perspective, we continue to expect full year free cash flow 
of more than $7 billion. We expect our capital allocation discipline to 
continue to drive core ROIC improveme
nt. This is building on the steady 
progress we have made in ROIC, with core net ROIC up 310 basis points 
from 2012 to 18.4% through the second quarter of 2015 on a rolling four 
quarter basis. And consistent with prior outlook, we expect to return 
between a
pproximately $8.5 billion and $9 billion to shareholders in 2015, 
through both dividends and share repurchases.
 
As a reminder, our previously announced 7% dividend per share increase, 
commenced with the June payment. Our annualized dividend is now $2.81, 
a
n approximate 60% payout ratio based on 2014 core EPS. This represents 
the 43rd consecutive year of annual dividend increases and our annualized 
dividends per share have grown at 10% compound annual rate over the past 
10 years.
 
So to summarize; our core co
nstant currency earnings per share outlook for 
2015 has improved from our last call, and free cash flow, disciplined capital 
allocation and returning cash to our shareholders remain top priorities for 
the company.
 
With that operator, we will take the first
 
question.
 
Question
-
and

Answer Session
 
Operator
 
[Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of John 
Faucher of JP Morgan.
 
John Faucher
 
Thanks. Good morning.
 
Indra Nooyi
 
Good morning John.
 
John Faucher
 
Good morning Indra. Two quick 
questions here; one, can you just give us a 
little bit of the rationale in terms of the merger at the Latin American Food 
and Beverage businesses? I just sort of 
--
 
the regions 
--
 
need to manage the 
regions? And then secondly, can you talk a little bit abo
ut the Frito volume, 
which was a little bit light relative to trends? Anything in particular going on 
there? Thanks.
 
Indra Nooyi
 
Let me talk a bit about the Latin American merger. We have seen success in 
Europe and AMEA with all of the power of one managem
ent of those regions. 
We are able to get more productivity takeout costs, and especially with 
volatile economies, we have to get more and more agile and more creative 
about how to take out costs. And its not just costs within our system, John; 
I think even
 
with our bottling partners, there is an opportunity to cooperate 
and figure out how not to duplicate efforts between the two companies. And 
we are seeing those initiatives pay off in AMEA and Europe, and we decided 
now is the time to do it in Latin Americ
a.
 
We are in the middle of a major productivity program in Latin American 
Foods, and integrating Latin American beverages with foods, gives us that 
much more of a cost base to work with.
 
Lastly, given the volatility of those economies there, I think it's v
ery 
important to really become a lean mean machine there, in order to take the 
sales and reinvest it to grow the top line. So that's Latin America.
 
Second is on the Frito volume. Again, we watched the Frito performance 
very carefully as does Tom Greco and 
the Frito team. In our potato chip 
business, we were going through a revenue management program, and that 
revenue management program is actually yielding good revenue growth, and 
improving topline growth and profitability for our retailers. And one of the 
results of the revenue management program is that, it is going to impact 
volume, because the price
-
backed [ph] architecture shifts some of the 
volume to certain bag sizes, which impacts volume in the short term. But 

 
for the business. So I'd let it play out 
through the balance of the year, then look at our results in 2016.
 
Operator
 
Our next question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane of Bank of America.
 
Bryan Spillane
 
Hi, good morning everyone.
 
Indra Nooyi
 
Good mor
ning Bryan.
 
Bryan Spillane
 
Just two quick ones; first, in terms of exchange rate, Hugh, you mentioned 
Venezuela; and if you were to move to the SIMADI rate, what would the 
impact for that be on the year, and how will that affect the guidance that 
you have 
given for currencies?
 
Indra Nooyi
 
I mean, Hugh is going to take that.
 
Hugh Johnston
 
Yeah. Happy to do that, Bryan. As you all know, we have provided pretty 
extensive disclosures in our 10
-
Qs and 10
-
K on the question. In the Q that 
we intend to file after t
oday's market close and consistent with past Qs, you 
will see that Venezuela represents approximately 2% of our revenue and 
operating profit. We also have net monetary assets of approximately $335 
million, and non
-
monetary assets of approximately $725 mill
ion.
 
Now, if we were to take all of that and go to SIMADI, Venezuela would then 
represent 0% or very slightly above 0% of our revenue and operating 
profits. So it's roughly a 2% hit on both revenue and operating profit. We 
have a charge of approximately $3
25 million related to the net monetary 
assets. It will also likely lead to an impairment of our non
-
monetary assets.
 
Now the one thing for investors to consider on this is, from an economic 
standpoint, this really would not represent a big impact on PepsiC
o, given 
that Venezuela is largely a self
-
sufficient, self
-
funding operation. We are not 
putting any capital to speak of in the country, and we have not been able to 
redeploy any of our Venezuela cash outside of Venezuela. So from the 
perspective of cash f
low and cash management, it would not have a 
meaningful impact on cash returns.
 
Bryan Spillane
 
So that 2% effect on operating income though would be above and beyond 
the guidance that you have given this morning, in terms of the 11% 
currency hit to EPS for
 
the year, is that right?
 
Hugh Johnston
 
That's correct. Right now, what we are assuming for the balance of year on 
Venezuela is 12.8, because that was the recent SICAD option, which was a 
pretty robust option. But if we did make the move to SIMADI, the 
impact 
would be that much more significant.
 
Bryan Spillane
 
Okay. And then just one other question I guess, thinking about the back half 
of the year. Just seems like, the first half has come in better than expected, 
and with organic sales at mid
-
single digi
ts, it seems like there has just been 
a better operating leverage here, or again, the currency neutral operating 
profit has been better. So in the second half, why 
--
 
just some higher level 
thoughts in terms of why that doesn't continue in the second half?
 
Is there 
something you are seeing on the commodity cost front? Is the flow of 
productivity savings? Just something that sort of raises that flag for the back 
half of the year, that you won't continue to kind of see the current growth? 
Thank you.
 
Hugh John
ston
 
I think there is three things I'd remind you of in that regard, Bryan. Number 
one, the back half lapse, particularly Q4 
--
 
both Q3 and Q4 are more 
challenging than the first half overlap. So we are certainly facing more of an 
uphill for growth in the 
back half of the growth. Number two, you are 
correct, commodities are more of a headwind in the back half of the year 
than they were in the first half of the year. And number three, again recall, 
certainly based on what we are seeing in the news these days
, the world 
remains a very volatile place. We have big businesses in the Middle East; we 
have big businesses in Russia. And as we model things out, we obviously try 
to ensure that we give investors appropriate guidance, at least incorporating 
some of that 
volatility. So we are not assuming the perfect sunny day going 
forward as well.
 
So that's what goes into our thinking, as you look at the so
-
called squeeze 
chart between the first half and the second half of the year.
 
Operator
 
Your next question comes from
 
the line of Bill Schmitz of Deutsche Bank.
 
Bill Schmitz
 
Hi, good morning.
 
Indra Nooyi
 
Good morning.
 
Bill Schmitz
 
Couple of questions. The first one is, is there a price war going on in snacks, 
especially in the U.K.? because I look at some of the market s
hare trends, it 
seems like the categories are in a lot of pressure, and Pringles and Kelloggs 
are getting pretty aggressive. I know it's not a huge business, but I just 
wonder, how far that travels across Europe, and what the competitive 
response has been?
 
And I have a follow
-
up.
 
Indra Nooyi
 
I wouldn't call it a price war. I just think that the retail environment in the 
U.K. remains interesting. There is 
--
 
the high street retailers are going 
through their own set of challenges. You have got the entry of th
e 
discounters. All of that is closing. The entire competitive situation in the U.K. 
to be reset. And being one of the major food and beverage companies in the 
U.K. and the largest salty snack company in the U.K., I think we have to be 
careful how we make o
ur transition with the high street retailers and the 
discounters.
 
And so in the short term, we did lose some share. But we have plans in 
place to recover that share and somehow navigate through these retail 
environment changes. Again Bill, I tell you, arou
nd the world, as we see 
major changes in the retail environment, always in the short term, there will 
be some dislocation, because we have to make changes in the business 
model very
-
very carefully.
 
Operator
 
Your next question comes from the line of Bill Ma
rshall of Barclays.
 
Bill Marshall
 
Hey, good morning.
 
Indra Nooyi
 
Good morning.
 
Bill Marshall
 
I am just curious. So the syndicated data in June across a lot of categories 
looked a little tough. I think most have come to the conclusion that may be 
that was a
 
little bit weather related. I am curious, if you could update us on 
what you are seeing in the market, and then specifically if you had any 
comments, kind of into the July 4th Holiday, how both of your beverage and 
snacks portfolio as we are doing on a vo
lume and price perspective?
 
Indra Nooyi
 
I think from our perspective, our numbers look fine. I mean, we have got 
good price utilization. There were some weather related issues in some parts 
of the country. But I think overall, we are feeling pretty good ab
out our 
results.
 
Hugh Johnston
 
Absolutely Bill. To some degree, I think there is some bifurcation between 
what's happening in the center of the store, and what's happening on the 
perimeter. But from the perspective of the categories we 
participate in, with 
the exception of center of the store, where we saw Quaker category slow 
down a little bit; most of our categories are robust and saw pretty good 
growth across the quarter.
 
Operator
 
Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Grundy
 
of Jefferies.
 
Kevin Grundy
 
Hey, good morning.
 
Indra Nooyi
 
Good morning Kevin.
 
Kevin Grundy
 
So two quick ones for you. First with respect to North American carbonated 
soft drinks and broadly in the industry. And given the recent pricing 
discipline which ha
s taken hold, my question is, given this dynamic, how 
materially does this change your view, with respect to North American 
carbonated soft drink profit pool, and do you see mid
-
single digit growth 
now, as sort of more sustainable here looking out, not jus
t this year, but 
longer term? And then as sort of a follow
-
up speaking with North American 
beverages, can you give us an update Indra, on Diet Pepsi and the change 
to the formulation there your competitors are not following? And how you're 
thinking about t
hat, how you're defining success there with that product? 
Thank you.
 
Indra Nooyi
 
In terms of the North American CSD pricing 
--
 
look, we have been talking 
about disciplined pricing for a long time; I'd say couple of years. I am glad 
that there is discipline
d pricing in the marketplace right now. And there is lot 
more innovations in the market basically from our end. And look, we are 
going to keep playing our game; we are going to focus on disciplined pricing, 
good revenue management, put CSD innovation out i
n the marketplace. And 
ultimately, it depends on the competitive situation, what the profit pool is in 
this whole CSD business, or the North American beverage business in 
totality. But we believe this is the right way to participate and play in this 
very
-
v
ery important and large segment.
 
In terms of Diet Pepsi; big business. And I think for some reason which we 
cannot really explain, as with the Enchilada [ph] flavor with some 
consumers. And from our perspective, we just want to make sure we have 
an offerin
g for all of the consumers who want to switch out of aspartame. 
And we have formulated a very
-
very good product, which is aspartame free, 
and will be available in the market starting in late August. So for all of those 
consumers who are looking for an alte
rnative, to an aspartame sweetened 
diet product, we will have a product. And for those consumers, who still love 
Diet Pepsi with aspartame, we will figure out how to make it available online. 
So I think, this is a consumer driven strategy to offer all of t
he Diet lovers, a 
diet cola that's aspartame free.
 
Operator
 
Your next question comes from the line of Rob Ottenstein of Evercore.
 
Rob Ottenstein
 
Great. Thank you very much.
 
Indra Nooyi
 
Good morning.
 
Rob Ottenstein
 
Very impressive introductions on the innov
ation front and progress there. So 
wondering if you could give us a little bit more granularity on the impact to 
the topline, both in terms of volume and price mix that you're getting from 
innovation?
 
Indra Nooyi
 
I'd say that, innovation has allowed us to 
get lot more price mix 
--
 
pricing 
realization in particular. Something that's very
-
very important in today's 
environment. And its 
--
 
product packaging process innovation, but we are 
also spending a lot of time on revenue management. I mean, really thinking
 
through portion sizes, pack sizes, and I think this combination of interesting 
products coming to the marketplace and interesting packages in interesting 
combinations of packages, it's what's resulting in incrementality on the 
revenue side and actually re
sulting in higher profit flowthrough. And we are 
seeing it across carbonated soft drinks, I mean, whether its DEWshine or 
Baja Blast or any of those products, and we are seeing it even in Europe and 
Russia and Latin America and AMEA, where I'd say, creativ
e revenue 
management tactics, coupled with innovation that cuts through the clutter is 
resulting in flow
-
through to the bottom line.
 
Again, I think in these environments, the focus should be on revenue and 
profit, not necessarily on volume growth. We focus
 
more on unit growth, 
revenue and profit in these environments, because a change for volume, 
results in the whole business hurting. So I think the revenue management 
unit growth, value growth, and profit is what we focus on, and that's what 
our innovation 
efforts are yielding today, the almost 10%, I think the high 
9s are innovation performances. Something that is a significant step
-
up, and 
we keep watching that metric very
-
very carefully.

Your next question comes from the line of Caroline Levy of 
CLSA.
 
Caroline Levy
 
Good morning. Thank you.
 
Indra Nooyi
 
Good morning Caroline.
 
Caroline Levy
 
Good morning Indra. Question on the 
--
 
it is actually talk of Russia putting 
an advertising ban I guess on sugar drinks and fatty foods and things like 
that. 
And in the context of that, I am just wondering, if you see increased 
regulatory risk to your food or beverage business around the globe, and 
what you think the impact might be, for example, in Russia, and how you 
would handle that?
 
Indra Nooyi
 
Caroline, w
e were among the first people to recognize this risk, and we have 
been retooling our portfolio, to make sure that, first of all we have a diverse 
portfolio that can weather any sort of action on any part of our portfolio. But 
we are also in constructive co
nversations with governments, to make sure 
there aren't any discriminatory taxes or discriminatory action on any of our 
categories.
 
Having said that, on Russia in particular, it is perhaps the most diverse 
portfolio of any part of our company between berry
 
and juices and ranks 
ranging from fun
-
for
-
you to good
-
for
-
you, and beverages. This is actually a 
small portion of our business in Russia. And so if you want to use an 
example of the most diverse portfolio of doing fun
-
for
-
you, better
-
for
-
you 
and good
-
for
-
you is skewing towards good
-
for
-
you, I think it's our Russia 
portfolio.
 
So we feel good about Russia so far, and we all wish there weren't any 
geopolitical issues to deal with from a Russian perspective, but our business 
is doing well, and the economy has 
been good to us, and the Russian 
business environment has been good for us. So we like it.

Your next question comes from the line of Mark Swartzberg of Stifel.
 
Mark Swartzberg
 
Morning Indra, Morning Hugh. I was wondering if we could talk a little 
bit 
more about procurement specifically in that larger $5 billion productivity 
aim. Can you give us a bit of an update on 
--
 
to what extent that number is 
included in the $5 billion and how you're leveraging your global scale. And 
whether if at all, these 
changes in the reporting structure, particularly Latin 
America, have any influence on how you go after procurement savings of the 
global entity?
 
Indra Nooyi
 
Hugh, go ahead.
 
Hugh Johnston
 
Yeah, I am happy to take that one Mark. The entity question is actual
ly quite 
straightforward. We don't include procurement savings as a part of 
productivity. Productivity is focused on the operating cost structure, not on 
the commodity and procurement cost structure. The way we report 
procurement savings is, we share with 
you all a net commodity inflation 
number, so that includes gross commodity inflation, less whatever we can do 
in terms of managing, what we call value engineering, so managing our 
commodities to a lower cost through more efficient packaging, trading 
differ
ent types of juices, and things like that. So the $5 billion number does 
not include any savings from procurement at all. That's all captured in net 
commodity inflation.
 
Operator
 
Your next question comes from the line of Steve Powers of UBS.
 
Steve Powers
 
Y
es hi, good morning. I was actually hoping you could just talk us through 
personnel and segmentation decisions that you announced alongside today's 
results. Obviously, congrats to you Hugh, but could you maybe also provide 
a little more color on the other 
people movements that were highlighted, 
and then also a bit broader window into your thinking on the 
resegmentation? I think it makes sense to bring Latin America in line with 
Europe and Asia, as you have mentioned, an increased visibility into North 
Ameri
can beverages is welcome, at least from my perspective. But I love 
your broader perspective on it as well. Thanks.
 
Indra Nooyi
 
Steve, I will tell you, one of the things we did some time ago, is really sit 
back from the world and say, how should we think ab
out groups of countries 
and clusters of operations that make sense? And based on all the work we 
did, basically the world broke out into eight clusters
\
; North America is 
cluster one, Western Europe is the next developed market with cluster two; 
three was 
Latin America; four was Russia and East Europe; five is Middle 
East and North Africa; cluster six was the Indian subcontinent; seven was 
China and the whole Pacific Rim; and cluster 8 was Sub
-
Sahara Africa. So 
those were the eight clusters.
 
And North Ameri
ca is so big, that grouping it together and not providing 
visibility into the pieces didn't make sense. So we have kept North America 
separate in terms of North American beverages and Frito
-
Lay and Quaker 
being so different. But all other clusters, we just
 
cleaned it up. Cluster three 
is Latin America, we put it together, and Sub
-
Sahara Africa, we had the 
snacks business of South Africa and Simba reporting into Europe, and 
beverages reporting to our Asia and Middle East sector, we just cleaned it 
up.
 
So the
 
segment changes that we reported, were a clean
-
up of these 
clusters, so that we can think of cluster strategies. So that's the first one, 
and more and more strategic thinking and designs of the future are based on 
how do we establish and grow our position
s in each of these clusters. And 
more importantly, how do we get more productive working across our 
partners within each of the clusters. That's what we have been focused on. 
So the last two got cleaned up.
 
In terms of personnel changes, as I talked to you
 
earlier in my strips, talent 
management is something that the board and I are focused on a lot. I mean, 
our phenomenal board, spends a lot of time thinking through succession for 
the top couple of hundred jobs. And one of the things we always looked at 
is
, where is that bright talent across the company that should be lifted up, so 
that they can be part of a succession process in the company. And every 
time we get an opportunity, we figure out ways to lift them up, in order to 
stretch people, in order to re
ally build exciting talent for the future, and 
that's what the most recent changes enabled us to do.
 
And just to give you an idea, let me start with Brian Newman, and I have 
worked with Brian now for 20 years, off and on. Brian started in corporate 
strateg
y, but then went to China, he went to Russia, he went to Spain, 
worked in European headquarters. Went to Canada, was the Treasurer of the 
Pepsi Bottling Group, and both Hugh and I have been mentoring him now for 
20 years, Hugh? And now giving him this job 
with operations coupled with 
corporate strategy, allows him to get a whole perspective of the company 
across snacks and beverages, even though he has worked in it for a while. 
And here is a person that speaks Mandarin Chinese, speaks multiple other 
languag
es, and just a very great executive to lift up. And we are looking for 
opportunities to do that, and with the departure of Anderson, gave us that 
opportunity.
 
And Eugene likewise, he has been running the key partnership, but again a 
Dutch national who has 
worked in multiple countries, and truly global 
executive. Travels, 60%, 70% of his time in every part of the world. I 
remember, when he was running Turkey, he started to learn Turkish. 
Everywhere he goes, he becomes a national. And again a very exciting 
ex
ecutive; and you will all get a chance to see these people in action, as we 
move along. And all of the people we are elevating, whether it's Laxman who 
is now going to be running Latin America. Ramon has got additional 
responsibilities in Europe. Sanjeev w
as running a gigantic geography. You 
will see all of them over the next few quarters. And of course you all know Al 
Carey and Tom Greco and Hugh very
-
very well.
 
So I think that you will find that, what PepsiCo is doing is, just reinforcing 
the fact that th
ey are a talent academy. And any company that's looking for 
talent always relates PepsiCo. So we have to constantly make sure that our 
best and brightest move up, and we keep them engaged and excited about 
the company. And that's my job, and the job of the
 
board, and that's what 
we are doing.

Good morning Judy.
 
Judy Hong
 
So I had two questions. One, Indra, its just really more of a 
longer term kind 
of strategy questions as you think about your global snack business. You 
obviously have a very good business there, but in a world where skill is 
becoming increasingly important and you have got other macro
-
snacking 
categories that perhaps
 
you may not be participating as actively, how do you 
think about accelerating really top line, as well as the profit growth, as you 
think about the global snack platform? It's really looking at integrated 
beverage and snack nationally is the answer, or ca
n you really do something 
more with the platform?
 
And then second question is, just really talking about your global e
-
commerce effort. It's not an easy opportunity for CPG companies, so can you 
just give us some perspectives on what efforts you have made 
already, and 
what are some of the opportunities as you think about over the next few 
years?

Sure Judy. Interesting question, because I think in global snacks, we are in 
an interesting position; because our base is savory snacks, and we are a 
ve
ry
-
very strong player in savory snacks.
 
First of all globally, we still have a lot of growth within savory snacks. We 
came from a salty crisp snack background, and we are expanding more and 
more into other savory snacks, be it crackers, be it nuts and seed
s, we are 
expanding into those areas, there is lot of opportunity there. I see growth in 
global snacks along two dimensions. Dimension one is, a compliment to our 
snack, and that's what made us go into dips, because many of our snacks 
are consumed by thems
elves. Other times, your snacks serve as sort of a 
substrate upon which you can put on meal like products like our Sabra 
hummus or our Tostitos dips. So that's one vector to grow, and we still 
haven't scratched the surface, and we have got lots of growth.
 
The other area is taking away eating occasions from other macro
-
snacks 
category. Its interesting, unlike beverages, in the case of snacks, we can go 
off and take eating occasions from other macro
-
snacks, be it cookies, or 
confectionery or chocolate. And ou
r goal is to focus on what we are doing, 
but looking at our signs of demand spaces, which I talked about briefly, look 
at each eating occasion by cohort group, and figure out, how we can 
leverage our salty snack platform, to go after other macro snacks, be
 
it 
--
 
replace it with a salty occasion, or do some sort of a salty
-
sweet 
combination, for example Stacy's with cinnamon sugar. It's based on a pita 
chip, but it's certainly sweet when you taste it, and has a much better mouth 
feel and experience, than if 
you eat something totally sweet by itself. At 
least, that's my perspective.
 
So I think that, our growth is all about growing the core and then leveraging 
all of the other eating occasions, taking share away from other macro 
snacks, and other savory snacks.
 
In addition, I think it's leveraging the beverage occasion to really figure out 
how to go into all retail outlets that beverages are in already; because 
beverages retail outlet, our penetration is much higher than snacks. And so 
if you leverage that retai
l base, it gives you lot more opportunities for 
growth.
 
And internationally, we are leveraging in
-
store promotional displays a lot 
more. I mean, I was in the Middle East a few months ago, and I was just 
amazed to see the in
-
store display of Lay's and Pepsi
; and again, with the 
shares of Pepsi that we have there, it is really a powerful in
-
store promotion 
that results in tremendous lifts. So the opportunities for growth, by itself and 
in combination with beverages, are pretty significant.
 
So with that, let m
e turn to Hugh to talk about global e
-
commerce, because 
he is the leader of the global e
-
commerce activity. Hugh?
 
Hugh Johnston
 
Okay. Thank you, Indra. I mean, global e
-
commerce to talk about in two 
minutes, is a bit of a challenge to say the least. I gues
s, I'd make just a 
couple of quick comments to start the dialog on that.
 
Number one, global e
-
commerce can mean so many things, anywhere from 
just changing the way the product is ordered and picked, the so
-
called click
-
and
-
collect model, where people order
 
online and then go pick up products 
at their local retail outlet, all the way through to in China, where the product 
is delivered significantly to door and in more and more proportions of the 
overall spend. Clearly, one of the leading areas, to the U.K., 
where you see 
retailers also doing a lot more delivery to the store, all the way through to 
new emerging players like the Blue Aprons of the world, who are actually 
sort of designing meal solutions, in effect filling demand moments for 
consumers by giving 
them an entire pre
-
packaged meal, which you see in 
some urban markets in the U.S. and starting to expand outside the U.S. as 
well.
 
From the perspective of PepsiCo, we are looking at it two ways. Number one 
is, the existing products going through the existi
ng channels, either current 
retailers or the traditional online retailers. And then second really, looking 
hard at demand moments and designing products that fit the e
-
commerce 
types of distribution channels and e
-
commerce types of consumers in a more 
tail
ored way. So that's sort of a very brief view towards what's happening in 
the e
-
commerce world. The biggest opportunity obviously is to be able to 
have more of a one
-
on
-
one relationship with those consumers than we have 
ever had in the past, through tradit
ional linear TV advertising.
 
I expect you will see a lot more from us in this regard, but that's probably 
the best two minutes that I can give in terms of what it is that we are doing 
right now.

Your next question comes from the line of Ali Dibadj
 
of Bernstein.
 
Ali Dibadj
 
Hey guys.
 
Indra Nooyi
 
Hey Ali.
 
Ali Dibadj
 
Hi. Wanted a thought on volume versus price question that we heard about 
FLNA about, but wanted to hear more about Europe, and what really was 
driving that and if we are seeing any end 
in sight in terms of slower volumes 
there is the first question, in Europe specifically? And then the second one is, 
if you could help us, I guess, give some quantification for the buckets where 
the remaining cost cutting will be coming from? What the buck
ets are, how 
much? And if we were to talk to your employees at this point, would we hear 
any concerns that you are cutting too deeply into the organization from a 
cost perspective?
 
Indra Nooyi
 
Let me take the first one Ali. The thing I'd tell you is, Europ
e is a difficult 
economy, between east and the west, there is some sort of volatility there 
all the time. I think today, year
-
to
-
date, we are the best performing 
European CPG company, based on all the numbers we have looked at. If you 
combine east and west
, or whether you look at them individually, both on 
the top line and the profit performance, we are performing the best.
 
The challenge in Europe is, especially with Russia there, the high street 
battle in U.K. going on, I think it's very important, we play
 
a very judicious 
game between revenue and profits. And we have been playing that game 
very
-
very carefully, and if you look at our year
-
to
-
date numbers, I won't 
look at it on a quarterly basis, I'd look at it on a year
-
to
-
date basis. I think 
on a year
-
to
-
d
ate basis, we are performing at or above our expectations in 
Europe, and we feel comfortable with what the team is doing, and that's 
what we intend to keep doing for the balance of the year.
 
And in terms of cost cutting opportunity, Hugh well you can talk 
about what 
other opportunities exist, but in terms of employees, look nobody likes cost 
cutting, everybody likes growth. I think we are one of those companies that 
are doing a wonderful balance of growing the top line and delivering 
productivity, and that'
s what we want to focus on. Swinging the pendulum 
too much to cost cutting, I don't think is a good idea at all, because it just 
jeopardizes the future of the company. So we look at opportunities to shrink 
the cost base and get more lean and mean, but with
out sacrificing our ability 
to innovate and grow; and that's really all I have to [indiscernible]. Do you 
want to add anything Hugh?
 
Hugh Johnston
 
No. I think you captured it well. The areas for cost cutting I think remain 
inside the manufacturing faciliti
es, we are using automation where it makes 
more sense. Inside of the selling system, we are using technology to make 
our [indiscernible] system more productive, and inside of the G&A buckets, 
we are doing more combinations of shared services to create more
 
efficiency 
in the way we delivered shared services to the organization. And Indra, to 
reiterate what you said, which is finding the right balance of driving 
productivity, reinvesting some in growth, and delivering some to the bottom 
line, is yielding resu
lts at brand building and innovation and taking some of 
that growth. Investing it back and driving more productivity and delivering 
some of that to the bottom line, is working well. I think we are in the sweet 
spot right now in terms of being able to deliv
er performance and it is a 
careful balance to manage.
 
Operator
 
We have time for one more question. Your final question comes from the line 
of Nik Modi of RBC Capital Markets.
 
Nik Modi
 
Yes, good morning everyone and congrats Hugh. I guess the question is on
 
cost savings, so clearly you have this $1 billion three year program over the 
next few years. But every meeting I go in with an investor or an industry 
conference, the word zero based budgeting comes up or the terms of a zero
-
based budgeting comes up. So 
I just wanted to get your perspective on that 
particular cost saving initiatives and if you're thinking about zero base 
budgeting at all within the business, in addition to the $1 billion program?
 
Indra Nooyi
 
We look at every opportunity to tighten our bel
ts and become more efficient. 
As I said earlier, and as Hugh reiterated Nick, we are balancing top line and 
bottom line growth very
-
very judiciously. When you embark on a zero base 
budgeting program that costs to the bone, and jeopardizes your ability to 
g
row the top line. I think that's a formula for disaster.
 
We believe into the smart spending initiatives where we look across all of 
our cost structure, and see where we can selectively reduce costs, 
intelligently, not for the short term, but find a way to 
make sure it does not 
affect top line growth initiatives. So rest assured, that we look at every 
possible way to make our company more efficient, and I think we are 
--
 
as 
Hugh said, in the sweet spot of balancing investments against top line 
growth, and fi
guring out ways through automation, shared services, taking 
out work that's not needed, simplifying our processes, coordinating across 
the company, reducing our cost. And that's what we are focused on.
 
And with that, let me reiterate that we are pleased wi
th our results for the 
first half. We are confident that our plans are working and believe we are on 
the track to deliver our financial targets for 2015. I want to thank you all for 
your time and questions this morning, and more importantly for the 
confide
nce you have placed in us. Have a wonderful day.

Thank you, Jamie

highlight before I move on to a brief recap of the operating sectors results. 

revenue grew 4.5% overall with each of our six opera
ting sectors 
contributing to the growth.
 
I believe the solid growth we had in the second quarter is a good indication 
of the strength of both our product and geographic portfolios and it also 
gives us the confidence that the plans we shared with you at the
 
beginning 
of the year are being very well executed.
 
Second, we continue to make progress on our productivity agenda and 
remain on track to achieve a full
-
year productivity target savings. Third,

half of 56 basis points as a percent of net revenue.

plans to support our 

global systems harmonization and standardization and we took steps to 
transform our culture to become more effective by being more consumer

ming our full year 
guidance.
 
So let me move onto the sectors results, starting with Frito
-
Lay North 
America. FLNA continued to post strong growth in the second quarter with 
organic revenue up 5% and solid market performance. We delivered good 
net revenue g

and Ruffles.
 
In addition, we posted good growth across all channels in the U.S. led by 
high
-
single digit growth in convenience and dollar stores. We continued to 
invest across the business with 
the aim to drive sustainable, better
-
than
-
industry growth and this includes investing in plant and warehouse capacity, 
routes, sales technology, enhanced consumer and shopper data and insights 
and brand media.

that FLNA was once again the largest contributor to total food and beverage 
U.S. retail sales growth in the quarter.
 
PepsiCo Beverages North America deli
vered 2% organic net revenue growth 
with solid benefit from net price realization. Trademark Pepsi and trademark 
Mountain Dew showed sequential volume improvement and our ready
-
to
-
drink coffee and water volumes grew in the high and mid
-
single digits, 
respe
ctively. A&M spending was up strong double digits for the quarter.
 
Beyond brand investment were also directed investment on innovation to 
address new category entrants and to drive success in higher growth 
category segments and this is evident with innovat
ions like Mountain Dew 
Game Fuel, Gatorade Zero and Gatorade Bolt24, LIFEWTR, Bubly, new 
variants of Propel and extensions within our successful Starbucks and Pure 
Leaf Tea lineups.
 

and
 

a return to sustained competitive performance.

3% driven by net price realization and modest volume gains.
 

returned to volume growth in Aunt Jemima and ready

which delivered mid
-
single digit volume growth.
 
Now moving on to international, despite ongoing macroeconomic volatility in 
a number of key markets and poor weather in parts of Western Europe, each 
of our international divisions delivered solid organic revenue growth in the 
second quarter.
 
Notably, deve
loping and emerging market organic revenue increased 8%, 
driven by particularly good growth in a number of our key markets. Mexico 
and Russia were up high
-
single digits, Brazil was up more than 20% in part 

sport strike, China grew 
strong double digits and India increased mid
-
single digits.
 
These results are a reflection of the benefits of the increased investments 

execution, driving a lot
 
of relevance and lot of affordability, expanding our 
global brand portfolio, leveraging our global capabilities to drive higher per 
capita consumption and market share gains.
 
And with this, let me hand it off to Hugh.
 
Hugh Johnston
 
Thank you, Ramon. Good 
morning, everyone. I have just a few comments 

each of the components of our 2019 guidance, namely we continue to expect 
organic revenue growth of 4%, a core effective tax rate of ap
proximately 
21%, core constant currency EPS to decline approximately 1%, free cash 
flow of approximately $5 billion and total cash returns to shareholders of 
approximately $8 billion comprised of dividends of approximately $5 billion 
and share repurchases 
of approximately $3 billion.
 
As you model out the balance of the year, I call your attention to the fact 
that the organic revenue growth comparisons get meaningfully more 
challenging in the second half. And from an EPS perspective, you should 
consider the 
following. First, over the balance of the year we will be lapping 
gains from various strategic asset sales and refranchising gains and 
insurance recoveries. And second, our pace of planned reinvestments in the 
business will accelerate over the balance of t
he year and you will see this 
reflected both in core EPS as well as in our operating margin performance.
 

question.
 
Question

and

Answer Session
 
Operator
 
Thank you. [Operator 
Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line 
of Bryan Spillane of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
 
Bryan Spillane
 
Hi. Good morning, everyone.
 
Ramon Laguarta
 
Good morning.
 
Bryan Spillane
 

ar of this 
stepped up investment and I think if we look at the organic sales, the 

price heavy and less volume. So I guess two questions around that. One, do 
you think that the 

 
is the investment allowing for maybe more pricing and 
mix than maybe what existed previously? And second, would you expect 

of these marketing initiatives get into the market for th
e balance of the 
year?
 
Ramon Laguarta
 

very rational pricing in our categories, both in snacks and beverages. Last 

been 

trying to do is trying to understand much better the consumer, trying to 
understand the different occasions the consumer is going into our categories 
and maximize obviously t
he opportunities for revenue in each one of those 



hat you 
should be seeing in the future as well. The most important thing from the 


improving distribution, conn
ecting better with consumers versus just using 

pretty powerful, good situation for our categories I would say.
 
Operator
 
Your next question comes from the line of Dara Mohsenian
 
of Morgan 
Stanley.
 
Dara Mohsenian
 
Hi. Good morning, guys.
 
Ramon Laguarta
 
Good morning.
 
Dara Mohsenian
 

Frito
-
Lay North America, the balance has tilted much more towards pricing 
rece
ntly with the strong organic sales growth over the last few quarters. So 
can you give us a little more granularity on what specifically has been 
driving that and should we expect more of a balance going forward between 
pricing and volume? And then also on 
the beverage side, obviously very 
strong pricing in the last few quarters, post the fall increase. You just 
commented that the competitive environment is pretty rational, but just any 
thoughts on pricing potential in NAB when you cycle those increases in t
he 
fall would be helpful?
 
Ramon Laguarta
 

in the industry is a trend towards smaller packs. So consumers are somehow 

 
either the size of the household or the particular occasions wher

consuming our products, consumers are moving to smaller packs. And if you 
recall when we talk about some of our investments in the past call, we said 

consumer is moving to small
er packs and some of our capacities under 

 


is better, price per liter is better. The second trend i
s consumers are looking 

benefits in the consumption of our categories, be it snacks or beverages and 
that tends to be also higher price per liter, price per kilo. So I think you will 
c
ontinue to see those trends going forward in our categories, especially in 
more developed markets. In developing markets, a bit of a different game 
where you have to be very mindful of the price points and the affordability 
lenses. So if you cross certain 
price points, clearly your product will become 
out of reach for a lot of consumers. But in developed markets we see smaller 
packs and more functional benefits driving what I would say positive pricing 
environment. Then also we see more consumption in conve
nience channels, 
channels where consumers are willing to be a bit less price sensitive and 
they pay more for every transaction. So those are trends that you could see 

--
 
Hugh Johnston
 
Yes, I t

small pieces I would add to it. Number one, Dara, in particular with Frito
-
Lay 

only pick it up in equity income, tha
t was about a 1 point drag on Frito
-

volume. So if you take that out, then Frito
-

little bit closer obviously. And then number two is, as Ramon said, I think in 
developed markets we probably can expect a couple points of
 
visual and 
then a couple points of consumer
-
driven mix that will enable us to get 
pricing in the future. So that I think is a reasonable expectation going 
forward.
 
Operator
 
Your next question comes from the line of Ali Dibadj of Bernstein.
 
Ali Dibadj
 
Hi, 

making now over the past six months and where you expect that to appear 
in the top line? Is it rate? Is it mix? Is it volume? Ramon, I appreciate your 
commentary in the first question abou
t price rationality in the marketplace 
certainly, but the incrementality of the investment I would have imagined 

seeing it yet. So just trying to understand how you think about the 
in



talking about PBNA?
 
Ramon Laguarta
 



company going for
ward. I think we have accelerated clearly from the 2%, 
3% to sustain 4% to 5% growth. Our ambition is to stay within those 
parameters, as we said, in the 4% to 6% top line growth and that will 
require multiple layers of investment across multiple parts of 
the business. 

could call more short
-

routes in the market, some more selling capacity or improving some of our 
warehouse and bottlen
ecks that we had in some of our businesses because 

because really the demand is quite high for some of our technology. So that 
you will see reflected 

 

 
seen Frito
-
Lay, 4.5% 
growth or acceleration in all of the water brands in PBNA or some of the 
coffees or whatever, it is being reflected. But the big idea I think for us and 

compan
y is how do we keep investing in capabilities that will give us that 
4.5% or 5% or 4%, like between the 4% and 6% going forward on a 
sustained basis and not only the U.S. but really across the company. And 
those have to do with new capabilities in insights
 
and how do we digitalize 
the company and how do we what we call precision at scale and how do we 
execute our portfolios in every store with the right level of insights and 
precision. And we have closed loops on execution so that our people can 
execute con
sistently at those high levels. How do we continue to innovate in 
new platforms and have the right amount of resources to invest in new 
platforms versus taking money from the core and giving to those new 

 



markets to be in the future. So I think we feel pretty good. And then the 
investment 
will come in all the different areas that I told you. But with this 
idea of sustained high performance at top line, that will be the big driver of 
value for you guys as shareholders of the company.
 
Operator
 
Your next question comes from the line of Judy Ho
ng of Goldman Sachs.
 
Judy Hong
 
Thank you. Good morning. So, Ramon, I think you cited improvement in 
NAB particularly around the Pepsi trademark and Mountain Dew, but I guess 

perspective i

Gatorade standpoint? Obviously, you have innovation around the trademark 
with the Bolt24, so how does that kind of fit into the strategy and when you 
think that we should see some more tangible im
provement on that brand? 
Thank you.
 
Ramon Laguarta
 
Good morning. Listen, Gatorade is clearly a big brand for us and one that is 
very solid with the consumer. All the metrics on the brand are fantastic in 
terms of consumer engagement and consumer brand equi
ty in all 

umbrella. The big innovation we 

 
you mentioned Bolt but the big innovation 

consumer base of the brand t
o some consumers that actually were athletes 
but they put a lot of I guess emphasis on sugar and therefore the less of 
some of the occasions that they were consuming the brand to move into 

e 



already the number one Zero sports drin
k in the country by quite a distance 
I would say and we see every week the velocity of the brand improving. So I 
think that this is a brand that will be very big for us. Now Propel is another 
big opportunity for us in sports drink and sports hydration and 
we see Propel 




w adding vitamins and some other positive functionality. 

functional platform trying to cater into the athlete off the field. I think the 
consumption is going to be off the field. We

athlete during the day with functional benefits that are all natural. Now 


and 
whatever. And you will see more innovation coming under that platform that 

about the image, the functionality, the brand that we can create around Bolt 

one more example of how Gatorade understands 
consumers and continues to innovate again all the needs of consumers in 

development that we have in this segment and how we will be ab
le to grow 
the category which is at the end our biggest responsibility as leader of the 
category.
 
Operator
 
Your next question comes from Lauren Lieberman of Barclays.
 
Lauren Lieberman
 
Great. Thanks. Good morning. I was hoping we could talk a little bit abo
ut 

challenger stronghold battleground framework for thinking about markets. I 
would just hoping you could maybe shed a little bit more light on kind of the 
investment priorities, 
whether you want to talk about by geography, by 
category? And do you think kind of the game changer for you in accelerating 
performance or market share performance is about 

 
is it more about 
innovation or is it more about capabilities and execution? Thank
s.
 
Ramon Laguarta
 
Okay. Listen, we see international as a huge growth opportunity for this 

the U.S. growth for the last few years, I think that should continue in the 
future when you 
see the per caps of both our snacks and our beverage 
categories around the world and the U.S. We see a lot of opportunities in 

seeing that our snacks business benefits a lot by urbanization
 
and as we see 

opportunity. We have a very good label on how we develop per caps of our 
snacks business. I think we keep qualifying that better and better and we 
have a very, I think quite 

that in many markets around the world. So you should see us continue to 
invest in our snacks business internationally and that should be a big engine 
of growth for us. When you go to the beverage category, the
 
same principles 
in terms of how big is the growth opportunity as consumers are moving from 
I would say non
-
commercial liquids to more commercial liquids everywhere 
in the world. And there the new ones in our strategy is obviously we have 
another competito
r that is trying to develop the category with us. And then 
we have to be smart where we have a [indiscernible] I would say a higher 
growth share 

 
higher share position versus a medium share position versus 
a low share position and our studies need to chan


around the world, but the tools we use and the number of complexities we 
chose to add to the business will be different depending on the market 
position we pl

beverage and the snacks business. You should see international as a huge 
growth opportunity for us globally for many, many years to come and I think 

ositing every quarter 
and they show both the top line and the bottom line opportunity that that 
has for PepsiCo going forward.
 
Operator
 
Your next question comes from the line of Steve Powers of Deutsche Bank.
 
Steve Powers
 
Great. Thanks. So maybe to build o
n some of what you said I think in 

confidence in being able to resume your long
-
term algorithm come 2020 
that 4% to 6% top line, 20 to 30 basis points margin improvement formula, 
beca
use despite the first half investments your guidance as Hugh highlighted 
in his remarks seems to allow for some deceleration in the back half on the 

are in your ability to maintain 
first half top line momentum not only in the 
back half but out to 2020 and beyond? And then secondly to the extent you 
are able to sustain or accelerate the top line from here, do you see all 
businesses now being in a position to contribute to necessary ma
rgin 
improvement come 2020 or will certain businesses require another year of 
more investment beyond 2019? Thanks.
 
Ramon Laguarta
 
Listen, I think obviously we stayed true to the long
-
term guidance that we 
gave a few months ago, right, like five or six mont
hs ago. We thought very 
carefully about that framework for growth and we obviously are seeing that. 


 
categories of 
portfolio of geographies that allow us to deliver that on a sustained basis 
assum
ing that we make the right choices around productivity and 
investments and we make the right choices on where we put this money for 

innovate and we stay true to that long
-
term framewor
k. Remember when we 
talked about the investment year for 2019, we said 

 
first, we did a few 
things, right, in the process. First, we looked at existing budgets and we 
tried to reallocate those budgets into the areas that would give us a better 
return, so 

down on our productivity and that productivity will be reinvested for growth 


 
we probably need a year of additional 
reinvestments that would put a solid foundation for the years to come

company going forward. I think we can fund most of them with our

Thanks. Good morning. I have a follow up and then a margin que

can you comment on the state of the consumer in the U.S., as alluded 
before, the results this morning have been supportive but this kind of data 
has been softer as of late. Is this just the timing or weather related or are 
you guys seeing the con
sumer a bit more cautious? And on the gross 
margin, Hugh, you had called out the timing of commodity pressures in the 
first quarter earnings and into the second quarter, but the gross margins too 
expanded well. So have we cycled most of the pressures? Than

that tells us that consumer is slowing down,

which are low priced, quite routine categories that are very well penetrated, 
very high penetrated across all the U.S.

Ramon, I had a question on a couple of brands in North America beverages. 
So Mountain Dew which has clearly been an area of focus but the brand 
continues to lose some share based on 
what we see in the syndicated data. 
Can you give us an update there on your strategy to stabilize the share 
trends? And then maybe you can just briefly touch on Bubly which has done 

m
oney behind advertising? Maybe talk about how you see the opportunity 
for that brand now with distribution looking rather full? Thanks.
 
Ramon Laguarta
 

opportunity in Mountain Dew 
to recover share and we have a huge 
opportunity ahead of us in Bubly in creating a whole new category of 
beverages. So on Dew, we tried to approach 

 
we had to work on Pepsi, we 

feeling
 



lot of innovation as well that should help the 
core new consumer to have 
more options in what is a high loyalty brand. Next to Mountain Dew there is 

category in small steps. Kickstart was one that we did. Kickstart was a great 
pla

solidify Mountain Dew. And then we just launched Mountain Dew Game Fuel 
to put one foot into the energy category with a differentiated position more 
towards the gaming and that kin
d of demand opportunity. It is doing very 
well. We plan to continue to innovate in that segment. The numbers you see 


of the new 

Dew consumer, very loyal giving them their preferred product in non
-
sugar 
and sugar options, innovating in favors in Dew and then moving Dew slowly 
into other spaces whe
re we think the brand has a role to play and I think 


sparkling water is always 

 

the U.S. if you 
compare with some of the European markets and we thought it was a big 
opportunity there. I think the R&D team did an amazing job. We have a very 

creating with some of th
ose flavors. I think the personality of the brand is 
fun, is modern, is young. So the consumers are coming back to Bubly. Bubly 
has doubled velocity, really has doubled velocity per point of distribution in 
the last three, four months after the Super Bowl 
with this new advertising. I 

a while for our retailer partners to give these brands that are growing so fast 

s with our 
retail partners to expand the Bubly space. So we see this brand as the brand 




think that is a very good positioning that we can have for this brand going 
forward for the modern consumer, the millennial and the younger mother 
that I think is adopting this brand for her kids

that
 
our commercial teams talk about purpose and our organizations are

piece is a bit of a separate relationship because of existing contracts, et

where we want to build this brand. In markets like Western Europe or

Indra Nooyi
 
Thank you, Jamie and good morning everyone. I am pleased with our 
performance in the first quarter of 2015. Our focus on innovation, bran
d 
building and marketplace execution funded in part by productivity initiatives 
continued to drive fundamental business performance.
 
In the first quarter, organic revenue grew 4.4% with Global Snacks up 7% 
and Global Beverages up 1.5%. And core gross margi
ns improved by 150 
basis points. Excluding the impairment charge and gains Jamie mentioned, 
core operating margin improved by 65 basis points. Core constant currency 
operating profit grew 11% and core constant currency EPS grew 16%. 
However foreign exchang
e headwinds persist. We have and will continue to 
take actions to manage through the current volatile macroeconomic 
environment by taking responsible pricing actions, tightly controlling costs 
and optimizing our global sourcing to minimize and mitigate the
 
impacts of 
the current foreign exchange challenges.
 

especially in Global Beverages where we realized 3 points of effective net 
pricing. At the same time we will not let cyclica
l macroeconomic issues divert 
us from our focus to drive sustainable shareholder value creation. We intend 
to continue to invest across our markets and brands to generate organic 
revenue growth, drive greater efficiency and productivity, deliver attractive
 
free cash flow and cash returns to shareholders and enhance our returns on 
invested capital.
 
The power of our the portfolio of products and brands and the strength of 
our geographic footprint have enabled us to consistently meet or exceed our 
financial go
als and more importantly give us confidence in the future 
prospects of our business.
 
As you know, in June this year we celebrate the 50
th
 
anniversary of PepsiCo 
which is the coming together of PepsiCo and Frito
-
Lay. As we celebrate this 
milestone, we look 
back on our journey with price. In 1965, our annual 
revenue was $510 million. Today it stands over $66 billion. A $100 
investment in PepsiCo stock in 1965 was worth nearly $43,000 at the end of 
2014, a compound annual total shareholder return of over 13%, 
far 
outpacing the S&P 500. And the reason we performed so well is that 
throughout our history, we have delivered short term performance with a 

because throughout the past half century
, PepsiCo has made bold move to 
reshape our portfolio, build new capabilities and broaden our geographic 
footprint.
 
So today our portfolio is positioned well. Our annual net revenue is nearly 
split evenly between the US and countries outside the US. And ju
st over half 
of our global revenue is derived from snacks, with the remainder from 
beverages. In aggregate, carbonated soft drinks comprised less than 25% of 
our 2014 total global revenue. And while we are proud to have the Pepsi 
name on the door, coolers 
represented less than 15% of our total revenue 

transform our portfolio to address ever changing consumer needs and 
preferences.
 

 
to compete in a 
rapidly evolving global business environment. For example, we transformed 
our operating model to blend global scale leverage with locally focused 
execution and this has increased our ability to capture efficiencies, live and 
shift the best
 
ideas and capabilities from PepsiCo teams around the world 
and win us a point of sale.
 
We embrace design as a core building block of our new product pipeline with 

proud to report that 
three PepsiCo products have received the 2015 Nielsen 
Breakthrough Innovation Award. This award recognizes the most successful 
and enduring new CPG products launched in the US in 2013 and PepsiCo is 
also the only company to receive multiple awards this yea
r.
 
Lastly, productivity is now part of our DNA with $1 billion in annual savings 
projected through 2019. These savings enable us to maintain or increase 
necessary investments in the business to drive strong organic revenue 

to reconceptualize our business to unlock 
even more productivity.
 
We are proud of the legacy results we are building this company on. So with 

with North America which again delive
red strong results in an otherwise 
sluggish packaged food and beverage environment. In fact, in Q1 2015 
PepsiCo was the largest contributor to US retail sales growth among all food 
and beverage manufacturers with over $300 million of retail sales growth in
 
all major channels. This was nearly three times the next largest contributor 
to growth and represented more growth than the next 19 largest 
manufacturers combined. Notably, North American beverages was the key 
driver of US retail sales growth within Pepsi
Co and the largest contributor to 
US retail sales growth on a standalone basis.
 
Turning now to PepsiCo Americas beverages. We delivered organic revenue 
and core constant currency operating profit growth while holding US LRB 
value share. Our strategy has no
t wavered as we continue to manage the 
business responsibly with consistent positive price realization across the 
portfolio. Within the US, we gained value share across important sub
-
categories, including sports drinks and ready to drink tea. And we grew r
etail 
sales in measured channels in the US for regular colas and Mountain Dew in 
CSDs and for Gatorade Lipton Tea and Naked Juice within our non
-
carbonated footprint.
 

over 60,000 integr
ated food and beverage displays merchandised at retail, 
up nearly 70% from the prior year. We also continue to invest in R&D to 
drive sustainable innovation. For example, we rolled out a newly designed 
Gatorade 20
-
ounce bottle which is a sleek contemporary
 
design bottle that is 

are promising with this package of innovation contributing to double
-
digit 
retail sales growth in regions that have converted with the new packaging.
 

also focused on health and wellness innovation. We recently 
introduced new Naked Juice flavors, including Chia Cherry Lime, Chia Sweet 
Peach and Bright Beat [ph] which offer delicious food and vegetables movies 
that pack a nutritional punch. And we launche
d Tropicana Farmstand 
Tropical Green, which is a great tasting green juice that has a full serving of 
fruits and vegetables in each 8
-
ounce glass with no added sugar.
 
Additionally we recently launched Mountain Dew Dewshine, a craft premium 
soda inspired by
 

clear citrus juice made with real cane sugar and packaged in clear glass 

Umami Burger which was a Pepsi
-
Cola Mountain Dew 
and Sierra Mist, all 
made with real sugar at its 24 locations.
 
In addition, we entered into a new multi
-
year deal with Live Nation. We are 

and have exclusive pouring rights at 75 


-
year food and beverage 
partnership with the National Basketball Association, Women's National 
Basketball Association, NBA Development League and USA Basketball 
beginning next seas
on. As part of this expansive food and beverage 
partnership with the League, PepsiCo will leverage its Mountain Dew, 
Aquafina, Brisk, Doritos & Ruffles brands to engage NBA fans through 

-
profile activation. Th
e 


 
Turning now to Frito
-
Lay North America, delivered another quarter of very 
strong results. Organic revenue grew 4% and
 
core constant currency 
operating profit rose 7%. The US salty snacks category continued to show 
solid growth and Frito market share again posted steady sequential 
improvement supported by both volume growth and price realization. Our 
key brands had revenu
e growth, including particularly good performance 
from Lays, Doritos and Cheetos. And we continue to innovate.
 
We launched Cheetos Sweetos, the first ever sweet Cheetos in the US as 
well as Cheetos appetizers, Doritos Jacked 3D and [indiscernible]. 
Additio
nally our Lays Do Us A Flavor win in 2014, Lays Kettle Wasabi Ginger 

successful Lays Do Us A Flavor consumer contest. Fans nationwide have 
submitted their ideas for the next great potat
o chip flavor for a chance to 
win $1 million grand prize and we will announce the four delicious finalist 
flavors this summer.
 
Quaker Food North America delivered commendable results despite 
continued challenges across central store food categories. During
 
the quarter 
we gained or held value share in the US in all three of our key categories, 
Hot, Ready
-
To
-
Eat Cereal and Snack Bars while expanding gross margin at 
the same time. These value share gains are driven by innovation which 
includes the launch of Qu
aker 3 minutes Steel Cut Oats in the quarter. This 
product has the same hottie texture and nutty flavor as traditional steel cut 

time is cut from 30 minutes to just 3 minutes. We a
lso launched gluten free 
varieties of Quaker Popped Rice Crisps.
 
And then turning to developing and emerging markets. Our business has 
delivered 10% organic revenue growth in the quarter despite all of the 
ongoing volatility in many regions of the 
world. Looking across some of our 
key DNA [ph] markets, our business continued to proved resilient with 
double
-
digit organic revenue growth in China and Turkey and mid single 
digit organic revenue growth in Mexico, Egypt and India.
 
So before I turn it over
 
to Hugh, I want to highlight a few key points. As an 
operating company, we absolutely manage the things that are within our 
control: marketing, innovation, marketplace execution and productivity and 
we expect to continue to perform well in these areas. Ho
wever we expect to 
face continued headwinds related to macros, in particular weak currencies in 
a number of our key markets and the impact of low oil prices in countries 
whose economies are highly dependent on energy. Obviously these are all 
products and s
old but we adjust the business to weather through the 
challenges as best as we can by controlling costs, adjusting our raw material 
sourcing and executing pricing actions, and these steps contributed to our 
strong fundamental performance in Q1.
 
So with tha
t, let me turn the call over to Hugh. Hugh?
 
Hugh Johnston
 
Thank you, Indra and good morning everyone. Turning to guidance. For the 
full year 2015 we expect mid
-
single
-
digit organic revenue growth, core 
operating margin expansion as organic topline growth a
nd productivity 
should offset negative geographic mix and commodity inflation, which 
incorporates the impact of higher than previously expected transaction 
related foreign
-
exchange headwinds and approximately $1 billion of 
productivity servings.
 
Below the 
division operating profit line, we continue to expect corporate cost 
to be lower, a core tax rate of approximately 25% and to reduce share 
count. As a result, we continue to expect 7% core constant currency 
earnings
-
per
-
share growth in 2015.
 
However given 
the continued strength in the US dollar, we now expect 
foreign
-
exchange translation to negatively impact net revenue and core 
earnings
-
per
-
share growth by approximately 10 and 11 percentage points 
respectively based on current consensus market rates. That 
compares to our 
initial outlook of 7 percentage points for each back in February. Keep in mind 
that while spot rates have shown improvement we use consensus rates in 
calculating our expected foreign
-
exchange impact and consensus rates have 
worsened for all
 
of our key foreign currencies, including the Russian ruble, 
the Brazilian real, the Canadian dollar, the Mexican peso and the British 
pound.
 
Our outlook for the year assumes continued translation of our Venezuela 
results at the SICAD rate of 12 Bolivars p
er US dollar. Should circumstances 
dictate use of a higher rate this would also negatively impact our US dollar 
results.
 
Taking our 2014 core EPS of $4.63 and applying our guidance and current 
market consensus of foreign
-
exchange impact implies 2015 core E
PS of 

consider the following: Foreign
-
exchange translation should have an 
approximate 11 point unfavorable impact on the second quarter net revenue 
and approximate 12 point unfavorabl
e impact on second
-
quarter core EPS 
based on current market consensus rates and we expect a profit decline in 
Europe driven by the volatility associated with transaction and translation 
currency related headwinds.
 
Below the division operating profit line, 
net interest expense is expected to 
increase in the second quarter versus last year, primarily reflecting 
increased debt balances. And our tax rate in the second quarter is expected 
to be sequentially higher than the first quarter of 2015.
 
Finally, our ste
pped
-
up share repurchase activity will occur throughout the 

of 2015.
 
From a cash flow perspective, we continue to expect full year free cash flow 
of more than $7 billion. I want to 
emphasize that despite the expected 
incremental foreign
-
exchange headwinds this year, our original $7 billion 
free cash flow target remains intact. This is the result of stringent working 

our 
cash conversion cycle by over 50% since Q1 2012 and continue to manage 
capital spending with great efficiency, holding capital spending below 5% of 
sales.
 
We expect our capital allocation discipline to continue to drive core ROIC 
improvement. This is b
uilding on the steady progress we've made in ROIC 
over the past two years with core net ROIC up 220 basis points to 17.5% 
from 2012 to 2014. And we expect to return between approximately $8.5 
billion and $9 billion to shareholders in 2015 through both divi
dends and 
share repurchases, again consistent with our original target.
 
As a reminder, our previously announced 7% dividend per share increase 
will commence with the June payment. This represents the 43rd consecutive 
year of annual dividend increases and a
n approximate 60% payout ratio 
based on 2014 core EPS. And our annualized dividends per share grew at 
low double
-
digit compound annual growth rate over the past 10 years.
 
To summarize, our core constant currency outlook for 2015 is unchanged 
from our last 
call and free cash flow, disciplined capital allocation and 
returning cash to our shareholders remain top priorities for the company.
 
With that operator, we will take the first question.
 
Question
-
and
-
Answer Session
 
Operator
 
[Operator Instructions] The firs
t question comes from the line of Dara 
Mohsenian of Morgan Stanley.
 
Dara Mohsenian
 
Can you discuss demand elasticity so far from the higher pricing you've 
taken? It looks like it's been pretty muted with the solid organic sales 
growth. So I am just wonderi
ng where demand elasticities are coming in 
versus your expectations particularly in Latin America and Russia given 
some of the macro difficulties there. And then as we look going forward as 
FX pressure continues to worsen do you plan to take incremental pr
icing 
internationally because I imagine at some point you don't want to push too 
far from a consumer standpoint? And then last just a detail question, the 
pricing number was very strong in Latin American foods and I suspect in the 
Latin piece of PAB how mu
ch of that was driven by Venezuela versus other 
geographies?
 
Indra Nooyi
 


take pricing. The challenge is
 
to balance volume and revenue and what we 
do in most cases is that we try to push through as much of the inflation as 
we can, and raw material inflation as we can through pricing. In many cases 
we cannot cover all of it but we try to price through about 7
5% of the 
inflation and then we manage very judiciously the revenue output and make 
sure that our volume decline is not significant. For example, let me take 

managed it up with a lot of p
roductivity also. And so our results in Russia 
and our business is doing very well. The real issue is yes, there is some 
volume drop
-
off but I think in these times we have to judiciously manage 
revenue and volume and then as the economies recover, go back 
to volume 
growth. If we don't push pricing through now, it will be very hard to push it 
all through later on to cover all of these costs. So at every point in time in 

 
And in terms of ongoing FX, spots rates are sl
ightly better than consensus. 
We have to watch and see how this thing evolves but in every country 
--
 
again every country is not moving exactly the same way but country by 
country as FX moves, especially transactional FX impacts country 
performance, we do 
take pricing at least to cover 75% of that and the rest 
of it we try to cover through productivity. And as far as Venezuela is 
concerned, I mean the footnotes in the Q will indicate exactly the impact of 
Venezuela and I think it will speak for itself.

ator
 
Your next question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane of Bank of 
America.
 
Bryan Spillane
 
First, just a comment, a lot of companies reporting this morning, you put out 
a pretty efficient press release that was easy to read. So thank you for that. 
I 


still, I guess, we could expect in Russia and potentially Venezuela. And so if 
you could just talk to 

 


of having that type of volatility. So could you talk just about what some of 

 
some variances to those 
forecasts and even specifically on free cash flow, what other actions can you 
take if you still have 

 

against you?
 
Indra Nooyi
 
Yes, I am going to let Hugh talk about cash 
flow but I will just make an 
overall comment. Russia, the business is doing very well, Bryan. Retail, dairy 
products, juice products, basic snacks, the business is doing very well. We 
have an excellent team in Russia, great productivity programs, putting t
he 
pricing through in very judicious ways, doing very good revenue 
management. I am very proud of the Russia team. And so they are 
managing through this volatility very well. And Venezuela, the business is 
doing exceedingly well in Venezuela. The issue is 

Huge now talk about what he is doing on the free cash flow to make sure 
that as a company we deliver on our commitment on free cash flow. Go 
ahead, Hugh.
 
Hugh Johnston
 
Yes, happy to. Morning Bryan. Real a couple things. Number o
ne, we do 
continue to localize this even more aggressively than we have in the past 
and obviously that helps us manage from a currency perspective which helps 
us manage from a free cash flow perspective. Number two, we are managing 

ve seen us over the last few years come down from 
the mid
-


from what had previously been about 21 days down to about three d
ays. In 
all condor, I still think we have more opportunity in that regard particularly 


you market consensu


from an inventory perspective in order to continue to cover if we have 
further downsides from an FX perspective.
 
Indra Nooyi
 
And our new operating model is also allowing us to come up with more 
productivity ideas across the company. That we will be working as the 
company against.
 
Operator
 
Our next question comes from the line of Bill Schmitz of Deutsche Bank.
 
Bill Schmitz
 
Hey I 

close down Muller as far as big impairment charge in the quarter? So is that 
just a write
-
down at the fair value now and is that still going to be in the 

through?
 
Indra Nooyi
 


some retooling. I know that business is alive and kicking.
 
Operator
 
Your next questi
on comes from the line of Judy Hong of Goldman Sachs.
 
Judy Hong
 
So I guess my question is more on the PAB margin performance in the 

margin did decline year
-
over
-
year. I know in the
 
press release you did cite 
lapping some of the one
-
time items. So can you just walk through the 
margin performance in PAB and how much is timing versus just really some 

top line per
spective?
 
Hugh Johnston
 
Yes, couple of elements there, Judy. First of all, the pricing environment is 
quite healthy. We felt terrific about pricing in the quarter and we expect that 
to continue going forward. Two other drivers, obviously advertising and 
ma

That's one of the elements. The other elements are some of the timing on 
spending with our Latin American bottlers that drove that number. So 

 
but 
we certainly expect PAB margins
 
to continue to grow over time as they have 
been.
 
Operator
 
Your next question comes from the line of Caroline Levy of CLSA.
 
Caroline Levy
 
Just one quick one. Why did you leave the charge in the Quaker operating 
income? Is there a good reason for that? And 
then it would be great if you 
could just tell us what it's like on the ground in Russia and Brazil right now, 
possibly even Mexico because there is a sense that things are deteriorating 

 
Indra N
ooyi
 

Quaker Muller.
 
Hugh Johnston
 

 
Indra Nooyi
 
On the ground in Russia, as Hugh just mentioned, we were localizing costs 
and we hav



say that on the ground in Russia, the business
 

also giving an opportunity for all companies operating in Russia to look and 

cost. So except for the overall macro geopolitical issues in Russia 
on the 
ground the business in Russia looks okay.
 


of volatility at all in Mexico, we have pockets of security issues but overall 
Mexico is just fine. Brazil
 
did see a slowdown, coming off the real weakening 
and then on top of that the graft issues happening in Brazil. Yes, we did see 

of the three countries that you mentioned proba
bly in the last quarter, Brazil 

carefully at this point.
 
Operator
 
Your next question comes from the line of Ali Dibadj of Bernstein.
 
Ali Dibadj
 
I actually had two questions. One is just ass
uming on cost a little bit, please. 

inflation being higher for the year, why for FLNA and PAB, you had an 
operating cost inflation. Is that wages? And then importantly also just 
continu
e to cut the billion dollars of cost a few years of that, but what 


-
Cola refranchise more and more of its 
US bottling operations. Are you se
eing anything that shows the change in 
pattern of their activity in the marketplace?
 
Indra Nooyi
 
I am going to answer two parts and I am going to turn it to Hugh on 
commodity inflation. And as I mentioned in my script, Ali, we talked about 
the billion
-
doll
ar per year for the next five years. But when we announced 
the billion
-
dollar a year for the next five years, we started working on the 
next round of ideas to think about even more productivity opportunities. And 
we will come back and talk to you about it 
when we are ready to talk about 
it but believe me once we change the operating model of the company to 
really look across the company as opposed to allowing each country and 
regions just operate independently. There are more opportunities for 
efficiency. S

 

why we bought back the bottling access. We bought it back because we 
wanted to improve efficiency in the system and most importantly we wanted
 
to serve our customers in a seamless way and be able to put in a lot of 
innovation through a bottling system which had to move from huge 
monolithic products to a highly segmented set of products. That original 
proposition has not changed. What we are seei
ng today is disciplined pricing 
in the market and from our perspective the integrated operating system is 
very valuable and we intend to continue to operate that way. So on 
commodity inflation, Hugh, quickly.
 
Hugh Johnston
 

tirely driven by foreign
-
exchange, ex foreign 
exchange their commodity inflation is almost flattish.
 
Operator
 
Your next question comes from the line of Bill Marshall of Barclays.
 
Bill Marshall
 
I actually have a high level kind of strategic question for you
. Indra, in your 
prepared remarks you mentioned the challenges in center of the store food 
recently. And I think a couple of years ago you labeled these businesses as 
not necessarily core to the mission, even though nice cash flow generating 
assets. I am k
ind of wondering how you are thinking about those businesses 

with food and the interest rate environment that we are seeing now.
 
Indra Nooyi
 
I think there's two kinds of businesses,
 
I said, were not core to the mission. 
Quaker is very core to the mission. What we were talking about is sort of the 
peripheral businesses we got as part of the Quaker Oaks acquisition, the 
Golden Grain and the Aunt Jemima. Those businesses are center of t
he 
store. They are not core to our portfolio, but today they are doing fine. They 
are holding their ground, sometimes even gaining share. They are 
generating very valuable US cash flow and these are businesses with 

more dilutive to get rid of them than 
to keep them. And so, what we are going to do is just manage those 
businesses steadily as long as they don't distract us from our core mission of 

 
And la
stly, they also provide scale to our warehouse sales operation. So at 
this point just steady management of those businesses, don't distract 

we are doing.
 
Operator
 
Your next questio
n comes from the line of John Faucher of JPMorgan.
 
John Faucher
 
Indra, I wanted to talk about sort of your old sort of buckets that the 
business has had in terms of Fun for You, Better for You and Good for You. It 
seems as though we are seeing a change in 
the consumer dynamic 
particularly in the Better for You bucket, if you look at something like diet 
soft drinks, what have you. So I guess as we look at this what do you think 
has changed in terms of those buckets and what are you doing differently to 
respo
nd as the consumers maybe seem less interested in what you guys had 
traditionally discussed is Better for You?
 
Indra Nooyi
 

seen the consumer as confused as they are today. And I use t
he word 
confused in a neutral way, not a negative way. If you had asked me a few 
years ago people were moving to diet sodas. Now they view real sugar as 
Good for You. They are willing to go to organic non
-
GMO products even if it 
has high salt, high sugar, 
high
-
fat. So I think we have a challenge these 
days to really think about what is the definition of Good for You from a 
consumer perspective. And this is unprecedented and the old definition of 
Good for You is being challenged right now. So I think the bes
t way to think 
about this is to think about the fruit and vegetable corridor, a protein 
corridor, a grains corridor and then sort of a predominantly carb corridor.
 
And then within that just vary our strategy based on what the consumer is 
thinking about. Be
cause especially millennials today have got very different 
definitions of Good for You versus Fun for You. They don't really make the 

So we are also going through a little change 
in our thinking. The good news 
is whatever the segmentation is our portfolio is still balanced and we can 
actually flex to either definition. So, we are managing the business by 
watching both.

Your next question comes from the line of Mark Swartzb
erg of Stifel 
Financial.
 
Mark Swartzberg
 
Indra, Hugh, a question about FX from a transactional standpoint. Obviously 
you have some major productivity programs underway and we are a couple 
of years into this. But when you look at specifically the countries 
of Mexico 
and China, are these higher transactional costs that are dollar
-
related 
--
 
are 
they impacting you to the scope or the phasing of some of your productivity 
programs in those particular countries?
 
Hugh Johnston
 
Mark, I would say no. It really doesn't affect us a great deal. We obviously 

the degree that we are experiencing that in a particular market, as Indra 
mentioned earlier, we are tendi
ng to price through about 75% of it. But in 
terms of if transactional ForEx is affecting capital that we would put in to 
drive productivity, it really isn't impacting us a great deal. It's not slowing 
down the rate because the returns on those initiatives 
tend to be pretty solid 
and we can overcome the FX impact.

Your next question comes from the line of Amit Sharma of BMO Capital 
Markets.
 
Amit Sharma
 
Just a quick clarification first. The 75% rule that you're talking about, is that 
just to 
cover underlying inflation or should we expect that to cover the 
transactional FX as well?
 
Indra Nooyi
 
I mean, transactional FX is what drives some of the inflation. And so they 
are all related. I have given you 75% of what we're doing today, it varies 
aro
und that number. Sometimes we can do more, sometimes we can do 
less, but as a basket it's around 75%. The thing, Amit, is that globally we 
have been through in some country of the world hyperinflation, inflation, 
extraordinary inflation, geopolitical crise
s, we have been through that. And 
across PepsiCo exists a lot of playbooks on how to manage through these 
sorts of issues. So when we have a problem like this in a country we bring 
the experts in, we use one of these playbooks and then we use our 
extraordi
nary teams in these countries, then we judiciously manage through 
pricing, productivity, revenue management to see how best to insulate the 
portfolio.
 
And I think the good news about the portfolio is that the portfolio serves as 
a good hedge when you have 

what allows us to deliver the 7% constant currency growth, reiterate that 
guidance and the free cash flow guidance.
 
Hugh Johnston
 
To be clear on that, I would think of the 75% as a rough modeling guideline, 
not
 
an internal principle as to how we execute market by market. We vary 
market by market based on the opportunities in front of us.

Your final question comes from the line of Steve Powers of UBS.
 
Steve Powers
 
Maybe just a couple of final clarificati
ons. First on pricing specifically in 

this quarter is falling well short of sort of the currency headwinds. So was 
there additional pricing that maybe you took after the quarter 
in Eastern 
Europe and Russia or do you still expect to take to catch up with currency? 
And if so what type of elasticity should we kind of think about around that 
incremental pricing? That's first. And then second, maybe, Hugh, just some 
clarification and 
sensitivities around that updated FX guidance, 
understanding you use consensus rates. If we benchmark to today's spot 
rates can you give us some sense of what that outlook would look like at 
spot rates and how it might improve? And then conversely, if you 
did move 
to the latest rates in Venezuela, some sensitivities around the magnitude of 
that impact in the other direction?
 
Hugh Johnston
 

efficiently. Number one, you will see more pricing 
in Eastern Europe that will 
come through. To date the elasticities in Russia have been less than one. So 
as we put incremental pricing we will see how it looks going forward. But to 
date the elasticity has been less than one. So obviously that's been 
favor
able to us.
 
Number two, in terms of the overall FX, spot numbers are moving around so 
much, I actually don't pay as much attention to spot as I do to market 
consensus. So not clear to me, it might be a little bit favorable at this point. 
But I would just s
tay focused on the guidance that we have given you rather 

was around 

 
I think that was it. Anyway, Steve, if you have another 
question you can give Jamie and the team a call.
 
E
nd of Q&A
 
Indra Nooyi
 
Yes. Thank you all for your questions. And in closing I just want to say that 
we have taken the necessary steps to position ourselves for sustainable 
long
-
term growth. I believe we are off to a good start in 2015, and we are 
navigatin
g well through an uncertain and volatile environment. And I believe 
the first quarter of 2015 is a good example of how a well constructed 
portfolio, appropriate investment and disciplined execution can drive strong 
constant currency top
-
 
and bottom
-
line re
sults. Our first quarter results give 
me confidence that our plans are working and that we are on track to deliver 
on our financial goals in 2015.
 
I thank you for your time this very busy morning and for the confidence you 
have placed in us with your inves
tments. Have a great day.

Thank you, Jamie, and good morning, everyone. As you saw in this 
morning's release, we concluded 2017 with another quarter of strong 
operat
ing performance, capping off another successful year. In the fourth 
quarter, overall organic revenue growth accelerated sequentially from the 
third quarter to 2.3%, right in line with our expectations. Core constant 
currency operating profit increased 6%, 
and core constant currency EPS 
increased 8%.
 
We had particularly strong performance in the quarter at Frito
-
Lay North 
America, with organic revenue growth of 5%, led by impressive growth in 
variety packs, Ruffles, Tostitos, Doritos and dips. We also gained
 
market 
share, both in salty snacks and in the more broadly defined macro snacks 
categories. The business performed well throughout the year, with strong 
brand activation and innovative new products propelling the top line, and 
productivity programs contin
uing to move margins up.
 
Quaker Foods North America had very good performance. Hot cereals 
volume grew mid
-
single digits, and we gained share in our three key 
categories of hot cereals, bars and ready
-
to
-
eat cereal.
 
North America Beverages posted sequentia
l improvement from the third 
quarter in organic revenue performance, with volume trends improving in 
trademarks, Pepsi, Mountain Dew, Gatorade and Lipton. More importantly, 
we have robust marketing in innovation lined up for 2018, including the 
launch of o
ur Pepsi Generations campaign; the launch of Mountain Dew Ice, 
which was prominently featured with Doritos Blaze at the Super Bowl; the 
introduction of bubly, our new sparkling water that combines refreshing 
flavors with an upbeat and playful sense of humo
r to shake things up in the 
sparkling water category; and further marketing support in packaging 
innovation, as LIFEWTR enters its second year from launch.
 
To be clear, while our North American Beverages segment's top line 
performance did improve compared 
to the third quarter, overall, its 
performance still has tremendous room to improve, and we are taking the 
right steps to realize those opportunities. We remain committed to our 
strategy to compete on the basis of brand building, innovation and 
marketplace
 
execution across our portfolio of brands as the best way to 
create shareholder value over the long term.
 
Turning to our international segments, organic revenue growth outside North 
America was fueled by continued strong performance in developing and 
emerg
ing markets, which posted organic revenue growth of 7% as a group, 
led by double
-
digit growth in Vietnam, Turkey, Thailand, Philippines and 
Argentina, high
-
single
-
digit growth in Russia and China, and very solid mid
-
single
-
digit growth in Mexico and India.
 
For the full year, we delivered solid organic revenue growth of 2.3%. We 
expanded core operating margin by 45 basis points. We grew core constant 
currency EPS by 9%, exceeding the 8% goal we set out at the beginning of 
2017. We generated free cash flow, e
xcluding certain items, of $7.3 billion, 
which exceeded our goal of approximately $7 billion we set out at the 
beginning of 2017.
 
Core net ROIC expanded by 140 basis points and now stands at 22.9%. And 
we met our goal of returning $6.5 billion in cash to s
hareholders through 
dividends and share repurchases. These are impressive results, particularly 
in light of the challenges posed by global mega trends impacting our 
industry, from macroeconomic and political volatility, the continued 
rebalancing of the eco
nomic world, to shifting consumer preferences and 
increasing demand for healthier products, to the disruption of retail caused 
by the rapid growth of e
-
commerce and the blurring of channel lines.
 
Our 2000 (sic) [2017] (06:08) results add to a long run of v
ery strong 
operating performance. Over the past five years, organic revenue grew at a 
4% compound rate, core operating margin expanded by 220 basis points, 
core constant currency EPS growth averaged 9% annually, core net ROIC 
expanded more than 750 basis p
oints, our annualized dividend per share 
increased by 50%, and we returned $38 billion to shareholders through 
dividends and share repurchases combined.
 
Our results for 2017 and over the longer past are a result of our steadfast 
commitment to manage our bu
siness responsibly and sustainably. Our 
portfolio of businesses has delivered consistently strong financial results year 
after year, while making the investments and taking the necessary actions 
to sustain shareholder value creation over the long term. Spe
cifically, the 
expansion of our geographic reach and product portfolio has made our 
business more resilient. The power of our customer relationships in retail 
and foodservice has created advantage in the marketplace.
 
The strength of new capabilities in e
-
c
ommerce, research and development, 
social and digital marketing and design has helped us connect with 
consumers in new ways. Our environmental footprint has continued to 
shrink, streamlining our operations and reducing costs. And our commitment 
to producti
vity has enabled us to sustainably reinvest in the business, 
positioning us to capture tomorrow's growth. In a nutshell, we have built a 
business that balances top line growth, productivity and reinvestment to 
generate strong financial results in a way tha
t is self
-
reinforcing and self
-
sustaining.
 
The strength of our customer relationships in the United States was reflected 
in the most recent Kantar Retail PoweRanking survey, where our retail 
partners, once again, named us as the number one best
-
in
-
class 
ma
nufacturer. And for the first time, we received the top ranking in every 
functional category, including clear company strategy, most important 
consumer brands, growth in profitability, sales force and customer teams, 
insights and category management, suppl
y chain management, and use of 
digital platforms. Similarly, we were highly ranked in service by Advantage 
in many of our markets outside the United States, including key markets like 
China, Russia, the UK and Mexico.
 
Our annual productivity savings of app
roximately $1 billion have been driven 
by a relentless continuous improvement mindset focused on every aspect of 
our value chain and guided by our environmental sustainability agenda. We 
have refined our business model to reduce management layers and 
accel
erate decision making, and have deployed leading
-
edge technologies to 
increase manufacturing throughput, reduce logistics costs, and increase go
-
to
-
market efficiency and effectiveness.
 
Further, our robust environmental sustainability agenda has complemente
d 
these initiatives. Its focus on reducing water and energy use and eliminating 
waste has both reduced cost and vastly reduced our environmental impact. 
For example, in 2017, we accelerated our efforts to minimize PepsiCo's 
environmental impact, enabling u
s to streamline costs and mitigate our 
operational impact in the communities we serve. We have teamed up with 
disruptive startups, leading universities, governments and innovators to 
develop biodegradable film resins that meet the sustainable, flexible 
pac
kaging requirements of our global food and beverage business, a 
technology to help advance our goal of designing 100% of our packaging to 
be recyclable, compostable or biodegradable by 2025.
 
Despite the many challenges we faced over the years, from changin
g 
consumer preferences to disruption in the retail environment, to geopolitical 
turmoil, we have consistently and substantially reinvested savings back into 
the business to further build capabilities and adopt technologies that we 
believe will enable us to
 
sustain our top line growth. So, for example, our 
investment in e
-
commerce across multiple channels, from e
-
grocery, to 
direct to consumer, to pure play, helped drive exceptional growth in 2017.
 
We are leveraging big data and predictive analytics to sharp
en real
-
time 
marketing messages, dynamic merchandising and tailored offers. And we're 
increasingly collaborating with retail customers to make e
-
commerce a point 
of differentiation for PepsiCo. As a result, our e
-
commerce business is now 
approximately $1 b
illion in annualized retail sales, and we are well 
positioned to capitalize on what is sure to be a dynamic future in this space. 
In our investment in the world
-
class design capability enabled the successful 
launches of innovative new products like LIFEWTR
, and injected excitement 
and dynamism into our presence at major global events, from the Super 
Bowl to the UEFA Champions League Final.
 
Looking to 2018, we are encouraged by a number of factors. The global 
economy is growing, with developed markets stable
 
and a number of 
developing and emerging economies showing signs of acceleration. In most 
of our key markets, the picture is relatively positive, with strong 
employment, consumer spending, and consumer sentiment data.
 
And in the United States, our largest 
market, we expect the recently enacted 
tax reform to have a positive impact on many sectors and businesses and on 
the economy overall. However, our outlook is tempered by expectation for 
challenging industry conditions, including a continued dynamic retail
 
landscape, shifting consumer preferences and behaviors, especially as it 
relates to the focus on health and wellness, a robust competitive 
environment, and rising commodity costs.
 
Despite these challenges, we believe we are poised to continue to perform 
w
ell, precisely because we have been making the investments and taking 
the actions to adapt and thrive in the current dynamic environment. For 
2018, we will be aided by the financial benefits provided by the recent U.S. 
tax reform, which will allow us to ma
ke incremental investments to further 
fortify our business. For example, in 2018, we will provide a bonus of up to 
$1,000 to full
-
time front
-
line U.S.
-
based associates to reward and recognize 
their dedication and contribution to making our business better 
and 
stronger. And we will invest in training our global associates to arm them 
with the skills to succeed in tomorrow's workplace.
 
Furthermore, as a company, we will double down on new capabilities in 
areas such as e
-
commerce, digital, and brand marketing 
to make us even 
more competitive. We're going to accelerate capital investments to add 
manufacturing capacity and make our operations more efficient. And we're 
enhancing cash returns for our shareholders, beginning with the 15% 
increase to our annualized d
ividend per share, effective with the dividend 
expected to be paid in June 2018.
 
Taken together, these actions are consistent with our philosophy of 
responsible sustainable management. They extend the durability of our 
business while 
strengthening cash returns to our owners, those who have 
entrusted their capital to us to generate secure, growing returns to provide 
for their retirements, their children's educations, and all the other noble 
financial goals they may be pursuing.
 
With tha
t, let me turn it over to Hugh. Hugh?

Thank you, Indra, and good morning, everyone. Let me begin with a 
discussion of our assessment of the impact of the recently enacted U.S. tax 
reform because it has implications for our 
2018 financial outlook on a 
number of dimensions. From our perspective, it will affect five key areas.
 
First, beginning in 2018, it will result in a lower tax rate on our U.S. 
earnings. Second, it imposes a one
-
time mandatory tax on our international 
accum
ulated earnings that existed as of year
-
end 2017, regardless of 
whether we choose to repatriate those earnings, but at a substantially lower 
rate than would have previously applied to actual repatriation. So net, it 
provides a much more efficient framework
 
in which to repatriate our 
international cash.
 
Third, it decreases our net deferred tax liabilities, as those tax deferred 
items are now expected to be taxed at a lower rate at the point they became 
taxable. Fourth, it will allow for much greater mobility
 
of our international 
cash going forward. And fifth, it will drive higher cash
-
on
-
cash returns on 
U.S. capital projects, as capital spending for the next five years will be 
immediately deductible for tax purposes.
 
As a consequence, in the fourth quarter of
 
2017, we recorded a one
-
time 
$2.5 billion provisional net tax expense, which reflects the deemed 
provisional one
-
time repatriation tax of approximately $4 billion net of a 
provisional $1.5 billion benefit relating to the deferred tax remeasurement. 
The pr
ovisional $4 billion liability associated with the international 
accumulated earnings is expected to be paid out over eight years, starting in 
2019.
 
We expect a lower overall effective tax rate for 2018. We will accelerate 
some capital projects into 2018, 
resulting in an expectation for total CapEx 
to be approximately $3.6 billion in 2018. And we expect to make a $1.4 
billion discretionary pension contribution in the first quarter of 2018 to 
maximize its tax deductibility.
 
So turning to our guidance for 201
8, we expect organic revenue growth at 
least in line with our 2017 growth rate, or 2.3%, as we expect to continue to 
benefit from successful product innovation and strong marketplace 
execution, but tempered by a cautious outlook as it relates to the retail
 
environment and changing consumer behavior. As Indra mentioned, we 
expect to step up investment spending in front
-
line workforce training, 
digital capability, data analytics, e
-
commerce, and advertising and 
marketing.
 
We expect our core effective tax rate
 
to be in the low 20s. and we expect 
core earnings per share of $5.70, or a 9% increase compared to 2017 core 
earnings per share of $5.23, with the benefit of the lower tax rate 
substantially offset by the incremental investments.
 
Turning to cash flow, we 
expect to continue to generate strong cash flow and 
to exercise discipline over capital allocation, with prudent reinvestment into 
the business and the majority of our free cash flow returned to shareholders. 
So for 2018, we expect free cash flow of approx
imately $6 billion, 
approximately $9 billion in cash flow from operations, which includes the 
$1.4 billion discretionary pension contribution. On this point, it is important 
to note the pension funding will reduce our gross debt from a rating agency 
perspe
ctive, and so it creates room for leverage elsewhere within our capital 
structure.
 
And we expect net capital spending of approximately $3.6 billion. As I 
mentioned, this is a bit above our trend over the last few years as we 
accelerate some projects into 2
018. And we expect to return approximately 
$7 billion to shareholders in 2018, with cash dividends of approximately $5 
billion, reflecting the 15% dividend increase Indra mentioned, and share 
repurchases of approximately $2 billion. Further, beyond 2018, w
e see the 
prospect for even higher cash returns as we begin to fully realize the 
benefits of greater global cash mobility.
 
Relatedly, we announced today our new three
-
year share repurchase 
program commencing July 1, 2018, providing for the repurchase of up
 
to 
$15 billion of common stock.
 
Finally, as you update your models, I'd like to highlight the following. We 
expect our rate of organic revenue growth and core constant currency EPS 
growth to be higher in the second half than in the first half, as we will 
lap 
NAB's softer performance and natural disaster
-
related business disruptions 
in the second half. We expect variability in the timing of productivity 
savings, investments, and this includes the accrual of the front
-
line bonus, 
and net commodity inflation 
to contribute to relatively better performance in 
the second half. And we expect the fourth quarter to have the largest year
-
on
-
year core tax rate benefit.
 
With that, we're ready to take the first question.

Good morning, Dara.

Hey, good morning. So, NAB continued to be weak for the second straight 
quarter. I wa
s hoping you could review your plans there to improve market 
share performance on the CSD side of the business going forward. And how 
big a piece lower pricing or greater promotion is within those plans?
 
You mentioned some tweaks post Q3 in terms of shelf 
space focus, et 
cetera, but it did look like you pulled the pricing lever more aggressively in 
Q4, both in the scanner data, as well as reported results despite the 
comments on brand building. So, I'd love some detail there. And then also, 
while we're on t
he subject, can you review the Gatorade trends in North 
America from a market share perspective and forward plans for that brand? 
Thanks.
 
Indra K. Nooyi

PepsiCo, Inc.
 
Dara 

 
Hugh, you want to take this?
 
Hugh F. Johnston 
-
 
PepsiCo, Inc.
 
I'd be happy to ta
ke it. Thanks, Dara, for the question. A couple of 
comments on that. First, I want to make clear that our strategy in the 
beverage business remains as it's been. It's focused on brand building, it's 
focused on innovation, and it's focused on execution in t
he marketplace 
funded by driving incremental productivity.
 
Second, in terms of 2018, we have increased advertising behind the big 
brands, and we expect that to have a positive impact. But like most 
advertising campaigns, that will take several quarters to 
fully realize the 
impact. So, we expect sequential improvement in each of the quarters, 
starting with Q1. Just as a reminder, back on the Q3 call, we did talk about 
the fact that we expected sequential improvement from Q3 to Q4 and we 
did, in fact, see tha
t.
 
Regarding pricing, we expect our pricing to be competitive in the 
marketplace, but pricing lower is not part of our strategy to gain market 
share. Price/mix is always complicated when you read the reported results. 
Particularly in the first month of 
the year, you saw some increased 
promotional activity that is much more reflective of timing at a few of our 
bigger customers than it is of a change in strategy. So, we expect to get the 
types of pricing that we've gotten in recent years in the North Ameri
can 
Beverage business.
 
As for Gatorade, I think you'll see a full lineup of innovation for the year, 
both flavor innovation and perhaps some broader things as well, which we'll 
be talking about as we get further into the year. So, net, it's about 
innovatio
n and it's about brand building. It's not about pricing as far as our 
strategy is to continue to see sequential improvement in the beverage 
business.
 
Indra K. Nooyi

And more importantly, Gatorade trends are improving, and we feel good 
about
 
what we're saying the business delivering right now.

Hey, good morning
 
everyone. Just a question, I guess, related to 

 
or a 
couple questions related just to cash flow as we think about this year. First, 
net interest expense; Hugh, if you could talk at all about just the movement 
in rates and how we should think about how th
at might 

 
or potential 
movement in rates and how that might affect net interest expense?
 
And then, second, in terms of the CapEx coming up, I think you mentioned 
in the prepared remarks that some of it's going also to adding capacity. And 
so, I'm just cur
ious to know, with organic sales growth sort of below the 
algorithm, but we're adding capacity, is it a modernization, so a need to sort 
of modernize some manufacturing capacity? Or are there true needs to sort 
of add capacity?
 
Indra K. Nooyi

PepsiCo, In
c.
 
Go ahead.
 
Hugh F. Johnston 
-
 
PepsiCo, Inc.
 
So I'm happy to take that one, Bryan. First, regarding your questions on 
cash flow and specifically net interest expense, we do operate with zero net 
floating debt, so rises in interest rates shouldn't have an 
immediate impact 
on us in terms of the debt that we carry. We obviously do have refinancing 
risk as we sort of turn over that debt tower each and every year. But given 
the cash return, we should be able to manage that successfully, so I don't 
expect to see
 
significant rises in net interest expense for the year.
 
As to your question regarding capacity, if you look at the Frito
-
Lay business 
in particular, we will be investing in capacity there. We've seen good strong 
volume growth in Frito
-
Lay over the last se
veral years and certain of our 
international markets where we've also seen good strong volume growth, 
we'll need to add capacity in those markets. So, this is very much capacity, 
reflective of growth in individual product categories around the world.
 
Indra
 
K. Nooyi 
-
 
PepsiCo, Inc.
 
And most of the capacity increase is in snacks. And we're going to put the 
capital in 2018 and hopefully, from 2019 we'll start to see the results of the 
new capacity coming on stream.

We've been reading all the reports that you guys have written to understand 
the real strategy behind that merger. I'm sure there's some towering 
strategic logic, but we are still searching for it. You see, the distribution, 
80% of distribution of Dr Pe
pper sits between the red system and the blue 
system. And so, if the merger is supposed to increase access to distribution, 
it's between the two of us who control 80% of the distribution and manage it 
for Dr Pepper. So, let's wait and see over the next few
 
weeks and months to 
see what kind of a strategy they articulate because it somehow eluded us 
the strategic logic.

Good morning. Thank you very much. I'm wondering if you could give us a 
little detail on your outlook for costs. We understand there's a lot of pressure 
on distribution, trucking, shortage of dri
vers, and then, of course, just raw 
materials. And I think you're hedged out nine months on average on your

across the board, operating cost pressure and some raw material cost 
pre
ssure already in the fourth quarter. Thanks.

PepsiCo, Inc.
 
Thanks. Thanks, Indra. Yeah, Caroline, break it up into two pieces. On the 
commodity side, as you correctly observe, we do have our systematic 
forward buying program in pla
ce, so we're generally out about nine months 
on all the things that we can be out on. Overall, commodity inflation will be 
in the low single digits as it's been in the last couple of years.
 
Regarding labor inflation and OpEx inflation, we've typically seen
 
pressure 
there in the range of 3% to 4% globally, which is about in line with the 
inflation in our markets around the world. To date, we haven't seen any 
pressure that's so substantive that it's disruptive to the algorithm, but we 
certainly expect some la
bor inflation pressure in certain markets over time.

Good morning, Robert.
 
Robert Ottenstein

Great, great. Good morning. Hugh, you did touch on quite a bit some of the 
financial implications of tax reform. But I'm just wondering if you could step 
back, philosophically it sounds like you'll be able to give more money back to 
shareholders. You raise
d the share buyback authorization higher than it was 
in the past. And you increased the dividend at a higher rate than in the past. 
Can you just talk a little bit more detail about some of the increased 
flexibility you're going to have? Should we expect hi
gher dividend increases 
than in the past? Does this change anything on the M&A front? Just a little 
bit more detail from a strategic perspective.
 
Hugh F. Johnston 
-
 
PepsiCo, Inc.
 
Sure.
 
Indra K. Nooyi 
-
 
PepsiCo, Inc.
 
Go ahead, take the dividend question. On
 
the M&A, I'll just tell you, Robert, 
we're sticking with our strategy of tuck
-
in M&As. And if something blindingly 
strategic and value creating shows up, we'll be sure to talk to you about it. 
But at this point, our focus is on sensible tuck
-
in acquisitio
ns. But talk about 
the other things, Hugh.
 
Hugh F. Johnston 
-
 
PepsiCo, Inc.
 
Yeah. So, Robert, on more broadly, obviously, the tax reform bill allows for a 
much greater flexibility in terms of the way we manage the company's 
resources, and, particularly, ca
sh resources around the globe. It, obviously, 
lowers the cost of capital a little bit in the U.S. as well. So, generally, that's 
good news for investment in growth.
 
In terms of our projections going forward on dividend and share repurchase, 
with this 15% a
nnouncement, you've seen the payout ratio go up a little bit. 
I think that's likely where we're to maintain. This is not a signal of a longer
-
term increase in the payout ratio over time. So, we talk about dividends 
once a year, every year.
 
I'm not going to
 
talk about specifically what will happen going forward. But I 
think what you see is just a modest uptick in the payout ratio. Beyond that, 
we'll see what happens as we get beyond 2018 regarding where the cash 
goes and what we do with it. But as Indra said
, our M&A policy has been 
very tightly focused on tuck
-
in M&A, and that's where we'll stay.

Financial Group LLLP
 
Good morning, everyone. Good morning and good morning, everyone. Look, 
just two questions. First, can we talk a little bit about ready
-
to
-
drink coffee 
and ready
-
to
-
drink tea? I know you don't fully own those 

 
you don't own 
those busin
esses directly, but in a couple of years, both of them could be as 
big as your sports drinks business if my math is not wrong. Just give us 
some color there. Obviously, you have the Dunkin' entry with Coke into 
ready
-
to
-
drink coffee. On the tea side, Pure 
Leaf and Brisk are doing well, 
but Lipton is declining. Just some color there would help. And maybe a 
reminder in terms of how that really flows through the P&L.
 
And the second question, in terms of your water strategy, leaving bubly 
aside, obviously, Prop
el LIFEWTR are helping you gain share in still bottled 
water. But just remind us of the strategy in still water, Aquafina is still a big 
chunk of your business there, but how big are the other brands also?
 
And third and last, related to water, can you give
 
us some color on bubly? 
Obviously, your main competitor there, LaCroix, does not advertise. I 
suppose we will see a big advertising push from bubbly with it being at 
Walmart. Just some color on the launch would be helpful. Thanks.
 
Indra K. Nooyi 
-
 
PepsiCo
, Inc.
 
Okay, ready
-
to
-
drink coffee and ready
-
to
-
drink tea, both businesses doing 
very well. Ready
-
to
-
drink tea overall has grown every year in the United 
States and globally. Clearly, Pure Leaf grew at very attractive rates. And 
core Lipton fell off a litt
le bit, but we have plans to bring growth back to 
Brisk, to Lipton and to Pure Leaf. So, we feel very good about the plans we 
have for ready
-
to
-
drink tea, which also includes the premium Tea House 
Collection. So, all the new flavors we are launching. And t
he sort of re
-
advertising of core Lipton, I think, is going to give the ready
-
to
-
drink tea 
business that we have a much needed boost.
 
When it comes to ready
-
to
-
drink coffee, Starbucks is still the most powerful 
brand in the United States and globally. And 
the joint venture is doing very 
well. When you have a competitor in the ready
-
to
-
drink coffee business 
going through a powerful distribution system, which is what happened with 
Dunkin' Donuts coffee, in the short term, you will have some share erosion. 
The
 
challenge is not to behave crazily through the share disruption because, 
ultimately, the strength of the product determines who is going to win in the 
long term.
 
So, I think, as the year progressed, our ready
-
to
-
drink coffee business 
returned to growth ag
ain because the initial distribution share losses 
steadied. And ultimately, the business has to be won on velocity of the 
product, and we're doing just fine. And the innovation pipeline on ready
-
to
-
drink coffee coming out of Starbucks is very, very impress
ive. So, we feel 
good about both.
 
In terms of the profit impact to us, it's a joint venture, but we captured the 
bottling revenue. So, we capture a large portion of the revenue of both 
coffee and tea, although it's a joint venture with Starbucks for coffee
 
and 
Unilever for tea, and they're both very successful joint ventures. I wish we 
had more of them.
 
In terms of water, clearly, it's a big market and it's growing. And as you 
know, beverages is a repertoire category. And water in all its forms, still, 
spar
kling flavored; still, flavored sparkling; electrolytic waters; sports 
hydration, they're all growing categories. At this point, we have our 
presence in, I think, pretty much every category in water.
 
And I'll be honest with you. I think we were late to the
 
flavored sparkling 
water category. I wish we had launched bubly a couple of years ago. But the 
fact of the matter is we have a very good distribution system. Our customer 
relationships are excellent, and our customers are very, very happy we're 
launching 
bubly. The product tastes fantastic, and in a lot of the testing, it is 
winning versus competition. So we are feeling good about bubly.
 
Propel has been doing very well, growing. We feel good about that. 
LIFEWTR, as you know, is perhaps one of the fastest
-
g
rowing electrolytic 
waters that was launched in 2017. And our goal is to continue to support the 
arts and roll it out globally in 2018 and beyond. So overall, the hydration 
portfolio is strong. And our goal is to make sure, as a repertoire category, 
we off
er sports drinks, we offer other hydration options, and coffee, tea, 
carbonated soft drinks, all of the products that the consumer wants.

Indra, I was hoping that you could expand on your comment, please, around 
your outlook for the retail environment. I assume that was a U.S. specific 
comment. And if you c
ould drill down at all into what you're seeing in c
-
stores, I think it will be helpful. Thank you.
 
Indra K. Nooyi 
-
 
PepsiCo, Inc.
 
Actually, the retail disruption is happening globally. It's not just a U.S. 
phenomenon. The success of the newly emerging reta
il channels is still a 
work in process because none of them have really established a toehold in 
the U.S. But between the hard discounters, e
-
commerce, e
-
commerce of 
every kind, the pure play, the click
-
and
-
collect, the growth of dollar stores 
from a few y
ears ago, and of course, the brilliant growth of Walmart, all of 
this has caused the retail industry to go through a fairly significant change 
because we are overbuilt in grocery in the country, and all of these alternate 
channels are now beginning to chal
lenge all the square footage in the 
marketplace. So we are watching and waiting to see whether this disruption 
is just a low level of disruption that happens over many years or is this going 
to accelerate. It's something that we're watching.
 
The good news 
is that our DSD system reaches virtually any outlet that's out 
there. Whether it's convenience store, foodservice, whether it's the big 
supermarkets or the big hypermarkets, we reach every one of them. So we 
are watching the traffic through these outlets. 
We are watching what kinds 
of products are being sold, what are people buying through e
-
commerce and 
what are people buying through brick
-
and
-
mortar. And more importantly, 
we're looking to see whether brick
-
and
-
mortar stores are really becoming 
the warehou
se to pick for e
-
commerce, which breathes more life into them.
 
So, this is an evolving story, Vivien. And the outlook is not perfectly clear 
because the economics of many of these new digital channels is still being 
thought through. It's not perfectly clea
r that they're all going to make 
money.
 
Internationally, we have much the same phenomenon. China I think is the 
cutting edge of digital sales in the grocery channel. We are seeing Europe 
now grow in terms of e
-
commerce and the hard discounters taking a muc
h 
bigger presence there. And we're seeing the same thing in Latin America. So 
I think China and the U.S. are cutting edge in terms of retail disruption. 
We're going to have to watch and see how it evolves in the other markets. 
And our teams are all connect
ed globally and thinking through the best 
strategy for us to play in this new retail environment.

Good morning, Ali.
 
Ali Dibadj

Sanford C. 
Bernstein & Co. LLC
 
Hey, guys, so two questions on a couple things that don't make sense to me. 
The first one is just if we were to refocus on NAB here for a moment. And 
look, what looks like a change in the price rationality, at least in the data, 
despite
 
certainly what you're saying. And it isn't your first quarter of seeing 
this, so I think it's important because your stock has been weighed down by 
this concern in the investment community about price rationality in North 
America.
 
And look, for years you'
ve agreed with the idea that the price elasticity in 
the category suggests price rationality. But what we're seeing in the results, 
not just this quarter, for the past couple quarters, and then in Nielsen on 
NAB specifically is really suggesting that there
 
is lower rate, there's lower 
mix, and certainly lower marketing spend at least in the quarter, it looks like 
in that in NAB. And by the way, your volumes, your shares, and most 
probably your sales are not really responding. Meanwhile, your competitors 
are
 
taking 1.5% to 3% pricing or price/mix systematically and pretty 
logically.
 
So I want to give this opportunity to either clarify what I'm missing because 
we have broken out rate and mix, to your earlier point. And look, I believe 
that you're not going bac
k on what you said before about price rationality 
and taking prices up, but we'd really love your assurance and your clarity 
that we're going to see pricing up 

 
in line with competition I think is the 
language you used, but in line with the competition go
ing forward in NAB, 
because it's a very, very important thing obviously for your stock and for the 
industry. So I really want to delve into the disparity between what we're 
seeing in the data and what you're saying.
 
And the second thing, a really easy one 
but potentially disappointing one, is 
that it looks like you have $0.08 on the quarter and $0.15 on the year from 
Britvic and Jordan gains and other one
-
time things, and it looks like it's in 
your core. And if it is in your core number, I'd love an explana
tion of why 
one
-
time things like this remain in your core. And it looks like from a quarter 
perspective, that would suggest you're missing EPS, at least our numbers, 
and it suggests consensus. And your EPS growth for the year was only about 
5% excluding th
ose items. So again, there too, I would love some clarity 
and better understanding. Thanks.
 
Indra K. Nooyi

PepsiCo, Inc.
 
Hugh, do you want to take the question and I'll add to whatever you have to 
say?
 
Hugh F. Johnston 
-
 
PepsiCo, Inc.
 
Yes, happy to do th
at, Ali. Let me get the second one out of the way first. 
You're right about the gains. And where that money went was about $0.03 
on the 53rd week and lapping that, about $0.03 on investment back in 
ESSA, and about $0.04 or $0.05 of business disruption from
 
hurricanes and 
floods, all of which were one
-
time items, and they were all in Q4. So 
hopefully, that helps you tie that one out.
 
Regarding the question on pricing, as I mentioned earlier, our strategy has 
not changed. We were, I think in many ways, the au
thor for the industry of 
the strategy that the basis of competition is around innovation and brand 
building, and that pricing is something that we would expect to take 
consistently every year.
 
One point that that's a little bit hard to comb out of the data
, but it connects 
back to the marketing investments that we're making back behind the big 
brands, we are seeing promotional price points that are consistent between 
ourselves and our competitors and full revenue price points that are 
consistent between our
selves and our competitors. But our velocities on full 
revenue have been slower than some competitive velocities.
 
The reason for that, we believe, is because we do need to refocus back on 
A&M behind the big brands and ensuring that, as we build displays, t
he 
displays are very much reflective of those big brands as well in a substantive 
way, both in the shelf and out on the perimeter of the floor. We did start to 
do that in Q4. You'll see more of it in Q1 and even more of it in Q2. So, the 
strategy remains t
he same.
 
I think the full revenue velocity piece is something that probably warrants a 
little bit further analysis, but I think it captures some of the effect that 
you're seeing in the numbers. As I mentioned earlier, as you pointed 
January, the one other 
factor is, in any given four
-
week period, you are 
going to see promotion timing between competition being distortive, but the 
point they made earlier over the course of a couple of quarters, I think, is 
more driven by this whole rev promotional mix than it
 
is by us dropping 
prices further.
 
Indra K. Nooyi 
-
 
PepsiCo, Inc.
 
But the thing to remember, Ali, is when you're redoing the pricing 
architecture on certain products, it takes two to three quarters for it to play 
through the system. And second is, the good
 
news is the portfolio works. 
Any which way you look at it, if you look at 2015 and 2016, NAB performed 
very well. 2017, there was a confluence of factors that caused some issues. 
And 2018, we have a strong marketing program, and we're maniacally 
focused o
n the business. I just think the overall portfolio works, and that's 
the benefit of having international, North America, and snacks, beverages 
and the Quaker business. So, we are feeling good about our prospects.

Good morning. I was curious if you could talk a little bit
 
more about drivers 
of gross margin this quarter, down pretty in a fairly healthy way. I don't 
think we've talked much about that. And then part and parcel with that was 
anything more on channel mix. Hugh, you did comment a bit on e

commerce, but just curi
ous anything on foodservice or convenience channel 
trends that may or may not have been contributing to that gross margin 
performance. Thanks.

Hugh F. Johnston

Yeah. So, happy to do so, 
Lauren. I think if you look at overall PepsiCo gross 
margins, NAB is the big driver behind that for all the reasons that we've 
been talking about. It's a different way to sort of look at the financial 
performance of NAB. But given the deleverage in the sys
tem, that's affecting 
gross margins, as well as operating margins, obviously.
 
Regarding channel mix, some of the comments that I made earlier that we 
were talking about regarding c
-
store and velocities, in particular, it does 
have some impact in that chann
el. And as a result, as we invest more 
behind advertising and marketing, behind the big brands of Pepsi and 
Gatorade and Dew, I think you'll see improved performance from us in that 
channel, in particular.

Hey, good morning, everyone. In Q4, we saw the refranchising o
f the Thai 
business be enacted with Suntory. Similarly, we saw some more products 
and territories being handed over to Varun, your bottler in India. So, how 
should we think about these going forward, the strategy to continue 
refranchising more aggressively
 
internationally? And also, I mean has your 
position in the U.S. changed in regards to the franchise model?
 
Indra K. Nooyi 
-
 
PepsiCo, Inc.
 
Internationally, when we find a very good bottler and we believe that they 
can run the business better than us, we wi
ll refranchise the business, and 
that's what we did in Jordan, that's what we did in Thailand. And we look 
across our portfolio internationally to see where it makes sense. And I'd say 
internationally, we're pretty much refranchised in the bulk of the mark
ets or 
franchised, I should say, in bulk of the markets.
 
North America, we look at it constantly. We look to see the benefits of doing 
the refranchising again versus running it ourselves, and all the friction that 
results when you refranchise a business. A
nd right now, our belief is that we 
can run it better than going through the whole pain of refranchising and then 
living with all the friction. We don't believe that going back and forth from 
owning it, refranchising it, owning it again is a decision we ca
n make lightly. 
So, at this point, we are focused on extracting the productivity, driving the 
top line growth and making sure innovation sticks in the marketplace.
 
Again, let's not forget, 2015 and 2016 were very good years for North 
American Beverages. 20
17 was a year that we would have liked to have had 
better performance. And now we're going into 2018 with a strong marketing 
calendar. So, let's wait for the year to play out.

Thank you, good morning, so a couple of questions. One is just on your 
organic revenue growth guidance of at least 2.3%, which is in line with 2017 
growth rate. I 
guess it's somewhat of a disconnect from the improving 
macro outlook, some of the robust innovation pipeline that you've talked 
about. So, I'm wondering if this is really more related to the retail 
environment and sort of the pricing pressure that you see 
in these markets.
 
Or is there some conservatism around how the innovations are going to 
work out in 2018? And then a little bit of color just in terms of some of the 
improvement you're seeing in emerging markets, particularly around China 
and India, as wel
l as what you're expecting for Latin America.
 
Indra K. Nooyi 
-
 
PepsiCo, Inc.
 
Judy, it's a tough question to answer only because, clearly, we'd like to do 
better on top line growth, and that's what 

 
our innovation is geared to 
better performance, clearly I
 
think the macro is improving. But for all the 
positives we're seeing, as I mentioned in my script, there's a whole bunch of 
headwinds. Retail disruption is one of them. Consumer preferences are 
shifting in interesting ways.
 
On the one hand, there's a huge
 
push towards health and wellness. On the 
other hand, they want to go back to products they know the best, but 
they're not consuming it in the quantities that they used to consume it in the 
past. So, it's an interesting dichotomy there. We talk about reinv
esting back 
in the big brands, but a lot of the growth is coming from the small brands, 
so we have to launch those brands, too.
 
So, we are just making sure that any guidance we provide to you is sensible 
and something that we know for sure we can deliver. 
And that's why organic 
revenue growth at least in line with 2017 is a sensible guidance. Internally, 
we'd like to do more, but we want to be very, very cognizant of the 
headwinds around us, some of which we don't even understand at times 
because the consum
er is not consistent.
 
In terms of macroeconomics, we are seeing the Chinese market improve. 
Post the GST, we are seeing the India market coming back. And Latin 
America, I think in 2017 Q4 going into 2018, we are seeing most of the 
markets in Latin America 
improve, too. So, as we said earlier, we're seeing 
an improving global macroeconomic conditions prevailing across the world. I 
mean Europe is a standout example. Both East and West Europe, we're 
seeing really improving macros which helps the business.

Good morning. So, I wanted to go back to Indra's comment on the previous 
conference call about giving innovation the appropriate space, in particular 
in beverages. And I would layer with your comments today on the cadence 
of the quarters. Is it fair to assume that you're likely getting more shelves 
on better displays?
 
And Hugh 
mentioned also on the displays and some of the four initiatives 
that you had on the trade with the new launches, I read in the first quarter 
or, usually, I'm assuming you have some visibility because that's usually 
what the time that it rests in the U.S. A
nd from a promotional standpoint, 
are you expecting to lift some of the promotions we saw in the fourth 
quarter, so we can see a better operational EBIT margin division for the 
balance of the year for 2018?

I'll take parts of
 
the question and then, Hugh, you can take other parts of 
the question.
 
Hugh F. Johnston

PepsiCo, Inc.
 
Sure.
 
Indra K. Nooyi 
-
 
PepsiCo, Inc.
 
I think, Andrea, from our perspective, whether it's a classic Mountain Dew or 
a Pepsi or our core brands, through 
our DSD system, they go in and they 
have their space on the shelf. When we launched the right innovation for the 
marketplace, low
-
calorie Lemon Lemon or IZZE, they're all great tasting 
products and Lemon Lemon was voted the best new innovation for last yea
r.
 
But when it takes space away from the core brands, the velocity is much 
lower, and we are trading a higher velocity product for a low velocity 
product. So, one of the things that we have to go back and look at is, should 
we incubate some of those produc
ts in the new distribution system, let them 
reach a certain size before you put them in the main DSD system because, 
clearly, they need to be incubated in a different place in the store, especially 
in the single
-
serve channels. And that's what we're workin
g through. It's not 
that we are backing off the innovation. It's how we get that innovation to the 
market, especially if it's on 

 
not on our big brands.
 
Let me turn to products like Mountain Dew Ice which we launched as part of 
our Super Bowl launch. Grea
t tasting, lower
-
calorie Mountain Dew, tastes 
just like Mountain Dew, a lemon lemon Mountain Dew 

 
or a lemon Mountain 
Dew, I should say. We put it through the DSD system. It's a Mountain Dew. 
It's doing well. But that's a big brand. It's not a Lemon Lemon
, which was a 
new brand. So, we are trying to tweak this whole small brand innovation 
which will become big over time, but how do we incubate it in our 
distribution system and specifically where in the store should it go.
 
Should it go and take space from o
ur big brands, or should it have new 
incremental space? The good news is our relationships with the retailers are 
so strong that they know that we are maniacally focused on driving growth 
for them. So, they like to give us the space because we handle displ
ays and 
merchandising very well, and we make it easier for the retailers to do 
business with us.
 
Hugh, did you want to add anything on this?
 
Hugh F. Johnston 
-
 
PepsiCo, Inc.
 
I think you covered it well. The only thing that I would add briefly is, these 
are
 
not either/or types of questions. There is a bit of a balance between the 
two. And as we talked about our Q3, we may have gotten our balance a little 
bit off. And we're course correcting that balance. So, I expect that our big 
brands will get plenty of pr
esence, but that doesn't mean we're backing off 
on the innovations, particularly of the newer, smaller healthier brands 
because we know over time that those businesses are going to turn into 
good
-
sized businesses for us. They're just taking time to incubat
e.

Hey. I just want to 

 
I guess I want to revisit Judy's question on the top line 
growth guidance from a slightly different perspective. So, if we step back 
and look at fiscal 2017 and 2018 as a whole, just 
based on the results today 
and the outlook today, there's just obviously a significant amount of 
reinvestment that you've been making ahead of the implied base rate 
algorithm, which I know you addressed in your prepared remarks. So, a 
reinvestment of produ
ctivity wins, reinvestment of the extra week in 2017, 
effective reinvestment of one
-
time gains like Jordan and, obviously, tax 
reform.
 
And then despite that, as you acknowledged, we're not really seeing 
advantaged growth at the total company level. So I gu
ess the question is 
how do you or how should we think about the ROI on all these 
reinvestments? Is this just symptomatic of a higher cost of growth 
structurally as you work through changes at the retailer and consumer level, 
or are there reasons beyond mac
ro improvement to expect better results; 
i.e., acceleration in 2019 and beyond? Thanks.
 
Indra K. Nooyi 
-
 
PepsiCo, Inc.
 
Stephen, I think some of what you said is right because, as I said earlier, 
there are a whole bunch of puts and takes. There are headwind
s in the 
marketplace. There are tailwinds. And the investments we are making, think 
of them in two buckets. Some of the investments we have to make because 
the cost of business has gone up. Example is all the investments we make in 
food safety because of F
SMA, the investments we have to make in cyber 
security. You can never fully protect your system, but investments keep 
going up. Those are investments you make to protect the core business. And 
they don't result in increased top line, but they prevent major
 
accidents from 
happening. That's the whole hope. We keep making those investments 
because that's the nature of the business.
 
In terms of investments in innovation, advertising to drive the top line 
growth, our hope is that we get even more 
attractive top line growth 
because of those investments. Sometimes there are headwinds on the 
categories or headwinds on our businesses that dampen the growth. As I 
said to you in our prepared remarks, we would like that top line growth to be 
higher, and t
hat's what we are focused on. But when you have the consumer 
shifting to smaller brands, but doesn't stick with the smaller brands and then 
comes back to the big brands, our innovation starts to not yield the kinds of 
benefits that we're seeing.
 
So I think
 
we're going through a period of incredible disruption between 
consumer preferences, retail channel changes. And even our 2.3% should be 
at the high end of top line growth in our food and beverage space. Believe 
me, we are focused on increasing that growth
 
rate substantially. But at this 
point, given what we are seeing in the marketplace, I think it's prudent to 
count on that number because we're saying it's at least in line with 2017. I 
don't know if you want to add anything, Hugh.
 
Hugh F. Johnston 
-
 
Pepsi
Co, Inc.
 
Indra, the only thing I would add to that, Steve, is that if you take a 
multiyear look at this, generally speaking, our revenue growth has been 
reasonably in excess of our peer group. And I think that's reflective of 
getting returns on a lot of th
e investments we've made ex the investments 
that Indra mentioned that we need to make for defensive purposes, going all 
the way back to 2012 when we put a substantial investment in the business.
 
If you look at where we landed in 2017, most of our businesse
s are 
performing very well and the PepsiCo portfolio is performing very well. But 
our biggest revenue business had a challenging year, and that was clearly a 
drag on the growth rate. And it's going to take a few quarters to course
-
correct that. I think our
 
guidance is reflective of that. As Indra said, we view 
our guidance as what we're trying to hit or beat. We obviously know that 
investors rely on that guidance quite substantially, so we do try to make 
sure that we are highly confident in the guidance tha
t we give. But we surely 
don't view it as a cap, and that's certainly been evident over the last five 
years of performance.

spite of that, the fact that they put up those kinds of results I think is 
extraordinary. And clearly, markets like Brazil are coming out of economic 
depression. But we're seeing signs of improvement. So I look
 
at Latin

Good morning, a couple questions. Indra, you guys talked a lot about 
disruption at the retail space. How much of that disruption informed your 
decision to hold on to the 
bottling businesses in the U.S.?
 
Indra K. Nooyi 
-
 
PepsiCo, Inc.
 
Control of distribution is what I would say, not necessarily holding on to 
bottling system because that's really distribution. I think it's important that 
as retailers just disrupt themselves 
and you're going to see big changes, our 
distribution systems don't cause more angst for the retailer.
 
I'd say when the bottling system was not part of PepsiCo, the biggest friction 
in the system was having to negotiate with retailers with our bottler 
alig
nment. And any of our innovation, we couldn't get it to the marketplace 
because the bottlers had a different agenda. Now we are largely aligned, and 
that's why retailers give us such high marks, because when you talk to 
PepsiCo, you have an aligned system 
on snacks and beverages that serves 
the retailer very well. So with retail disruption, that control of distribution 
system becomes even more important.
 
But I want to tell you something. If we believe, if we believe, and we haven't 
come to that conclusion a
t all, if we ever believe that that distribution 
system is better in the hands of somebody else and they can do a better job 
than we do, we are a team that's maniacally focused on shareholder value 
creation. So believe me, we will make the right decisions.
 
But at this point, 
it's our belief that we can do a better job running the system. And as you 
see more innovation, more retail disruption, we cannot afford friction with 
the distribution system.

Hi. Good morning, everyone, Hugh, a question for you. Gross margins were 
weak again in this quarter, have been weak for the last several quarters. As

And now it's my pleasure to introduce Ramon Laguarta.
 
Ramon Laguarta
 
Thank you, Jamie. Good morning everyone. About two months ago, we 
shared wi
th you in some detail our priorities for the business and our 
financial goals for 2019. So today we're keeping our prepared comments 
short, just touching on the highlights for the quarter, and then we will leave 
enough time to get to all your questions.
 
I'
ll start by simply saying that we're very pleased with our results for the 
first quarter. Our rate of organic revenue growth accelerated to 5.2%, our 
highest rate of quarterly growth in more than three years.
 
This top line performance was broad based, with
 
particularly strong organic 
revenue growth at Frito
-
Lay North America, which grew 6% and our 
international divisions, while negatively affected on a quarterly basis by 
FOREX and refranchising, delivered organic revenue growth of 8% in ESSA 
and 10% in both
 
Latin America and AMENA.
 
We also had solid growth and continued progress at PepsiCo beverages 
North America where organic revenue was up 2.5% in the quarter. We 
invested as planned across our businesses and these included a double digit 
increase in advert
ising and marketing. And our productivity and 
restructuring actions were implemented according to plan.
 
Our strong performance in the quarter is emblematic of a number of key 
strengths in the business. Amongst then, the health and resilience of our 
categor
ies, our leading brands, a broad based portfolio capable of evolving 
to satisfy consumer thesis and while develop geographic footprints with 
some positions in our largest markets, suite of strong and relevant 
capabilities across the value chain, scale that
 
allow us to run our operations 
very efficiently. And of course, our highly engaged and motivated associates, 
we execute every day in a way that enables us to win in the marketplace.
 
So with strong start to the year and one quarter under our belt, we remai
n 
confident in achieving the 2019 financial goals we shared with you two 
months ago. Looking ahead, we're staying focused on the priorities we share 
with you in February. Namely, to accelerate our top line growth in a 
sustainable way, to compete more effec
tively to win in most of our markets 
and more rapidly evolve our capabilities to widen our advantages versus the 
competition.
 
To achieve these objectives, we're focused on becoming faster, stronger and 
better. We'll become faster by being more consumer cen
tric and accelerating 
investment for top line growth and winning in the marketplace. This means, 
broadening our portfolio and packaging formats to win locally, fortifying our 
North American business businesses by investing in Frito
-
Lay North America 
and Pe
psiCo Beverages North America, and accelerating our international 
expansion with a discipline focus on right to win markets.
 
We'll become stronger by transforming our capabilities and our culture. This 
means, driving savings through holistic cost managemen
t, to reinvest in the 
marketplace. Developing and scaling the core capabilities necessary to 
better understand and meet new consumer trends, strengthen our brands 
and improve customer service and building a differentiated organization, 
talent base and cult
ure.
 
And finally, we'll become better by integrating our purpose agenda into our 
business strategy with a particular focus on four critical initiatives.
 
First, advancing farming practices to optimize crop yields, protect human 
rights, improve farmer liveli
hoods and secure supplier; second, replenishing 
more water than we use in water stress areas; third, creating a circular 
economy for plastics and fourth, increasing the appeal of our products by 
reducing added sugars, sodium unsaturated fats and adding mor
e positive 
ingredients. The entire organization from the board to our frontline is 
moving forward with urgency and we look forward to updating you on our 
progress as the year progresses.
 
And now let me hand it off to Hugh.
 
Hugh Johnston
 
Thank you Ramon and
 
good morning everyone. I have just a few comments 
on the balance of your outlook.
 
As we mentioned in the release, we are reiterating each of the components 
of our 2019 guidance, namely, we continue to expect organic revenue 
growth of 4%, a core effective 
tax rate of approximately 21%, core constant 
currency EPS to decline approximately 1%, free cash flow of approximately 
$5 billion and total cash returned to shareholders of approximately $8 billion 
comprised of dividends of approximately $5 billion and sha
re repurchases of 
approximately $3 billion.
 
With both organic revenue growth and core constant currency EPS drop, 
higher in Q1 than in our full year targets, that implies the growth rate for the 
balance of the year will be below the Q1 growth rates. So let
 
me address 
how you should think about that starting with the top line.
 
First, the rate of organic revenue growth at FLNA inQ1 was extraordinary. 
We don't expect that rate of growth to continue for the balance of the year. 
And second, Q1 represented our ea
siest lap of the year, so balance of year 
laps will be more difficult, especially in the back half of the year.
 
From an EPS perspective, you should consider the following. One, in Q1 we 
had the benefit of lapping the onetime frontline bonus from 2018 and w
e 
also benefited from approximately $50 million of insurance recoveries in the 
current year. Two, over the balance of the year we will be lapping gains from 
various strategic asset sales, and we're franchising gains and insurance 
recoveries, most notably i
n Q2.
 
Three, our rate of net commodity inflation, which includes the impact of 
transactional foreign exchange, is expected to accelerate in the second 
quarter and finally, our pace of planned reinvestment will accelerate over the 
course of the year and you
 
will see this reflected both in core EPS, as well as 
in our operating margin performance.
 
Now we'll open it up for your questions. Operator, we'll take the first 
question.
 
Question

Answer Session
 
Operator
 
Thank you. [Operator 
Instructions] Our first question comes from a line of 
Lauren Lieberman of Barclays.
 
Lauren Lieberman
 
Thanks Good morning.
 
Ramon Laguarta
 
Good morning.
 
Lauren Lieberman
 
I was curious if we could talk a little bit about gross margins, obviously 
really solid 
in the quarter kind of as expected, but I was curious about one, 
in the near term PEM have next year let's call it thinking about commodity 
inflation environment, so on how you might expect that to progress and then 
also longer term as mixing the portfolio
 
evolves, I guess category mix within 
Beverages, price tier ins and I think you've talked about in emerging 
markets. How should we think about gross margins from a longer term 
perspective? Thanks.
 
Hugh Johnston
 
Yeah, happy too Lauren, it's Hugh. A couple o
f things, one, obviously, we 
don't give gross margin guidance. So I'll talk more conceptually then I will 
specifically to numbers. We were obviously pleased with gross margins in 
the first quarter. But as I just mentioned, we do expect to see more 
commodit
y inflation in the balance of the year and transactional for export 
pressure commodities as well. So I think in the first quarter we saw 
probably, I call it very strong gross margin performance, in the balance of 
the year, we'll see how it plays out based 
on how FX and commodities play 
out. Longer term, obviously, we're looking to increase gross margins over 
time and that's driven primarily by productivity in the cost of goods area.
 
Ramon Laguarta
 
Yeah, Lauren, there's a three capabilities we're working on 
to make sure we 
protect our gross margins long term expanded, one is net revenue 
management, key capability. Other one is innovation. And the other one is 
holistic cost management. So those three capabilities are the ones where 
we'll invest in and developi
ng the team to make sure that we protect gross 
margin long term.
 
Operator
 
Your next question comes from the line of Judy Hong of Goldman Sachs.
 
Judy Hong
 
Thank you. Good morning. So obviously, a pretty strong quarter from an 
organic revenue growth perspect
ive, particularly as you called out some of 
the international markets in ESSA and AMENA, maybe you can give us a 
little bit more color just in terms of what you've seen in category versus 
your market share in some of your key markets. And, Hugh, you commen
ted 
on sort of the strength in ESSA not repeating in the back half the year, so 
maybe a little bit more color, just why you don't think that that will be 
sustainable in the balance of the year. Thank you.
 
Ramon Laguarta
 
Hi Judy, this is Ramon. Yeah, we're 
very pleased with the growth in 
international and really the macros have been very, very positive, I would 
say, during the quarter. We haven't seen any major geopolitical or big 
evaluation in any of our markets. So with your comments on ESSA, we've 
been in
vesting in ESSA for many years now in building sustainable market 
place performance and that's coming across and most of our markets are 
gaining share both in beverages and snacks. Turkey has been the only 
country where we've seen some FOREX disruption and
 
the team is doing a 
great job going through that. The same in AMENA where we had a great 
Chinese New Year, very, very strong Chinese New Year, the team prepared 
very well and we're getting better at capturing that. That's big seasonal 
opportunity there in
 
that large market. So we're seeing very positive thing 
with Mexico. Mexico has had a great a great quarter gaining share 
consistently already for three quarters and continues to be a very solid 
performing business. So we've seen good macros and good perfo
rmance 
across most of our operations.
 
Hugh Johnston
 
Yeah and Judy, just to clarify, the only thing I'd add about the laps, my 
comment about the laps being tougher in the back half of the year are about 
the company laps, not just specifically about ESSA.
 
Op
erator
 
Your next question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane of Bank of 
America.
 
Bryan Spillane
 
Hey, good morning everyone.
 
Ramon Laguarta
 
Good morning.
 
Bryan Spillane
 
So I guess my question 
-
 
Ramon, I know it's early in the year, but you now 
have the a
bility to begin the kind of measure or assess the efficacy of the 
step up in marketing and advertising, especially in PBNA, so I guess can you 
give us some color on whether you think A, it's going to be enough and B, 
are you beginning to see the consumer r
esponse to lift from the investments 
that you're making?
 
Ramon Laguarta
 
Hi, Bryan, Yeah, of course, listen it's a third quarter of growth in NAB, so we 
feel good about the progress we're making in NAB. We feel good about our 
capital variance. First, I 
think we're really strengthening the brands. We feel 
very good about how Pepsi is performing. So yes, the investment in Pepsi 
and some of the portfolio innovation and especially packaging innovation is 
working very well in Pepsi. We're seeing an improvemen
t in Gatorade, the 
velocity of Gatorade is improving as well. I think we have some more work 
to do in Dew and we will be investing more in Dew during the year. So we 
feel good about that part of our investments. I think what we feel really 
good is of our i
nnovation; innovation is really working very well in North 
America Beverages. If you think about LIFEWTR, third year of growth, 
doubling velocities as we increase distribution, still the velocity is going is 
going very fast.
 
We're, feeling very good about 
Game Fuel, some of the innovation we have 
in the energy area. Gatorade Zero is going to be a big incremental 
opportunity for us. It's driving category growth and its driving share for 
Gatorade, so we feel good about our innovation and some of our brand 
inv
estments. The areas where we are still working on his execution on 
excellence and we made the new division structure that's going to help us a 
lot in terms of becoming a much more stronger local operator whilst keeping 
a very good customer service or large
 
national customer. So we keep 
investing in that area, but I will feel good about the velocity of the brands, 
as I mentioned, the innovation and we'll get better execution as we invest 
and take maximum benefit from the new organization.
 
Operator
 
Your next 
question comes from the line of Ali Dibadj of Bernstein.
 
Ali Dibadj
 
Hey, guys. So I actually have two questions. One is just a clarification on the 
one timers because as we add them up and understand last year about the 
transfer covers everything else, it 
seems like there's about $100 million 
swing from last year to this year in these one timers are about $0.05 a 
share. And I just want to make sure we're kind of getting to roughly the 
right number as you guys think about it. And that's probably for Hugh. An
d 
then the broader question is about the ROI and the nature reinvestments. 
Not because 5% organic sales growth isn't good, I mean, we thought you 
ran up to five, you ran it down to five, so that's all great. But it's really in 
North America driven more by 
price mix versus volume. So trying to 
understand the nature of the reinvestments that we would expect a little bit 
more, I guess volume driven or demand building type investments given the 
plans you laid out before for marketing et cetera. So those two que
stions 
would be really helpful please. Thank you.
 
Hugh Johnston
 
Hey, Ali its Hugh. I'll take the question around one timers, depending on 
what you characterize it as one time, I think that's about right $100 million 
swing. In addition to that, obviously, t
he tax rate was higher in the quarter 
this year, but I think $100 million swing is about right.
 
Ramon Laguarta
 
Yeah. And on the investment Ali, I think it's still pretty much your 
-
 
to get 
any good readings on the return on investment. However, we've seen,
 
as I 
said, velocity of the brands improving, we're seeing market share recovering 
in a lot of the segments. We're seeing the brand equity better. We're seeing 
some of our numerical distribution and customer service, KPIs improving, so 
we feel good about h
ow our investments in turn, turn it into positive 
operating numbers. And we feel good about the progress we're making.
 
Operator
 
Your next question comes from the line of Andrea Teixeira of JPMorgan.
 
Andrea Teixeira
 
Yeah, hi, thank you. So I wanted to just 
follow up on FLNA and volumes 
continue to be strong on a serious spec and running about 3% in pricing the 
same way. I was just wondering if you can give us comfort that you're 
seeing good quality on that growth and I think you called out in the queue 
on th
e big franchises I assume running at a very high pace. So if you can 
comment on how you're seeing the progress into the goal of this 5% and 
how sustainable you see it going forward.
 
Ramon Laguarta
 
Yeah. Good morning Andrea. The category and savories is per
forming very, 
very well in the US and I think it's a combination of our investments. 
Obviously, we have a big share of this category and some other players 
investing. We are obviously having a very good partnership with our 
customers building 
-
 
increasing 
the space of this category in the store. So 
it's a compounded impact of multiple factors that is driving the category. 
Within this category Frito
-
Lay is improving its share performance as well. So 
we've seen the doubled impact of that. You were referring t
o pricing. And 
we're getting better at net revenue management and how we're capturing 
the maximum pricing of every occasion and Frito has done a great job of 
managing their mix to obviously maximize revenue of the demand that there 
is in the market.
 
And th
en they've made some operational adjustments to some of the supply 
chain bottlenecks that we had in the past and we've been able to capture 
some of the seasonal opportunity, especially around Super Bowl I would say 
in a very, very impactful way together wi
th our Beverages business as well. 
So we had a very good Super Bowl, so you put it all together and the 
category is healthy. I think this category we're going to have strong 
tailwinds as consumers. We've talked this in the past; consumers go into 
more unst
ructured meals during the day. So I think we have tailwinds, plus 
our investments, I think are accelerating the performance of these 
categories. So we feel good about Frito. Obviously, also, we're working on 
productivity and make sure that the business con
tinues to generate 
efficiencies through invest; make sure that this model is sustainable long 
term.
 
Operator
 
Your next question comes from Bonnie Herzog of Wells Fargo.
 
Bonnie Herzog
 
All right, thank you, good morning. I wanted to ask about CSDs, there's a
 
fairly wide delta remaining between your share performance and that of your 
largest branded competitor, especially in the US. So could you guys update 
us on some of your initiatives in CSDs, specifically innovation which you 
didn't mention any plans that 
I heard? And then how successful has your 
stepped up spending been in that category specifically? And then finally, I 
guess I'd like to understand how big of a priority CSDs are relative to your 
other beverage categories in terms of the investment spend an
d allocation of 
resources. Thanks.
 
Ramon Laguarta
 
Okay, good. So of course CSD is a very critical category for us. And we 
talked about that we need to have a balanced growth between CSDs and 
then NCBs if we really want to make progress in this business. So
 
from that 
point of view it's clear that we're turning both segments of the market with a 
very clear intention of allocation of resources with CSDs taking a very 
important role for us. Within CSDs our first priority was Pepsi and we started 
investing in Pe
psi last year. The good news is that the Pepsi brand is gaining 
share of CSDs already. And pretty good growth compared to our Cola 
competitor. So we feel good about that large segment of CSDs. Now, as I 
said before, we're working on Dew. Dew is 
-
 
it's also
 
improving its 
performance in its core portfolio and we have some laps that are over as of 
March, so you will see an improvement in CSD share.
 
We continue to invest. Again you'll see, I didn't mention the innovation, 
there is innovation on dew brand. Game 
Fuel is one of the innovations in 
dew brand. We have other innovations coming up this summer that you 
guys will be able to see in the marketplace and you'll see some very strong 
activations of the brand coming up in the summer. So we feel good about 
Pepsi 
and it's a combination of brand, is a combination of 
-
 
non
-
sugar doing 
very well, mini
-
cans doing very well, so the portfolio transformation we've 
made as well is helping us to 
-
 
for Pepsi to outgrow the CSD market and now 
Dew is the next area of focus and
 
I'm confident we'll see performance 
improvement in the next quarters in Dew.
 
Operator
 
Your next question comes from the line of Vivien Azer of Cowen & Company.
 
Vivien Azer
 
Hi, thank you. Good morning.
 
Ramon Laguarta
 
Good morning.
 
Vivien Azer
 
So I was 
just hoping also to talk about Beverages and ask for an update on 
SodaStream, how that's going and any update on your thinking on the role 
that'll play in your broader beverage initiative. Thanks.
 
Ramon Laguarta
 
Yeah, I think we talked during the strategic
 
review. SodaStream is a long 
term strategic bet for ads and it's in multiple dimensions. One is we think 
consumers will be looking for customization of their beverages solutions at 
home and I think SodaStream, it is a very good tool to provide that to 
con
sumers. Obviously, we're going to innovate in improving the flavor 
experience and other options for consumers to really capture that need. 
Obviously, there is a sustainability angle to SodaStream and we think that 
we can provide consumers with very good be
verage experiences without 
packaging, without ways and that's I think a big plus for these effort [ph]. 
The performance is good; it's accelerated versus the past. We're not going 
to disclose specifics, but if you know the past performance of SodaStream, it
 
is accelerating. The penetration in most of the European countries, which is 
the number one KPI we're measuring, keeps increasing, the same in 
Canada, the same in the US, which are the largest markets for this business. 
So we feel good about the operation
al results and we feel good about the 
value that PepsiCo as a company is adding to SodaStream, especially in the 
areas of R&D and flavor innovation, customer relationships and some of the 
direct to consumer opportunities that this business has.

Yo
ur next question comes from the line of [indiscernible] of Credit Suisse.
 
Unidentified Analyst
 
Hey, everybody, good morning. Ramon presumably when you first started 
you developed a one year, three year, five year plan and such in, as we 
think about that, d
o we think about this year's investment spending as a bit 
of a one and done and the investment becomes part of the base and we're 
back to algorithm or do you think of it as this is the first full year we have 
some critical things to do and then next year t
here's a new set of initiatives 
that require further step up to hold momentum or maybe or maybe even 
something different.
 
Ramon Laguarta
 
No, when we talked in February we were quite clear I think on this is a year 
where we 
-
 
we are obviously taking some of
 
our internal monies and 
redirecting them that we needed some additional investments to make sure 
that we stepped up our performance in some areas. And also, we're starting 
to create some capabilities that will hopefully drive the sustained 
performance in 
the future. So we will remain with the same investment 
position as we said in February.
 
Hugh Johnston
 
And to add to that, and just to reiterate what Ramon was saying kind of, we 
talked about next year we will be back on long term algorithm so don't 
worry.
 
Operator
 
Your next question comes from the line of Caroline Levy of Macquarie.
 
Caroline Levy
 
Thanks very much, and good morning. I wonder if you could talk a little bit 
about the other categories in Beverages. They stepped up competition 
coming in 
coffee. We're just seeing a lot of new brands as well as the 
monster coffee business is doing pretty well and then needless to say energy 
and again some great new brands, but in Sports and Energy and almost a 
merging of those two categories. So if you coul
d talk about your approach to 
defending share in coffee and to growing against Energy and Sports against 
the newer players that would be really helpful.
 
Ramon Laguarta
 
Yeah, different market positions in different segments, right. So in Energy 
we're challe
ngers and our portfolio in Energy clearly innovates to move on to 
space as the current players are not playing. So we're addressing Energy 
from the coffee market, we're addressing Energy from energy, like Game 
Fuel with specific positioning within that nar
rower but probably more 
functional. And so we are challengers and we want to have that mentality of 
going after existing leaders in this category and trying to get market share 
from that segment. In the other two categories that you mentioned our 
critical 
role is to keep building the 
-
 
make sure that those categories remain 
very healthy and they keep growing above our LRB and that's what's 
happening with coffees and with sports drinks. They're both growing fast. 
Our biggest innovation in beverages is Gatora
de Zero, I think it's going to be 
a very good innovation, very incremental to the category and good for our 
for our show market.
 
We're investing big into Gatorade Zero and we're investing big into 
Gatorade. Of course Propel is doing very well and so we hav
e a broad based 
approach to the sports category and we see our velocity is improving. When 
it comes to coffee the same approach that we think our role is to continue to 
innovate in this category and make sure that we premiumize at the same 
time we value, w
e cover all the different spaces where the category can go 
and we see our Starbucks coffee partnership very strong and clearly growing 
above what is the average of our company, so very accretive. Some of these 
players are coming into our categories. Some o
f them they stay for a long 
time, some of them, they come in and then two years later they're not 
there. So our approach to these categories is sustained innovation, 
consumer insights to drive the category long term. keep investing; make 
sure that we keep 
driving the growth, the margin expansion of those 
categories long term.

Your next question comes from the line of Steve Powers of Deutsche Bank.
 
Steve Powers
 
Thanks and good morning. So Ramon you talked to the category about the 
importance of inve
sting among other areas in more impactful science and 
design led innovation and you've highlighted on this call just in response for 
last question some of the initiatives you have underway this year is related 
to beverages. But when you step back, how woul
d you assess the 2019 
innovation and new product pipeline globally, relative to what you hope to 
bring to market in 2020 or '21. And where might you say you see the most 
room for incremental improvement there.
 
Ramon Laguarta
 
Yeah, listen, as part of the ca
pabilities we're building is this one that you 
refer to, I think it's critical for us to continue to drive the growth of our 
categories, continue to create value for our customers in sustained way, 
right and that's where we are investing. We'll talk to you
 
in the probably in 
this summer about how we are looking at innovation. And from the 
capability point of view how we're segmenting different ways of innovate. I 
think it's very different how you do a local refresh innovation versus what 
are the big bets fo
r the company versus how do you do lift and adapt and lift 
and shift globally, which is a huge opportunity as you can imagine for a 
global company. So we'll talk more in the future, but in all of the capabilities 
that we're investing heavily and we're refu
rbishing money from other costs, 
lines of our P&L into capabilities, it is innovation and it is especially the 
different types of innovation that you were talking about. We feel good 
about 2019 from the innovation point of view, and then the fact that we'r
e 
growing 5.2%, it is a reflection of we're growing the core, but we're also 
adding some new segments that are very incremental to our top line and 
also to our categories and our customers who 

we want to position 
ourselves as a key growth contributor to o
ur customers through innovation, 
through category growth.

Your next question comes from the line of Robert Ottenstein of Evercore ISI.
 
Robert Ottenstein
 
Great, thank you very much. A few related questions on Frito
-
Lay North 
America. First, you 
mentioned that you expect the growth to slow as the 
year progresses. Is that purely a function of tougher comps? Second, can 
you talk about the impact of mix in the quarter both in terms of the pricing 
and volume? And third, I think it's mentioned in the 1
0
-
Q that you had 
double digit declines in Sentidos, if you could talk a little bit about what's 
going on there. Thank you very much.
 
Hugh Johnston
 
Yeah. Hey Robert, its Hugh, I'll handle that one. Some of the commentary I 
gave on Frito
-
Lay with performance
 
penalty year is driven by the laps as 
you've anticipated. In addition to that, we had a particularly good January as 
we had some tightening in areas of our supply chain, we address those 
issues, and we really had a very big Super Bowl, bigger than we've h
ad in 
previous years because we unlocked some areas of the supply chain. So I 
think that was a big driver for the quarter, obviously that's a onetime event. 
We don't see that repeating over the balance of the year because it was 
much more driven by January
 
challenges. Regarding mix in the quarter, it 
was quite positive. So we certainly feel good about where Frito
-
Lay mix is.

Amit Sharma
 
Hi, good morning, everyone.
 
Ramon L

Good morning.
 
Hugh Johnston
 
Good morning.
 
Amit Sharma
 
Ramon, you mentioned good macros in most of your markets during the 
quarter. Can you just outline for us, how do you see that evolving for the 
rest of the year? IMF recently cut down global grow
th out a little bit. Can 
you just talk about how you see that developing for the rest of the year as 
well please?
 
Ramon Laguarta
 
Yeah, happy to 
-
 
listen, we're seeing very good demand for our categories 
globally, right. So obviously, I mean, we sell snacks
 
and we sell beverages, 
so low price point product. So sometimes the big GDP fluctuations are driven 
by other components of the GDP and not so much consumption of our 
category. So the way we tend to look at our businesses is, is employment 
good, is wages a
nd salaries are they moving in the right direction. So we see 
that stay and we don't see any reasons why in the US or in some of our big 
markets they just change it. FOREX has a big impact to our P&L, especially 
in markets where we 
-
 
some of the supply cha
in comes from outside of the 
country. And so far FOREX has been good, it's been stable in the ruble, the 
Euro, the peso, Mexican peso, so some of our big markets, the FOREX has 
been good. So our estimates are that it's going to continue to be quite 
stable.
 
Having said that, there's always possibility obviously of geopolitical events or 
some others that might disrupt some of the demand, but at this point we 
feel good about the projections for macros for the balance of the year.

Your next question co
mes from the line of Bill Chappell of SunTrust.
 
Bill Chappell
 
Thanks Good morning. Just want to go back to North American Beverage 
and just try to understand your commentary. You said you're pleased with 
the kind of progress of CSDs in the quarter that Pep
si was kind of gaining 
share and pleased with the progress there, but really kind of two quarters 
removed or really one quarter removed from changing the strategy, 
reinvesting and kind of taking a step back. So trying to understand are 
things moving faster
 
than you expected? Was advertising have a bigger 
impact than you expected this quarter or are we still expect 
-
 
are there still 
a kind of a step change from here.
 
Ramon Laguarta
 
No, I think the teams are doing a great job and things are coming as 
planned,
 
right. So is a combination innovation, is a combination of good 
advertising, quantity of advertising, execution in stores and Pepsi has been 
the focus of our execution in stores, implementing the innovation and also 
improving the looks of the product. So 
things are coming as planned, as you 
said, three, quarters into this turnaround strategy and we're pleased with 
the results. I mean, growing above CSD category, I think is a very good 
output of the inputs that we put into this plan. We feel good about it.

Your next question comes from the line of Laurent Grandet of Guggenheim.
 
Laurent Grandet
 
Hey, good morning Ramon and Hugh. I like to focus my question on the 
profitability of your international segments those increased significantly. 
Could you 
give us more color on where the improvement is coming from and 
how sustainable that is in the coming quarters? Thank you.
 
Hugh Johnston
 
Yeah happy too Laurent, I mean, we saw profitability improvement across all 
three of the big segments. We did benefit to
 
some degree in both Russia and 
in Mexico from some insurance recoveries and we put all that in the end the 
disclosure so you can you can back those onetime items out. That said, we 
saw good solid fundamental operating profit performance improvement 
basica
lly across there, the big segments even ex those gains.

Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Grundy of Jeffries?
 
Kevin Grundy
 
Thanks. Good morning. This question I hope it just has housekeeping for 
Hugh, free cash flow conversion for th
e business longer term, understanding 
that you're ramping up some spending this year. What's the right free cash 
flow conversion and what period of time you think you can return to it? And 
then the strategic question for Ramon, I'm just trying to reconcile
 
some of 
your comments on sports drinks with what we're seeing in the scan data 
from a market share perspective with PepsiCo down

 
excuse me Gatorade 
down 360 basis points in the most recent four weeks and over the past year, 
down close to 400 basis points
. So when should we expect to see that get 
better? I'm sure that cannot be satisfying and then not we'd expect going 
forward? When should we expect to see some of those trends get better and 
is there anything tactically you need to do differently? Whether 
this is more 
advertising, your promo is down quite a bit, your competitors is up 
materially. So question is around Gatorade and anything you need to do 
tactically and when do share trends get better? Thank you.
 
Hugh Johnston
 
Why don't I handle the free cas
h flow question first? We don't get specific 
guidance on free cash flow. The one thing that we did comment on in the 
past just as a reminder is that we would see a step up in CapEx this year 
and lesser so in the next several years and we would expect over 
the course 
of four years. So for that to go back to something around 5%, so I as you 
model that out I think you'll get to a reasonable overall cash flow number, 
nothing else should be notably different relative to the historical projections 
on cash flow. I
t's just a step up in CapEx.
 
Ramon Laguarta
 
Yeah and with regards to Gatorade, we're investing in several areas. We're 
investing in improving our communication and the amount of advertising as 
you're saying, we're improving the packaging of the product. I 
think there is 
an opportunity to improve the packaging. And then most importantly, we're 
going after additional consumers and Gatorade Zero is a very strategic 
intentional innovation to go after consumers that had left Gatorade franchise 
because of the sug
ar levels up. People that still want that same efficacy 
when it comes to hydration, but want less sugar. From the early reads that 
we have on Gatorade Zero, it is performing as we intended in terms of 
expanding the category, capturing new consumers and dri
ving incoming 
challenges for the brand. So we're very hopeful that those three leavers will 
help us regain growth.
 
The fact of the matter is that we also have other brands play in that space, 
Propel is a great brand that we have in that space of sports hyd
ration with a 
different positioning that's growing very fast. And we'll come up with some 
other innovations. Obviously, I cannot disclose for competitive reasons, but 
there is new innovation coming up that hopefully will attack some spaces in 
the current s
ports overall category where we've probably got weaker. That's 
the way we're approaching. Yeah, this is a very important business for as it's 
part of our management conversations quite often and I think we will, as I'm 
saying we'll improve the performance 
of our sports set of brands and 
products in the in the coming quarters

Your next question comes from the line of Sean King of UBS.
 
Sean King
 
Hi, thanks guys. I guess now that you closed the CytoSport deal, how do 
you see the 
-
 
I guess, do you see 
any incremental channel or category 
innovation opportunities to build on that investment?
 
Hugh Johnston
 
All right. Yeah. Hey, Sean, this is Hugh. I think you'll see us now that we 
sort of have control of the brand there combined with the Gatorade Shakes 
bu
siness that we have, sort of craft a premium and mainstream approach to 
that business and they clearly appeal to different consumer segments. And 
we think by virtue of owning that business we'll be able to have more 
success with both of those brands. So mo
re to come on that, but that's sort 
of the broad thinking behind the move that we made.
 
Ramon Laguarta
 
Yeah, we think there is obviously, executional opportunities with these 
brands. But most importantly we think that this category is going to grow 
fast in
 
the coming years. And we want to make sure that we have full 
ownership of the full value chain so we can innovate both, as Hugh was 
saying, with multiple brands to make sure that we cover all these spaces, 
and more functional, more lifestyle, more premium
 
or value. So there's a lot 
of 
-
 
I think there's a lot of ways how we can help accelerate a category that 
has a lot of consumer tailwinds already. So it's a good strategic acquisition 
for us so that we make sure that we drive this category to its maximum.
 
Ramon Laguarta
 
Okay, so this is the last question. Thank you, all of you for your time and 
participation in this morning's call. To conclude, just a summary, we're 
pleased with our results for the first quarter. We're executing against our 
key priorities w
ith a very high sense of urgency. We remain on track to 
achieve our 2019 financial goals. And lastly, we thank you for your 
confidence that you've placed in PepsiCo with your investment. Thank you.

Investor Relations
 
Thank you. Joining me on the call today are Indra Nooyi, PepsiCo's 
Chairman 
and CEO; and Hugh Johnston, PepsiCo's Vice Chairman and CFO. We'll lead 
off with prepared comments and then we'll turn to Q&A. And recognizing it's 
a busy earnings day, we'll end the call at about 8:45.
 
As we begin the call, it's important to note
 
the following. We will make 
forward
-
looking statements on this call. Any forward
-
looking statement 
inherently involves risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to 
differ materially from the current predictions and expectations. Information 
on such risks can be found in today's earnings release and our most recent 
Form 10
-
K and subsequent SEC filings. In addition, we will discuss results 
using non
-
GAAP measures. You can find GAAP to non
-
GAAP reconciliations 
on our website in the Investors sec
tion under the Events and Presentations 
tab.
 
As we discuss today's results, keep in mind that our fourth quarter 
comprises the 16 weeks ended December 26 for our North American 
operations and the months of September through December for most of our 
operati
ons outside North America.
 
And now, it's my pleasure to introduce Indra Nooyi.

Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
Thank you, Jamie, and good morning, everyone. And if I sound funny this 
morning, it's because I'm nursing a very bad cold. I'
m pleased to announce 
that PepsiCo has delivered to shareholders a terrific year in 2015, with 
strong organic revenue growth and 10% core constant currency EPS growth. 
We simultaneously enhanced our competitiveness and prospects for future 
growth, while me
eting or exceeding each of the 2015 financial goals that we 
shared with you this time last year.
 
From a strategic perspective, we held or gained market share across most of 
our key markets. We built the strength of our brands, evidenced by both our 
strong 
organic top
-
line growth and 40 basis point increase in A&M as a 
percentage of sales. We continued to extend our innovation advantage, 
growing new platforms such as MTN DEW Kickstart, Stacy's Pita snacks and 
Inner Smile dairy drinks in China, and simultaneo
usly invested for the future 
by increasing our R&D spending.
 
We continued to win in foodservice by adding Disney in China, SUBWAY 
across several countries and renewing Yum! in China, due primarily to our 
broad product portfolio and superior customer servic
e. And we enhanced our 
offerings to our foodservice partners in 2015 through the establishment of 
exciting new platforms like Stubborn Soda, MTN DEW BLACK LABEL and 
Hello Goodness vending. We added major new marketing properties with the 
NBA and the UEFA C
hampions League. And we expect to derive value from 
them through our rapidly
-
expanding global marketing and design 
capabilities. And we delivered a record
-
setting year for productivity as our 
outstanding operating teams leveraged our global supply chain Ce
nter of 
Excellence to execute best practices and new ideas with great precision 
across all of our businesses.
 
While delivering strong strategic results, we delivered financially. We 
targeted mid
-
single
-
digit organic revenue growth and delivered 5% growth. 
We targeted core operating margin expansion and delivered a 30 basis point 
improvement. We delivered 10% core constant currency EPS growth against 
our initial target of 7% and converted 120% of core net income to free cash 
flow, excluding certain items, th
rough strong capital management. This 
strong cash generation enabled us to provide attractive cash returns to our 
shareholders, a total of $9 billion in 2015. And our core net return on 
invested capital stands at 19.6% at the end of 2015, up 430 basis poin
ts 
over the past three years.
 
I am particularly pleased to note that we achieved these results in the face 
of a challenging macro and external environment. Over my several decades 
in business, I have never seen this combination of sustained headwinds 
acros
s most economies, combined with high volatility across global financial 
markets. From my meetings and observations traveling around the world, I 
have noted slow economic growth or recession across all but the U.S. 

 
across the U.S. and a few other countrie
s, as a combination of geopolitics 
and oil have created many challenging economic outcomes.
 
The slower economic growth has resulted in lower demand for commodities, 
which has put extreme pressure on previously
-
booming economies like 
Russia, Canada and Braz
il, just to name a few. In order to address slowing 
demand, central banks have few tools to kick
-
start their economies, as these 
tools have largely been fully exploited over the past several years. In 
addition, increased government regulation, including in
creased taxation, 
labeling requirements and limitations on social programs, are placing further 
pressure on consumer demand.
 
These macro issues have created three broad risks for the consumer and for 
CPG companies. First, the widespread economic malaise ha
s created a 
strong U.S. dollar, which has the effect of creating local inflation in 
international markets and threatens to derail the U.S. economic recovery. 
Second, volatile financial markets may cause a pullback in corporate 
investment and consumer spend
ing. And finally, the continued weak 
economic performance is causing widespread political and social turmoil 
across the globe, which may create even greater economic harm.
 
In the face of these challenges, our geographic sectors managed very well 
during 201
5, exploiting the more positive environments for superior results, 
while carefully navigating weak environments to balance tight cost 
management with judicious investment to surgically capture growth.
 
In a relatively positive macro environment, our perform
ance in North 
America was particularly strong, with both Frito
-
Lay North America and 
North American Beverages turning in very good operating and financial 
performances. Each posted 3% organic revenue growth and 7% core 
constant currency operating profit gr
owth for the year.
 
Frito
-
Lay North America once again delivered consistent results, while 
continuing to transform its package architecture in potato chips and its go
-
to
-
market system through further expansion of the GES program.
 
North American Beverages ha
d its best financial performance in recent 
memory, benefiting from the continuation of improved industry pricing 
dynamics, a broad product portfolio and continued positive innovation 
performance.
 
And Quaker Foods North America began a turnaround in 2015, d
elivering 
positive organic revenue results for the first time in several years and 
gaining value share across its breakfast categories of hot and ready
-
to
-
eat 
cereal and Aunt Jemima syrup and mix. And I'm pleased to report that 
PepsiCo once again was the s
ingle largest contributor to U.S. retail food and 
beverage growth for our customers. For the full year, we provided more 
growth in U.S. retail sales than the next 15 largest food and beverage 
manufacturers combined. And it's this success that uniquely posi
tions us as 
our customers' go
-
to partner to drive growth.
 
When we look beyond North America, our international divisions clearly dealt 
with the lion's share of the macro challenges that I mentioned earlier. And 
yet despite these challenges, we were able to
 
grow organic revenue 8% and 
core constant currency operating profit 6% for the year by executing 
effective pricing strategies, launching exciting innovative products, localizing 
sourcing to address FX transaction headwinds and driving productivity that 
pr
ovided investment funding that will propel future growth.
 
So overall, a very good performance for the year and we believe we are 
well
-
positioned as we enter 2016.
 
Now, you may recall that we focused on one of our big performance
-
driving 
initiatives on each
 
of the last three earnings calls. On our prior calls, we 
covered innovation supported by sensible brand management, then we 
talked about flawless execution. And last time, we talked about self
-
sustaining productivity. Today I want to focus on the fourth o
f these 
initiatives, cash generation and food and capital allocation.
 
Now, a substantial portion of our earnings converts to free cash flow and we 
generate a lot of cash. In fact, over the past three years, we've converted 
more than 100% of our core earnin
gs to free cash flow and we generated 
more than $24 billion in free cash flow, excluding certain items, including $8 
billion generated in 2015 alone. More broadly, we are highly disciplined in 
how we allocate this cash, with a particular focus on returning
 
cash to 
shareholders.
 
Our first capital allocation priority is to invest in the business, not only in the 
form of CapEx and working capital, but also within the P&L, in A&M, R&D and 
marketplace investment in routes and racks. In fact, since 2011, we've 
in
creased A&M as a percentage of sales by 110 basis points and R&D 
spending is up 40%.
 
We have rigorous capital planning and review processes. Our CapEx 
investments have very attractive returns on investment. And we continually 
find ways to drive returns eve
n higher by driving greater fixed asset 
utilization and by reducing the cost of adding capacity. Over the past four 
years, we have reduced CapEx as a percentage of sales to 4.4% on a rolling 
four quarter basis, which is an improvement of 60 basis points. O
n a 
revenue base of $63 billion, this equates to an annual cash savings of 
approximately $380 million.
 
Similarly, our efforts to improve our working capital have yielded positive 
results. Over the past three years, we have improved our working capital 
cash
 
conversion cycle by more than 30 days, which contributed $2.5 billion 
to cash flow improvement. So both our CapEx and working capital 
productivity have been significant contributors to our very favorable free 
cash flow performance.
 
Our second priority is 
to pay dividends to our shareholders. We have raised 
our dividend for 44 consecutive years, effective with the June 2016 
payment. And this is through both consistent earnings growth and by raising 
our payout ratio over time. With this morning's announced d
ividend 
increase, we expect to pay out approximately 60% of our core 2015 
earnings. And our dividend yield at yesterday's closing stock price is an 
attractive 3%. And our ten
-
year compound annual growth in dividend per 
share is 10%. Continuity of dividends
 
and growth in annual dividend per 
share are a point of great pride for PepsiCo and we view them as a vitally 
important element to the total shareholder return equation.
 
Our third priority is to strengthen our market positions and create value 
through responsible tuck
-
in acquisitions, generally less than $500 million a 
year in total, which equates to a relatively small percentage of annual free 
cash flow. We've built a lot of capability in evaluating and integrating tuck
-
in 
acquisitions. And we 
have very disciplined strategic and financial guidelines 
to ensure that they are value creating. Our acquisition evaluation is 
comprehensive and includes assessment of geographic considerations, 
category growth and attractiveness, scalability, competitive 
dynamics, 
people and business systems, integration, cultural fit and transaction 
complexity.
 
And our fourth capital allocation priority is to return residual cash to our 
shareholders through share repurchases, and we plan to do so within the 
confines of ma
intaining a capital structure that provides us ready access to 
the debt capital markets at attractive rates. Over the past three and 10 
years, we returned more than $13 billion and $35 billion, respectively, to 
shareholders in the form of share repurchases
. Net, our focus on capital 
allocation discipline has yielded impressive results. We've returned more 
than $65 billion to shareholders over the past 10 years in combined 
dividends and share repurchases.
 
Before Hugh covers guidance in detail, I'll just make
 
a few broader points 
about the landscape going forward. We expect a continuation of the many 
macro challenges we face this year: a strong U.S. dollar; sluggish growth or 
recession in most developing and emerging markets; political and social 
unrest in a n
umber of regions; and increased government regulation.
 
And, as I mentioned, while the U.S. economy is experiencing a recovery, it's 
delicate. And there is a risk that it will not sustain itself if the rest of the 
globe continues to experience such massive 
pressures. But even in the face 
of this rather challenging global landscape, I'm optimistic about PepsiCo's 
future. We have made a prudent appraisal of those factors outside of our 
control and we are controlling those factors we can control.
 
Our teams arou
nd the globe are executing well. Our innovation pipeline is 
full and promising. And the sustained investments we've made in 
strengthening marketing and developing cutting
-
edge capabilities will serve 
us well as we move through the year.
 
We believe we have 
the plans in place for 2016 to continue to deliver strong 
financial results. And there is something that's equally important as the right 
plans. We have the right people. The fact that we've achieved so much in 
what has been a protracted and extremely chal
lenging and volatile 
environment, is a testament to the strength and experience of our 
management team. We benefit greatly from a senior management team 
distinguished by continuity, experience and skill. Our sector heads and CFO, 
Al, Tom, Laxman, Ramon, Sa
njeev and Hugh, have 140 years of combined 
PepsiCo experience across multiple categories, markets and functions. And 
at the same time, we are developing and advancing PepsiCo's next 
generation of leadership.
 
The appointments over just the past 24 months of
 
Laxman and Ramon to 
their respective sector leadership roles and the appointments of Brian 
Newman to run Global Operations and Eugene Willemsen to run our global 
category groups are a few key examples of such next
-
generation leaders 
who have gained tremen
dous experience already and have much runway 
ahead of them at PepsiCo.
 
So with these comments, let me turn the call over to Hugh. Hugh?
 
Hugh F. Johnston 
-
 
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer
 
Great, and good morning, everyone. Moving on to our outlook f
or 2016, as 
we set out in the release, we expect organic revenue growth of 
approximately 4%, with the top
-
line continuing to benefit from the 
investments we've made in our brands and innovation, as well as our 
revenue management capabilities, driving organ
ic revenue growth and 
positive net price realization. And taking our core 2015 EPS of $4.57 and 
applying our guidance and current foreign exchange market consensus 
rates, implies a 2016 core EPS of approximately $4.66.
 
Let me touch on the key consideration
s and assumptions embedded in our 
outlook. First, we will have a 53rd week in 2016, as we do every five or six 
years, which principally impacts our North American businesses, given that 
our international businesses report on a monthly calendar. Our organic
 
revenue growth outlook excludes the impact of this extra week. And our 
intention is to reinvest the benefit from the extra week in growth and 
productivity initiatives.
 
Second, we will be lapping the deconsolidation of our Venezuela business, 
which occurre
d at the end of Q3 in 2015. Venezuela contributed 
approximately $0.10 per share to core earnings in the first three quarters of 
2015. And third, foreign exchange translation will continue to be a 
headwind, with most of our key international markets' curren
cies expected 
to decline versus the U.S. dollar in 2016. Based on current foreign exchange 
market consensus rates, this is expected to be a four point drag on both net 
revenue and core EPS.
 
Additionally, to the positive, we expect to generate approximately
 
$1 billion 
of productivity savings in 2016, which is in line with our overall objective of 
achieving $5 billion of productivity over the five years through 2019. We 
anticipate continued reduction in corporate expenses, and we expect our 
share count to ben
efit from a targeted $3 billion in share repurchases.
 
In terms of headwinds, we anticipate continued volatile macros, especially in 
the developing and emerging markets. And commodity inflation is 
deflationary in the low single digits, excluding foreign exc
hange, and low 
single digit inflationary, including the impact of transaction
-
related foreign 
exchange in many of the markets whose currencies have and are expected 
to continue to weaken against the U.S. dollar. Also, keep in mind that 
because of our forwa
rd buying approach, our commodity costs tend to lag 
what you see in the spot markets.
 
As you model out the quarters, we ask you to consider the following. We 
deconsolidated our Venezuela operations at the end of Q3 in 2015, so our 
EPS comparisons will be i
mpacted by lapping the elimination of earnings 
from Venezuela during the first three quarters of 2016.
 
The AMENA division will face a difficult operating profit comparison during Q1 
2016, as the business laps a gain related to re
-
franchising a portion of I
ndia 
bottling operations, and the benefit of the 53rd week will fall in the fourth 
quarter of the year, while our reinvestment of the benefit of the 53rd week 
will be made throughout the year.
 
We will maintain a high level of discipline toward capital allo
cation, with the 
vast majority of free cash flow after capital spending being returned to 
shareholders in the form of dividends and buybacks. We expect to return $4 
billion in cash to shareholders through dividends, and we expect to return an 
additional $3
 
billion in cash to shareholders through share repurchases.
 
So combined, we expect these actions will result in cash returns to 
shareholders of $7 billion in 2016. Capital allocation is a top priority for our 
management and our board, and we trust these ac
tions will again be seen 
by shareholders as tangible evidence of this commitment.
 
With that, we are ready to take the first question.

Thank you. Our firs

So 
first, can you give us your organic sales growth in emerging markets in 
Q4? And as we look out to 2016, Indra, it sounded like you were very 
cautious on the macro environment, so any impact in terms of macros on 
your business in emerging markets in Q4, if 
you could provide some more 
detail there and also, so far, what you're seeing in Q1, given we're well into 
the quarter, and any thoughts just in general on the level of risk and your 
visibility on the 4% organic sales growth guidance. And then also, on the
 
macro side, can you just review trends in gas and convenience in the U.S. in 
both snacks and beverages and your thoughts on consumer spending in that 
channel for 2016? Thanks.
 
Indra K. Nooyi 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
So let me start with the ma
cro numbers. Go ahead.
 
Hugh F. Johnston 
-
 
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer
 
Yeah, Dara, this is Hugh. To answer your question on developing and 
emerging markets, the growth rate would've been about 6% for the quarter.
 
Indra K. Nooyi 
-
 
Chairman & Chie
f Executive Officer
 
So, Dara, let me talk about the world and what we're seeing around the 
world. And it's not just emerging markets. We travel around the world, and 
let me just take a quick walk around the world. As you look at Latin America, 
Brazil, Arge
ntina, if you look at Colombia, between a combination of the 
economic issues in the country and the currency devaluation, it's causing 
tremendous strain on anybody who is operating in that country, leave alone 
American companies have to report in U.S. doll
ars because you have both a 
transaction and a translation problem to deal with. Transaction because a lot 
of the commodities we buy are denominated in dollars, so we have to figure 
out how to price that through.
 
If you go over to Europe, the Western Europe
an market, I would say, did 
show some signs of recovery, but not to the level that we would like to see 
it. Interestingly, our businesses in East Europe are doing well with respect to 
the local market, but again the currency is really taking a bite out of 
the 
profit streams that come out of that market.
 
I was in the Middle East about three weeks ago. The teams there are very 
resilient, but they have to cope every day with the issues in the Middle East, 
whether it's countries going through attacks or the ref
ugee crisis. It is pretty 
severe what's going on there. And many routes have to get off the market at 
times. And our teams are all local, so they figure out a way to operate, but it 
is tough. And I think we are one of the few companies that keeps an 
operat
ion going because the routes can come on quickly when there's a lull 
in the activity there. So I would say it's difficult to watch that region going 
through the problems it's going through.
 
And as you move further east, India's holding up. The Pacific Rim 
is holding 
up nicely, don't see too many issues. And China, going into the Chinese New 
Year, last year, I think the market was very sluggish, but this year it started 
off moderately okay. And if you ask me about how the year has started off, 
look, one peri
od or one month a year does not make, but the year has 
started off okay.
 
And again, I want to be very clear. What we can control, we are doing very 
well: execution; productivity; innovation now on the shelf. We are doing a 
very good job. And that's giving 
us some tailwinds. What we cannot control, 
which is the geopolitical issues, this incredible currency turmoil, we just have 
to accept it for the moment. And so I'd say the teams are executing very 
well in the marketplace. And that's why we feel cautiously 
optimistic, on the 
one hand, while feeling despondent about the macros on the other hand.
 
As far as the convenience store is concerned, in the past, we used to say 
when gas prices came down, there used to be a perceptible increase in 
convenience store traf
fic. Yes, we did see an increase in convenience store 
traffic and convenience stores were up, what, 6%, Hugh?
 
Hugh F. Johnston 
-
 
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer
 
About 6%, yeah.
 
Indra K. Nooyi 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
About 6%. But you k
now, I think that game has played out. Now, it's going 
to be how much innovation you put on the shelves and how you execute. 
And this is where again our DSD systems, our Power of One, and the fact 
that we have the right products for the convenience stores 
is going to stand 
us in great stead.

Ali Dibadj

Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC
 
How are you? Hopefully, you'll fe
el better soon. So I wanted to get a better 
sense of your 2015 to 2016 EPS bridge, because if you're still actually 
getting this $1 billion of cost savings, you're buying back kind of this $3 
billion similar level of stock purchase, that, together, would b
e kind of 11% 
or 12% EPS growth. And ex
-
Venezuela, ex
-
currencies, you're only saying 
you're going to get something like 8%. And I'm having trouble figuring out 
what that gap is. It makes me feel that all else equal, so if you're not cutting 
costs, you're n
ot doing anything, the core business is actually shrinking, 
which clearly can't be with a 4% top
-
line growth number organically for next 
year. So I'm just trying to figure out the bridge, if you can, more 
quantitatively between 2015 and 2016 than what you'
ve already offered, 
particularly on the core piece, please.
 
Indra K. Nooyi 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
Absolutely, Ali. Let me toss this to Hugh, who'll give you a complete answer 
on this.
 
Hugh F. Johnston 
-
 
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer
 
Sure, happy to. Good morning, Ali. If you add up the numbers, you're right. 
Revenue growth, as we've said, is to be about 4%. Productivity will be about 
a $1 billion benefit. Commodities, of course, are inflationary, low single 
digits. The other factors b
uilt into our numbers are number one, we will see 
operating expense inflation. Recall, our bucket of OpEx is about $28 billion. 
A little over half of that is labor, and labor will inflate somewhere around 4% 
for the year. In addition to that, you'll see co
ntinued investments in 
advertising and marketing, as you have over the last couple of years. And 
the reason we continue to invest in that is we continue to get good returns 
on it, hence the 4% to 5% revenue growth you've seen over the last couple 
of years.
 
You will see higher investment in research and development as well, same 
answer on that. We're continuing to see good returns on that. And then, of 
course, with the revenue growth that we've seen over the last couple of 
years, we do need to invest in manu
facturing lines. We need to invest in 
routes. We need to invest in racks to place the products on. So when you 
add all of those factors up and then add into that geographic mix, which is a 
slight drag, you wind up with a total of 8% on earnings per share g
rowth.

Your next question comes from the line of John Faucher of JPMorgan.
 
Indra K. Nooyi 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
Morning, John.
 
John A. Faucher 
-
 
JPMorgan Securities LLC
 
Good morning, Indra. Wanted to talk a little bit about sort 
of the longer
-
term 
outlook for the pricing environment; and so it makes sense, given all the 
inflationary pressures that we're seeing in terms of pricing in emerging 
markets, I guess the question really becomes can you sustain pricing in 
developed markets,
 
particularly given 

 
I know your raw materials are up 
slightly, but there are some deflationary raw materials. And there seems to 
be some concern about downward pressure on pricing maybe in the U.S. So 
as we look at the 2015 results, low single
-
digit volu
me, a little bit more 
pricing, do you see that changing over time? And can you continue to get 
the pricing in developed markets that would allow you to sort of sustain that 
sort of, let's say, 3% to 4% pricing number going forward? Thanks.
 
Indra K. Nooyi 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
John, that's a great question because we talk about that and worry about 
that all the time. I think there are two or three things to think about. One is 
in categories which are not growing robustly, like carbonated soft 
drinks, 
there you should manage pricing very carefully because there's no point 
trying to drop the pricing, because it's not going to drive additional demand. 
So in that particular category, through a combination of revenue 
management, through a combinatio
n of intelligent price pack architecture, 
you just figure out how to get some pricing from the marketplace. So let's 
hold that on the side.
 
Second, the area where we really look for pricing is through innovation. 
Because if there's one place where the cons
umer likes the news and is 
willing to pay up for, it's for innovation. And we've been really ramping up 
our innovation machine to be able to get price realization through 
innovation.
 
The third is through channel mix. And if you sell more single
-
serve, if y
ou 
sell to the channels where the consumer is willing to pay a little bit more, 
that clearly is a help.
 
And lastly, even if you don't get the pricing in some places, we want to take 
our costs down. So we've been looking at how to reengineer our supply 
chai
n end
-
to
-
end, how to work with customers to re
-
think our supply chain. 
So there's a lot of work going on in our company in terms of rethinking our 
end
-
to
-
end costs to align our supply chains with customers, so we can 
mutually take out costs and then figure
 
out a way to pass some of it to the 
consumer. So that's really our strategy on pricing.

Your next question comes from the line of Steve Powers of UBS Investment.
 
Stephen R. Powers 
-
 
UBS Securities LLC
 
Hi. Thanks. Good morning. So, on the marketin
g step
-
up, which you 
obviously increased a lot this year and in the fourth quarter especially, can 
you talk a little bit more about where that investment is focused? Is it 
broad
-
based? Is it more food versus beverages, domestic versus 
international? Any sk
ew would be helpful. And then more broadly, I'm just 
wondering if there's anything you're seeing out there that gives you more 
confidence on the margin in that spending, because I'm struck now by how 
many CPG companies that have emphasized a return to A&P 
investment in 
the last few weeks. But it's interesting against the backdrop 

 
the macro 
backdrop, as you pointed out, is not getting easier. So is the increase that 
you're making, is it PepsiCo
-
specific against proactive opportunities? Is it 
against things
 
that may be sort of deceptively encouraging for the broader 
industry? Or is any of your increase simply driven by a need to kind of keep 
pace and maintain share of voice versus peers that are also stepping up 
their investments? Any clarity there would be 
helpful. Thank you.
 
Indra K. Nooyi

Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
Hugh, why don't you talk to the where we're putting the money and then I'll 
talk about the rest here.
 
Hugh F. Johnston 
-
 
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer
 
Sure, happy to. A coupl
e of comments on that, Steve, number one, it is 
broad
-
based. I wouldn't say it's targeted to any particular business or any 
particular geography. As we cut across snacks and beverages, numbers went 
up in both categories. As we cut across the geographies, a
ll of our 
geographies saw an increase in advertising and marketing spend.
 
Number two, in terms of where is the money going, I would say that more of 
it is going to digital over time. The big constraint on moving more to digital 
is identifying high
-
quality 
properties to advertise on. So it's not just a matter 
of going for pop
-
up ads anymore. It's really more sophisticated digital 
advertising. And that is probably 

 
more than anything, the rate
-
limiting 
factor is finding high
-
quality assets to invest in.
 
Thir
d, as you've seen as recently as the Super Bowl this past weekend, we 
are investing in big properties, because these big properties do enable 
breakthrough types of messaging. And I think we, over the last several 
years, as well as for a longer period of ti
me, have been quite successful in 
investing in those big properties.
 
And then fourth, from a returns perspective, obviously, measuring 
advertising and a marketing return is a little bit trickier than measuring 
return on price reductions and things like tha
t. That said, with the advent of 
big data, we actually are getting more sophisticated in terms of our ability to 
measure those returns. Without getting into all of the details of it, the things 
I'd point to on a macro level are, we've been able to sustain 
4% to 5% 
revenue growth in what's been a challenging environment.
 
So when you add all of it up, we'll continue to invest more in advertising and 
marketing as we see good payback on it. As a management team, we are 
acutely focused on shareholder value creat
ion as the meta
-
metric for all that 
we do around here. And advertising and marketing is giving us good 
payback for the shareholders.

On what detail you can provide on Frito. I think Gatorade benefited in 2015 
from three factors. One is, it was a hot year, and it was hotter for a longer 
period of time. And Gatorade does well when the temperature is above 
nor
mal, especially for as long as it was during the year. So we shouldn't 
underestimate the impact of that.
 
Second is, the Gatorade innovation has been very good. Fierce and Frost 
alone, I think, contributed significantly to sales growth. And all the new stuf
f 
that Gatorade is doing with the smart bottle, with the pods that are tailored 
for the athlete, the Gatorade Prime and Recover, all of that is giving more 
legitimacy to the brand. And I think that it's driving more of the Gatorade 
sales.
 
And third, I thin
k on a competitive basis, relatively speaking, the fact that so 
many athletes are choosing Gatorade now is allowing Gatorade to far 
outdistance any emerging competitors in the space who tried to attack 
Gatorade just on price. And Gatorade has managed to ho
ld its own and, in 
fact, extend its advantage. And so a combination of these three have served 
us well.
 
Going into 2016, I think we'll keep the pedal to the metal on innovation, on 
execution and hope that the weather holds up. That's the best we can do. So
 
Frito, Hugh?

Yeah, so from a Frito perspective, Bill, I assume your question is around the 
potato chip promotional package, moving from the XXL to the XL bag. That 
probably cost us from a volume p
erspective about a point. Recall, that the 
reason for the strategy, as we talked during last year, was to increase 
household penetration with smaller household sizes. The objective was to 
get a package that smaller households would find attractive as the p
rimary 
promotional package. In that regard, the strategy has actually been quite 
successful and I think gotten our volume re
-
based in a good spot from the 
standpoint of how we're managing the Lay's business.
 
More broadly in terms of Frito
-
Lay performance, 
you saw 1%, 3%, 7% last 
year in terms of volume, revenue and profit. If you look at Frito's 
performance over the last four or five years, it's been remarkably consistent, 
volume's been around 2%. Revenue's been around 4% and profit's been 
around 6%, plus o
r minus a point, for quite a few years. I think you can 
continue, even as we invest and make changes in Frito, you can expect to 
see that type of performance going forward.

Your next question comes from the line of Judy Hong of Goldman Sachs.
 
Indr

Morning, Judy.
 
Judy E. Hong

Goldman Sachs & Co.
 
Good morning, everyone. How are you?
 
Indra K. Nooyi

Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
Good.
 
Judy E. Hong

Goldman Sachs & Co.
 
So I guess I just wanted to 
go back to Frito
-
Lay and maybe just get your 
color on the broader kind of macro snacking environment in the U.S. The 
confectionery category has been a little bit soft. Salty snacks is more stable, 
but just in terms of the context of the U.S. consumers perh
aps being a bit 
better off, seems like maybe the category could do a little bit better. So any 
color just in terms of where the consumers are going across the broader 
macro snacking category would be helpful.
 
Indra K. Nooyi

Chairman & Chief Executive Off

Let me step back. The overall macro snacking category probably growing 
somewhere in the 3% to 4%, and the reason Frito does as well as it does is 
because it takes occasions from all other macro snacking categories. And so 
Frito's able to go after crac
kers, able to go after sweet occasions, through 
interesting products that comes from a salty heritage. So we have a frying 
platform. We have a baking platform, different sort of baking platforms. And 
we leverage those platforms to go after all of those occ
asions. And I think 
that's what creates an advantaged model within Frito
-
Lay.
 
We are not in a zero
-
sum game within macro snacks, where any growth that 
we get has to come at the expense of another category already 
participating. In the case of Frito, we are
 
in one category and reach out of 
the core (38:56). Remember the old strategy of grow the core and add 
more? That's really what we're doing. We're looking at the demand of 
consumers and wondering how we can serve that demand with a Frito
-
Lay 
option.
 
And wh
ether it's Cheetos, Fritos or it's the chocolate
-
covered Lay's that we 
offered or all the new products on slate for next year, I think we're just 
going after other macro snacking occasions. And that's why other companies 
are hurting and Frito
-
Lay is doing 
so well. And you combine that with our 
DSD system, our Power of One advantage, we can really get a tremendous 
advantage with customers.

Your next question comes from the line of Mark Swartzberg of Stifel, 
Nicolaus.
 
Mark Swartzberg

Stifel, 
Nicolaus & Co., Inc.
 
Thanks. Good morning, Indra. Good morning, Hugh.
 
Indra K. Nooyi

Morning, Mark.

Two questions on Latin America, if I could, one is, any detail you 
can give us 
on the ""strategic investments"" in the quarter, to what extent they're brand 
and forward
-
facing and to what extent they were otherwise. And then 
secondly, it's kind of early days since you've integrated snacks and beverage 
in Latin America, but 
could you give us an update on how that's going and 
whether 2016 is a year where we should expect benefits from that to be 
more significant? Just how that's going and what your outlook from that is.
 
Indra K. Nooyi 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
Inves
tments in Latin America.
 
Hugh F. Johnston 
-
 
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer
 
Yeah, sure, happy to start with that. Good morning, Mark. When you look at 
Latin America, you really have to take a step back, because it's such a broad 
and diverse geograp
hy, both in terms of cultures and in terms of economic 
outlook for the near
-
term. Obviously, Brazil has got a significant number of 
challenges facing into 2016, as it has over the last couple of years. At the 
other end of the spectrum, Mexico is, as an eco
nomy, performing quite well. 
So if you think about what we're trying to accomplish, as you move south 
into Latin America, a lot of our focus has been around making our supply 
chain more efficient and making our management structures more efficient. 
And a n
umber of the investments that we made in the fourth quarter there 
were geared towards productivity
-
driving initiatives.
 
On the other hand, in Mexico, where the outlook is more positive, the 
investments we made during the course of 2015 were more growth
-
ori
ented. 
And as we think about our outlook going forward, we expect that mix of 
probably stronger performance out of Mexico, more margin improving 
performance out of the balance of Latin America. That said, we're long
-
term, 
very positive on the geography. We
 
think we've got great market positions 
and great people down there. And we think it's one of the most important 
regions of the world for us going forward.
 
Indra K. Nooyi 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
And then, in terms of integrating snacks and bev
erages under one leader, 
look, if we didn't have economies in Latin America that were performing so 
poorly at this point, we'd start to see results sooner. But right now, it's very 
hard to really point to when we will see results, based on the fact that an
y 
progress we make is eaten up by macroeconomic challenges. So we look at 
underlying in
-
process metrics, if you want to call it that, as opposed to 
tailpipe metrics. And everything we're seeing says that we are making great 
progress in figuring out how to 
leverage a franchise bottler system with our 
snacks business to create advantage. And it's going well so far.
 
Indra K. Nooyi

Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
So with that, let me just thank you all for your questions. And in closing, let 
me reiterate t
hat we are pleased with our 2015 results. Looking ahead to 
2016, we are confident that we have the right plans in place. We are 
executing well against those plans. And we've set appropriately aggressive 
targets for 2016. We look forward to updating you on 
our progress as the 
year advances. Thank you for your time and questions this morning and, 
more importantly, for the confidence you've placed in us with your 
investment. Have a great day.

President of Investor Relations. Mr. Pamnani, you 
may begin.

begin with some brief prepared 
comments from Ramon and Hugh, and then open up the call to your 
questions.
 
Before we begin, please take note of our cautionary statement. We will make 
forward
-

p
lans and 2020 guidance. Forward
-
looking statements inherently involve 
risks and uncertainties and reflect our view as of today, and we are under no 
obligation to update. When discussing our results, we refer to non
-
GAAP 
measures, which exclude certain item
s from reported results. Please refer to 

-
K available on pepsico.com for definitions 
and reconciliations of non
-
GAAP measures and additional information 
regarding our results, including a discussion of factors that could caus
e 
actual results to materially differ from forward
-
looking statements.
 
And finally, as disclosed in our earnings release this morning, we are now 
reporting four international divisions versus three previously. This reflects 
changes made to our management r
eporting structure. Therefore, certain 
international division results have been restated for the full years 2017, 
2018 and 2019. Specifically, our former Europe Sub
-
Saharan Africa division 
has been reclassified as Europe and will no longer include Sub
-
Saha
ran 
Africa.
 
And our former Asia, Middle East, North Africa division has been reclassified 
into two divisions: Africa, Middle East, South Asia, or AMESA; and Asia 
Pacific, Australia, New Zealand, China, or APAC. There are no changes to the 
remaining divisio
ns or our consolidated results.

4.5% in 2019, our fastest rate of growth since 2015.
 
Our organic revenue growth was very broad
-
based across all divisions, with 
Frito
-
Lay delivering its fastest rate of growth since 2013 and PBNA delivered 
its fastest rate of growth since 2015. Our develo
ping and emerging markets 
also delivered high single
-
digit growth despite ongoing volatility and 
uncertainty in certain parts of the world. We invested in becoming Faster by 
increasing our global advertising and marketing spending by more than 12% 
for the 
full year, reflecting investment across snacks and beverages, and in 
both our large and established brands and our emerging brands; expanding 
our market presence by increasing route capacity, adding merchandising 
racks and coolers and advancing the technol
ogies that we deploy to drive 
greater and more precise execution; and investing in additional 
manufacturing capacity to remove bottlenecks and increase growth capacity 
for our products.
 
This includes investments in new plants, new lines and added distribut
ion 
infrastructure. Whilst we intend to continue to invest back into our business, 
we know that sustaining higher growth would require building stronger 
capabilities, ones which will be difficult to match by our competitors. During 
2019, we enhanced our co
nsumer and customer
-
facing capabilities, 
strengthened our organizational culture and transformed our cost 
management. Specifically, we invested in data analytics and other 
information technology to build consumer intimacy and achieve precision at 
scale.
 
By
 
capturing and analyzing more granular consumer
-
level data, we can 
understand the consumer in a more individualized way to both customize 
communication and executing in every store with precisely the right products 
placed in the right location and at the r
ight price. We strengthened our 
omnichannel capabilities, particularly in e
-
commerce, but our retail sales 
were nearly $2 billion in 2019. To meet the growing need across channels 

-
t
o
-
end agile value chain that can deliver more precision and variety to 
enable us to win in the marketplace.
 
We migrated our organizational structure closer to the market in order to 
improve speed, increase accountability and become more locally focused. 
An
d we evolved our way 

 
our values and ways of working to foster a culture 
where employees act like owners with a greater sense of empowerment and 
accountability. We call this The PepsiCo Way, which includes a set of seven 
leadership behaviors that have bee
n rapidly embraced by our organization. 
And we took a completely holistic approach to cost management, one in 
which we manage all costs as an investment.
 
In doing so, we challenged the entire cost structure to evaluate cost and 
benefit of our spending. In 
2019, we delivered in excess of $1 billion in 
productivity savings and plan to deliver this amount annually through 2023. 
Finally, becoming Better reflects our aspiration to continually integrate 
purpose into our business strategy and brands as more is exp
ected of 
corporations by society. We prioritized and embraced a set of focused 
initiatives to help build a more sustainable food system. These include 
advancing benefits to farmers and communities through more sustainable 
agriculture. We intend to achieve 
100% sustainably farmer
-
sourced 
agricultural raw materials by the end of 2020, which include potatoes, whole 
corn, oats and oranges.
 

sufficiency and aiming to replenish 100% of the water we c
onsume for 
manufacturing in high water risk areas by 2025. Circular packaging. By 
2025, we intend to increase recycled content in our plastics packaging to 
25% and reduce 35% of virgin plastic content across all our beverage 
portfolio.
 
Improving choices ac
ross our portfolio by reducing added sugars, sodium 
and saturated fats. Mitigating the impact of climate change by reducing 

2030. And finally, advancing respect for human rights, prom
oting a diverse 
and inclusive workplace and increase the earnings potential 

 
earnings 
potential of women to drive economic growth and increased food security.
 
Our commitment to becoming Better was most notably demonstrated by 
appointing our first
-
ever Chi
ef Sustainability Officer and by a green bond 
offering that generated almost $1 billion in net proceeds to advance our 
sustainability agenda.
 
To complement our Faster, Stronger and Better initiatives, we also made 
investments to fortify our portfolio for f
uture growth. Specifically, we 
invested in our SodaStream business, which grew net revenue more than 
20% last year in order to capture an incremental growth opportunity. We 
announced our intent to acquire BFY Brands, the makers of the fast
-
growing 
PopCorne

the process of acquiring Pioneer Foods, which will build the foundation for 
future growth and scale in Africa, a key emerging market where our growth 
opportunities remain vast.
 
And we acqui
red CytoSport, the makers of Muscle Milk, which expands our 
presence in sports nutrition, providing opportunities for additional growth 
and category expansion. As we aspire to be the global leader in convenient 
foods and beverages by winning with purpose, 
we believe these investments 
position us well to win in the marketplace.
 
Now let me discuss our operating results. As I noted earlier, our organic 
revenue growth accelerated to 4.5% for the full year 2019 versus 3.7% in 
2018, exceeding the initial target w
e set a year ago. All our divisions 
contributed to this growth, including a 3% increase in developed markets 
and an 8% increase in developing and emerging markets.
 
Frito
-
Lay North America had a very strong year with a 4.5% increase in 
organic revenue, alon
g with an acceleration of volume growth in the second 
half of the year. The business gained value share in both salty and savory 

driven by the investments we made in innovation, 
marketing and consumer 
insights, supply chain and manufacturing and go
-
to
-
market capacity. This 
included a double
-
digit increase in advertising and marketing spend, 
additional plant, warehouse and distribution center capacity, and additional 
routes, racks 
and selling resources.
 
Frito delivered net revenue growth in all of its large mainstream brands like 

-
digit growth 
in emerging premium brands such as Bare and Off the Eaten Path. Our 
multipack
 
offerings also delivered very good growth as we have continuously 
expanded the variety of brand and flavor combinations. The breadth of our 
growth was also evident across every key retail channel. We increased net 
revenue growth in grocery, mass, club, co
nvenience, foodservice and e
-
commerce.
 
And Frito
-
Lay was once again the number one contributor to U.S. food and 
beverage retail sales growth in 2019. With respect to the fourth quarter, 
Frito delivered 3% organic revenue growth, driven by 2% volume growth 
and 1% net price realization. The deceleration in net price realization. The 
deceleration in net price realization was largely a function of the timing of 
pricing actions taken in 2018. We expect our net price realization trends to 
improve over the coming 
months and have strong innovation and 
merchandising plans in place for the business to deliver very good growth in 
2020.
 
PepsiCo Beverages North America delivered 3% organic revenue growth in 
2019 with a sequential acceleration in the fourth quarter, which
 
represented 
its fastest rate of organic revenue growth in four years. The business 
benefited from improved local market focus and execution driven by our new 
field structure, increased go
-
to
-
market capacity, significantly stepped up 
advertising support, i
nnovation and additional selling resources.
 
We also invested in improving our presence in the away
-
from
-
home channel 
by becoming the preferred beverage partner for JetBlue, Carnival Cruise 
Lines and Regal Cinemas for the past year. Investing in our brands 
has been 

double
-
digit range for both the fourth quarter and full year with increases in 
our large brands, such as Pepsi, Gatorade and Mountain Dew.
 
Trademark Pepsi posted its sixt
h consecutive quarter of net revenue growth 
with strong double
-
digit growth in our Pepsi Zero Sugar product. Gatorade 
accelerated as the year progressed and ended the year on a very strong 
note with high single
-
digit growth in the fourth quarter, led by Ga
torade 
Zero, which delivered more than $600 million in measured retail sales in 
2019.
 
Innovation played a very important role at PBNA this year with Gatorade 
Zero, bubly and Mountain Dew Game Fuel having cumulatively delivered 
more than $1 billion in measu
red retail sales. Other brands, including Propel 
and Lifewater delivered strong double
-
digit net revenue growth, while Pure 
Leaf and Starbucks delivered high single
-
digit growth in 2019.
 
Finally, we have plans in place to build on our recent innovation suc
cesses. 
We will invest in BOLT24, a functional beverage we launched last year that 
supports athletes around the clock by providing advanced, all
-
day hydration. 
We recently introduced Zero Sugar variants of Mountain Dew and Mountain 
Dew Game Fuel, which off
er the same bold taste as the originals without the 
sugar. And we will roll out Pepsi Cafe, a coffee
-
infused cola beverage that 
will be available for a limited
-
time offering in U.S. stores as of April.
 
Rounding out our North America 
performance. Quaker Foods delivered 1% 
organic revenue growth for the full year, with double
-
digit net revenue 
growth in our light snacks business and Gamesa cookies and mid
-
single
-
digit 
growth at Aunt Jemima and Roni. I want to conclude our discussion on 
North 
America by acknowledging terrific work of our customer and supply chain 
teams have done.
 
Specifically, PepsiCo was awarded the number one ranking in the 2019 

top spot; and the 
top two rankings in 2019 U.S. Advantage survey core food 
multichannel report. These surveys reflect our customers' view of PepsiCo as 
a valued partner and demonstrate the benefits of investing with our 
customers to help drive growth.
 
Now moving on to inter
national markets. Each of our international divisions 
delivered strong organic revenue growth in 2019. These results include some 
performance across our developing and emerging markets, with high single
-
digit organic revenue growth for both the fourth quar
ter and the full year. 
We continue to have a long runway for growth in many international 
markets, and our results reflect the benefits of our increased investments as 
we continue to leverage our global capabilities to drive higher per capital 
consumption 
and improve market share, while executing in locally relevant 
ways.
 
In Latin America, we grew organic revenue growth 

 
we grew organic 
revenue 7% for the full year, with growth in both snacks and beverages 
despite ongoing macroeconomic volatility and polit
ical uncertainty in certain 
markets. Mexico, our largest market, delivered high single
-
digit growth for 
both the quarter and the full year. Our next largest market, Brazil, delivered 
mid
-
single
-
digit growth for the full year with an acceleration in the fou
rth 
quarter to high single
-
digit growth. In Europe, we grew organic revenue 
5.5% for the full year, with very good growth both in snacks and beverages.
 
Our largest market, Russia, delivered mid
-
single
-
digit growth for the fourth 
quarter and the full year. 
The United Kingdom delivered low single
-
digit 
growth for the full year. But very encouragingly, it exited the year with mid
-
single
-
digit growth in the fourth quarter. Other highlights include double
-
digit growth in Turkey and high single
-
digit growth in Po
land for the full 
year.
 
Moving to our Asia, Middle East and Africa regions. During the fourth 
quarter, we took the opportunity to think more strategically about this part 
of the world. We decided to split the organizational structure of our prior 
AMENA div
ision into AMESA, which includes Africa, Middle East and Africa 
regions. During the fourth quarter, we took the opportunity to think more 
strategically about this part of the world.
 
We decided to split the organizational structure of our prior AMENA divisi
on 
into AMESA, which includes Africa, Middle East and South Asia; and APAC, 
which includes Asia Pacific, Australia, and New Zealand and China. By 
creating one operating sector centered on the Asian consumer and another 
centered on the Middle Eastern, South
 
Asian and African consumer, we 
believe we can enhance our focus on accelerating top line growth. AMESA 
delivered 6% organic revenue growth for the full year.
 
This includes double
-
digit growth in Pakistan and Egypt and mid
-
single
-
digit 
growth in India and 
Saudi Arabia. APAC delivered 9% organic revenue 
growth for the full year, led by strong double
-
digit growth in China and 
Vietnam and high single
-
digit growth in Thailand and the Philippines.
 
To conclude, our priorities for 2020 remain consistent with our d
iscussions 
today. We expect to deliver 4% organic revenue growth and 7% core 
constant currency earnings per share growth in 2020. And we will continue 
to invest back into the business to evolve our portfolio and transform our 
value chain; build next
-
genera
tion capabilities, particularly leveraging 
technology to enhance our insights, speed and precision; grow our talent 
and simplify our organization to be more consumer and customer
-
centric; 
invest in our brands, both large and emerging; and reduce our cost s
tructure 
to free up resources to fund our investments. These priorities will always be 
executed with an eye towards enhancing our marketplace competitiveness 
and delivering, of course, long
-
term value creation. With that, let me now 
turn the call over to H
ugh.
 
Hugh Johnston
 
Good morning everyone. As Ramon noted, for 2020, we expect to deliver 
4% organic revenue growth and 7% core constant currency earnings per 
share growth. We expect foreign exchange to have an approximately 
negative 1 percentage point impa
ct on net revenue and core EPS growth 
and, therefore, expect our core U.S. dollar EPS to be $5.88 in 2020. For 
2020, we also expect our core 

 
annual core effective tax rate to be 
approximately 21%, free cash flow of approximately $6 billion, reflecting 
Ca
pEx of approximately $5 billion. The higher rate of capital spending is 
associated with accelerating progress on our strategic growth priorities, as 
Ramon laid out earlier. We expect our capital spending to remain at or 
around these levels for the next few
 
years and now expected to moderate to 
5% of sales by 2023.
 
We expect total cash returns to shareholders of approximately $7.5 billion in 
2020, comprised of dividends of $5.5 billion and share repurchases of $2 
billion. The expected cash returns reflect a 
7% increase in the annualized 
dividend per share effective 

 
with the dividend expected to be paid in June 

per share increase.
 
With respect to your models, please keep in mind the fol
lowing: In the first 
quarter of 2020, we face a difficult comparison for both organic revenue and

Good morning everyone. So I guess, I just got a few question
s this morning 
about Frito and the kind of the deceleration there this quarter, and I guess, 

you talk a little bit about the dynamics there, I guess, lapping some price 
increases? And
 
then kind of what gives you confidence that, that can 
reaccelerate as we move through 2020?
 
Ramon Laguarta
 
Good morning Bryan. Yes, listen, we feel very good about Frito performance 
in 2019. So we accelerated the highest level, I think, in the last seven 
years, 
so overall, a very good year. Volume went up and volume across all our 

the future. So very positive performance and also, as I said, across all 
channels. So very, very hol
istic, very good performance, I would say. The 
deceleration in Q4, as I said on the statement, is based on the pricing 
decision in 2018.
 

more of a price decisions now in Q1, second
 

main difference. We feel good about it especially the volume acceleration. 

pretty positive to us testament that our investments are working in driv

Steve Powers
 
A question actually on PBNA. As you think about the fourth quarter 
performa

which brands or businesses performed best versus your expectations in the 
quarter? And as you look forward to 2020, how do you think about the 
trajectory there, just balancing the current mome
ntum against what will be 

the expansion on the shelf and in the cooler of an energy category in which

bout our innovation has 
been very, very strong across the year, and you mentioned, some of the 
successes. So Gatorade, clearly driving sustainable growth by innovating in a 
new space like Zero.
 
Zero has driven a lot of new consumers into the sports categor

not like a summer
-
related growth of Gatorade. It is a, I would say, a 
structural, more penetration of the brand into consumers that were not 
consuming Gatorade. So we see that as sustainable. Actually, it accelerated 
during Q4. We see Pepsi,
 
as I said, with sustainable growth. So that makes 

that are driving consumption.
 
So we see Pepsi as well driving sustainable growth. We continue to see very 
strong 
performance in our coffee business, and our partnership with 


premium spaces with innovation is very powerful
. Very strong performance 
across the year, including Q4. The same with our tea categories. Pure Leaf 
continues to drive a lot of growth and develop the category. You mentioned 
bubly.

category where we participate, expanding those categories, bringing more 
consumers into this space.
 

sustainable growth for PBNA, which is 
driven by better execution. And this better execution, obviously, comes from 

to the business where we have decision

making closer to the consume

to the market is making us a better execution company in PBNA. I think that

going to get better with better tools and better focus. So we feel strong 
about where we finished.
 
We feel strong about the drivers of that growth, 
not being one

Just want to go back to FLNA for a second. I get the p
rice increases in 2018. 


written about FLNA and concerns about it. And I get, Ramon, that you said 

e going to see some price realization improving through 2020. But 
I wonder with all the consumer work that you guys do, if you see anything 
at all that gives you pause from a structural perspective.
 
So are you seeing any changes driven by the consumers, in
 
particular, on 
health and wellness that are accelerating? Or are you seeing anything from a

trends of the consumer and trying to adjust the portfolio to those trends. If 

 
growth in 2019 and the way we think 



 
the way we 
market those brands in a way we are personalizing the messages, the way 

we innovate against those large brands.
 
At the same time, our kind of more permissible portfolio,
 
our premium 
portfolio, that segment of our range is growing about two times the average 
of the company. So if you think about Off the Eaten Path, Bare, Simply, 
Smartfoods, I mean, all those brands that you would say they are probably 
preferred by some typ
e of consumers that prefer more permissible snacks, 
they are growing two times.
 
But the beauty of our Frito
-
Lay portfolio and the same would apply to our 

brands that are well estab
lished, trying to modernize them, keep them very 
attractive to the consumers and then innovate into future spaces where the 
consumer might move at a different speed in different parts of the country 

volving the 



 

Eaten Path is a great example.
 
The Simply portfolio is a great example that is giving us very
 
high 


 
and I think we talked about it last time, is there is a trend towards smaller 
packages. And that might be a way the consumer is also approaching 
snacking categories with portion
 
control being a key driver of the occasion. 
So we see small packs.
 

would continue to give us good growth in that space of more permissible 
snacking, either by portion control by 
new brands and products that are 


participate in this snacking trend, which I think is true and is going to be 
here
 
for a long time. And that would make us feel very positive about Frito 
because there are a lot of tailwinds to the snacking category.

id, as you sort of 
slightly noted, the world is certainly a volatile place, lots of events going on

Yes, good morning, Andrea. In terms of the guidance, actually, the guidance 

he same as we gave 12 months ago. 
So obviously, we saw a world where the investments that we were making 
paid off a little bit better than we expected. And as a result, we got results

this year. It will still grow. It might even grow a little bit in excess of the rate 

that we se

marketplace to accelerate investment in order to capture even more growth, 


that we guide to give us the ability to take advantage of those opportunities.

Laurent Grandet
 
Good morning, Ramon and good morning, Huge. And congratulate Ramon on 

opportunity. I mean, two weeks ago, Unilever CEO said the co
mpany was 
beginning a strategic review of its tea business. As we have been saying for 
quite some time now, we believe the acquisition of the balance of your JV 
with Unilever will be a net positive for PepsiCo. It is one of the fastest
-
growing segment glob
ally, one where you have a market share leadership. 
So the acquisition would make a strategic sense, but also a financial one 
because you will be capturing 100% of the profit rather than just half. So 
could you comment on this opportunity and the role of t
he tea segment for 
PepsiCo in general, especially as you are now facing, I mean, a renewed 
competition with Fuze mostly in Europe, but also in international markets. 
Thank you.

ramifications for us going forward.

Africa all the way to Australia from one 

Dubai, was a big burden on our people and our executives. So that was not 
the ideal. But fundamentally, more than that, which is also important, is that 
there are clearly different consumption patterns, different trends, 
different 
food cultures between, I would say, the group of countries centered around 
China and the group of countries centered around the Middle East and 
Africa.
 

more local relevance

local relevance. We want to be able to have resources close to the 
marketplace in the critical differentiators like R&D, like sales execution that 
will help us to perform better in the market. One of the 
critical opportunities 
for PepsiCo is to develop the international business. And I think Asia remains 
by far our number one opportunity. And China, of course, is a huge market, 

remarks.
 
But the opportunity is much, much higher.
 

sustainable and focused growth in those two parts of the world. Africa is 


 

ery close to 
concluding the Pioneer acquisition. That will give us a lot of scale in Africa,

Thank you. Good question. Listen, obviously, we 

 
the consumers are 


 
for. As the day is becoming longer and the commuting is 




brand that we think we have the opportunity to 

 
working together with the 
ROCKSTAR owners, to develop and to reinvest, and I think we can do a 

coffee category,
 
and I think our partnership with Starbucks has been great.
 


participating in lower caffeine levels from 

 
and 
we just announced some 
innovation in our bubly brand, some innovation in our BOLT24 brand. So we 
plan to participate in the caffeine space from multiple dimensions, including 
doing a better job with ROCKSTAR and our partnership there. Brands like 
Mountain 
Dew Kickstart and Mountain Dew Game Fuel are good innovation 
from our own brands into that space, a bit more focused on particular 
opportunities, one on the morning occasion, one on the gaming occasion. 


now of participating in what is, as you say, a large opportunity and quite 
profitable.

rs' kind of questions

horizon or so
mething just that gets you

ave six quarters of growth for Pepsi 



wor



back with the smaller packs.
 

s great. Zero is a very fast
-


our focus in the Super Bowl. Our execution is quite focused on Pepsi Zero. I 
mean Pepsi regular is growing bac
k again. Again, I think there is more our 





will keep bringing some news to the brand to continue the consumer 
engagement with our brand, our products.
 



against our key priorities. We look
 
forward to updating you again on our 
progress throughout the year, and we thank you very much for the

Indra K. Nooyi

PepsiCo, Inc.
 
Thank you, Jamie. I am pleased to report that we are on track to meet our 
2017 financial goals, with first quarter operating results right in line with
 
our 
expectations. Organic revenue was up 2% globally. We delivered positive 
volume growth in both global snacks and global beverages, along with 
positive net price realization. And core constant currency EPS grew 7%.
 
And despite the macro volatility and w
eak currencies in many of our key 
overseas markets that impacted our reported results, our organic revenue 
growth was driven by our developing and emerging markets businesses, 
with mid
-
single
-
digit organic revenue gains. We are particularly encouraged 
by t
he broad
-
based gains we saw in our two largest developing and 
emerging markets, Mexico and Russia, where growth across snacks, 
beverages and dairy led to high single
-
digit organic revenue growth in each 
of these important markets.
 
And the developed markets
, we grew organic revenue 1%, led by solid 
performance of Frito
-
Lay North America and North American Beverages. And 
we delivered this performance despite facing a few headwinds, including: the 
timing of the New Year holiday, which fell into the 53rd week o
f our 2016 
fiscal year; a later Easter this year; and the delay of U.S. income tax refunds 
that dampened Q1 consumer spending across virtually every consumer 
category.
 
With Q1 coming in line with our expectations, we remain confident in the full 
year 2017 
outlook we shared with you last quarter, namely, organic revenue 
growth of at least 3% and core constant currency EPS growth of 8%. We are 
proud of the strength and consistency of our performance over the years 
and we expect 2017 to be yet another strong y
ear of achievement. As I 
wrote in my annual letter to shareholders, our performance has been 
enabled, in large part, by our anticipation of and response to far
-
reaching 
demographic environmental and societal shifts. For more than a decade, it 
has been clea
r to us that if we wanted to make our future as bright as our 
past, we needed to transform our company in a number of critical ways.
 
With changing consumer preferences reflecting a growing shift towards 
healthier lifestyles, we needed to continue to transf
orm our portfolio to offer 
more nutritious products. With increasing strains on natural resources and 
the increasing importance governments are placing on protecting our planet, 
we needed to transform our operations to limit our environmental footprint. 
An
d we're changing attitudes, values and demographics in the workplace, 
especially as Millennials enter the workforce in large numbers. We needed to 
transform our workplace and our culture to make sure we were meeting the 
evolving expectations of a new gener
ation of associates.
 
The urgency of responding to these shifts is what gave rise to the approach 
we call Performance with Purpose. From the start, Performance with Purpose 
has been more than a slogan. It's been an overarching vision, guiding every 
aspect o
f our business. It's about building a healthier future for all our 
stakeholders. Of course, this begins with generating healthy financial returns 
for our owners, but that is just the table stakes. Our challenge is to deliver 
them consistently and sustainab
ly year after year.
 
And the way we are doing this is by continuing to transform in five areas: 
first, making healthier foods and beverages for our consumers. To meet the 
evolving needs of our consumers around the world, we are shifting our 
portfolio to a w
ider range of what we call: first, Everyday Nutrition products, 
which are products with positive nutrients like grains, fruits and vegetables 
or protein, plus those that are naturally nutritious like water and 
unsweetened tea; and two, what we call guilt
-
f
ree products, which includes 
the Everyday Nutrition products plus beverages with 70 calories or less from 
added sugar per 12
-
ounce serving and snacks with low levels of sodium and 
saturated fat.
 
As a result, today, more than 45% of our net revenue is deriv
ed from guilt
-
free products. And our Everyday Nutrition portfolio is growing faster than the 
balance of the portfolio. This transformation has been enabled by a series of 
critical investments in R&D that are paving the way for new flavors and 
sweeteners, a
s well as ingredients and recipes. And we are also investing in 
advanced manufacturing technologies, like our proprietary frying innovation 
that can reduce the amount of fat in potato chips by 20%.
 
You see our commitment to our product transformation and o
ur recent 
innovation around the globe. For example, in North America, we just 
launched LIFEWTR, a premium bottled water, PH balanced, with electrolytes 
for added taste. The brand fuses creativity with design to serve as a source 
of inspiration by featuring
 
the works of some of today's top visual artists on 
the package. We also launched LEMON LEMON. It's a sparkling lemonade, a 
modern take on an old tradition with bubbles, lemon juice and a touch of 
sweeteners, with just 70 calories per 12
-
ounce serving. We 
launched IZZE 
FUSIONS, a next
-
generation sparkling beverage, modernized with unique 
flavors and just 60 calories per 12
-
ounce serving. And we're expanding the 
lineup of our highly
-
successful Smartfood Delight popcorn, that contains just 
35 calories per cup
. It's made with air
-
popped 100% whole grain popcorn, 
contains no artificial colors, flavors or preservatives and offers gluten
-
free 
and non
-
GMO project verified varieties.
 
In Brazil, we are launching new Quaker fruit bars made with oats and real 
fruit. Qu
aker fruit bars are just 60 calories per serving, have no added 
sugar, has zero trans fats and are a source of fiber and Vitamin C.
 
In Russia, our J7 whole fruit line, containing 100% fruit juice and nectars 
with the fiber of a whole fruit, hit the market 
earlier this year. In Mexico, we 
are expanding our global Sunbites franchise with the launch of three product 
forms, multi
-
grain chips, popcorn and plantains. And in the UK, we launched 
Quaker Super Goodness in two forms, SuperGrains and Super Fruits, both
 
made with 100% whole
-
grain oats with beta glucan, which has been shown 
to lower blood cholesterol levels.
 
And we believe there is much more room to grow in the space. For example, 
working with our retail partners, Quaker Foods North America has the 
opport
unity to return to growth by leveraging one of the most beloved 
nutrition distribution brands to renew excitement in the center of the store 
through innovative merchandising.
 
The second area is generating healthy growth for our retail and foodservice 
partn
ers. As a result of all the investments we have made to position 
ourselves for success over the long term, from anticipating consumer trends 
to building a robust innovation pipeline, to transforming our product portfolio 
to meet consumers' needs, we are de
livering top
-
tier growth for our 
retailers. For the third consecutive year, PepsiCo was the largest contributor 
to branded retail food and beverage sales growth in the U.S. In fact, in 
2016, we generated more retail sales growth than all other $5 billion
-
p
lus 
food and beverage manufacturers combined. We're driving growth by 
leveraging our global scale and driving excellent local in
-
market execution.
 
For example, in 2016, we placed with our retail partners more than 250,000 
single
-
serve displays dedicated to
 
our fastest
-
growing brands with our best 
innovation, driving growth in single
-
serve beverages for our retail partners 
and us. By implementing the GES model pioneered Frito
-
Lay, our North 
America Beverage unit is improving order accuracy, reducing out
-
of
-
s
tocks 
and driving even greater levels of in
-
store service.
 
To drive growth with our foodservice partners, in just one year, we placed 
20,000 Hello Goodness branded vending units that offer consumers access 
to foods and beverages from across the PepsiCo por
tfolio that meet certain 
nutrition criteria. And we are building a powerhouse e
-
commerce team, 
creating global capability in markets from the U.S. to China to the UK and 
tailoring that capability with retailers to fit their growth strategy.
 
Third, we are c
ontributing to a healthier planet while boosting our bottom 
line. One of the central planks of Performance with Purpose, the vision we 
set out over a decade ago, has been protecting our planet and conserving 
natural resources. We continue to advance these 
efforts in a number of 
ways, including responsible water use, shrinking our carbon footprint across 
our supply chain and reducing our waste and packaging material, not only 
because it's the right thing to do, because it's the smart thing to do for 
business
. I am pleased to report that globally, approximately one
-
third of 
our plants have now achieved near
-
zero waste landfill while reducing, 
reusing or recycling their waste. And our efforts continue.
 
In January, we activated a wind turbine at our Skelmersdale
 
plant in the UK, 
which is now providing 25% of the site's electricity with this renewable 
energy source. These and many other environmental sustainability initiatives 
are not only shrinking our environmental footprint, they're also substantially 
reducing 
our costs and boosting the bottom line.
 
The fourth area is creating a healthy workplace and culture for our 
associates. The extraordinary men and women who make up our company 
are our greatest assets. That's why we're committed to remaining a place 
that th
e best and brightest come, not only to earn a living, but to build a life 
by fostering a healthy workplace and culture. So we've undertaken a broad 
set of initiatives: to build a work force that's diverse and inclusive; to 
provide working caregivers the su
pport and flexibility they need to meet 
their responsibilities at work and home; to foster learning; and to promote 
more effective ways to work together.
 
For example, in North American Beverages, we've declared 2017 to be the 
year of the frontline leader a
nd launched frontline leader excellence training 
to our almost 3,000 frontline managers, with topics covering employer 
advocacy, time management and career building. And at Frito
-
Lay, we are 
piloting innovative programs to address the continuous need for s
killed labor 
by creating a variety of programs aimed at skill development for our current 
associates as well as partnerships with local technical schools for 
development of future talent.
 
Our workplace and culture are more than the product of 
corporate policies. 
It also reflects our values, holding ourselves to the highest standards of 
excellence, speaking with truth and candor and selling only products we can 
proudly stand behind.
 
And the fifth area is promoting healthier communities wherever 
we operate. 
Although we're thought of as a global enterprise, we are also members of 
every local community where we do business. Our associates live there, we 
make our products there and we often source our raw materials there. For 
all of these reasons, we
 
have a stake in the local communities we serve and 
we work hard to meet our responsibilities to them. An important way we 
contribute to our communities is by creating well
-
paying jobs, along with the 
possibility of long, successful careers.
 
We are also do
ing our part to be a good neighbor in other ways. For 
example, in Chicago, for over a decade, we've been the title partner of the 
largest high school soccer tournament in the U.S., the PepsiCo Showdown. 
In 2017, there are 216 Chicago area high schools and 
more than 21,500 
student athletes involved in the event, which is built around the theme Make 
a Difference On AND Off the Field. Relatedly, there is a monthly community 
service push with the thousands of PepsiCo Showdown student athletes to 
cultivate leade
rship for a brighter future.
 
And throughout Mexico, our Entrepreneurship for Growth program supports 
youngsters from vulnerable communities to improve their quality of life, to 
develop enough soft skills through sport and hard skills through technical 
educ
ation. So taken together, these steps form a virtuous cycle that's 
powering our ongoing transformation as a company, enabling us to do well 
by doing good and positioning us for success, not only over the short term 
but also over the long term, adding to bo
th the durability and duration of our 
shareholder value creation.
 
So net
-
net, we feel good about the state of our business. We are on track to 
deliver our full
-
year financial targets. And we are managing our business to 
both the short
-
term and the long
-
ter
m in a way that delivers healthy, 
sustainable returns to our shareholders.
 
With that, let me turn the call over to Hugh Johnston. Hugh?
 
Hugh F. Johnston

PepsiCo, Inc.
 
Thank you, Indra, and good morning, everyone. Let me start by picking up 
on Indra's poi
nt regarding healthy financial returns. As much as we are 
proud of the advancement of our agendas with customers, consumers, our 
associates and communities, we are equally pleased with the financial gains 
these initiatives have contributed to our sharehold
ers. Over the past five 
years, we have generated approximately $40 billion of free cash flow, 
excluding certain items, and returned $38 billion to shareholders in the form 
of dividends and share repurchases.
 
This cash flow has been the result of healthy or
ganic revenue growth, 
margin expansion, diligent working capital management and disciplined 
capital allocation, including responsible reinvestment in the business to 
position it to remain strong and generate attractive returns far into the 
future. We belie
ve 2017 will add to our track record of balanced earnings 
growth and strong cash generation for the company and attractive cash 
returns for our shareholders, which brings me to our outlook for 2017.
 
As we set out in the release, we continue to expect organ
ic revenue growth 
of at least 3%, fueled by successful product innovation and strong 
marketplace execution, but tempered by a cautious macro environment. 
Foreign exchange is now expected to negatively impact reported revenue by 
approximately 2 percentage p
oints, which is an improvement of 1 point from 
our previous guidance based on current market consensus rates. And we 
continue to expect core earnings of $5.09 per share, which assumes core 
constant currency growth of 8%, offset by an expected 3 percentage 
point 
drag from foreign exchange translation based on current market consensus 
rates, which remains unchanged from our previous guidance.
 
In terms of other key considerations and assumptions embedded in our full
-
year outlook, we continue to expect raw mate
rial inflation driven by both an 
increase in our basket of commodities and additional pressure from 
transaction ForEx. We continue to expect core operating margin expansion, 
contributed to by our productivity programs. And we continue to expect our 
core ef
fective tax rate to be approximately 24%.
 
Turning to cash flow, we expect to continue to generate strong cash flow and 
to exercise discipline over capital allocation, with prudent reinvestment into 
the business and the majority of our free cash flow, exclu
ding certain items, 
to be returned to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. So 
for 2017, we continue to expect: approximately $10 billion in cash flow from 
operations; net capital spending of approximately $3 billion; approximately 
$7 billi
on in free cash flow, excluding certain items; cash dividends of 
approximately $4.5 billion 

 
recall that we previously announced a 7% 
increase in our quarterly dividend, to begin with the June payment, and this 
would represent the 45th consecutive year in
 
which we have increased our 
dividend; and share repurchases of approximately $2 billion.
 
Finally, as you update your models, I'd like the highlight the following three 
items as they relate to the second quarter. First, we expect our rate of 
organic revenu
e growth to show sequential improvement. Second, we expect 
our consolidated core operating margin to contract in the quarter, due to the 
timing of business investments in Latin America and AMENA. And finally, we 
expect foreign exchange translation to be a 
low single
-
digit headwind on 
both reported revenue and EPS, based on current market consensus rates.
 
With that, we're ready to take the first question.

the 
weakness we've seen in the U.S. I wonder if you could elaborate a little bit 
on what you've seen as you've kind of come out of the quarter and maybe 
anything, frankly, distinctive about your businesses, because outside of 
Quaker, it certainly looks lik
e snacks and beverages were relatively immune 
to some of the softness we've seen more broadly across CPG. Thanks.
 
Indra K. Nooyi

PepsiCo, Inc.
 
Thank you, Lauren. Let me just say that, clearly, in the first part of the 
quarter, several things happened. On
e is the fact that the New Year build up 
into the 53rd week of 2016 and then we had the slowdown because the tax 
refunds were delayed. By the time we got to the end of the first quarter, the 
business started to pick up again. So we aren't really concerned.
 
It's just a 
timing issue.
 
I'd just say globally, our business is looking good. Let me quickly give you a 
snapshot of what we are seeing globally. Europe is doing very well. It's 
strong. The return to growth has been impressive, so we are feeling very 
good
 
about Europe, across all parts of Europe. The Latin American continent, 
outside of Brazil, Argentina and Venezuela, is good, but Brazil, Argentina and 
Venezuela are causes for concern. The Middle East is retooling itself, and we 
have to wait for it to fig
ure out how they're going to come out of the oil price 
decline.
 
China, the GDP growth is good. Our snacks and nutrition business is doing 
very well, and our beverage business is slowly recovering. And India is 
coming out of a bold demonetization now to rem
onetization. There's good 
GDP growth and we feel good about our business prospects there, too. And 
as far as the U.S. is concerned, as we head into the second quarter, we don't 
have a reason to be worried.

Hi. So although we've been, obviously, pretty positive on Pepsi for a while 
and 
certainly understand the timing shifts you went through just recently, 
your volume growth in the developed markets wasn't perhaps as great as it 
could be, certainly not as well as we had expected. And when we talk to 
investors and ask about the risks to th
e company 

 
and I'm not sure it's all 
manifested in the quarter or not 

 
but the risk to the company longer term, 
we kind of talk about three things and I'd love your perspective on it. One is 
Pepsi's business over
-
indexing to convenience stores in a time 
where gas 
prices are up. Have you seen any of that impact? Two is the company's 
difficulty, I guess, perhaps inability, to capture impulse purchases online as 
consumers shift to e
-
commerce. And then three is if health and wellness 
ever really impacts snack
s like it does the rest of packaged foods? And have 
you seen any of those things manifested in the quarter or do you think it's 
all timing? And I guess also, are those perhaps legitimate concerns more 
broadly going forward?
 
Indra K. Nooyi 
-
 
PepsiCo, Inc.
 
Y
ou know, Ali, those are all very good questions, but every one of these 
concerns can also be reframed as an opportunity. And that's really what we 
do because if PepsiCo's business is over
-
developed in C
-
stores, we look at 
expanding in grocery and other cha
nnels, whether it's foodservice or 
vending, as a bigger opportunity. And then we look to see how we can 
leverage our DSD system to grow our business into new categories in C
-
stores. And that's what has made us more valuable partners to convenience 
store re
tailers.
 
And in terms of difficulty with impulse on online, we've built a very good e
-
commerce business. It's growing at impressive rates. I don't want to discuss 
those rates, but it's growing at impressive rates. And clearly, our challenge 
is to create im
pulse online. And we are working on tools with all of our 
partners to make our categories look like impulse categories online. It's a 
work in process, but I must tell you that our growth rates are quite 
impressive.
 
And in terms of health and wellness and i
mpacting the snacks business, 
look, snacks are simple pleasures of life. What we are doing is making our 
snacks more permissible. We're reducing the saturated fat levels. We 
remove trans fats. We're reducing the sodium levels. If you're going to eat a 
snac
k, eat a PepsiCo snack. And there's nothing wrong with eating a snack 
that's guilt
-
free. So our goal is to offer you a range of options from sort of 
fun
-
for
-
you products to guilt
-
free products, which include Everyday 
Nutrition, both in a snacking form and 
in a food
-
like form. And at this point, 
we are singularly focused on growing the core, expanding out of the core but 
making sure across the board we make them a lot more permissible. And it 
looks like that strategy is working at this point.

Yeah, Bryan, happy to. We typically are a user of working capital 
in the first 
quarter. If you go back, I think you'll see in most years we have generally 
had a couple hundred million dollar use of working capital, so same here. 
What are the drivers? Biggest one is we're starting to build inventory as we 
get into the hot

pattern that is very, very consistent with what you've seen historically.

Hey. Good morning. So, Hugh, gross margins compressed year
-
over
-
year for 
the second straight quarter. That's a rarity for you guys. Obviously, you'd 
highlighted it previously, but I was hoping you 
could discuss your 
expectation in the balance of year on gross margins and also give us more 
detail on what drove the compression in Q1, particularly in terms of the 
balance between pricing realization versus commodity pressure and the 
commodity outlook in
 
the balance of the year. Thanks.
 
Hugh F. Johnston 
-
 
PepsiCo, Inc.
 
Yeah, happy to, Dara. As you know, we saw some late in the year 
commodity inflation after a number of quarters of commodity deflation. 
When I say late in the year, I'm talking about late in
 
the year 2016. That 
continued into 2017. And we expect that to continue, as we've shared 
before, over the course of the year. As you know, our intent is generally to 
price through commodity inflation. In developed markets, we generally price 
through 100%.
 
In developing and emerging markets that have particularly 
high rates of inflation, we've tended to price through between two
-
thirds and 
three
-
quarters right away and then basically manage the rest of the P&L 
through productivity.
 
What you saw this quarter
, more than anything else, was our pricing in 
AMENA, in particular, was relatively light. Couple of markets driving that, the 
biggest one is Egypt, where we've seen particularly high inflation driven by 
ForEx. And our pricing is in place such that over the
 
course of the full year, 
we should see margin appreciation. But in the first half of the year, we will 
likely see margin compression. So you'll likely see one more quarter of that, 
and then you'll see margin appreciation in the back half of the year. That
 
is 
going to be driven, more than anything, by the fact that in the developing 
and emerging markets, we'll be taking more pricing to cover the commodity 
inflation.
 
We do like to balance that out, as you know. We don't like to sticker shock 
the consumers in
 
those markets because we want to keep them in the 
category. So a phased approach to pricing when we see high inflation, we 
found generally works best for long
-
term value creation.

Judy E. Hong

Good morning. So I wanted to delve a little bit more into the Frito
-
Lay 
performance in the first quarter. Obviously, it was more of a price/mix
-
driven quarter w
ith pretty healthy price/mix and volume down. So can you 
just talk about the acceleration in price/mix specifically and what's sort of 
driving that? And then with Kellogg transitioning out of the DSD system, 
have you started to see any positive impact on y
our business? And then, 
Hugh, just in terms of the currency impact in EBIT or EPS, that actually 
didn't change, even though revenue numbers came up a little bit, so is it 
just more of a rounding situation there?
 
Hugh F. Johnston 
-
 
PepsiCo, Inc.
 
Yeah, I'll 
answer the third question first, Judy. It was rounding. So the 
revenue tipped towards 2% but earnings stayed at 3%, but they both 
improved directionally, just one tipped over into 2% and the other stayed at 
3%. Regarding the Frito
-
Lay business, two big num
bers to point to that I 
think both cover the volume and also cover the pricing question that you're 
asking; the two big factors regarding why volume was down in the quarter, 
and both are temporary in that regard, number one was the New Year's 
build. As Ind
ra pointed out in her opening, New Year's fell into the 53rd 
week. In the previous year, it fell into Quarter 1 of the year. That cost us 
about 1.3 points on volume for the quarter.
 
The second was some of the challenges that we had in the Sabra business 
du
e to some product challenges, which we're now through and have largely 
solved. That cost us about six
-
tenths of a point on volume for the quarter. 
Now, one of the things to keep in mind is we don't get revenue credit for 
Sabra because it's a 50%
-
50% JV. We
 
get, obviously, volume credit and we 
get profit credit. By virtue of that six
-
tenths of a point coming out of volume 
but not having an impact on revenue, it probably made it appear that there 
was more pricing than there is.
 
Net, I think we've got our Frit
o
-
Lay pricing in the right place for the year. 
And as you see the Sabra volume start to come back, you should see 
improved volume performance. Obviously, we'll be out of the Easter as well 
as the New Year's overlap, and the volume will certainly come back 
because 
of that. Those were temporary factors, so.
 
Indra K. Nooyi 
-
 
PepsiCo, Inc.
 
And we're already seeing the volume back.
 
Hugh F. Johnston

U.S. and Frito

Lay and all and the beverage business as well, what could we 
expect in terms of like should we expect more of a smoother qua
rters at the 
balance of the year? Appreciate that, thank you.
 
Hugh F. Johnston

PepsiCo, Inc.
 
Yeah, happy to. So for Beverages, you saw 1% revenue and 3% operating 
profit growth. I think you will see that strengthen slightly. And then for Frito, 
you saw 2
% revenue and 4% operating profit growth. Again, I think you 
should expect to see that strengthen slightly as we get into the balance of 
the year. Quaker, we certainly expected to see a bit of improved 
performance. So, I think you'll see all the numbers li
ft a little bit as we get 
out of the first quarter and into the balance of the year.

Hey, thanks. 
Good morning. Good morning. So picking up on the pricing 
theme, it was again a pretty large driver of growth organically in Latin 
America this quarter. And maybe just could just talk a little bit more about 
how that played out, snacks versus beverages. But
 
more importantly, 
looking ahead, do you see that current pricing trend as sustainable, just 
given some of the comments made by your competitor yesterday, at least 
with respect to Brazil, as well as the currency reversals we've begun to see 
since the start
 
of the year? I guess a similar question might relate to Russia 
and Eastern Europe, as well.
 
Hugh F. Johnston 
-
 
PepsiCo, Inc.
 
Yeah, I'm happy to handle that one, Steve. We do expect to continue to see 
solid pricing down in Latin America. A couple things to think about in that 
regard, our beverage business in Brazil is relatively small, so we are 
somewhat insulated from some of th
e commentary that they made. In 
addition to that, our biggest business in Latin America is Mexico, where we 
continue to see very strong performance, both from the beverage business 
and particularly in our very large snack food business. And then, last but 
not 
least, obviously, Argentina has very high rates of inflation. That does create 
a significant pricing benefit in our overall numbers. So I do think we'll 
continue to see somewhat similar results.
 
To the degree that the pricing trends need to moderate be
cause of certain 
countries, I think you'll see, as you saw last year, improved volume 
performance. That's been our history in Latin America is as the pricing 
comes down from what are visually high single
-
digit types of numbers, our 
volume does tend to pick
 
up. So I'm comfortable with the trends. You may 
see a bit more balance between volume and pricing is all.
 
Operator
 
Your next question comes...
 
Hugh F. Johnston 
-
 
PepsiCo, Inc.
 
Sorry. The last question was regarding Russia. Again, I think same answer 
there
. You'll probably see less pricing. The pricing was very ForEx driven 
anyway. So to the degree that the Russian consumer economy continues to 
strengthen, and as ForEx has less of an impact, I think you'll see us take 
less pricing but you'll see stronger vo
lumes, so you'll probably get a fairly 
similar revenue result.

Good morning, Indra. Good morning, Hugh. Question about Quaker. I mean, 
despite Quaker being one of the LTS of all (34:54) PepsiCo brands, it seems 
the top line has been soft for quite some time, n
ow including this quarter. At 
the same time, operating margin have reached a new high with 27.4% in 
the quarter. So could you please give us more color on this business 
segment and is this first quarter kind of a reflection of what we should see 
for the en
tire year?
 
Indra K. Nooyi 
-
 
PepsiCo, Inc.
 
Great question, Laurent. I'd say the Quaker business internationally outside 
the United States is doing very well. Solid growth, we are entering new 
markets. It's doing very, very well. In the U.S., the Quaker Nort
h America 
numbers that you see includes the Quaker hot cereal, which is where the 
Quaker brand is housed. And then all of the other businesses that go within 
Quaker North America, including Rice
-
A
-
Roni, Pasta Roni, Aunt Jemima, 
there's a whole bunch of oth
er businesses, ready
-
to
-
eat cereals. One
-
third of 
the business is the Quaker hot cereals. And the Quaker hot cereals business, 
I'd say, over the past few years, has been flat to very slightly down. And the 
only reason why the overall portfolio looks negati
ve is because it's center 
store business in grocery stores. And the overall center store category is 
down high single digits, sometimes even low double digits in some quarters.
 
And so while we are outperforming the center store categories handsomely, 
I thi
nk our next challenge is how do we leverage our relationships with 
retailers to reinvent center store. And that's a conversation we've been 
having with some of the retailers to say how can we help you rethink the 
center store so that we can bring growth ba
ck to that category. And we need 
to do that in order to bring interest back to that whole cereal aisle and, 
therefore, Quaker. By itself, Quaker remains a much
-
loved brand and it's 
profitable. And our hope is that with the rejuvenation of center store, our
 
categories grow, too.

So, Indra, the commentary in terms of cate
gory trends in North America 
exiting the quarter is certainly encouraging, but given how much pricing you 
saw this quarter and how reliant the business has been on pricing for some 
time now, in particular in Frito, can you talk about the evolution of price
 
elasticity in your categories and whether you're seeing any shift there given 
some of the nearer
-
term consumer softness? Thank you.
 
Indra K. Nooyi 
-
 
PepsiCo, Inc.
 
Yes. I think to talk about elasticity on a category basis is too general, Vivien. 
I think we
 
look at elasticity sub
-
segment by sub
-
segment. And all the pricing 
we've put in place in the U.S. is very carefully looking at the elasticity 
curves. And we look to see what kind of pricing the consumer can adopt, 
what kind of volume impact it will have a
nd what can we sustain as a 
portfolio. And I think that what you're seeing right now is pricing that was 
sensible for the first quarter. And as the year goes on, I mean, look, we put 
the pricing in place in Q1, or in fact, I'd say Q4 we started putting the
 
pricing in place, and that's ticking through the year. And we modify that as 
we go along if we believe that we need to change our promotional calendar 
to accommodate the consumer trends. I don't know, Hugh, if you want to 
add anything.
 
Hugh F. Johnston 
-
 
PepsiCo, Inc.
 
Yeah, I completely agree with that. And in addition to that, if you look at our 
pricing in North America, macro top level, it's generally in the 2s, kind of in 
the low 2% range. And given commodity inflation is low single digits, I think 
that
's sustainable pricing. Now, the Frito pricing appears a little bit larger 
than that because of the Sabra conversation that we had earlier, because we 
were hit on volume and, obviously, it doesn't have an impact on us on 
revenue. But as that normalizes, I 
think you'll see Frito pricing in the 2s, I 
think you'll see beverage pricing in the 2s and Quaker pricing in the 2s, and 
I think that's a reasonable place for us to be for the long term. I think that's 
very consistent with what those businesses can sustai
n in a modest 
inflationary environment.

Thanks. Good morning. Hey, morning, guy
s, morning, Indra. Indra, question 
for you, if I may, on soda taxes. Naturally, seem to be increasing focus. The 
law passed in Philadelphia, which received a lot of attention and has had a 
pretty profound impact on entry volumes. And now we have the vote 
u
pcoming in Santa Fe, and then there's reports they have a rather well
-
known advocate behind such taxes, putting money into that market behind 
the effort. So, Indra, hoping to get your updated thoughts there on risk to 
your business and to the industry; may
be even some historical context for 
how you view this risk now relative to recent years. Thank you.
 
Indra K. Nooyi 
-
 
PepsiCo, Inc.
 
Thanks, Kevin. Look, at the end of the day, we oppose beverage taxes that 
are regressive and unfairly target one category or 
industry. I think, 
unfortunately, today's beverage taxes are more revenue generation
-
focused 
rather than health
-
focused. But whatever the reason be, from our 
perspective, we are working on two things: one, making our portfolio deliver 
products that are low
er in sugar and a lot of zero sugar products and 
beverages with positive nutrition. So that's one part of our strategy, and 
we've been working on that for 10 years.
 
The second part of our strategy, making sure we bolster the rest of the 
portfolio outside o
f beverages. So when taxes do come in, we can cushion 
the effect through managing the portfolio in a more intelligent way. And 
that's been our strategy over the last decade because we anticipated some 
of these trends early on and we started to re
-
tool the 
company for that.
 
So at this point, let me just say that our strategy is crystal clear and we feel 
comfortable as to where we are headed.

Now, it's my pleasure to introduce Indra Nooyi.
 
Indra Nooyi
 
Thank you, Jamie, and thank 
you all for joining us this morning. We will start 
off this morning with highlights for the third quarter and a discussion of each 
of the operating sectors' performances in a little more detail; and then Hugh 
will cover the full year outlook.
 
For the quart
er, we delivered revenue, operating profit, and EPS growth in 
what continues to be a volatile macro environment. Organic revenue was up 
1.7% for the quarter and 2.3% year
-
to
-
date with solid net price realization 
operating margin expansion in most of the se
ctors.
 
Although we have moderated our full year organic revenue growth outlook, 
we now expect full year core EPS of $5.23, which is 2 percentage points or 
$0.10 higher than our previous expectation. This improvement is being 
driven by the strength of our y
ear
-
to
-
date results, coupled with an improved 
outlook on foreign exchange impact.
 

expectations with the numbers showing sequential topline acceleration, with 
the exception of our North Ameri
can Beverages business, where net revenue 
and operating profit declined. So, let me start with that.
 
While North American Beverage performance was below our expectations, I 
will tell you upfront that the issues are temporary and we believe we have 
taken th
e necessary actions to improve the performance of this business 
beginning in Q4.
 
So, what happened? From an industry perspective, weather was 
comparatively negative, both temperature and precipitation, following record 
hot summers in 2015 and 2016, and the
re was a marked slowdown in the C
-
store channel in Q3. Now given this as a background, our performance did 
lag the industry, no question about it.
 
First, Gatorade, which accounts for approximately one
-
fifth of our Q3 volume 
declined following two sequentia
l years of terrific Q3 growth. In fact, Q3 
volumes were up a total of 18% over 2015 and 2016.
 
Relative to other beverage categories, this is one that is both much more 
sensitive to weather and more exposed to the C
-
store channel. So the 
broader weather and
 
C
-
store industry themes I just mentioned had an 
outsized impact on Gatorade.
 
Second, we underperformed the industry in carbonated beverages. This 
summer, we directed too much of our media spending and shelf space to 
new low
-
calorie, much smaller brands at
 
the expense of our Pepsi and 
Mountain Dew trademarks. While our plans for the summer were consistent 
with our continued and deliberate strategy to transform our beverage 
portfolio.
 
Clearly, we redirected some big brand space to these new products as 
oppos
ed to focusing on new incremental space. We view both of these 
conditions as temporary and not structural, and we fully expect topline 
performance to improve in the coming quarters.
 
We have a good handle on what happened, and we are making immediate 
adjust
ments to get the business back to growth. We are stepping up 
marketing spending on Pepsi and Mountain Dew, including our zero and low 
calorie products under these trademarks.
 
We are reallocating and securing incremental shelf space in this place for our 
ex
isting and new products to drive better overall velocity. We are tweaking 
our consumer communication with sharper brand messaging on pack, at 
point of sale, and through traditional social and digital media.
 
We have more innovation directed at our biggest t
rademarks, including low 
and no calorie products that will hit the market starting in early 2018, and 
we're executing our programs responsibly to ensure that we're driving 
profitable growth. With the expected improved topline, we also expect 
improved profi
t performance as we realize both mix and scale benefits from 
the improved sales trajectory.
 
To be clear, our beverage transformation initiatives over the longer term 
have been very successful in shifting our mix to faster growing subcategories 
and providin
g more low and zero sugar options.
 
Since 2010, we have increased our mix of non
-
carbonated beverages by 7 
percentage points. Over the decades, we have established and maintained 
leadership positions in many of the most attractive noncarbonated 
categories, 
and we have successfully introduced many offerings to appeal to 
consumers' increasing demand for zero and low calorie offers. So, make no 
mistake about it, we remain squarely on strategy and having made a few 
course corrections, expect NAB to return to gro
wth in the coming quarters.
 
Moving on to Frito
-
Lay North America, we had another quarter of very strong 
results, with a good balance of volume growth, net price realization, and 
operating margin expansion.
 
We feel very good about the business with innovati
on, pricing, execution, 
and market share performance all on target. We are particularly pleased 
with the continuing strength in organic sales growth, which is being fueled 
by effective price pack management and innovation backed by great 
marketing.
 
Take Cheetos as an example. We drove 6% net revenue growth for the 
trademark in Q3 with new products, such as Cheetos Paws, Jalapeño 
Cheetos, and our SIMPLY line, and Mac n' Cheetos also contributing to the 
growth.
 
The innovation is well
-
supported by creat
ive consumer engagement that 
included our award
-
winning Cheetos virtual museum campaign that asks, 
""What do you see in your Cheetos?"" The program garnered 100,000 online 
consumer submissions and countless earned media impressions.
 
Ruffles, which grew net r
evenue 11% in the quarter benefited from 
innovations such as Spicy Jalapeño Ranch and Flamin' Hot that appeal to 
consumers' increasing desire for both flavors.
 
And beyond our largest trademarks, we saw impressive double
-
digit net 
revenue growth in premium 
and better
-
for
-
you offerings such as SunChips, 
Smartfood Popcorn, and Miss Vickie's and in our variety multipacks that 
provided great assortment of our top brands in convenient single
-
serve 
packages.
 
At Quaker Foods North America, we are pleased with the s
equential 
acceleration in organic volume, organic revenue, and core operating profit 
performance, and we continue to feel positive about the trends in the 
business.
 
Our activations of portable breakfast innovation, namely Breakfast Flats 
launched in 2016 a
nd Breakfast Squares that were launched in the first 
quarter are yielding positive results.
 
And our second quarter launch of Overnight Oats Cups, capitalizing on the 
growing trend of preparing chilled oats using a variety of healthy ingredients 
is also gai
ning traction with consumers. Taken together, our innovation and 
other programming drove mid
-
single
-
digit volume growth in our base 
oatmeal portfolio.
 
To wrap
-
up North America, I'm pleased to report that year
-
to
-
date through 
the third quarter, we generated
 
more retail food and beverage revenue 
growth in the United States measured channels than all other 5 billion plus 
manufacturers combined. And in the third quarter, Frito
-
Lay on a standalone 
basis was once again the number one contributor to total U.S. foo
d and 
beverage retail growth among all 5 billion plus manufacturers.
 
Turning now to our sectors outside North America. In Latin America, we 
continue to see very challenging macroeconomic conditions and geopolitical 
instability, which dampened consumer spen
ding.
 
As we enter our fourth quarter, the devastating impact of the Mexico 
earthquakes and hurricanes in the Caribbean and Puerto Rico are clearly 
adding to these challenges. Within this context, our businesses in the region 
performed well in the third qua
rter, posting 5% organic revenue growth.
 
Mexico, our largest market in the region, had high single
-
digit organic 
revenue growth, while Brazil grew organic revenue mid
-
single
-
digits. 
Similarly, we have continued to experience macro challenges in a number of
 
markets throughout our Asia, Middle East, and North Africa segment, 
including the significant currency devaluation in Egypt and the economic 
impacts in a number of markets across the Middle East stemming from 
persistently low oil prices.
 
However, we have 
been adjusting our business to address these challenges. 
We are pricing to cover the increased cost of doing business and we are 
going more aggressively after productivity to reduce our overall costs. As a 
result, we saw a noticeable improvement this quart
er as AMENA delivered 
9% organic revenue growth driven by double
-
digit organic revenue growth 
in China, Pakistan, Philippines, Egypt.
 
And turning to Europe and Sub
-
Sahara Africa, we had very good results 
across the region, with organic revenue growth in ea
ch of our top four 
markets, along with six of the next seven key markets and a sequential 
acceleration overall, which translates to margin expansion and 12% core 
constant currency operating profit growth.
 
Organic revenue growth was well balanced across sna
cks and beverages, 
which grew high single
-
digit and mid
-
single
-
digit respectively, driven by 
strong product innovation and in
-
market executions.
 
Russia, our largest market in the region, had mid
-
single
-
digit organic 
revenue growth and very strong operating
 
margin improvement. Among our 
other key markets, we delivered double
-
digit organic revenue growth in 
Turkey, mid
-
single
-
digit organic revenue growth in France, Poland and 
Germany, and low single
-
digit organic revenue growth in the U.K.
 
Now as we mentioned
 
last quarter, across our businesses, we're pleased 
with the progress we're making in the e
-
commerce channels, and I say 
channels, plural, because we're addressing growth opportunities across 
eGrocery, pureplay, urban grocery delivery, direct
-
to
-
business a
nd direct
-
to
-
consumer models.
 
Our success is underpinned by the significant investments we've made in 
attracting talents to and building capabilities in our dedicated global e
-
commerce business unit. So today, we have a team of roughly 200 e
-
commerce profe
ssionals supporting our businesses to capture growth in the 
rapidly emerging e
-
commerce channels.
 
It's made up of seasoned e
-
commerce and tech professionals, combined with 
our best entrepreneurial talent from within PepsiCo and we're managing this 
unit mor
e like a tech company than a traditional CPG from how and where 
they work, the risks they can take, to how they are compensated. And we 
continue to fortify and enhance the full suite of capabilities that we believe 
will enable us to win in these channels f
rom data analytics to specialized e
-
commerce supply chain knowhow.
 
Importantly, we're increasingly collaborating with our retail customers to 
make our e
-
commerce capabilities yet another point of differentiation in our 
value
-
added relationships with them.
 
For example, using big data and predictive analytics to shape real
-
time 
marketing messages, dynamic merchandising, and tailored offers, our team 
is enabling us to drive greater purchase instrumentality and higher basket 
size for our customers online.
 
As a 
result of these efforts, we have a business that's approximately $1 
billion in annualized retail sales with impressive growth in key e
-
commerce 
markets. For example, this year, our e
-
commerce retail sales are projected 
to be up 80% in the United States and
 
nearly double in China.
 
In many cases, our online share exceeds our offline share and we are 
gaining online pretty much across the Board. While overall penetration of 
food and beverage remains relatively low compared to most of the 
categories, it is growi
ng fast and its development is sure to be highly 
dynamic, and we believe we are well
-
positioned to win in this space.
 
Despite the many macro challenges, we continue to feel good about the 
state of our business. The fundamentals we have been focusing on and
 
discussing with you remains solidly intact. We have a leading product 
portfolio and deep capabilities.
 
We continue to drive growth, product innovation, exceptional marketing, and 
innovation. We continue to transform our portfolio to capitalize on evolving
 
consumer trends and we have a robust productivity agenda that is enabling 
us to continue to invest in the business, while delivering attractive earnings 
growth.
 
And finally this quarter demonstrated that the PepsiCo portfolio does have 
the capacity to gen
erate topline and bottom
-
line growth even in the 
occasional quarter where we see a downturn in a particular sector. And it is 
the resilience of the portfolio that is also enabling us to increase our 
earnings outlook for the year.
 
With that, let me turn the
 
call over to Hugh. Hugh?
 
Hugh Johnston
 
Thank you, Indra and good morning everyone. Turning to guidance, we 
expect our full year organic revenue growth to approximate the 2.3% rate 
we have achieved through the first three quarters. We expect core constant 
currency EPS to grow 9%, a one percentage point increase compared to our 
previous guidance.
 
Based on current market consensus rates, foreign exchange is expected to 
negatively impact both full year reported net revenue and EPS by 
approximately one 
percentage point, which compares to the previous market 
estimates of two points. So, as a result of the improved outlooks for both 
core constant currency EPS growth and foreign exchange, we now expect 
core earnings of $5.23 per share.
 
In terms of other key
 
considerations and assumptions embedded in our full 
year outlook, we continue to expect low single
-
digit raw material inflation, 
driven both by an increase in our basket of commodities, and some pressure 
from transaction ForEx.
 
We continue to expect core 
operating margin expansion fueled by our 
productivity programs. Our productivity programs are on track to achieve 
our annual $1 billion target and we continue to expect our core effective tax 
rate to be approximately 24%.
 
Turning to cash flow, we expect to
 
continue to generate strong cash flow and 
to exercise discipline over capital allocation with prudent reinvestment in the 
business and the majority of our free cash flow, excluding certain items, to 
be returned to shareholders through dividends and share 
repurchases.
 
So, for 2017, we continue to expect approximately $10 billion in cash flow 
from operations, net capital spending of approximately $3 billion, 
approximately $7 billion in free cash flow, excluding certain items, cash 
dividends of approximately 
$4.5 billion. Recall that we previously announced 
a 7% increase in our quarterly dividend that began with the June payment. 
This represents the 45th consecutive year in which we've increased our 
dividend and share repurchases of approximately $2 billion.
 
F
inally, as you update your models, I'd like to highlight the following three 
items as they relate to the fourth quarter. We are lapping the 53rd
-
week 
from 2016 and expect our reported revenue to be negatively impacted by 
three percentage points, we estimat
e the impact of the recent natural 
disasters to negatively impact EPS of by approximately three percentage 
points, and we expect sequential improvement at our North American 
Beverage business.
 
With that, we are ready to take the first question.

Operator
 
Thank you. [Operator Instructions]
 
Our first question comes from Judy Hong with Goldman Sachs.
 
Judy Hong
 
Thank you. Good morning everyone. So, Indra I guess I just wanted to get a 
little bit more color just in terms of North Ameri
ca. Clearly, you've seen 
some volume pressure in the quarter, maybe a little bit more details around 
the brand performance in terms of how much volume was down across your 
brands.
 
And then I think you talked about some of the challenges from a weather 
and 
C
-
store traffic perspective, but maybe talk a little bit more about the 
competitive backdrop, because it does seem like there's some small brands 
that are gaining share, maybe there is a little bit better execution from your 
key competitors, so if you coul
d just talk through those issues?
 
Indra Nooyi
 
Look, we have gone deep on the business to understand what is 
environmental factors that contributed to our performance and what is our 

at, 
roughly speaking, my assessment is about 70 
-
30 in terms of what the 
weather, the precipitation, what the C
-
store slowdown caused to the 
business, and what we could have done differently.
 
And as I said in the script, Judy, Gatorade is a big part of our
 
business and 
we were lapping 18% over 2015 and 2016, and with a slowdown of C
-
stores 
--
 
C
-
store traffic and the weather patterns in Q3, clearly Gatorade was 
impacted because the weather has an outsized impact on Gatorade. That 
was the first one.
 
The secon
d is CSDs. We've been embarking on a deliberate strategy to shift 
the portfolio to lower calorie offerings and they tend to be more non
-
carbonated beverages, and that's why we shifted about seven points of the 
portfolio to non
-
carbs.
 
We have a lot more low
er calorie and zero calorie innovation in CSDs, and 
we actually have it even under the big brands, the Pepsi and the Mountain 
Dew brands. So, what we're going to be doing going forward is taking the 
big brands and doing a lot more low calorie and zero calo
rie offerings under 
that brand.
 
So, I tell you if I looked at this quarter, the only two that we need to focus 
on is getting Gatorade back to growth, which we're already beginning to see 
and tweaking our advertising spending against Pepsi and Dew.
 
The thin
g to be very careful about is we are focused on responsible growth. 
During the quarter, as we saw the trends, we could have very quickly hit a 
promotional lever and tried to drive growth, and we tried our best not to do 
that because we think that once you 
go down this promotional spiral, it's 
never
-
ending. So, our team is focused on profitable growth, responsible 
growth, and we are all focused on getting CSD trademarks and Gatorade 
back to growth.
 
Operator
 
Our next question comes from Laurent Grandet with f
rom Credit Suisse.
 
Indra Nooyi
 
Good morning Laurent.
 
Laurent Grandet
 

mean specifically 
--
 
I mean more structural issues I mean of CSD the 
business. I mean, it seems like Coke is getting
 
shares clearly 
--
 
the 
competition would be higher next year as, I mean, your competitor would be 
fully refranchised.
 
What do you think about what's happening really in the marketplace against 
your key competitors? And how you think you will be able to tur
n this 
business around? I'm thinking more about the CSD business here. I know 
you said you will spend more in your A&M, but in terms of operating more in 
the business would be interesting to understand.
 
Indra Nooyi
 
Okay. Let me give my comments and 
then Hugh step in with yours. I 
actually believe ownership of the bulk of the bottling system is an advantage 
because you can actually do two things. One, you can flex them quickly and 
second is that you can extract more productivity from a bigger base. So
, I 
actually believe it's a good thing.
 
During a period when a refranchising is going on, what happens is that you 
have funds that you can use to deploy against the market. But that is a 
temporary situation and that is going to get exhausted very soon.
 
So,
 
we have to be careful that while the marketplace might have extra 
funding during a refranchising activity, we don't overreact by hitting a 
promotion lever to get short
-
term value 
--
 
volume in the business.
 
Having said that, what are the structural issues 
we see? One, we see a 
continued decline in full
-
sugar beverages. We see consumers shifting to 
lower calorie and zero calorie beverages. And we do see a lot of little 
competitors coming into the marketplace with interesting new beverage 
offerings, some of w
hich stick, many of them don't stick.
 
So, what we have to do is create an entity within our company that does 
smaller brands, but smaller brands that stick and grow into medium size and 
bigger brands, we have to create that capability, which we are doing; 
and 
second is that the big lesson from Q3 is that it is an and game, not an or 
game.
 
When we launch new products, we have to go for new shelf space. The core 
shelf space, especially in C
-
stores for the big brand, we have to protect the 
hell out of it and t
hat's what we're going to do. And Hugh, do you want to 
add anything to it?
 
Hugh Johnston
 
No, I think you've captured it well. The only thing that I would add is there 
clearly is going to be a competitive difference between the way our primary 
competitor is
 
going to the market and the way we are. As Indra said, we 
think our strategy is the right one for all the reasons that are mentioned. 
And in addition to that, we think that that structure of the industry will lead 
to healthy competition, not destructive c
ompetition.
 
So, I think we are positioned well to see a healthy competitive environment. 
The consumer change is going to continue to be more towards lower calorie 
options and because of our investments in R&D, we think we are advantaged 
to capture those co
nsumers as they move into the healthier options.
 
Indra Nooyi
 
But you know, Hugh, it's also safe to say that, as a leadership, we are 
focused singularly on value creation, shareholder value creation and we spot 
trends and if we think we have to make changes
 
in our business, we do that. 
So, at this point, we think our strategy is the right strategy.
 
Operator
 
Our next question comes from Bonnie Herzog with Wells Fargo.
 
Bonnie Herzog
 
Good morning. Hi. I guess I was just hoping you could drill down a little 
more
 
on your full year guidance and really what has changed now that you 
expect to deliver the 9% EPS growth despite your topline being slightly 
weaker. I know, Indra, you touched on topline for your North American 
Beverage business improving. So, I'm trying t
o think about that relative to 
what your expectations are for Frito revenue?
 
And then I still really unfair what of the levers are that you can pull to drive 
the faster EPS growth in light of a more difficult cost environment? And then 
maybe if you could j
ust touch what drove the sharp reduction in your 
corporate expense line in the quarter? What that was from and then how 
much more of an opportunity there could be for further reduction? Thanks.
 
Indra Nooyi
 
Go ahead Hugh.
 
Hugh Johnston
 
Yes, Bonnie, happy to
 
answer that. Two factors, all right. It's not being 
driven by aggregate revenue and it's not being driven by tax rate. As we 
noted the tax rates are same. Two primary factors. Number one is costs 
we're expecting now to come in a little bit better than we 
had previously 
forecast. And number two, we expect the mix of business to be a little bit 
more profitable, little better and those two factors gave us about an extra 
point of EPS growth.
 
Indra Nooyi
 
And in terms of overall cost management, we put in place 
a Smart Spending 
program about one year ago. And as the months go by, we just get better at 
being smarter and smarter with Smart Spending. And what you're seeing, 
because right here in corporate, we drive Smart Spending very, very 
seriously and that's wher
e you're seeing the reduction in corporate cost.
 
Operator
 
Our next question comes from Vivien Azer with Cowen and Company.
 
Indra Nooyi
 
Good morning Vivien.
 
Vivien Azer
 
Good morning. Indra I was hoping we could touch on C
-
store again, please? 
I 
appreciated your comments on the channel sluggishness and the impact 
that's having on your Beverage business, but it does seem like there is a 
disconnect. And specifically, that's while beverages are under pressure, your 
salty snacks business actually look
s to be outperforming pretty materially in 
that channel. So, if you could address that divergence that would be helpful? 
Thank you.
 
Hugh Johnston
 
Yes, I'm happy to answer that one, Vivien. A couple of things going on there. 
One, Frito
-
Lay really does have 
a wonderful balance of core products and 
great execution this year, and that's certainly helping us in the convenience 
store channel. And the truth is Frito
-
Lay is actually bucking what's a broad 
trend of challenges across most products in the channel.
 
In 
terms of what's driving the channel, volumes are down a little bit across 
the Board and C
-
store; pricing is up a little bit, three biggest factors in 
challenging the channel traffic. Number one, gas prices were up particularly 
in the latter half of the thi
rd quarter.
 
Number two, construction was down a little bit during the course of the 
summer and that negatively impacted traffic. And number three, we didn't 
get the heat burst this summer in late July and August that we had seen in 
the previous two summers
 
and that negatively impacted the channel.
 
Operator
 
Our next question comes from Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley.
 
Indra Nooyi
 
Dara good morning.
 
Dara Mohsenian
 
Hi, good morning. So, if we look at the year
-
to
-
date results or your full year 
guidance, it l
ooks like versus years past, we're seeing low organic sales 
growth, weaker gross margin trends to get to that very solid 9% core EPS 
growth.
 
So clearly, you're relying more on SG&A leverage and cost cutting. So just a 
couple of questions off that. First, H
ugh, is there something that's changed 
from an SG&A or cost
-
control standpoint, where this improved pace of SG&A 
leverage see longer term? Or is it more isolated to this year and some of the 
Smart Spending Indra mentioned? So, just trying to understand if 
that 
changing trend is something that can get you to longer term.
 
And then second, Indra, you obviously made comments on the Beverage 
business and reinvestment in Q4 and theoretically within the next couple of 
quarters. Given the overall topline slowdown i
n the industry pressure points, 
is there greater reinvestment in your mind that's needed back behind the 
business, beyond just Q4 in light of the difficult industry environment and 
just that pressure of the typical earnings algorithm you've been able to 
de
liver historically? Thanks.
 
Indra Nooyi
 
I'll answer the second answer, and then, Hugh, you should take the first one 
and talk about what's changed. I think that the thing to be careful about is 
not just the reinvestment, it's how much and in what. It's bet
ter to invest in 
pull activities than to hit the pedal on push activities. Because when you 
start getting into this competitive battle of more and more promotions, 
we've been there, done that, I don't think that's a way to create long
-
term, 
strong business
es. So, we've tended to focus more on innovation and pull
-
related spending, more A&M spending.
 
The shift to digital is a question mark because I don't know what the ROI on 
digital is as yet. And we're relooking at all elements of our marketing 
spending to 
see exactly which method of spending gives us the best ROI by 
brand. So, that's a piece of work we are doing.
 
What we want to do over the next few quarters is look at our brand portfolio 
and see how best to do trademark advertising, so we can focus on the 
big 
brands and still drive lower calorie products.
 
The thing to be careful about is this industry should not escalate to going 
from push spending to pull spending and everybody throws a lot of money 
into this business. It's going to be a judicious manageme
nt of this business, 
where you've got the right amount of A&M spending and judicious execution, 
so this business remains profitable going forward.
 
I think that's where ownership of the bottling business is going to make a 
huge difference because we can wor
k all of these levers very carefully. So, 
the next few quarters, watch and see what we do to tweak our spending and 
what the benefits are. We feel reasonably confident.
 
Hugh Johnston
 
Yes, I'm happy to jump in on the SG&A question, Dara. You're right, we 
--
 
our gross margins were down a few basis points, operating margin was up a 
few basis point. The biggest change that we've seen over the last couple of 
years is Smart Spending. We have about 30 big categories of spend. We've 
really only gotten into about fi
ve or six of them at this point. The ones that 
we've done are the relatively simpler ones that 
--
 
the travel outside services, 
facilities and things like that.
 
The more complex areas of spend when you get into distribution, when you 
get into selling, when 
you get into certain elements of non
-
working A&M, 
those take a little bit longer. We're working on them right now. We have 
plans to and expect to see results from those areas of spend over the next 
couple of years. So, to complete the answer to your questi
on, we do expect 
to be able to continue to leverage Smart Spending to deliver outsized 
productivity results for the coming years.

Our next question comes from Bryan Spillane with Bank of America.
 
Indra Nooyi
 
Good morning Bryan.
 
Bryan Spillane
 
Hi, 
good morning everyone. I guess my question is maybe a follow
-
up to 
Dara's question with regard to the algorithm. One of the questions that we 
fielded a lot this year is just whether or not the PepsiCo long
-
term algorithm 
is really sustainable given how 
--
 
all the dynamic changes happening at 
retail in the U.S., category trends in beverages.
 
So Indra, could you just sort of give your sort of state of the algorithm 
relative to all the changes that we're seeing occur in the marketplace today, 
and sort of 
how PepsiCo is just ensuring that you've still got the sort of the 
right resources and whether that algorithm is still right?
 
Indra Nooyi
 
So, Bryan, we're not a talking about any long
-
term algorithm or guidance at 
this point. We usually do that in the Febr
uary meeting. But let me tell you in 
broad shapes, our focus is on innovation, our focus is on portfolio expansion, 
our focus is on shift to Better For You, Good For You products. And our focus 
is on productivity and stepped up levels of productivity.
 
The 
whole goal is to marry our innovation capability with our productivity 
programs. And we've had remarkable success over many, many, many 
quarters. This one quarter was a bit of a [Indiscernible] on North American 
Beverages, and I call it [Indiscernible] bec
ause there were many external 
factors that caused this. And believe me, we are all over this business and 
we will be back. There is no issue.
 
So from a long
-
term algorithm, just wait until February next year when we 
do give you the guidance. But all I say 
to you, our focus is on balanced top 
and bottom
-
line growth. Invest in the topline; make sure the right 
productivity to deliver the bottom
-
line growth. Make sure that you invest in 
all the new capabilities needed and generate the productivity to invest in 
new capabilities. That is a tried and tested playbook, and we're not backing 
off of that.
 
Operator
 
Our next question comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays.
 
Indra Nooyi
 
Lauren good morning.
 
Lauren Lieberman
 
Good morning. Thank you. Two things. 
First was just a follow
-
up for Hugh on 
the Smart Spend conversation. You've mentioned I think 30 buckets; you're 
five to six in so far. I'm just curious, is it sort like a pro rata potential, where 
these first five to six are not just a little easier to ge
t at, but also bigger 
pools than kind of what's still to be explored and understand the complexity? 
That was one.
 
Two is just going back again; I apologize, to North America Beverages, but 
year
-
to
-
date, at least externally the trends haven't been great or 
less good 
than they've been in the past. So, you'd also already talked about prior to 
today putting more money behind big franchises, you talked about behind 
CSDs. If I think back to the Super Bowl, it was Pepsi Zero Sugar that was 
supported.
 
So, I'm just 
curious kind of how some of this redirecting spending already 
started? It seems on TV 
--
 
I know I'm seeing a lot of the Pepsi ads, are you 
seeing any lift from that yet? I'm just 
--
 
I'm surprised the degree to which 
--
 
at sort of this point in time, that s
omething went off internally that say we 
need to redirect and replan and it didn't happen earlier in the year. So, if 
you can just address kind of what flipped the switch for guys on thinking 
through this a bit differently?
 
Indra Nooyi
 
You want to take the
 
first part, Hugh?
 
Hugh Johnston
 
Yes, I'm happy to handle that one. Lauren, in terms of the buckets, I would 
characterize our timing of them not about size, but just about complexity. 
Travel is obviously a relatively simple bucket to get after when you get
 
into 
distribution and selling and things like, those are just more complex buckets 
of spend.
 
The size actually of the buckets that we haven't gotten to yet is substantially 
larger than the size of the buckets that we have already gotten to. So, I 
would th
ink of it as there's lots more opportunity out there, but it just takes 
more time to get at them.
 
Travel and facilities and outside services and things like that are relatively 
simple and straightforward to get at, so that's why we're seeing those 
benefits
 
more immediately. But it's not a question of running out of runway 
on the size of opportunity.
 
Indra Nooyi
 
And talking about NAB trends. When you're looking at weather and you're 
looking at precipitation, you don't plan for a cooler weather or higher leve
ls 
of precipitation. So, we fully expected that this summer would be a normal 
summer, not a flaming hot summer, but we thought it'd be normal summer. 
And so we kept investing behind the brands like Gatorade, but then when 
the weather completely turned sout
h and 
--
 
not literally, but it was cooler 
and a lot more precipitation, that advertising spending did not give us much 
lift as we would've liked the business to get.
 
Now, if we have not been lapping the 18% growth, it's a whole different 
ballgame. The prob
lem is the combination of lapping the 18% growth for the 
last two years in Gatorade, plus the fact that we had a cooler summer this 
year, when it's our seasonally big quarter is what caused the issue.
 
And one of the things we've told our businesses is that
 
don't do anything in 
the short
-
term which will have no lasting impact for the long
-
term. Many 
years ago, we use to just hit the promotional spending lever. And I think 
what we're doing very carefully now is saying don't hit the promotional 
spending lever 
because that won't last for the long
-
term.
 
So, the weather was a big factor. And we hate to use weather as an excuse, 
Lauren, but the weather was a big factor. And we didn't make all the 
changes anticipating poor weather, we just kept playing our playbook 
and 
that's what caused the issue. Again, it's temporary, we're taking the actions 
and we are all over it.
 
Operator
 
Our next question comes from Ali Dibadj with Bernstein.
 
Indra Nooyi
 
Good morning Ali.
 
Ali Dibadj
 
Hey how are you? So, I actually have two 
questions. One is I really 
appreciate the conversation about responsible growth and push versus pull. 
So, I just really want to make sure that I'm understanding correctly that the 
tactics going forward to improve some of the slowdown in a NAB is not going 
to be major increase in promotion, it's not going to be lowering price mix. 
So, I just want to underline that point and make sure that's not part of the 
plan going forward.
 
And then related to that, second question, I guess I'm a little confused about 
the 
margin discussion that we've been having here. Because it sounds like 
we're saying there are bigger pies to go after, we're going to get more 
savings, more spending is going to be better. But we haven't really changed 
the $1 billion gross cost savings that
 
we've been talking about for a very, 
very long time.
 
And that number hasn't changed, it's a very good number. But it feels like 
there's a gap between gross to net, right? So, this year, call it, 20 basis 
points of margin improvement, 30 basis points on th
e quarter, less obviously 
if you take away the NAB asset sale, if you take away the Britvic stake, et 
cetera, and you're saying you going to invest more back.
 
So, I guess long question as usual for the second one, but is that $1 billion 
gross savings going
 
to go up so you're going to have to spend more back, so 
you're getting more margin expansion? Or are you going to have to 
--
 
are 
you just going to spend the same amount more efficiently? Because I'm just 
confused, the $1 billion number hasn't changed and 
I don't know if you're 
suggesting that's going to go up. So, thanks for the pricing question and just 
margin clarification for me, please.
 
Indra Nooyi
 
Well, I'm going to talk about the pricing question and then Hugh is going to 
give you a good answer on th
e rest of it. As I said, Ali, at least two or three 
times, and thank you for asking the question, we are focused on responsible 
growth. The goal is not to hit the promotional lever and try to just buy short
-
term volume. And that's the message that's been m
ade very clear to our 
entire North American beverage Business, and Al and Kirk and the team are 
singularly focused on that.
 
So, you will see PepsiCo executing a very responsible strategy going 
forward, balancing push and pull spending so that it's profitab
le growth. In 
terms of productivity and the plans for cost reduction, Hugh, why don't you 
just provide the answer for that?
 
Hugh Johnston
 
Yes, happy to do that. I think, Ali, the confusion that you're experiencing is a 
result of timing. My comment earlier 
about we think there's a little bit more 
cost benefit is a way of explaining why the 9% EPS growth for this year.
 
Regarding the longer term, my broader points there around Smart Spending, 
where just that there's lots of productivity opportunity left out th
ere. We're 
not making any changes to the long
-
term guidance, we're not making any 
changes to our long
-
term productivity targets and we're not talking about 
2018 yet. I was really just offering some robustness to why we think we can 
continue to drive the pr
oductivity that we've already talked about. Hopefully 
that helps.

Our next question comes from Robert Ottenstein with Evercore ISI.
 
Indra Nooyi
 
Good morning Robert.
 
Robert Ottenstein
 
Great. Obviously, a lot of focus on the U.S. business. Could you
 
give us a 
little bit more color on what's going on outside of the U.S.? And you gave us 
some broad
-
brush, but are you seeing, for instance in Brazil, some of the 
other markets, some underlying stabilization and improvement that would 
give perhaps some con
fidence going forward of an acceleration?
 
Indra Nooyi
 
Hugh, do you want to take that? So, let me give you some of the 
--
 
what 
we're seeing in some of the geographies. We're actually seeing a strong lift 
in European business. All of our business 
--
 
actually
 
West and East Europe, 
we're seeing tremendous strength. All our businesses are doing well. We 
have a wonderful portfolio in the ESSA market. And we have the right 
marketing programs, the right pricing programs in place and that's why 
you're seeing such a 
stepped up growth rate in the ESSA market, both East 
Europe and Western Europe. And our Russia business in particular is doing 
very well, and so we feel very, very good about that.
 
In the Middle East, which is another big market for us, clearly this year w
e 
saw the impact of the lower oil price, the tax on CSDs, all of that went into 
place. Again, we have taken all the appropriate actions to implement more 
productivity, start to shift the product portfolio. And while we took a short
-
term shock to the system
, we're coming out of that. And we think that the 
Middle East, North Africa still represents a very, very good market with lots 
of consumers is still in coming into the peak consumption years. So, we feel 
good about that market. The prospects for recovery 
in those markets are 
good.
 
As I look at China and the Asia
-
Pacific region, our business in China is doing 
well, especially our Snacks business is doing very well. Our Quaker business 
is doing exceedingly well in China. The team is a good team. Our e
-
commer
ce business is on fire in China and doubling in size every year. And 
it's becoming a learning lab for us to learn how to do e
-
commerce for the 
rest of the world, so we feel good about China.
 
The wonderful thing about the rest of Pacific Rim is that you've 
got many 
markets; all these little tigers are recording pretty good GDP growth. The 
markets may not be big as a China or India, but each of these markets 
contributes positively to our performance, and we've been doing well on 
those markets and gaining shar
e in all of those markets. We have good 
bottling partners. Our own operating businesses are very good. Good 
leadership teams. Those businesses are doing well. We don't see much of a 
concern in those markets, even though they've gone through some political 
ups and downs.
 
In the South Asian subcontinent 
--
 
India, Pakistan, Nepal, Sri Lanka, we face 
the normal upheavals from GST, the demonetization 
--
 
or remonetization, I 
should say. We are through all that now. And hopefully the business will 
start to steadil
y recover in India. But Pakistan has been a big success story 
for us. We have a good business there and it's growing very nicely and 
profitably.
 
Latin America is a big question. We have strong businesses in Mexico and 
Brazil in Central America. Clearly, La
tin America has gone through its share 
of geopolitical issues, and recently, the earthquakes have really had a 
devastating impact in Mexico; and the hurricanes that swept through the 
Caribbean and Puerto Rico have a really decimated those islands.
 
In spite
 
of that, the teams have performed well. And our Brazil business is 
doing very well and our Mexico business is doing well across both Snacks 
and Beverages. So, in those markets, I would say we're holding in Latin 
America, doing exceedingly well in the ESSA
 
region.
 
Our AMENA sector is, in spite of all the issues, coming back very nicely. 
North America is our core, and we remain positive about the North American 
business. Now and then, there will be a quarter where some business has a 
hiccup or a toast up. Th
e resilience of our overall portfolio is what allows us 
to deliver the numbers we're delivering.
 
So, overall, we still feel quite confident about our prospects and we are 
buckling our seatbelts and saying, ""There will be geopolitical instability, 
there wil
l be weather
-
related issues, we just have to build a portfolio that 
can weather that and somehow profit through and deliver the performance.""

Our next question comes from Pablo Zuanic with SIG.
 
Indra Nooyi
 
Good morning Pablo.
 
Pablo Zuanic
 
Thanks for taking 
--
 
thanks Indra for taking the last question. Look, just two 
quick ones. One, I understand the idea with retailers who will try to get 
space back for CSDs, that it's a case of and, and not or. But when I see 
LaCroix in some targets having
 
30 feet of space and Coke and Pepsi each 
maybe five or six, I wonder how much is it about what you can do and about 
what the retailers and the consumer wants. So, if you can comment on this 
strategy, on the retailers, on the retail space, I find that it w
ould face a lot of 
pushback from the retailers? And number two 
--
 
which maybe means you 
just have to double
-
down on non
-
CSDs, but that's the question.
 
And the second one, I know this is going back in time, but when you bought 
Wimm
-
Bill
-
Dann back then, you 
were talking about dealing a third leg with 
this big nutrition arm. And since then it's been 
--
 
it's become more about 
transforming the potato chips, to better nutrition and drinks and so on. 
Maybe you got 
--
 
things got changed because of [Indiscernible] b
ack then, 
but is there 
--
 
is this a moment to maybe think about that third leg again? 
Thanks.
 
Indra Nooyi
 
Pablo, great question. First of all, we always get pushback from retailers and 
everything. I think the real thing is that from PepsiCo's perspective a
nd DSD 
company, we have big brands and our brands have high velocity. So the 
combination of those three yields tremendous profitability for retailers. And 
clearly, some upside brands have come in and taken a lot of shelf space.
 
Our challenge is not to just
 
say, ""Hey, give us more space for core CSDs,"" 
it's how do we provide the right innovation to go after those upstarts who 
are taking a lot of space. I tell you one of the issues I would say, and I take 
full responsibility for this, maybe in a couple of cas
es we were slow to 
respond to some of these newcomers who have taken a lot of space.
 
And believe me, we will fix that. And going forward, the agility and speed of 
response from our company will go up significantly. Sometimes when you 
have too many big bran
ds and too much success under your belt, you lose a 
little bit on speed, and we are working to fix that.
 
So, I think you'll find that the retailers actually welcome the DSD suppliers 
to keep their shelves looking good going forward and that's what we provi
de 
with our beverage portfolio.
 
In terms of the third leg, we've tried to build it organically with success, 
Wimm
-
Bill
-
Dann was the last big acquisition we made, and except for the 
Russian ruble that went through its own share of challenges after we bought
 
Wimm
-
Bill
-
Dann, coming out of that, the business has performed 
exceedingly well. It's an ideal portfolio.
 
I think what we have to be very, very careful about 
--
 
if we went off and 
built that third leg through acquisitions, we have to think hard whether 
th
ey're shareholder value creating, what kind of a premium do you pay for 
any acquisition and how do we realize the benefits of that deal enough to 
offset the acquisition premium.
 
And believe me, the stuff we've looked at so far, we don't see a clear path to
 
that. And so as we've said many, many times to all of you, we want to make 
sure that any major acquisition we may 
--
 
minor or major, I'm sorry; any 
acquisition we make has a clear path to value creation. And if we don't see 
that, we typically do not make 
the acquisition. We try to do things 
organically. It may take longer, but they create much more value over the 
long
-
term. Hugh, did you want to add anything on that?
 
Hugh Johnston
 
No, I think that was perfect.

Our next question comes from Mark Swa
rtzberg with Stifel Financial.
 
Indra Nooyi
 
Mark good morning.
 
Mark Swartzberg
 
Hi Indra, good morning. Hi Hugh. Thanks for taking the question. Continuing 
this line of questioning on the algorithm, of course you're not going to give 
us an update. But I do w
onder if we're seeing a bit of a prequel to how you'll 
keep delivering the algorithm, meaning it seems that productivity and cost 
savings are gaining importance. And while I think we all agree that 1.7% is 
not the right run rate, you're going to be do bett
er than that. You did take 
your revenue growth for the year down to at least 3% before we had the 
third quarter. So, 
--
 
and you were doing 4s and 5s. So, is it right to think 
that you need to lean harder into productivity to get to the same outcome 
over a 
series of years to come?
 
Indra Nooyi
 
Don't know. Don't know, Mark. You know what I think with our revenue 
growth rate, they're still up there in the top performance in the Whole Food 
and Beverage space. And so it's an environment that requires us to modify
 
our model, our innovation model, our retail, our outreach model. And you 
know what, when you go through these sorts of transformations and you're 
tweaking part of the business model, there will be issues along the way.
 
If we focus on the year and looked a
t our performance versus other people 
in the space, I think we stack up pretty well, both on the top and the 
bottom
-
line. And so will we lean harder on productivity, we will always lean 
harder on productivity, because we believe that we ought to take out a
ny 
cost that is not value creating and put it back into investments in the 
business or flow it through to the bottom
-
line. And that has been our modus 
operandi.
 
So, productivity will always be paramount in PepsiCo. As we get better at it, 
we will keep doin
g more of it. But we're not taking our focus off of growing 
the topline. To us, growing the topline is really the right way to grow the 
company in a very, very balanced way.
 
So, we are redoubling our efforts to grow the topline. We're looking to see 
how to
 
spend the A&M that we put out in a much more efficient way. To me, 
that's the Holy Grail. We all spend a lot of money on A&M, how do you spend 
it in an efficient way so we get the appropriate lift from the A&M?
 
But you know it's interesting times in the e
ntire CPG world globally. And we 
have the size, scale, capabilities, the brands to be a very, very important 
player in this business and a top performer and that's what we're focused on 
maniacally.
 
And Mark let me just close by saying; 
personally, I'm completely committed 
to this company because 50 time my salary is in PepsiCo stock. And with 
that level of ownership, believe me, this is something Hugh and I focus on 
24 hours a day.

Our next question comes from Caroline Levy with
 
Macquarie.
 
Indra Nooyi
 
Good morning Caroline. Caroline, good morning.
 
Operator
 
Caroline your line is open.
 
Caroline Levy
 
Good morning. Can you hear me now?
 
Indra Nooyi
 
Yes, good morning Caroline.
 
Caroline Levy
 
Sorry. Thank you very much. I would really ap
preciate your take on the 
changing climate of retail, because that is on everybody's mind so much with 
Amazon buying Whole Foods. I know that you touched upon what's going on 
in your e
-
commerce business. But the other conversation that's raised its 
head is
 
private label. And over many decades we've had this conversation 
about will it suddenly take off and become like Europe and the U.S. So, I'd 
really love your opinion as to what e
-
commerce and Amazon probably 
change that dynamic, because private levels rea
lly never succeeded in your 
categories.
 
Indra Nooyi
 
Yes, look even in Europe, our categories have had private label penetration, 
but not to the extent that many other HPC or other categories have had. 
Having said that, we are not complacent about any of th
is. Basically, I think, 
as we look forward, we're still looking at retailers, if they want to deliver 
margin growth in a period in which they're seeing price compression, they 
have a couple choices. They can do private label or they can get more 
efficient 
or they can get innovation to the stores from the big manufacturers 
that drive more traffic and velocity.
 
So, I think what could happen 
--
 
Caroline, this is just my perspective, is that 
you could see a bifurcation. You could see big brands, big companies t
aking 
the burden off of retailers through DSD and by bringing our own label into 
the store and driving more velocity and traffic through the big brands and 
innovation. And then you could see on the other end, a combination of small 
brands and private label
 
that flanks it on the other side. What could be 
squeezed in the middle is sort of the mid
-
size brands.
 
Now, this is just my perspective, and we've been looking at all of this really 
hard. We think that could be a possible scenario going forward. So, from 
our 
perspective, doubling down on big brands, making sure innovation is 
--
 
making sure execution is perfect; our whole system is aligned, so when we 
have to make changes, we can do it fast.
 
And then within our company, making sure we have enough levers on 
productivity so we can get more and more efficient deploying automation 
and other tools to be able to put it back on innovation, driving the topline 
growth, whatever we have to do. I think that's going to be the game going 
forward.
 
As we said in the last c
all, this is going to be a period of brilliant disruption 
over the next three to five years and we're going to approach it with 
pessimism or optimism. We actually think this could be a time when a lot of 
competitor balances could be reset. And as perhaps t
he largest U.S. 
company in food and beverages and the second largest food and beverage 
company in the world, believe me, we will play an outsized role in this 
resetting of the competitive balance.

Our next question comes from Andrea Teixeira with 
J.P. Morgan.
 
Indra Nooyi
 
Good morning.
 
Andrea Teixeira
 
Good morning everyone. Thank you. Thank you for taking the questions. So, 
first on Frito, I think going back to Caroline's question and I think also 
boding into what your comments, but just curious how
 
you're seeing your 
competitor 
--
 
any competitor reaction, because clearly you have been 
gaining share consistently there. And if you're seeing anything in terms of 
your DSD against one of your competitors kind of getting out of DSD, if 
you're seeing any p
otential reaction to that? Or are you sort of seeing that 
market share gains as secular and more resilient than before?
 
Indra Nooyi
 
Go ahead Hugh.
 
Hugh Johnston
 
Yes. I'm happy to answer that Andrea. I think what you see is more resilient 
rather than 
temporary. A lot what's happening right now with Frito
-
Lay is 
less driven by what competition is doing and just more driven by the fact 
that Frito
-
Lay is both running the core portfolio very well and innovating well 
around that portfolio with products like
 
Stacy's and Smartfood and many of 
the premium products.
 
So, if you look at what's going to drive Frito
-
Lay's growth for the future, it's 
going to be continuing to execute that core portfolio and continuing to 
innovate premium and that will likely result i
n continued share gains over 
time, not anything that's happening competitively.
 
Indra Nooyi
 
So, thank you all for your questions. And let me just summarize by saying 
we are pleased with our year
-
to
-
date results for the third quarter with strong 
results acr
oss most of our sectors and we expect our topline performance to 
accelerate in Q4 as performance at NAB recovers.
 
And we're on track to deliver our fifth consecutive year of at least 9% core 
constant currency EPS growth. And we believe we are well position
ed to 
continue to perform well over the long run.
 
As always, thank you for joining us this morning and for the confidence you 
have placed in us with your investment. Thank you.

Now it's my pleasure to introduce Indra Nooyi.
 
Indra K
. Nooyi
 
Thank you, Jamie, and thank you all for joining us this morning. I am 
pleased to report that our second quarter results were very much in line with 
our expectations and that we remain on track to meet our full
-
year 2017 
financial goals.
 
For the qua
rter, while our reported results continue to be impacted by macro 
volatility and weak currencies, organic revenue was up more than 3% 
globally, a sequential acceleration from our growth rate in the first quarter. 
We generated organic revenue growth across 
both developed and developing 
and emerging markets, with developed markets up 2% and D&E markets 
growing 6%. The portfolio generated strong net price realization and core 
constant currency operating profit grew 7%. Core constant currency EPS 
grew 13%.
 
Our 
results reflect the power and durability of our portfolio, its ability to 
deliver sustainable and well
-
balanced results, despite ongoing pockets of 
macro and geopolitical challenges in a number of our key markets around 
the globe, and in an increasingly dy
namic retail and consumer environment.
 
Let's briefly review the performance in the quarter across our sectors, 
starting with North America where organic revenue grew 2% and core 
constant currency operating profit was up 4%. Importantly, year to date 
throug
h the second quarter, we have also generated more U.S. retail sales 
growth than all other $5 billion
-
plus manufacturers combined.
 
Frito
-
Lay North America had another very strong quarter. Volume and 
organic revenue accelerated sequentially from Q1, as we ex
pected, and 
results reflected a very good balance of volume growth, net price realization 
and margin expansion. We feel very good about the business, with 
innovation, pricing and execution, all on target. We are pleased to report 
that Frito
-
Lay alone was t
he number one contributor to total U.S. food and 
beverage retail growth by all $5 billion
-
plus manufacturers through the end 
of Q2.
 
Similarly, North America Beverages grew organic revenue and core 
operating profit, but our growth rates were limited in part
 
by adverse 
channel and subcategory mix in the quarter, as we have seen a lower rate of 
year
-
to
-
date growth in the C
-
store channel compared to last year and water 
growth outpace the balance of our business. We are encouraged by 
continued strength in our [s
tills] portfolio with good growth in Gatorade, our 
total water portfolio which benefited from the strong introduction of 
LIFEWTR, Lipton, and our distribution of Rockstar. In fact, in just five 
months of sales since its launch in Q1, LIFEWTR has already re
ached $70 
million in retail sales across measured channels, was the top brand 
contributing to LRB retail sales growth of the second quarter, and is on track 
to generate approximately $200 million in retail sales on an annualized 
basis.
 
On the carbonated si
de, we are encouraged by the performance of Pepsi 
Zero Sugar, but have more work to do on the carbonated portfolio overall. 
We will also be allocating a bit more marketing behind the big sparkling 
brand in the second half. We have strong activation for thi
s summer behind 
Pepsi Fire and our DEW
-
S
-
A program, followed by strong execution behind 
the NFL as we get to the fall. As we execute our second half plans, we will 
remain very focused on driving better net price realization and letting our 
marketing and in
novation drive the top line.
 
Quaker Foods North America performance continues to be impacted by 
broader center
-
of
-
stove pressures, but is performing well relative to other 
large breakfast manufacturers. Going forward, we have powerful 
programming in place 
aimed to improve the trajectory of the business. So 
for example, we have activation behind portable breakfast innovation, 
namely Breakfast Flats that we launched in 2016 and Breakfast Squares that 
were launched in the first quarter, and we have just launch
ed a new and 
first
-
to
-
market Overnight Oats Cup in the second quarter to capitalize on the 
recent and growing consumer trend of preparing chilled oats using a variety 
of healthy ingredients.
 
Turning to our sectors outside North America, in Latin America we
 
continue 
to see very challenging macroeconomic conditions, geopolitical instability, 
and high levels of inflation in key markets, including Brazil and Argentina, 
which are dampening consumer spending. Within this context, our 
businesses are performing wel
l.
 
Our largest market in the region, Mexico, encouragingly has been relatively 
stable and resilient and is performing well, and posted double
-
digit organic 
revenue growth in the second quarter. While our core profit performance in 
the first half of the yea
r was impacted by difficult economic conditions, we 
expect to see an improvement in core profit growth in the second half as we 
lap incremental investments from last year and we realize productivity from 
supply chain initiatives.
 
Similarly, we are experien
cing macro challenges in a number of markets 
throughout our Asia, Middle East and North Africa segment, including the 
significant currency devaluation in Egypt and the economic impact in a 
number of markets across the Middle East stemming from persistently
 
low 
oil prices. Related to these, we are experiencing significant cost inflation in 
Egypt arising from adverse transaction Forex and we are dealing with the 
recently imposed carbonated soft drink tax in Saudi Arabia.
 
So we are adjusting our business to ad
dress these challenges. We are 
pricing to cover the increased cost of doing business, we are going more 
aggressively after productivity to reduce our overall costs, and we continue 
to transform our beverage portfolio to offer more non
-
carbonated options 
an
d reducing sugar levels across the portfolio.
 
On the other hand, we are encouraged by a number of bright spots in the 
region, including China where we saw double
-
digit beverage organic revenue 
growth and mid single
-
digit snack organic revenue growth, in ma
rkets like 
Pakistan and Egypt where organic revenue was up double
-
digits.
 
And finally, turning to Europe and Sub
-
Sahara Africa, we had very good 
results across the region, with organic revenue growth in each of our major 
markets and a sequential accelerati
on overall. Russia, our largest market in 
the region, had mid
-
single
-
digit organic revenue growth and very strong 
operating margin improvement. As you saw in the release, our results also 
benefited from our sale of our minority stake in Britvic. Even exclu
ding this 
gain, core operating profit was up 19%. So we are very encouraged by the 
performance in the region and are optimistic about the outlook for the 
balance of the year. We continue to manage what's in our control and our 
portfolio products and geogra
phies is working.
 
And so, with half the year behind us and our performance overall in line with 
our plans and expectations, we remain very much on track to deliver our full 
year financial target of at least 3% organic revenue growth and 8% core 
constant cu
rrency EPS growth. And we continue to deliver these strong, 
reliable results even as our industry is undergoing some interesting shifts 
from multiple angles.
 
Consumer habits and behaviors continue to evolve, some trends like 
consumers' increasing demand fo
r convenience and variety have been 
present for decades but are becoming more pronounced, consumer shopping 
habits are rapidly adapting to evolving and new retail formats, and their 
lifestyles are increasingly influenced by pervasive social and digital med
ia 
and mobile technology, and this in turn requires new marketing models that 
harness the power of digital media and big data in a way that enables us to 
communicate with consumers on a much more personal and individualized 
level.
 
Consumers are also seekin
g more value and benefits from what they 
purchase and consume. They are also seeking more premium experiences, 
and at the same time seeking value. And across the spectrum, consumers 
continue to be interested in health and wellness, but with differing 
defin
itions, often not science
-
based of what this means.
 
Perhaps more pronounced are the changes we are witnessing in retail where 
the lines are blurring between channels. Brick and mortar retailers are 
building deep e
-
commerce capability, pure
-
play e
-
commerce 
is moving into 
brick
-
and
-
mortar, and virtually every channel is melding aspects of grocery, 
convenience, foodservice, meal kits, prepared meals, and home delivery.
 
So with all this change occurring and at an accelerated pace, we could look 
upon the spirit 
in our industry with hesitation and pessimism or with a sense 
of excitement and optimism. We choose to take the optimistic approach 
because this period offers a once
-
in
-
a
-
lifetime opportunity to strengthen our 
business and capture new avenues of growth. We
 
believe we are well
-
positioned to win in this environment. In fact, we anticipated and prepared 
for many of the trends we are witnessing today.
 
To begin, we participate in growing categories with products that are well
-
suited to consumers' continued desir
e for convenience, on
-
the
-
go portability, 
and snacking, in place of structured meals. Many of our brands occupy the 
number one or number two spot in their respective categories, giving them 
the scale to cut through an increasingly cluttered and fragmented 
media 
landscape, especially in the digital realm.
 
Our product portfolio has the stretch to continue to evolve with consumer 
needs. We have the ability to innovate to provide new benefits and value to 
the consumer in ways that are not only 
consistent with the brand's equity 
but in many ways strengthen it. A few examples come to mind.
 
Lipton tea, over the years we have not only added more variety but we have 
strengthened the brand by introducing increasingly premium offerings, first 
with Pure
 
Leaf and more recently with the Tea House Collection, resulting in 
the leading share position we enjoy today. Or Mountain Dew, where over 
time we have expanded the trademark from traditional green
-
bottle Dew 
and Diet Dew to exciting line extensions like C
ode Red, White Out and 
Voltage, and our very successful Kickstart lineup. Or Doritos, where our loyal 
consumers have embraced flavor extensions to the core product and 
innovations we have taken to foodservice and quick serve restaurants. Or 
Quaker, where w
e have provided increasing portability and convenience to a 
hearty, healthy breakfast through the introduction of Breakfast Squares and 
Breakfast Flats.
 
Beyond our product advantages, we also have a well
-
balanced geographic 
footprint that enables us to wea
ther pockets of macroeconomic volatility. 
Importantly, we have extremely strong relationships with our retail partners 
and meaningful presence of scale across all our relevant channels. In each of 
our five largest markets, comprising approximately 75% of o
ur total net 
revenue, we are the largest or #2 food and beverage manufacturer based on 
retail sales.
 
Regardless of channel, our products and brands possess a number of 
important characteristics that make them highly appealing to our customers. 
They are oft
en purchased on impulse, which makes them highly incremental 
and therefore build basket and box size. On promotion, they drive traffic. 
They are highly complementary to other food and beverage purchases and 
they have high velocities, which makes them very 
productive in whatever 
shelf they occupy, and therefore they are big cash flow generators. These 
attributes translate to the very foundation of the value we bring to our 
customers regardless of channel. We deliver sales growth and cash flow for 
our custome
rs.
 
And our partnership with customers goes well beyond supplying great 
products. Our deep capabilities, enabled by our scale and years of extensive 
investment, allow us to work with a strategic partner, delivering value in the 
areas of supply chain manage
ment, consumer and shopper insight, social 
and digital consumer engagement, research and development, design, data 
analytics, and e
-
commerce. In fact, our execution with retailers, leveraging 
the full breadth of our capabilities, deserves to be named the #
1 best
-
in
-
class manufacturer in the most recent annual Kantar Retail PoweRanking 
survey in the United States, and this was further reinforced a few weeks ago 
when I attended the Consumer Goods Forum in Berlin. In meeting after 
meeting with our retail partn
ers from around the globe, they expressed how 
much they value the growth we generate for them.
 
And finally, one of the most compelling reasons for our optimism is our 
culture. Over decades, we have built and developed a culture that thrives on 
change. We h
ave the heart of a challenger, a can
-
do spirit, with a must
-
do 
result. We view the evolution of our business, that is products, supply 
chains, processes, organizations, or business models, as our natural state. 
Our business today is very different than it 
was five years ago and we expect 
it to be very different five years from now.
 
Consider our beverage portfolio transformation that began decades ago 
when we had declared that we would become a total beverage company, 
and over the years we have built an envi
able portfolio of leading brands 
across virtually every sub
-
segment of the beverage category, including 
Gatorade, Tropicana, Aquafina, Lipton, and Starbucks, through organic 
introductions, joint ventures and acquisitions. And this transformation 
continues,
 
as evidenced by our recent introductions of products like 
LIFEWTR, Lemon Lemon, and IZZE Fusions, and acquisition of KeVita.
 
By having continuing to evolve our supply
-
chain over the years, as the retail 
landscape has changed and new technologies have come
 
to market. Our 
supply chain in Frito
-
Lay today is very different from the one we operated 
just a few years ago. For example, our deployment of GES has enabled us to 
handle more SKUs, fulfill demand with greater speed and accuracy, improve 
product quality 
and freshness, and operate more efficiently.
 
With our embrace of performance and purpose, the journey we embarked on 
more than 10 years ago that has transformed our business to adapt to the 
changing world around us. We have reduced added sugars, saturated 
fat and 
sodium in many of our products, while continuing to expand our lineup of 
nutritious foods and beverages to meet growing consumer demand.
 
Our product transformation efforts to date have resulted in a portfolio where 
we now derive approximately 45% o
f our net revenue from products that we 
refer to as guilt
-
free. These products include diet and other beverages that 
contain 70 calories or less from added sugar per 12
-
ounce serving and 
snacks with low levels of sodium and saturated fat, as well as what w
e call 
'everyday nutrition product'. And a full 28 points of the 45 points is made up 
of what we refer to as 'everyday nutrition', products with positive nutrients 
like grains, fruits and vegetables, protein, unsweetened tea, and water.
 
We have steadily im
proved our operational water use and energy efficiency, 
reducing our packaging and waste, and promoting responsible agricultural 
practices globally. We have built a workplace that attracts and retains the 
world's best and brightest. And we intend to contin
ue to make strides in 
these areas. We have announced even more aggressive product, planet and 
people goals that we intend to achieve by 2025.
 
Net, we feel very good about where we stand. We have a leading product 
portfolio, balanced development across chan
nels and geographies, broad 
capabilities, a robust productivity agenda, a great corporate culture, and 
excellent talents. These factors and combinations have enabled us to 
continue to deliver an attractive balance of top line and bottom line growth, 
and th
ey give us the confidence to lead into an ever
-
changing environment 
with a sense of excitement and cautious optimism.
 
With that, let me turn the call over to Hugh. Hugh?
 
Hugh F. Johnston
 
Thank you, Indra, and good morning everyone. Let's move to our outloo
k for 
2017. Looking ahead, and as we set out in the release, we continue to 
expect organic revenue growth of at least 3%, fueled by successful product 
innovation and strong marketplace execution but tempered by a cautious 
macro outlook.
 
Based on current ma
rket consensus rates, foreign exchange is expected to 
negatively impact full
-
year reported net revenue by approximately 2 
percentage points, consistent with our previous guidance, and negatively 
impact core EPS by approximately 2 percentage points, which i
s a 1 point 
improvement from our previous guidance.
 
We intend to reinvest the Britvic share sale gain in the balance of the year, 
so I would encourage you not to flow through the impact of the gain in your 
full year models. Given the variety of macro issue
s we are facing around the 
globe, we think it is prudent to use this upside to strengthen the business.
 
As a result of the improvement in foreign exchange outlook on earnings, we 
now expect core earnings of $5.13 per share. This reflects core constant 
curr
ency EPS growth of 8%, offset by the 2 point Forex impact.
 
In terms of other key considerations and assumptions embedded in our full
-
year outlook, we continue to expect raw material inflation driven by both an 
increase in our basket of commodities and addi
tional pressure from 
transaction Forex. We continue to expect core operating margin expansion, 
fueled by our productivity programs, and we continue to expect our core 
effective tax rate to be approximately 24%.
 
Turning to cash flow, we expect to continue t
o generate strong cash flow and 
to exercise discipline over capital allocation, with prudent reinvestment into 
the business and the majority of our free cash flow excluding certain items 
to be returned to shareholders through dividends and share repurchase
.
 
So, for 2017, we continue to expect approximately $10 billion in cash flow 
from operations; net capital spending of approximately $3 billion; 
approximately $7 billion in free cash flow excluding certain items; cash 
dividends of approximately $4.5 billion
; recall that we previously announced 
a 7% increase in our quarterly dividend beginning with the June payment, 
this represents the 45th consecutive year in which we have increased our 
dividend; and share repurchases of approximately $2 billion.
 
Finally, as
 
you update your models, I'd like to highlight the following three 
items as they relate to the balance of the year. First, please keep in mind 
that we will be lapping our strongest rate of quarterly organic revenue 
growth in Q3, with a particularly tough l
ap in our North America Beverages 
sector. Second, while we are lapping some incremental investments related 
to the 53rd week from last year, we do intend to reinvest the Britvic share 
sale gain this year. Hence, we expect there may be some variability and 
volatility in the core operating margin. Third, we expect the negative impact 
of foreign exchange translation to be similar to what we saw this quarter, 
and consequently we expect the balance of year core EPS growth to be 
weighted toward Q4.
 
With that, we 
are ready to take the first question.
 
Question

and
-
Answer Session
 
Operator
 
[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Dara 
Mohsenian of Morgan Stanley.
 
Dara W. Mohsenian
 
So Indra, I was hoping you could give us some perspective on t
he U.S. CPG 
environment. Obviously it's been weak year to date, but also specifically in 
Q2 we have seen category weakness across the board, including in your 
segment. So, I was hoping for detail on what's driving the softness in your 
mind from a consumer 
standpoint across CPG, are you seeing any signs of 
improvement in Q3? I guess your comment on the tough top line comparison 
might indicate you are not so far. But any reason to think basically that 
consumer outlook may improve in the back half of the year?
 
And then 
specifically on your business, the flat Frito
-
Lay North America volume results 
in Q2 were essentially flat. Do you think that will improve in the back half of 
the year, and how concerned are you also on the U.S. carbonated soft drink 
side by the 
year
-
over
-
year market share losses and plans to improve that 
going forward?
 
Indra K. Nooyi
 
That was 10 questions, Dara. That was 10 questions very wonderfully rolled 
into one, but we're going to try to answer every one of those. Let me start 
by 
saying that I think you are beginning to see the limitations of the 
syndicated data, because as I mentioned in my script, the channels are 
beginning to blur between food service, retail, home delivery, restaurants, 
everything, the channels are beginning to
 
blur. And when you have blurring 
channels, you now have a shopping occasion being replaced by home 
delivery or replaced by a meal delivery of kits. So what we have to do is 
rethink what is the real growth of the marketplace, the food and beverage 
marketpl
ace, in a much more holistic way.
 
There's no question that the syndicated data showed a slowdown in the 
overall market I'd say in the first half. Rather than talk about quarter to 
quarter, let's just talk about the first half. Slightly south of 2% is what 
we 
saw in the first half. But I think if you include a much broader definition of 
the market, I think you're going to see what the traditional growth is, which 
is population plus some, more in the range of somewhere between 2% and 
2.5%. I think that's what
 
you'll see as an overall growth rate.
 
I think we all as manufacturers have to start to rethink how we serve this 
multiplicity of channels and how we should retool our business models to 
serve every one of these fragmenting channels. That's the challenge a
ll of us 
have and we have been looking at that very, very carefully.
 
Now let's talk a little bit about the category weakness. I think, on salty 
snacks in particular, let me speak to that. I have belief, and we watch 
volume, revenue and pricing very, very c
arefully on a weekly basis, I think 
where the market is today, when we can take pricing, we should take the 
pricing, and we have been trying to move the portfolio more to premium 
products, and the good news is that we are actually making progress in 
Frito
-
Lay to move the business more to premium products.
 
And so, I'd say, this thing will right itself, we are gaining share overall in the 
marketplace, we are gaining value share which is really what we are focused 
on, we are managing the mix very carefully, ma
naging channel mix, product 
mix very carefully. We feel pretty good about the Frito
-
Lay performance and 
where we are moving the portfolio, nudging it towards premium, balancing 
the value of mainstream part of the portfolio very, very carefully. So we feel 
good about that.
 
On the beverage side, we've got good price realization, so I feel good about 
that. Do I have some concerns about our carbonated soft drink business? 
Not concerns, but I think they have more opportunity, and I think that as we 
move towards 
the second half of the year and we sort of fine
-
tune our 
calendar, you'll start seeing more activity from us on carbonated soft drinks.
 
On balance, we have good innovation, and I wouldn't say we are concerned, 
but we are watching it very, very carefully to
 
make sure that everything that 
we can control, we do right by these businesses. Big businesses, very 
attractive businesses, we just want to make sure we get our fair share of 
those businesses. But the key thing is we are going to focus on price 
realizatio
n and let marketing drive the top line.
 
Operator
 
Your next question comes from the line of Steve Powers of UBS.
 
Stephen Powers
 
Actually, I was hoping we could maybe just clean up a little bit on both those 
two topics, Frito
-
Lay and North America Beverages.
 
On Frito
-
Lay, the 3.5 
points of net pricing this quarter, is there a way to just frame how much of 
that was rate versus the channel or package mix premiumization that you 
called out, Indra, versus maybe some lingering sober effects? I'm just trying 
to fig
ure out what's driving that price, because to the extent I think the 
concern is that the price gap gets too wide and that becomes problematic on 
volume. Just like to hear your explanation there. And then on North America 
Beverages, I was hoping you could a
lso give more color, maybe a 
quantification on the favorable legal settlement, Hugh, and the promotional 
spending accruals that helped segment profit there this quarter? I think 
that's the second quarter in a row where we've had favorable promotional 
spend
ing accruals, and I'd just love just to better understand the magnitude 
and the dynamics there. So thanks for both.
 
Hugh F. Johnston
 
Happy to answer both of those, Steve. In terms of price versus mix in Frito, 
round numbers it was about 2 points price and 
about 1.5 points of mix. Mix, 
as Indra mentioned, is driven by premium products such as Lay's Poppables. 
So when you are selling a potato puff, you are obviously filling the bag with 
less weight than you would say with a bag of Fritos. So we think that's a
 
good win for the consumer and it's obviously a good win for us as well.
 
Indra K. Nooyi
 
And it's a great tasting product.
 
Hugh F. Johnston
 
Fantastic tasting product. In terms of the legal settlement and the other 
items that you mentioned, it was in the tee
ns in millions. So, it was not 
small number but not a gigantic number by any stretch of imagination.
 
Operator
 
Your next question comes from the line of Ali Dibadj of Bernstein.
 
Ali Dibadj
 
Wanted to touch on two topics, if I could please? One, in your first
 
answer 
this morning around changes of channels and shift that you mentioned in 
your prepared remarks as well, have you guys really figured out how to sell 
impulse online well, how do you get that cold icy package, or quick $0.89 or 
$0.99 bag of Lay's to r
eally resonate online without the immediacy of that 
channel? It seems to be becoming a bigger and bigger deal, given just lower 
foot traffic in brick
-
and
-
mortar. So I'd love to hear your philosophy on that.
 
The second topic, I want to dig a little bit deep
er on, and a few folks 
mentioned early, Steve mentioned, secondly on operating margins more 
broadly, so just hoping if you could quantify operating margins, the impact 
of productivity, the impact of commodities, the impact of promotional 
spending accrual s
ettlements, as well as the marketing spend? Because if I 
look at two of those in particular on productivity, and we've heard for many, 
many years now, we know doing all those cost savings on an annual basis, 
but we don't actually see your SG&A as a percent
age of sales particularly 
low versus peers even with some adjustments given bottler structure, et 
cetera, and we are now starting to see core operating margins have difficulty 
expanding, in fact they were down 10 basis points this quarter. So, is it that 
t
he low hanging fruit is most difficult, is harder to get now, I mean the 
lowest hanging fruit I guess is gone and it's hard to show? So, I'd love some 
more detail after quantification on productivity.
 
And on marketing spend, you did increase marketing spen
d in FLNA, QFNA, 
NAB, AMENA this quarter, it looks like year
-
to
-
date as well, and that's where 
you're seeing volume struggles. And on the one hand, you could say, one 
could say, well, that's causality, so no ad spend growth leads to challenged 
volume growt
h, or actually is it judicious decision
-
making because those 
markets aren't going to grow anyway? So I know there's a lot packed in 
there but it's really around the second part, the topic of operating margins 
please. Thanks.
 
Indra K. Nooyi
 
So, I'm going to
 
let Hugh get all the answers ready for the 10 questions you 
asked in operating margin, Ali. Let me talk about the changes in channels. 
We are all figuring it out as we go along. The good news is, our e
-
commerce 
business is growing brilliantly. We are doin
g very, very well. We are not yet 
ready to talk about it in any significant way. Maybe in the next couple of 
calls we will start focusing on that. But it's growing really, really nicely. But 
it's growing with our traditional products and our traditional pa
ckaging, if 
you want to call it that.
 
There is clearly an opportunity for us to think about innovation for e
-
commerce, which is what we are all focused on. We want to make sure that 
our snacks are more shippable, not just in click and collect, but more als
o for 
delivery, so that the cube efficiency is there. And on beverages, I think there 
are two issues. One is the cold delivery of the beverages, if consumers so 
desire ice
-
cold beverages delivered to them, which I find it hard to believe, 
but you can never
 
tell. And then how do we make sure that we address this 
whole delivery of water, because beverages is largely water. So we are 
looking at meaningful innovation, both in snacks and beverages, in order to 
address the exploding growth of e
-
commerce. And with
 
our big brands, I 
think we are well
-
positioned.
 
Now let me come to the impulse nature of our products. I think the whole e
-
commerce area is going to be impulse as you see it in a brick
-
and
-
mortar 
store, which then translates to e
-
commerce and then becomes
 
part of a 
replenishment cycle. But then as people stop going to brick
-
and
-
mortar and 
start shopping only on e
-
commerce, which well could be the Gen
-
Z, the new 
I
-
generation, if you want to call it that, I think the new digital tools can 
easily afford you t
he ability to create the impulse experience online. We 
have seen so many virtual reality tools right now that can actually simulate 
grocery stores or whatever version of a grocery store you want online, and 
you can easily navigate the aisles and just with 
a click shop for whatever you 
want.
 
So, I think in an interesting way there's infinite possibilities to create 
impulse all through technology online, and I think as this market matures 
and evolves, you're going to see a lot of that happening, and we are 
focused 
on developing all of these tools ourselves with our e
-
commerce partners to 
make sure that we are responsive to them when they so choose to go that 
way. So with that, let me turn it to Hugh to give you the [treaties] [ph] on 
operating margin. Go ahe
ad, Hugh.
 
Hugh F. Johnston
 
Sure, happy to. Ali, a couple of comments on that. First, as we pointed out 
at the beginning of the year, we expect to see operating margin 
improvement strengthen as we go from the front half to the back half. That's 
what you saw
 
from Q1 going to Q2 and that's what you'll see as we head 
into the back half of the year as well. So, I think things generally are 
tracking to our expectations.
 
Regarding advertising and marketing spend, we have said many times that 
we would invest furthe
r in A&M to the degree that we saw a return on 
investing further in A&M. As we move from 5.2% of sales to 5.7%, that was 
a move to get more competitive, as we have moved over the past four years 
from 5.7% to about 6.7% of sales. Those were all based on goo
d ROI. So, I 
think you'll see the A&M change as we introduce new products or as we see 
opportunities to earn a good return. We're not going to blindly put money 
into A&M. Do I think you'll see A&M going backwards? No, I don't expect 
that to be the case in 
a meaningful way. It could go forward to the degree 
that we see good investment opportunities.
 
More broadly on productivity, truthfully I think we have years of productivity 
still in front of us. The cost bucket that we evaluate productivity against, 
what 
we call OpEx, is about $28 billion. It's got a natural inflation rate of 3% 
to 4% per year. So as we continue to drive 4%
-
ish types of productivity, you 
see that bucket basically staying relatively flat. I do expect that we will, as 
we have guided in the p
ast, continue to see steady margin improvement 
while we reinvest in growth. So, I think overall, the margin versus growth 
equation is one that hasn't changed much relative to where we have been in 
recent years.
 
Indra K. Nooyi
 
And I think, Hugh, it's fair t
o say that with the changing marketplace, where 
there's blurring of retail channels, the consumer preferences changing, the 
marketing models changing, we have to invest in these new capabilities in 
order to generate the top line growth we are generating. S
o, we intend to 
continue to invest judiciously in these new areas, so we can sustain our top 
line growth globally.
 
Hugh F. Johnston
 
Absolutely.
 
Operator
 
Your next question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane of Bank of 
America.
 
Bryan Spillane
 
What are th
e questions that I guess or themes that have come up this year, 
specifically in North America, has been I think with all the changes in the 
retail environment, some concerns about pricing, and you have seen it 
especially in the food industry with the food 
stocks and how they have 
performed this year, and I think generally the concern is that there is going 
to be more sort of deflationary pressure at retail as retailers try to drive 
some traffic or keep customers, so can you kind of talk to how you're 
thinki
ng about that, not so much for this year but over the next few years, 
do you think that there is going to be maybe a need to just maybe change 
the way you have thought about pricing philosophically, just given the 
changes in the channel?
 
Indra K. Nooyi
 
We 
model out different channel shifts, what could be the pricing 
implications, we look at analogs from Europe when there were lots of retail 
disruptions, and then we look at what do we need to do to get innovation
-
driven pricing, mix
-
driven pricing, and then 
what do we need to offset the 
productivity, how do we need to go deeper on productivity programs. So 
Bryan, what we do do is model this out constantly, we look at multiple 
scenarios, and then we figure out how to get the best blend of top and 
bottom line g
rowth in a changing retail environment.
 
The good news is that as the retail environment shifts, we just have to retool 
our model for the retail environment shifts. The market is still growing, 
that's the good news, and these are huge categories. So, our go
al is to 
capture the growth with a changing environment with our innovation and our 
big brands. That's why we focus so much on innovation because we believe 
innovation can actually create consumer demand and get us the price 
premium, and then we keep inves
ting in our brands, both at the big brand 
level and the emerging brands like KeVita and Naked, so that we can grow 
our business on both ends of the spectrum.
 
Operator
 
Your next question comes from the line of Mark Swartzberg of Stifel.
 
Mark Swartzberg
 
In F
ebruary, we came to an interesting point in history, it was the five
-
year 
anniversary of your rebasing earnings, and no doubt the environment 
remains and arguably has become more challenging, but this year we are at 
just shy of 3% organic revenue. If you l
ook at 2012 through 2016, you were 
at 4s and 5s. And we spent time in this Q&A talking about the need to 
invest. So my question is simply, headwinds are always there, they are 
always changing, but when you think about your internal capacity to invest, 
and 
of course that relates to the resolve to cut costs and where you put that 
money, do you think, A, that the need to reinvest is getting greater, that 
you have to actually pick up the pace of investment because of the 
headwinds getting harder, and then B, if
 
it is getting harder, do you think 
you have the resources, the ability to even up the productivity target to 
address that greater pressure?
 
Indra K. Nooyi
 
I don't know about harder, they are different. I think it's different buckets, 
different areas, some
 
areas that we are comfortable with, some areas where 
we have to develop new muscle, but that's part of life in our food and 
beverage industry. I've been in PepsiCo for 23 years and every five years or 
so there is a brand
-
new skill we have to develop. And 
this place is amazingly 
resilient, we develop the muscle, we hire from the outside when we have to, 
we retrain, and then we go on. So, I wouldn't say it's getting harder, I'd just 
say that it's different buckets and we have to put in the work to make sure 
that we can deliver growth in this new environment.
 
As I said in response to an earlier question, we are looking at how much 
productivity we need to deliver to offset any price inflation if it happens 
because of retail disruption. So, we are constantly loo
king at how we need to 
balance top line and bottom line growth, and clearly productivity is a major 
factor in bottom line growth delivery. So we are looking at that. Hugh, did 
you want to add anything to that point?
 
Hugh F. Johnston
 
No, I think you capture
d it effectively. I do think we are doing different than 
new skills but that's something to be expected. And as far as having the 
resources, I think we can continue to drive sufficient productivity to stay 
ahead of the wave.
 
Indra K. Nooyi
 
And I think a lo
t of the new technologies actually allow us to deliver more 
productivity. We just need to 

 
I think the key thing people have to take 
away is that in order to deliver productivity downstream, you have to invest 
upstream. So you have to invest today to get 
the benefits tomorrow. 
Benefits don't come out of thin air. And so, what we are doing is investing 
today to get more productivity downstream.
 
Operator
 
Your next question comes from the line of Pablo Zuanic of SIG.
 
Pablo Zuanic
 
Just a question on, 
maybe it's going back in time, but 15 years ago the 
industry went through significant consolidation with Quaker, Kraft/Nabisco, 
General Mills/Pillsbury, Kellogg/Keebler, and we are talking about the 
significant changes taking place in the retail channel, w
e have seen retail 
consolidation, consumer changes, e
-
commerce, do you think the industry 
needs to as you mentioned develop new muscles, and a way to do that, that 
we should see another consolidation wave in the industry? I mean, yes, I'm 
asking a little b
it from an industry point of view but also from a Pepsi point 
of view, does size being bigger help to adapt to these new changes or what 
happened 15 years ago in hindsight was a wrong answer, that wave of 
consolidation? And just a quick follow
-
up, if Unile
ver were to change hands, 
I suppose that you could lose the Lipton agreement, right, you would be 
probably 

 
there would be a penalty that you will need to be compensated, 
but I assume that that contract would be taken away, if you can expand on 
that? Than
k you.
 
Indra K. Nooyi
 
So, first of all, we don't lose the Lipton business even with change of hands. 
So I would rest assure that we are protected there. On this whole industry 
outlook, Pablo, I think you guys on the sell side are much more 
knowledgeable ab
out industry and industry trends, because you've been 
following it for such a long time. We actually read your reports to get 
insights into where you think the industry is going. So I'd rather depend on 
your opinions here and we'll keep our opinions to our
selves on this one.
 
Operator
 
Your next question comes from the line of Lauren Lieberman of Barclays.
 
Lauren Lieberman
 
I just wanted to follow up again on the scanner conversation and just 
specifically relative to your business on North America Beverages, b
ecause 
the scanner data and your results have really been diverging 300, 400, now 
I think 450 basis points this quarter. So if you could just talk a little bit 
about where the sort of untracked data is coming from? And then the other 
piece was that at leas
t in the scanner data, both Mountain Dew overall, and 
specifically Kickstart and Gatorade, slowed dramatically, both of those down 
double digits. So if you could just talk a little bit about that, with anything 
specific plans you may have where you are ant
icipating those to recover, at 
least to get in the tracked channel piece of it? Thanks.
 
Indra K. Nooyi
 
Thanks Lauren for the question. First of all, we don't reconcile our data with 
the scanner data. We just keep running the business and just we keep 
selli
ng, we keep making sure that our product is on the shelf. Remember, we 
are high velocity products. So, we know on a weekly basis exactly what we 
sell and what's being pulled by the consumer. So we have good data on 
what's happening in the marketplace. I ha
ve no idea why the scanner data 
diverges so much. It's been happening in many markets and I think it 
reflects some of the limitations of syndicated data and they need to go back 
and retool it, but we are very comfortable where we are and we are just 
going 
to keep running the business this way.
 
So with that, let me thank you for your questions, and to summarize, we are 
pleased with our results for the first half, we remain on track to deliver our 
full
-
year financial targets, and we feel well
-
positioned to co
ntinue to perform 
well, even in the midst of change and disruption. Thank you very much for 
joining us this morning and for the confidence you've placed in us with your 
investment.

7/10/15,Pepsi,"Good morning, and welcome to PepsiCo's Third Quarter 2012 Earnings 
Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Today's call is being recorded and 
will be archived at www.pepsico.com.
 
It is now my pleasure to introduce Mr. Jamie Caulfield, Senior Vice 
President 
of Investor Relations. Mr. Caulfield, please go ahead.
 
Jamie Caulfield
 
Thank you, operator. With me today are Indra Nooyi, PepsiCo's Chairman 
and CEO; and Hugh Johnston, PepsiCo's CFO.
 
We'll lead off today's call with a review of our third 
quarter performance and 
our balance
-
of
-
year outlook, and then we'll move on to Q&A.
 
In an effort to get through as many analysts' questions as possible within 
the hour, we're doing 2 things today: first, we've shortened the amount of 
time for management's 
prepared remarks; and second, we're going to have 
a one
-
question limit so we can hopefully get through the full queue of 
analysts' questions.
 
Before we begin, please take note of our cautionary statement. This 
conference call includes forward
-
looking state
ments, including statements 
regarding 2012 guidance based on currently available information. Forward
-
looking statements inherently involve risks and uncertainties that could 
cause our actual results to differ materially from those predicted in such 
forwar
d
-
looking statements. Statements made on this conference call should 
be considered together with our cautionary statements and other 
information contained in today's earnings release and in our most recent 
periodic reports filed with the SEC.
 
Unless otherw
ise indicated, all references to revenue, EPS and division and 
total operating profit growth are on a core basis. In addition, references to 
organic results in this call exclude the impact of acquisitions and divestitures 
and foreign exchange translation.
 
To find disclosures and reconciliations of non
-
GAAP measures that we may 
use when discussing PepsiCo's financial results, please refer to the glossary 
and other attachments to this morning's earnings release and to the 
Investors section of PepsiCo's websit
e under the Investor Presentations tab.
 
Now, it's my pleasure to introduce Indra Nooyi.
 
Indra K. Nooyi
 
Thank you, Jamie, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to report that 
we continue to make progress against the plan we shared with you earlier 
this ye
ar.
 
Let me give you the headlines on our progress for the quarter. Our Asia, 
Middle East, Africa division had an excellent quarter across
-
the
-
board. 
Europe delivered solid results with very good pricing. Frito
-
Lay North 
America and Latin American Foods had
 
good volume growth and net price 
utilization. And within Pepsi Americas Beverages, we gained value
-
sharing 
carbonated beverages while executing a much
-
needed cleanup of 
unprofitable segments of our noncarbonated portfolio.
 
And across our businesses, we co
ntinued our stepped
-
up brand investment 
programs, heightened focus on innovation, productivity and execution and 
cash returns to you, our shareholders.
 
Our financial results for the quarter were in line with our expectations. Core 
EPS was $1.20. Our 5% org
anic revenue growth reflected organic volume 
growth of 1% and positive price mix of 4%, which helped to offset steep 
commodity inflation. And our organic net revenue growth for the quarter is 
right in line with our year
-
to
-
date performance and they're on t
rack to 
deliver the mid
-
single digit organic revenue growth target we shared with 
you at the beginning of the year.
 
So overall, our results for the quarter and year
-
to
-
date, as well as the 
outlook for the remainder of the year, are right on track.
 
So let m
e comment on each of our business units, share what's working and 
what we are pleased with and what aspects of the businesses we are still 
making progress on but remain work in process.
 
Frito
-
Lay North America delivered a strong quarter. We saw a 3% organi
c 
revenue growth in the quarter, and our brand equity scores continue to 
strengthen. Our premium products gained share in the quarter, and the 
increased advertising behind our mainstream products is strengthening our 
performance. Our value share trends hav
e sequentially improved throughout 
the year and Q3 was no exception. And as we enter Q4, we are seeing that 
trend continue.
 
Our Quaker Foods business also had a good quarter. We are gaining share in 
hot cereal, driven by both increased advertising and brea
kthrough 
innovation with Quaker Medleys. The oatmeal category is very much on 
trend both in the United States and globally, and you can expect us to 
leverage our global groups to take innovation like Real Medleys around the 
world.
 
Our Latin American Foods 
business delivered strong volume and double
-
digit 
organic revenue growth, and we continue to invest in routes and racks to 
support the robust growth in these markets.
 
In Europe, we had strong performance with organic net revenue up 7% on 6 
points of net pr
ice realization despite a challenging macroeconomic 
environment. Our performance is a result of both the portfolio strategies that 
we've executed, including our move to strengthen our presence in the 
faster
-
growing eastern European region coupled with good
 
operating 
execution to capture growth opportunities.
 
Our AMEA performance for the quarter was outstanding with strong volume 
growth, double
-
digit organic revenue growth and 14% core constant
-
currency operating profit growth. The strong results were across
 
both our 
snacks and beverages businesses. For example, in India, our snack volume 
grew 12% and our beverage volume grew 23%. In Pakistan, our snack 
volume grew 27% and beverage volume grew 25%. Beverage volume grew 
34% in Vietnam, 10% in Saudi Arabia and 
7% in the Philippines. And in 
China, the Tingyi integration is substantially complete, and we've seen 
volume growth accelerating every month since June. The fourth quarter is 
off to a strong start with CSD volume up 15% in the month of September.
 
Our North
 
American beverage performance was mixed, some positives and a 
few areas that are works in progress. As we look at Q3 performance, keep in 
mind that we had one fewer trading day due to the timing of Labor Day, 
which impacted volumes by 1 percentage point. 
On the positive side, I am 
pleased with the discipline we've maintained on pricing. We achieved 3 
points of positive price mix in the quarter. And we are pleased with our 
carbonated soft drink performance. Based on the IRI all channel data, we 
gained both 
value and volume share in the quarter. So even at higher 
pricing at retail, we grew our volume share. Our brand equity scores are 
strong, and our brand
-
building investments are working.
 
Our noncarbonated beverage performance in North America was more 
chall
enged, driven by 3 factors: first, we cleaned up our juice portfolio by 
pulling out of unprofitable juice drinks; second, we made deliberate decision 
not to compete in case
-
packed water at unprofitable pricing levels; and 
third, Gatorade's performance was 
off this quarter, which was really a 
function of competitive pricing actions and an inventory outage at one of our 
major accounts. Q4 is off to a good start, and we expect the business to be 
positive for Q4.
 
So we are being deliberate about where we're cho
osing to compete and 
about maintaining disciplined pricing. Our objective is to grow beverages 
profitably in North America and we're making the right decisions for the 
long
-
term health of the business.
 
Across PepsiCo, we continue to make good progress on t
he brand building, 
innovation, execution, productivity and cash
-
return initiatives that are key 
elements of our long
-
term plan.
 
From a brand perspective, we continue to increase the level of effectiveness 
of our advertising through our global campaigns by 
directing more of our 
spending to consumer
-
facing media. We are seeing positive results already, 
but as we've mentioned in the past, these investments typically take a year 
to fully take hold. We are 6 to 8 months into the program and I'm pleased 
with our 
steady improvement in brand
-
building initiatives. We'll be back to 
you on the fourth quarter call with another update on the specific brand 
equity performance just as we did on the second quarter call.
 
Innovation has been solid across our businesses and wa
s a key driver of our 
organic net revenue growth in the quarter. Our global beverage, snack and 
nutrition groups are having a positive impact. They are making good 
progress in refresh, reframe and breakthrough innovation and that's 
reflecting the solid top
 
line growth we've seen over the past few quarters 
and the fact that our innovation, as a percentage of net revenue, is now 
running at approximately 8% of sales. In particular, I am pleased with 
breakthrough products like Quaker Real Medley, Pepsi Next and
 
Gatorade 
Energy Chews, which have continued to steadily build during the quarter. 
We're on track to deliver in excess of $1 billion in productivity this year and 
to deliver our 3
-
year target of $3 billion. We're driving productivity across 
the entire valu
e chain across all our businesses and have a robust pipeline of 
projects that span from best practice sharing to increased automation to 
new processing technology, which all give us confidence that we will achieve 
our 3
-
year target.
 
And we continue to execute well. A good example is our activation of our 
partnership with the NFL. We are building on our 28
-
year relationship with 
the NFL, one of the world's most valuable sports properties. We are 
integrating on execution activities from
 
national advertising to localized 
packaging, in
-
store activities and promotions. The national ties between the 
NFL and PepsiCo are happening across our portfolio, from Gatorade to Pepsi 
and Lay's to even Quaker and we're leveraging them both using traditi
onal 
and social media. And at the local level, we're bringing them to life in the 
marketplace with team
-
specific packaging and merchandising displays in 22 
of 32 team markets. We also have retail store managing incentives and 
player appearances right throu
gh to the stadium with beverage and snack 
time promotions. In short, the connection between the NFL and PepsiCo is 
bigger and better than ever and enabling us to convert fans' passion for their 
teams into passion for our products.
 
We'll cap off the season'
s partnership with the NFL by having Pepsi as the 
official sponsor of the Super Bowl's halftime show. And just yesterday, we 
announced that Beyoncé will be the featured artist, so it will be a 
performance you just don't want to miss. This is just one of th
e many 
examples of our sharpened execution and it's one of the reasons why we are 
making steady progress on improving our share results.
 
Finally, we are making progress to drive higher returns on our invested 
capital and enhance shareholder return. We're d
elivering our earnings goals 
and we're converting them to stronger cash flow. We've reduced our net 
capital spending this year by $565 million year
-
to
-
date. We've returned $4.8 
billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases year
-
to
-
date, a
 
12% increase over the comparable prior year period and remain on 
track to return more than $6 billion for the full year.
 
Overall, in a cautious consumer and retail environment in developed markets 
and generally strong consumer conditions in the developing
 
and emerging 
markets, we continue to build our businesses in a fundamentally sound, 
focused, consistent manner. Our balanced portfolio of Fun

and year

full year of financial targets for 2012. Just as important, our growth is 
balanced and reflects the successful execution of our str
ategy.
 
So with that, let me turn the call over to Hugh Johnston. Hugh?
 
Hugh F. Johnston
 
Great. Thanks, Indra, and good morning, everyone. As Indra mentioned, the 
quarter came in, in line with what we were expecting. Organic net revenue 
growth increased 5% 
while our reported net revenue declined, reflecting the 
structural changes including Mexico and China, which reduced the reported 
number by approximately 5 points and by negative currency translation, 
which was a 5
-
point drag on the reported net revenue. W
e realized 1 point 
of organic volume growth and 4 points of effective net pricing globally. Core 
gross margins rose 56 basis points, driven by our effective net pricing and 
productivity initiatives, offsetting commodity inflation. And core division 
operati
ng margins were down by 13 basis points, reflecting a substantial 
increase in advertising and marketing investment to grow our brand equity.
 
All
-
in and in line with expectations, this resulted in a 3% decline in core 
division operating profit on a constant
-
currency basis and a 6% decline in 
core division operating profit on a U.S. dollar basis, reflecting a nearly 3
-
point drag from currency.
 
Core corporate unallocated expenses increased in the quarter, reflecting 
higher pension
-
related costs and a deferred 
compensation charge that was 
offset by a corresponding credit reflected in net interest expense.
 
Net interest expense was $181 million for the quarter, a decrease of 
approximately $28 million over Q3 of 2011. The impact of higher debt 
balances was more tha
n offset by lapping a debt tender premium included in 
the prior year and by the deferred compensation hedge credit I just 
mentioned.
 
And our core tax rate for the quarter was 26.3%, which is 90 basis points 
higher than the rate in Q3 of 2011.
 
And finally, 
our fully diluted share count was down 2% in the quarter 
compared to the prior year period, reflecting the impact of our share 
repurchase program.
 
So in total, below
-
the
-
line items, mainly pension
-
related expenses we 
recorded at the corporate level and a h
igher tax rate offset somewhat by the 
benefit of reduced share count drove about 1 point of deleverage from our 
core constant
-
currency division operating profit decline of 3% to our core 
constant
-
currency EPS decline of 4%.
 
Turning to our outlook. From an 
earnings perspective, consistent with our 
previous outlook and what we've been saying since February, we expect our 
core constant
-
currency EPS to decline 5% for the year. We're on target to 
increase our investment in advertising and marketing to 5.7% of re
venue 
this year, an increase of 50 basis points over our investment level last year.
 
Now I realize that EPS for the first 3 quarters came in a bit ahead of 
consensus estimate, but you should not flow that through to the bottom line 
as you update your full 
year models. Our intention is to reinvest any upside 
into the business to support and accelerate our brand building, innovation 
and productivity initiatives.
 
Based on current ForEx market consensus, currency translation would have 
approximately 3 points un
favorable impact on our full year core EPS, and we 
expect the core tax rate to be approximately 27% for the full year.
 
As you update your models for the fourth quarter, you should be mindful of 
a few items in particular. The impact of structural changes wi
ll have an 
approximate 2.5
-
point negative impact on revenue. ForEx is expected to 
have an approximate 1 point negative impact on revenue and operating 
profit. We anticipate both commodity inflation and price realization to 
moderate somewhat in the fourth q
uarter from the level we saw in Q3.
 
We're lapping several divestiture gains from Q4 of 2011, most notably the 
sales of several unrelated businesses within QFNA and LAF and the sale of 
our interest in a bottler in AMEA.
 
Corporate unallocated expenses in Q4 
are expected to be higher than in Q3 
due to the fact that Q4 is a longer reported period, so we have 4 additional 
weeks of costs in the fourth quarter as compared to the third quarter.
 
Net interest expense is expected to be higher year
-
on
-
year in Q4, given
 
higher debt balances and higher rates.
 
From a cash flow standpoint, year
-
to
-
date reported cash generated by 
operating activities was $5.1 billion, which includes a $1 billion discretionary 
pension and retiree medical contribution that we made in Q1. Refle
cting our 
capital spending productivity initiatives, net CapEx is down $565 million 
year
-
to
-
date and down more than 120 basis points as a percentage of 
revenue on a rolling 4
-
quarters basis.
 
In addition, our operating working capital also improved year
-
to
-
date with 
net working capital on receivables, inventory, prepaid expenses and 
payables improving by $685 million year
-
on
-
year.
 
Our management operating cash flow, excluding certain items, improved by 
$670 million to $4.9 billion year
-
to
-
date.
 
For the full 
year, we expect to generate more than $6 billion in management 
operating cash flow, excluding certain items, and return more than $6 billion 
in dividends and share repurchases.
 
Net, the quarter came in where we expected. The pricing picture and 
volumes ove
rall were positive, and our outlook for the year for earnings, 
cash flow and cash returns is completely consistent with what we've shared 
previously with you.

Just a question on Americas Beverages. Just if

just want to understand 
the drag that you saw in the quarter in t
he noncarb portfolio relative to the 
inventory outage, I guess, on Gatorade and also calling some SKUs. Does 
that also continue into the fourth quarter and 2013, or is that just a 3Q

I was hoping for more detail on your progress so far with the Tingyi alliance, 
and specifically I'm curious for how much progress you've made in te
rms of 
expanded distribution so far and how distribution expansion plays out going 
forward over the next few quarters.
 
Indra K. Nooyi
 
So the Tingyi deal was closed in the early part of second quarter. And 
through June, July and August, we went through the 
integration process. 
And starting sort of June, July, we started seeing the volumes pick up 
because the integration activities were completed. And in September, we 
actually saw the CSD volumes grow 15%. Now September is the first month 
in Q4, so it's not i
n the Q3 numbers. We haven't yet started to reap the 
benefits of the increased Tingyi manufacturing footprint because we haven't 
yet pulled the [indiscernible] lines in the new Tingyi plant. So the benefit 
you're seeing now is just the benefits from our ow
n brand equity and our 
focus back on the business now that the integration activities are over. On 
the reported number, you saw volumes in AMEA up significantly, that's 
because some of the juice volume that we have transitioned to Tingyi and 
everything got
 
rebranded as Tropicana, so you'll start seeing an acceleration 
of our noncarbonated beverage business starting Q4 and going into 2013. As 
we've mentioned before, the alliance between PepsiCo and Tingyi creates the 
largest beverage company in China with a 
1.5 to 1.6 relative market share 
of 
--
 
versus the next largest competitor. Between us, we will basically cover 
the entire country and have over 70 plants between the 2 of us in China. So 
I think us going into 2013 and forward, this business is going to loo
k very, 
very good.

Your next question comes from the line of John Faucher with JPMorgan.
 
John A. Faucher

JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division
 
Wanted 
--
 
just want to ask about Frito. So as we look at this, you're getting 
a little bit of volume
 
growth, a little bit of positive price mix. From what we 
can tell from the scanner data, you're losing a little bit of share within the 
category. So can you talk about sort of what you're willing to do in terms of 
going after the higher end and in terms o
f getting the shares up? And how 
much do you view Frito as look, we'll take the top line and the share growth 
is less important, or do you feel like you need to fight back a little bit more 
aggressively to stem some of the share declines? And can you also 
comment 
on shares in C&G relative to shares in large format?
 
Indra K. Nooyi
 
John, I'm just going to give you some overall comments and then toss it to 
Brian Cornell who's here. Frito
-
Lay, as we mentioned in the script, we're 
seeing sequential improvement i
n shares Q2, Q3, and in Q4 we're actually in 
the positive territory. So we feel very, very good about it. Second, we talked 
about the premium business, the value business and the mainstream 
business. The good news is in premium, we are now gaining share; 
m
ainstream, the share is stabilized and now getting into positive territory. 
And we want to make sure we crack the code on the value business in a 
responsible way without diluting anything we're doing in the mainstream 
business. We are focused on share. We 
do not intend to lose share on a 
consistent basis. We are the category, so we are looking at ways that we can 
keep the share progression and remain in the positive territory. So let me 
turn it to Brian to give you a little bit more color on Frito
-
Lay and a
lso talk 
about the convenience trend.
 
Brian C. Cornell
 
Sure. Well, John, as Indra mentioned, we really felt like Tom and the team 
delivered very strong results in the third quarter. That team is focused on 
balancing both profit volume and growing share. An
d I think some of the 
investments we've made in the first half of the year really started to pay 
dividends in the third quarter. Our investments in brand, in innovation, our 
continued focus and execution delivered 1% pound growth. We saw that 
translate to 
3% in revenue. And despite a 41% increase in our advertising 
expenditures, we grow our [indiscernible] by 1%. So we're starting to see 
that deliver stability and share. And as I look at our share over the balance 
of the year, we expect to see sequential im
provement continue. We were 
very pleased with our share performance at T10 [ph], both from a value 
standpoint, but importantly from a volume standpoint. And that increased 
pound growth is turning into an increase in our overall volume share. So we 
feel lik
e we're on the right track. We've taken a very disciplined approach at 
Frito. We got our pricing in the first half of the year, but we're now seeing 
pound growth, revenues increase and stability and share improvement from 
a volume standpoint. So I really f
eel like we're on track at Frito and we 
expect to see sequential improvement in the fourth quarter. John, you also 
asked about some of the overall trends, and before I just jump into C&G, 
why don't I just give you a general sense for the food and beverage 
landscape in the third quarter. Overall, we did see food and beverage trend 
soften in Q3. And if you remember, the second quarter report, as we started 
talking about these new [indiscernible] results, the overall food and 
beverage growth was 3.9% in the se
cond quarter. That softened to a growth 
rate of 2.4% in Q3. That was largely driven by soft trends in grocery, and we 
did see grocery soften to only a 50 basis point growth rate in the third 
quarter. That was down from growth of 1.4% in Q2. C
-
store continu
es to 
outperform the overall food and beverage trends. And again, in the third 
quarter, C&G was up 4%, so continuing to outperform the overall food and 
beverage trend. And as Indra mentioned, we continue to see big growth in 
that value segment and dollar c
ontinued to drive very strong growth. It was 
up 16.1% in the second quarter and actually increased its growth rate in Q3 
to 18.3%. So overall at Frito, we feel like we're on the right track. We're 
looking to balance our focus between maintaining and growin
g our position 
in the mainstream. Indra mentioned we've been focused on accelerating our 
performance in premium. And in a category that grew 16%, our 
performance in premium was up 17%. So we're building share in those 
important categories and we're focused
 
on our portfolio performance in the 
value segment. But overall for Frito, a very solid third quarter. We feel like 
we're building sequential performance as we go into Q4 and we're balancing 
that with the changing retail landscape.

Your next quest
ion comes from the line of Kaumil Gajrawala with UBS.
 
Kaumil S. Gajrawala

UBS Investment Bank, Research Division
 
If I can ask also about China and maybe a 2
-
part question. The first is if 
you'd like to give just some context on what you're seeing from a 
macro 
perspective. And then second, your results are quite different from what 
we're seeing with some other companies in the region. So can you talk 
maybe about the sustainability of the strength you're seeing in China. And 
then maybe, is there 
--
 
was ther
e anything that was, short term, maybe 
incremental distribution or anything in 3Q that may not continue forward in 
the next year or so?
 
Indra K. Nooyi
 
So Kaumil, I'm going to start with the last question you asked and then work 
my way backwards. First, the
re was nothing in Q3 that was a result of 
increased distribution because we haven't even begun to reap the benefits of 
the increased distribution that, as I said earlier, will come in the first quarter 
of 2013 and forward. So what you're seeing is just the
 
strength of the brand 
and our innovation in China. That's the first observation. Second, both our 
snacks and beverage businesses are growing very nicely. The snacks 
business was always growing well. The beverage business, for a quarter or 
2, went through 
its transition pains, but we're through with that and the 
business is back to growth. And so we feel good about China business 
overall. Being in partnership with Tingyi has really strengthened our 
franchise massively and given us instant access to the whol
e country. And 
once we've put the right manufacturing lines in Tingyi's plant, remember, we 
only had about 20 plants in China. Tingyi has got over 50 plants, so the 
combination gives us complete coverage of China. And so the combination 
when once we've put
 
the [indiscernible] lines in Tingyi plants is going to give 
us a real boost in the coverage in China. Let's talk about the macros in 
China. I've been there 3 times this year, Kaumil, and I'm back in China next 
week. If you are on the ground in China, you 
don't really sense the 
slowdown. If GDP slows down from 9% or 10% to 7% to 8%, from a 
country's perspective, when you're trying to get more and more people out 
of unemployment into employment and then trying to address 
underemployment, it matters a lot. Bu
t from a consumer product 
perspective, especially on small ticket items, which are very basic food and 
beverage products, you don't really see the impact in our categories. And in 
every city that I've been in China, and I've crisscrossed the country, there
 
is 
buoyancy, there is a certain optimism in the country. Of course, everybody 
would like the growth to go back to 9% or 10% in China, but at 7% 
--
 
7.8%, 
I still think China is performing at the peak of its game versus all of the 
other countries in the reg
ion or in the world today. So macro is a bit slow 
but certainly not impacting our categories at this point.

Your next question comes from the line of Judy Hong with Goldman Sachs.
 
Judy E. Hong

Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division
 
I 
just wanted to go back to the Frito question. And I understand the volume 
trend has improved sequentially this year, but pricing has also moderated. 
So when we hear you say you're on track with Frito, I'm just wondering what 
kind of organic revenue and pro
fit growth that is really realistic for this 
business to kind of deliver in more normalized inflationary environment. Is it 
sort of 3% revenue, 5% kind of profit growth or can we get back to kind of 
mid
-
single digit, 6%, 8% kind of profit growth that we sa
w in prior years? 
And what is really needed to kind of get Frito to that position?
 
Indra K. Nooyi
 
Judy, Hugh is going to take this question and then, Brian, you can chip in 
with any additional comments you might have.
 
Hugh F. Johnston
 
Yes. Judy, why don't 
I start on the questions you're asking specifically about 
Frito's algorithm going forward. As we've talked about in the past, we don't 
share division
-
specific algorithms. We think we wind up getting into a level 
of conversation that, frankly, isn't product
ive for everyone as we get to 
quarter's end. That said, in general, I think you can expect to see, as 
commodities normalize, you can expect to see Frito go back to a more 
normal type of an algorithm. Obviously, it's been more price
-
driven as we've 
seen exc
eptional commodity inflation. As we see commodities normalize, as 
the business both does well in mainstream and continues to gain share in 
the premium segment, you can expect to see an algorithm that's a little bit 
closer to what we've traditionally delive
red in the past in Frito
-
Lay. Brian, I 
don't know if you want to add any color to that?
 
Brian C. Cornell
 
I think you've captured 
--
 
I think as we go forward, you're going to continue 
to see us take a very balanced approach. We recognize the importance of 
g
rowing pounds. We want to continue to make sure we're managing pricing 
appropriately. And we think that'll yield through our productivity initiatives, 
expansion of our [indiscernible] margins. So as we go forward, you'll 
continue to see our strategy focuse
d on building our mainstream portfolio. 
Our investments in brand and innovation are going to continue to solidify 
that position. We believe we can accelerate our position in premium, you're 
seeing that take place today. And we're very pleased with the perf
ormance 
of brands like Stacy's as we move into the fourth quarter. And we'll continue 
to make sure that we participate appropriately in the value segment. So 
we're going to stay very focused on executing that agenda, continue to 
invest in our brands, in in
novation, making sure that our execution continues 
to improve at the point
-
of
-
purchase and as a company that's very focused 
on its productivity initiatives. So a very consistent strategy as we go 
forward.

Bill Schmitz with Deutsche Bank.
 
William Schmitz

Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division
 
Can you just give us an outlook on Pepsi Americas Beverages, when you 
think volume growth is going to resume? I mean will it be as easy as when 
the pricing starts to lap
, volumes should come back? Or has there been a 
change in some of the elasticity curves? And then if I could just sneak in one 
more. Can you just tell us what Gatorade grew in the quarter?
 
Indra K. Nooyi
 
Hugh?
 
Hugh F. Johnston
 
Yes. So, hey, Bill, why don't
 
I start and then Al is here with me and he can 
add a bit as well. In terms of determining when volume growth is going to 
resume, again we're getting back to sort of decision 
--
 
division
-
specific 
guidance. It's a place that we really don't want to get into
 
on a broad
-
scale 
basis. I do think that we look at the volumes, we look at our portfolio. As 
commodities normalize, we think the category is still overall LRB, probably 
has a little bit of growth in it. And in terms of our portfolio, there's no reason 
tha
t we wouldn't be able to hold share in that environment. So a lot of the 
question of when is going to be driven by commodities and what happens 
there. But I do think that we think the category has got a little bit of volume 
growth in it and I think our por
tfolio positions us well to hold share within 
the category.
 
Indra K. Nooyi
 
But I should add another thing, Hugh, in that we've always said we want to 
grow this beverage business profitably. And this year was a big reinvestment 
year. We invested significant
ly and there was commodity inflation. But going 
into next year, we want to play this game in North American beverages very 
responsibly and make sure we're generating profit growth. So it's important 
we don't chase unprofitable businesses, unprofitable cate
gories. For 
example, bottled water. There was hell of a price war going on in bottled 
water, so we chose not to play in the unprofitable segment of bottled water. 
We did a real portfolio scrub and we said, hey, terribly unprofitable 
businesses, which were 
chased many, many years ago for the sake of 
volume share, which everybody was maniacally focused on as opposed to 
responsible volume share, we got out of. Very painful decisions, but we got 
out of that. And Gatorade was down high
-
single digits in the quart
er, but I 
would say a bulk of that was an inventory problem at a certain customer. As 
we go into Q4, we're already in the positive territory. And again, what we 
want to make sure in Gatorade is that we don't make the mistakes that we 
made in the 2004, '05,
 
'06 time frame where we grew it as a general 
hydration product as opposed to a sports nutrition product. Because if we go 
back to that strategy of just selling it as a everyman's hydration and just 
another beverage, we're again renting volume. We've been 
there, done that. 
So we want to make sure we're going after the active thirst occasion, going 
after the athlete, sustaining our pricing and then flanking our core Gatorade 
product with innovation. So that's the strategy we're going to pursue in 
Gatorade. A
nd we're going to focus on the overall beverage portfolio going 
into 2013 as opposed to looking at one category or the other. The good 
news is we started with carbonated soft drinks. It's going well. We are 
holding volume share and value share. So we're fe
eling good about that. 
And now we'll start working the other parts of the portfolio. Did you want to 
add anything?
 
Hugh F. Johnston
 
I'd just add this, just a quick thing. Our overall Pepsi
-
Cola business, our 
overall beverage business, and our bottling syst
em, our company
-
owned as 
well as our franchise bottling system, was actually right in line with Q2. And 
our CSD trends are actually better with an improved share. Now, the 
Gatorade business was the big drag on our non
-
carb business in Q3. Some 
of that we k
new was going to happen because we were lapping a time when 
we put DSD Gatorade out on our route trucks in the drug and the dollar 
channels, so we ended up having to lap that business and we knew that 
would probably happen. But we also chose to not partici
pate in some deep 
discounts that we had on Gatorade from a year ago. And while it was 
painful, this is a year we're trying to clean up that portfolio where we're not 
renting share and getting into promotions that we really can't sustain the 
volume. So righ
t after the summer was over with, our Gatorade business 
has moved back to a growth territory. And the way we think about Gatorade 
right now is it can grow through 3 steps: one is what I call solid, hybrid EDV 
[ph] pricing where we're competitive, but we're
 
reasonable on the shelf 
every day. The second thing is advertising that's effective. And I think if you 
look at this RG3 advertising that's being played out on a lot of the NFL 
shows and also on the baseball playoffs, that's the kind of advertising that 
w
orks for Gatorade. We're getting very good consumer response from it. 
And then finally, product news. And these new Chews are doing a terrific 
job, but they're small. We have plans next year for improved product news 
on the base Gatorade business that I th
ink will add some growth. So all in 
all, it was a short
-
term blip for Gatorade and I expect that, that business will 
be solid for the balance of the year.

Your next question comes from the line of Ali Dibadj with Bernstein.
 
Ali Dibadj

Sanford C.
 
Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division
 
So one quick clarification on the core question, just a quick clarification in 
terms of the stuff you pulled out in terms of cleaning up the juice and not 
playing in water, why that's just a Q3 effect versus going 
forward. But the 
core question is if you take all of the explanation, that face value from a PAB 
volume perspective in this quarter, or even FLNA and how you're thinking 
about that and you translate that forward, do you think you're going to have 
to invest
 
more in this category to get the results you're getting now? Or do 
you think you're at the right level of investment for the types of growth 
you're seeing in those categories, underlying, taking away all these outages 
on inventory and all that sort of stu
ff?
 
Indra K. Nooyi
 
Ali, I believe that we are investing at the right amount in this business. What 
we talked about is stepping up our advertising from 5.2% to 5.7% this year 
and then we said over the next 3 years we're going to increase that steadily, 
okay
? And at this point, we feel good about where we are. The other thing 
we're doing is advertising money that sat with our bottling partners, our 
joint venture partners. We're making sure that's also being deployed the 
right way and that's not even included 
in the 5.7% numbers. So I think, 
taken together, all the marketplace investment that we have in the 
marketplace today, the fact that we're shifting more nonworking media to 
media 
--
 
working media and that we are focusing our portfolio down to 12 
muscular b
rands, I think all of that is really driving results for the business 
and we feel good about the progress. Now all of this is for naught if we don't 
back it up with good innovation. So our global groups are focused on 
innovation and not just rifle
-
shot inn
ovation, more platform innovation and 
focusing on refresh, reframe and breakthrough. And I think this sort of a 
deliberate focus on innovation, deliberate focus on execution and brand 
building is beginning to yield results. And what we have to make sure is
 
that 
we don't chase or we don't try to chase volume growth at all costs. I think 
historically the strategy has been for many people in this industry to go after 
volume growth at all costs. So bottled water was fair game, going after 
value snacks without r
egard to responsible portfolio management was sort of 
the right thing to do for the segment 
--
 
for the category. I think going 
forward, especially large companies like us, branded companies like us, we 
have to think through carefully which parts of the por
tfolio we actually add 
value. And that's why I think we're playing a much more focused, deliberate 
and differential game going forward.

Yes, Mark, this is Hugh. The numbers on sparkling and on noncarbs,

ted, we were basically in line with primary competition. 
Noncarbonated was down 7, which was obviously much 
--
 
a much deeper 
number. And the reasons were exactly the ones that Indra shared earlier: 
number one, we made some changes in terms of some unprofit
able juice 
drink businesses that we had; number two was there were some pretty 
aggressive case
-
packed water deals out there that we chose not to 
participate in; and then number three was the Gatorade issue that we've 
been talking about. Going forward, the 
Gatorade issue is behind us. As Al 
has referenced, we're back to growth in the fourth quarter. In terms of the 
unprofitable juice, I think we're largely past that now at this point. That 
overlap is also largely behind us. Case
-
packed water, as Indra mentio
ned, 
our stance is going to be consistent on that. We're not interested in chasing 
unprofitable case
-
packed water deals. So given all of that, we'd certainly 
expect to see the noncarb numbers pick up on a go
-
forward basis and that's 
how we're thinking abou
t it.

Mark, the other part of your question was about the tremendous amount of 
volume done on promotion in the category. It's not just us, I think it's the 
overall category. And the answer is, we're moving to what I call a hybrid 
EDV [ph] p
ricing strategy. It's a tricky thing to implement, so you can't do it 
overnight. But I think towards the end of the fourth quarter, you'll see more 
of that and certainly in 2013.
 
Hugh F. Johnston
 
And that'll benefit, we believe, pricing flow

through within
 
the PepsiCo P&L. 
We think it's the right strategy.

Couple of questions. But I'm actually going to ask about your thinking in 
North America Beverages. First, I think you said that you'll examine all 
underperforming assets and you've done that with Mexico, done it with 
China very successfully. Can you update
 
us, Indra, on your thinking on 
North American bottling ROIC, et cetera? And separately, energy drinks are 
taking market share in CSDs and they seem to be, to some degree, the 
drink of the youth today. What's your position on energy drinks?
 
Indra K. 
Nooyi
 
On energy drinks, I think the way we'd like to play the energy drinks is in a 
more responsible way, maybe I should use that word. We have some 
interesting launches that we have next year on the cards, which plays it in a 
way that is consistent with o
ur product portfolio and consistent with where 
we think consumers want to go with energy. So I think that's the right 
strategy for energy and you'll see some of those launches coming to the 
marketplace next year. There's no question energy drinks took shar
e from 
mainstream players. But I think that's not a strategy that any of the big 
companies could have deployed and been successful at. So we're going to 
take a more responsible and a disciplined approach in energy drinks going 
into next year. Let's talk ab
out our thinking in North American beverages. 
What we told you earlier this year was that in North American beverages, we 
were going to execute 
--
 
improve our execution significantly. We would 
invest behind brand building. It was going to take a year or 18
 
months to 
start to see the results. And we are very steadily executing on the game 
plan that we outlined for you in the early part of February. Meanwhile, we 
also have seen some interesting results come out from our technology 
investments. And our hope is
 
that by this time next year, we should start 
seeing the benefit of a lot of the technology bets we placed, whether it's 
natural sweeteners, enhancers, whatever that will allow us to go in and 
create real differentiation in our product portfolio, especiall
y in carbonated 
soft drinks so that we can actually offer to the consumers in the 2014 and 
beyond a product portfolio that consumers love. They love bubbles, they 
love the caffeine, they love cola taste, but addresses any value that might 
exist in the area
s of sugar in the portfolio or artificial sweeteners. So we are 
optimistic about the results of R&D investment and we are hopeful that 
towards the end of 2013, early 2014 and beyond, we can actually launch 
differentiated innovation in some of our core cate
gories. So our North 
American beverage business, our reinvestment activities, our turnaround 
activities are all on track and we'll keep giving you updates every quarter. 
But believe me, we look at everything about this business and we look at 
improving the
 
returns of the company on an ongoing basis.
 
Hugh F. Johnston
 
And Indra, if I can add one more comment to that. Just going back to the 
energy drink question, I want to take one thing off the table very explicitly. 
We do not have the strategy or an intentio
n to deploy significant M&A capital 
into the energy drink category. So I want to make sure we're crystal clear on 
that so that it's well understood by all.

Indra, I thought it was interesting on the Asia, Middle East and Africa 
business not only the great volume performance, but really the margin 
performance. And I wonder if you take a step back and you 
talked about 
China, do you 
--
 
is there an opportunity over time to raise the margin of that 
business over 
--
 
through positive price mix over time? I think we're trained 
to thinking about emerging markets businesses as lower gross margin. I 
think that's tru
e in most cases. But have we hit inflection point at China or 
other major emerging markets where either volumes are good enough, the 
consumer healthy enough that you can really start to up margin those 
markets over the next couple of years?
 
Indra K. Nooyi
 
I think, overall, AMEA, our Middle East business is very strong. Great volume 
growth, revenue growth, margin growth, margin expansion, profit growth, 
no issues. I think markets like South Asia, you get tremendous volume 
growth, you get revenue growth, but 
we're also investing heavily because 
the market is growing 15%, 20%, so we have to put in tremendous 
investment to keep the growth going. And the good news is once the growth 
starts moderating and I hope it takes many years before it moderates, the 
busines
s starts to yield very, very attractive return. But on the short term, 
we have to keep growing the business through investments, both P&L and 
on the balance sheet. And in China, absolutely once the Tingyi deal is up and 
running, which we hope will be going
 
into 2014 and beyond, you should start 
seeing margins in the beverage business improve. But again, we want to 
reinvest that back in the snacks business and keep growing the overall 
portfolio. So basically, what we are focused on is PepsiCo as an overall 
p
ortfolio. AMEA will always be a big growth engine. We will always keep 
investing in AMEA, and then the slower growth markets will be the source of 
investment for areas like AMEA. And so taken together, this portfolio should 
be able to deliver for PepsiCo a
long the lines that we talked about.

It's been great to hear that you've been able to confirm, and I guess, 
reaffirm guidance for this year 
throughout the year. But as most of us are 
thinking about next year, Indra, I was curious to get your confidence level if 
you think we could return to your long
-
term growth goals in 2013?
 
Indra K. Nooyi
 
I'm going to have Hugh talk to that. Hugh?
 
Hugh F. 
Johnston
 
We'll talk about 2013 specifically in February. We've given long
-
term 
guidance to give you an indication as to how you should model out multiple 
years. But with the world as volatile as it is, we think just as a practice the 
right answer is to giv
e guidance in February as we do our Q4 call. So no 
indications, positive, negative or otherwise, in terms of 2013. We'll get to 
that in the course of a couple of months.

Your final question comes from the line of Damian Witkowski with Gabelli &

Gabelli & Company, Inc.
 
As we're 6, I think, 8 months into the incremental advertising spend here in 
the U.S., just curious how do you measure its effectiveness and how 
--
 
is 
there a way of measuring shorter
-
term versus just looki
ng at it from a long
-
term perspective? And then any media that's performing better than other, 
whether it's for beverages or snacks, that's sort of standing out?
 
Indra K. Nooyi
 
We did talk about the fact that we are going to be measuring brand equity, 
espe
cially of the 12 big brands that we outlined in our February meeting. 
And we're doing 2 things: We're looking at what we're doing in process and 
then we're looking at sort of tailpipe metrics. In process, we're looking to 
make sure that we are shifting mor
e nonworking media to media 
--
 
to 
working media. And then we're also making sure we're investing more in the 
12 brands and slowly start to cull the tail. So we are making progress on 
that and we track it almost on a monthly basis. From a tailpipe metric, i
t's 
brand equity. Now typically, brand equity scores take 12, 18 months to 
really show improvement, sustained improvement. Interestingly, as we 
shared with you in our Q2 scorecard, and we're going to show you again the 
next scorecard in Q4 as part of our Q
4 call, we are beginning to see 
improvement across most of the brand portfolio. So the programs we have 
in place, the additional investment and the fact that we're doing a 360
-
degree activation, not just spending money on television advertising, but in 
the
 
digital world, executing better, doing the right promotion. All of that, 
we're seeing as beginning to drive the brand equity scores into positive 
territory. Now let me make sure we all understand. Our brand equity scores 
for these 12 brands is already pre
tty high. And we wanted to make sure that 
we continue to hold it or increase it in an advertising environment that was 
extremely cluttered. And I think the efforts that we're undertaking we're 
already beginning to see some results, which is very, very comf
orting to see. 
And I think as the quarters go on, you'll see even more benefit and that will 
then translate to higher value share. And so we're watching this virtuous 
circle very, very carefully and making adjustments as we go along and it's 
happening both
 
in beverages and snacks and our nutrition products and it's 
across all 12 brands.
 
So with that, let me just say, in closing, Q3 marked good progress against a 
clear, focused plan. As we said earlier, our AMEA region had an excellent 
quarter across
-
the
-
boa
rd. Europe delivered solid results behind good pricing 
and marketplace execution. Americas Foods had good volume growth and 
net price realization. Share trends in Frito
-
Lay North America are 
encouraging. And North American beverages, we gained value share 
in 
carbonated beverages while executing a cleanup of unprofitable segments of 
our noncarbonated beverage portfolio. Our stepped up brand
-
building 
investments are beginning to pay off. Innovation performance is improving. 
We are executing in a disciplined w
ay in the marketplace. We're on track to 
deliver our productivity commitment and on our cash returns to you, our 
shareholders. In short, we are executing with great focus to drive results 
and do what's right for the short
-
term, medium
-
term and long
-
term he
alth 
of the business.
 
So with that, let me just say thank you to all of you for joining us and for the 
confidence you've placed in us with your investment. Have a good day.

And now. it's my pleasure to introduce Indra Nooyi.
 
Indra K. Nooyi
 
Thanks, Jamie, and good morning, everyone. Our second quarter results 
came in right in line with our expectat
ions. The major economies we do 
business in, consumer behavior, the competitive landscape and commodities 
were all in line with our assumptions and expectations. Net revenue in the 
quarter grew 5% on an organic basis, supported by organic net revenue 
growt
h in each of our 4 business units. This is a solid result, reflecting 
balanced revenue management, which led to a healthy price mix benefit.
 
Our organic net revenue growth was 5% year
-
to
-
date, and we're on track to 
deliver organic revenue growth of mid
-
sin
gle
-
digits for full year 2012. Our 
organic net revenue growth was ahead of our reported revenue growth, 
owing to structural changes and to the negative impact of translating our 
international revenues with the strengthened dollar in Q2. The structural 
chan
ges included refranchising our bottling operations in Mexico in the 
fourth quarter of last year and, in China, with the transaction with Tingyi at 
the beginning of Q2.
 
As a consequence of entering into new franchise agreements with our highly 
capable partn
ers, we no longer report bottling revenues in these markets. 
From a strategic standpoint, these transactions strengthen our operations 
and are expected to improve our operating margins and key efficiency 
metrics, including revenue and EBIT per employee, im
prove our returns on 
capital and reduce the capital intensity of PepsiCo's operations in these 
markets.
 
Importantly, in addition to very solid organic top line growth in the quarter, 
we continue to gain traction on the brand building, innovation, and execu
tion 
of productivity initiatives that are key elements of our 2012 plan. Before I 
discuss progress on these initiatives though, let me quickly review the 
financial highlights for Q2.
 
Our financial results are right in line with our expectation. Core EPS wa
s 
$1.12. As I just mentioned, organic net revenue grew 5% and it reflected 
strong price mix across all of our businesses. Globally, price mix was up 4%, 
and this pricing helped to offset the impact of about $350 million of 
commodity cost inflation. We had 
growth in both global snack revenue and 
global beverage revenue on an organic basis. In emerging and developing 
markets, revenue growth was particularly strong, up 9% on an organic 
basis, led by strong double
-
digit organic revenue growth in key emerging 
ma
rkets.
 
Results are generally strong across our 4 business units, and each business 
unit posted organic revenue growth and achieved solid productivity gains to 
help offset inflation. Within PepsiCo Americas Foods, Frito
-
Lay North America 
executed very delib
erate channel and revenue management strategies that 
drove very good net price realization revenue growth, especially in the C
-
store and foodservice channels, and positive unit growth overall, while they 
delivered volume performance that was even with prio
r year. We could have 
employed different volume
-
oriented tactics, particularly in large format 
channels, but they would have been detrimental to our overall channel mix 
and net pricing objectives, and we are comfortable with the channel, pricing, 
unit and 
volume balance we achieved.
 
PepsiCo Americas Beverages had another solid quarter of solid net price 
realization. We remain highly disciplined in the execution of our price/pack 
and channel strategies, and as a result, we are seeing very good 
performance in
 
the immediate consumption packages, which led to strong 
net revenue growth in the C
-
store channel, and we are seeing good, stable 
and value share performance relative to our primary competitor in measured 
channels.
 
Europe was a terrific story with strong 
performance, with organic net 
revenue up 3% and constant currency operating profit up 15%. Zein will 
comment on Europe in more detail in a few minutes.
 
In AMEA, we had 10% organic net revenue growth and terrific operating 
profit performance, reflecting the
 
strength of the top line growth and our 
productivity programs. Overall, our Q2 results encourage us that we're 
making good progress, and we're on track to deliver our full year financial 
targets.
 
Let me now turn to the progress we are making on our key in
itiatives for the 
year. We remain focused on 5 big areas: brand building, innovation, 
execution, productivity and driving cash returns. Let me talk to each of 
them.
 
On brand building. We're on target to increase our investment in advertising 
and marketing 
to 5.7% of revenue this year, which is an increase of 50 basis 
points over our investment level last year. We've made good progress on 
increasing our consumer
-
facing A&M investment, focused on 12 global mega 
brands, to drive greater scale and impact with o
ur spending. Much of this is 
enabled by having much greater coordination among our operations globally, 
allowing us to leverage creative and production activities across multiple 
geographies, which gives us cost leverage and drives greater consistency in 
o
ur brand messaging.
 
And we've significantly stepped up our media in key markets. For example, 
in the United States alone, our media spending was up over 40% in the 
second quarter and over 30% year
-
to
-
date. And we're beginning to gain 
traction with these ef
forts. Brand equity scores for our major brands in our 
key markets are showing improvement in many cases and are stabilizing in 
the remainder. We will sustain our efforts in this area, and we are confident 
we will see higher brand equity scores translate i
nto strong top line growth 
with healthy price premiums.
 
Our second focus area is innovation, where our goal is to consistently 
increase the contribution of new products to our total net revenue. Our 
innovation is targeted on specific channels, cohorts and 
occasion 
opportunities and with the balance focused on Fun
-
for
-
You, Better
-
for
-
You 
and Good
-
for
-
You products.
 
For example, at Frito
-
Lay North America, innovation drove incremental sales 
all across the portfolio. Doritos had double
-
digit sales growth in the
 
quarter 
behind innovations such as Doritos JACKED and Doritos Locos Tacos, which 
continues to drive strong growth at Taco Bell. Ruffles delivered mid
-
single
-
digit sales growth, supported by incremental sales from Ruffles Ultimate, 
which continues to gain 
distribution during ramp up, with strong retail 
activations surrounding the launch.
 
In our Frito
-
Lay growth ventures business, which is focused on incubating 
new premium and value products, revenue grew 13% in the quarter, led by 
double
-
digit gains in Stac
y's and our Smartfood platform.
 
In North American beverages, Pepsi Next is off to a strong start, and we 
have just launched 2 new limited
-
time
-
only flavors, Pepsi Next Cherry 
Vanilla and Pepsi Next Paradise Mango, to satisfy the thirst of cola lovers 
looki
ng for unique fruit flavor blends, both with 60% less sugar than regular 
colas.
 
We're also driving growth across the Gatorade portfolio, with additions to the 
G Series line and introduction of differentiated packaging. One of our most 
recent introductions 
is the Prime Chew. The Chews come in 3 flavors and 
contain 25 grams of carbohydrates, as well as B vitamins, to help your body 
break down carbs into fuel and helps you maintain your performance 
throughout your activity.
 
And at Quaker, we are driving organi
c sales growth and share gains with 
innovation like Quaker Real Medleys and Quaker Yogurt Bars. Interestingly, 
on both Quaker Real Medleys and the Gatorade Chews, we are selling all we 
have the capacity to make. Year
-
to
-
date, our innovation is off to a goo
d 
start, and it provides a good base to build on.
 
Let me turn to execution. We are measuring and driving execution across 
every element of the value chain to increase efficiency, quality and service 
to best
-
in
-
class levels, and we are seeing good results a
cross our functions 
and businesses. One example is how we've executed our price/pack and 
channel mix strategies this year, driving strong revenue realization and 
positive mix. This is evident in North America where our C
-
store growth 
remains very strong, w
ith retail sales gaining 8% in both snacks and 
beverages in the second quarter, making us the #1 contributor to growth in 
the channel. In fact, PepsiCo was the largest contributor to food and 
nonalcoholic beverage growth across all measured channels in the
 
United 
States in the second quarter.
 
And our businesses are executing well together. We launched our Rock Your 
Summer campaign, where consumers are encouraged to match, snap and 
win. Match any Frito
-
Lay product with any Pepsi beverage product and then 
sna
p and submit a picture of the 2 products for a chance to win a variety of 
prizes. We featured the campaign in 46 of our top 50 retail accounts and 
increased our Power of One displays on the grocery channel by 13% 
compared to last summer. Joint promotion me
rchandising is a key element 
of our Power of One programming, and it's driving coincidence of purchase 
of PepsiCo beverages and PepsiCo snacks at a rate well above our fair share.
 
And our execution focus is especially evident in many of our emerging and 
de
veloping markets. For example, we had strong double
-
digit organic 
revenue growth in beverages in India and Brazil and snacks in Mexico and 
India, and we are especially pleased with the progress we've made in 
Eastern Europe.
 
I'd like to ask Zein to give 
us a quick update on this business, which had 
very good results this quarter. Zein?
 
Zein Abdalla
 
Thank you, Indra, and good morning, everyone. Despite the well
-
known 
challenges in Europe, we continue to build momentum in our business, 
beginning with a very
 
solid performance in Q1 followed by strong results in 
Q2. We grew our organic net revenue by 3% and delivered 15% growth in 
our core constant currency net operating profits. We've done this through a 
disciplined approach to pricing and mix management, tog
ether with terrific 
execution against an aggressive productivity agenda. A particular highlight 
this quarter has been our acceleration in Eastern Europe, where our 
successful integration of Wimm
-
Bill
-
Dann and our Power of One initiatives 
drove outstanding 
results in Russia.
 
Our success has really been enabled by the transformation we've made to 
our business over the last few years, with a strong focus on expanding in the 
faster
-
growing Eastern European markets, encompassing a broader set of 
categories to ca
ter for more consumer needs and day part, a portfolio that is 
wonderfully balanced across Fun
-
for
-
You, Better
-
for
-
You and Good
-
for
-
You, 
which is the best way to compete in this region. In 2008, less than 25% of 
Europe's revenue mix came from the east. And 
by last year, that figure had 
increased to well over 50%. And this portfolio transformation is helping us 
weather the macroeconomic headwinds facing other parts of Europe.
 
PepsiCo Europe's increasingly diverse category portfolio 
--
 
about 40% of net 
revenue
 
comes from snack, with the remainder well balanced across 
noncarbonated beverages, DSDs and dairy 
--
 
has positioned us to respond 
to changing consumer preferences and to strengthen our mix.
 
Central to these changes has been PepsiCo's journey in Russia, on
e we 
embarked upon some 50 years ago. Through our recent investments, we've 
built the largest food and beverage business in Russia, a powerhouse 
business primed for growth and positioned to capitalize on the market with 
lots of growth potential. PepsiCo Ru
ssia net revenues now represent some 
40% of our total sector's revenue, and Russia is growing profit at the fastest 
rate in Europe.
 
We have leading positions in multiple categories: savory snacks, juice, tea, 
water, energy and dairy, with a portfolio of st
rong global and local brands. 
In fact, we now have 10 of the top 25 nonalcoholic food and beverage 
brands in Russia, each with retail sales of more than $250 million.
 
By building on this strong base, PepsiCo Russia provides a gateway to more 
than 400 milli
on consumers. It's our base for expanding successfully across 
Eastern and Central Europe, and we started to see the benefits of this in the 
quarter with accelerated growth in Ukraine and other CIS markets.
 
The integration of Wimm
-
Bill
-
Dann is progressing v
ery well. Adding this to 
the Power of One business infrastructure we had already put into place 
across our Russian businesses, we've been able to drive significant synergies 
and productivity. We have a fully integrated and low
-
cost supply chain and 
back of
fice, delivering substantial cost synergies.
 
We have tremendous go
-
to
-
market advantage with unparalleled reach 
across the organized and traditional trade channels. We've created a single
-
sales structure to our top 8 national accounts, enabling us to capita
lize on 
the benefits of scale to enhance customer engagement. We've integrated our 
foodservice teams in Moscow and St. Petersburg, now delivering dairy, juice, 
beverages and snacks to on
-
premise and social channels.
 
The top line synergies have come in, in 
the form of convergence and brand 
building and go
-
to
-
market, which is the recent launch of Oats products 
under Chudo branding and with single
-
serve kefir, or drinkable yogurt, being 
distributed through the PepsiCo system. All this is helping us to deliver 
strong revenue realization through selective pricing, portfolio management 
and strong, speedy innovation.
 
We have very strong share positions across our strategic categories in 
Russia. Highlights include very favorable savory snack share, with 1.9 
percenta
ge point value share gains year
-
to
-
date, and strong CSD share, with 
0.8 percentage point value share gains year
-
to
-
date. In short, we are 
pleased with our results in Europe overall, enabled by a well
-
architected 
geographic and product portfolio, with Russi
a and the balance of Eastern 
Europe well positioned to be a substantial growth engine, not only for 
--
 
in 
the European sector but for all of PepsiCo.
 
Indra K. Nooyi
 
Thank you, Zein, and that's a great report out on East Europe and Russia.
 
Let me now turn t
o productivity. We're targeting more than $1 billion in 
productivity this year and $3 billion in total over the next 3 years, which 
includes the restructuring program we announced earlier this year and our 
other productivity initiatives that are incrementa
l to our ongoing productivity 
agenda. Our productivity programs for 2012 are locked in, and we are very 
confident to deliver these targeted savings.
 
We made substantial progress against our productivity plans in the first half 
of the year. The financial be
nefits of the restructuring accelerated in Q2 and 
will continue to benefit financial performance as we move through the 
second half of the year.
 
In addition to the restructuring programs, we've also accelerated other 
productivity initiatives. We're driving
 
hard against reducing the capital 
intensity of our business and improving working capital efficiency, and we 
are already seeing good results.
 
Finally, we are doing a better job leveraging global capability and know
-
how. 
By sharing best practices and imple
menting best

in
-
class processes, we are 
improving operating performance. So we are encouraged by the pace and 
progress of our productivity plan.
 
And finally, we are taking steps to drive higher returns on our invested 
capital and enhance cash return to sha
reholders. We have reduced our net 
capital spending year
-
to
-
date by $338 million and reduced our net CapEx as 
a percentage of sales over the last 4 quarters by more than 100 basis 
points. We are achieving this, both by driving higher utilization of our ass
ets 
and by reducing the cost of replacement and growth capacity through value 
engineering and through enhanced global procurement management.
 
And we remain committed to returning cash to our shareholders. In the first 
half, we returned $2.8 billion in cash
 
to our shareholders through dividends 
and share repurchases, and we expect to return more than $6 billion for the 
full year, an increase of approximately 12%. Our dividend increased again 
this June, making 2012 our 40th consecutive year of dividend per sh
are 
increase. Based on yesterday's closing stock price, our current dividend 
represents a 3.1% annual dividend yield.
 
To recap, we are focused on brand building, innovation, execution, 
productivity and cash return. We are making good progress. We expect 
mo
mentum to continue to build as the year progresses, and we are 
confident in achieving our 2012 goals in these areas.
 
Let me now turn the call over to Hugh Johnston. Hugh?
 
Hugh F. Johnston
 
Thanks, Indra, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to start by revi
ewing 
the scorecard we introduced at our investor meeting in February. At that 
time, we shared that we'd review with you on a semiannual basis our 
performance in 8 key areas, and I'm pleased to share our initial results with 
you today and look forward to p
roviding another update following Q4.
 
Let me review the results briefly. We're focused on 4 key input metrics: 
brand strength, innovation, execution and cost and capital spending; and 
then 4 key output metrics: value share, EPS, net return on invested capi
tal 
and operating cash flow. We're making good progress on each of these, and 
our results were right in line with where we expected to be at this point in 
the year.
 
On brand strength, our objectives are to step up the level of investment in 
A&M and to impr
ove the brand equity for our major brands in our key 
markets. At the end of Q2, our brand equity scores are stable or improving 
in 85% of our key brands in strategic markets with sequential improvement 
from Q1 to Q2, and we're on track to achieve our targe
ted A&M investment 
level of 5.7% of sales for the full year.
 
On innovation, our goal is to increase the contribution of innovation to our 
overall net sales. Year
-
to
-
date, our innovation is currently at 7% of net 
revenue and is on track with where we want t
o be. And our expectation is 
for this number to trend up as we launch products currently in the pipeline.
 
Turning to execution. As a proxy for overall execution, we're providing share 
of inventory on display and coincidence of PepsiCo snack and beverage 
pu
rchases in the United States. Share of inventory on display increased in 
the second quarter for both snacks and carbonated soft drinks, and we 
continue to achieve above our fair share of co
-
purchases of salty snacks and 
CSDs, which improved from 2011 to 20
12.
 
From a market share perspective, we're gaining or holding LRB value share 
versus our primary competitor in a majority of our strategic markets. While 
our value share trends in savory are a bit more mixed, we've shown 
sequential improvement from Q1 to Q2, a
nd we expect this to continue to 
improve. This is not an area where we expect to see results overnight 
because it's partly an outcome of our brand
-
building efforts, which are just 
beginning to gain traction. We stay 
--
 
we're staying focus on this and expec
t 
to continue to see sequential improvement.
 
And we feel good about our performance against our financial metrics. Cost 
and CapEx performance are both positive, with CapEx trending at 4.4% of 
net revenue over the last 4 quarters, and we're projecting to me
et our 
targeted operating cost reduction of 75 basis points of net revenue. And with 
respect to EPS, ROIC and operating cash flow, as Indra mentioned earlier, 
we're on track to deliver our EPS and cash flow targets for 2012, and our 
capital investment in 2
012 is in line with our target to begin to see ROIC 
improvement of 50 basis points per year beginning in 2013. So overall, 
we're pleased with the progress we're making on our scorecard, and we'll 
provide another update on our Q4 call.
 
I'll wrap up now with
 
a quick discussion of the numbers in our outlook, and 
then we'll turn to Q&A. As Indra mentioned, the quarter came in, in line with 
what we expected. Organic net revenue increased 5% while our reported net 
revenue declined, reflecting the structural chang
es, including Mexico and 
China, which reduced the reported number by approximately 4 points and by 
negative currency translation, which was a 3
-
point drag on the reported net 
revenue. We realized 4 percentage points of effective net pricing with 
increases 
across each of our divisions.
 
Core gross margins were down 64 basis points, driven by higher commodity 
costs in the quarter, which is a sequential improvement from the first 
quarter. And core division operating margins were down by 22 basis points 
with pro
ductivity and SG&A helping to offset a substantial portion of the 
commodity inflation. All
-
in, this resulted in a 1% decline in core division 
operating profit on a constant
-
currency basis and a 3% decline in core 
division operating profit on a U.S. dollar 
basis, reflecting a nearly 3
-
point 
drag from currency, in line with our expectations.
 
Core corporate unallocated expenses increased in the quarter, reflecting 
higher pension
-
related costs. Net interest expense was $208 million in the 
quarter, an increase o
f approximately $30 million over Q2 of 2011, which is 
a function of both lower net interest income and higher average debt 
balances.
 
And our core tax rate for the quarter was 27.8%, which is 180 basis points 
higher than the rate in Q2 of 2011, driven by co
untry mix and the favorable 
resolution of some tax items in Q2 of last year. And finally, our fully diluted 
share count was down 1.5% in the quarter compared to the prior
-
year 
period, reflecting the impact of our share repurchase program.
 
So in total, belo
w
-
the
-
line items, mainly pension
-
related expenses we record 
at the corporate level, interest and tax rate, offset somewhat by the benefit 
of the reduced share count, drove about 3 points of deleverage from our 
core constant currency division operating prof
it decline of 1% to our core 
constant currency EPS decline of 4%.
 
Now turning to our outlook. We anticipate continued strong net effective 
pricing, which will contribute to net revenue growth but expect continued 
impact from negative currency translation a
nd from the deconsolidation of 
revenue related to structural changes. We expect continued commodity cost 
pressures. Our current outlook on commodities is consistent with our 
previous outlook at about $1.5 billion for the full year.
 
As Indra mentioned, we'r
e on track to deliver productivity of more than $1 
billion this year, which represents a substantial increase versus our historical 
productivity target. The incremental productivity is largely driven by the 
restructuring program we announced earlier this y
ear. A majority of the 
restructuring actions have already taken place, and we expect the remainder 
will take place over the course of this year. So the productivity benefits 
should accelerate as we move through the year.
 
We're investing more in A&M this ye
ar to support our brands, and we're 
making incremental marketplace investments in routes and racks. We expect 
A&M as a percent of sales to increase by approximately 50 basis points on a 
full year basis. We began to put more media in the market in the first
 
half, 
but the increase in A&M expense as a percent of net revenue in the P&L will 
actually be more pronounced in the back half based on how the accounting 
curve of the expense works. In fact, we expect A&M as a percent of sales 
will increase by approximat
ely 100 basis points year
-
on
-
year in the second 
half, so you should model this increase into your operating margin and 
operating profit growth assumptions with the impact heavier in Q3 than in 
Q4.
 
Below the division operating profit line, we expect an incr
ease in corporate 
unallocated expenses, reflecting higher pension cost related to the change in 
the discount rate and investments in productivity capability, with Q3 
corporate unallocated expected to be a bit higher than what we saw in Q2 
based on the timi
ng of expenses.
 
Full year net interest expense is expected to be higher, driven by higher 
debt balances and higher rates as we term out some of our debt during the 
year. And we expect our core tax rate to be approximately 27% for the full 
year but with som
e level of variability between the quarters. Based on 
current ForEx market consensus, currency translation would have 
approximately 3 points unfavorable impact on our full year core EPS, with a 
Q3 impact on both net revenue and operating profit estimated a
t 
approximately 5 points.
 
As you model out the second half, you should be mindful of 3 structural 
changes we've mentioned, where we will no longer record the revenue. First, 
we re
-
franchised our Mexican beverage business in early Q4 of 2011. We 
adjusted ou
r ownership in our joint venture in Almarai, such that we are now 
in the minority. And finally, we entered our alliance with Tingyi, which closed 
on March 31. We estimate the impact of these changes will be an 
approximately 5
-
point drag on our reported net
 
revenue in Q3 and 
approximately 3 points in Q4. The impact abates somewhat in Q4 as we lack 
the Mexico re
-
franchising that occurred in Q4 2011.
 
From a cash flow standpoint, year
-
to
-
date reported cash generated by 
operating activities was $1.2 billion, whi
ch includes a $1 billion discretionary 
pension and retiree medical contribution we made in Q1. Reflecting our 
capital spending productivity initiatives, net CapEx is down $338 million 
year
-
to
-
date and down more than 100 basis points as a percentage of 
reve
nue on a rolling 4 quarters basis. In addition, our working capital also 
improved year
-
to
-
date with net working capital on receivables, inventory, 
prepaids and payables improving by more than $300 million year
-
on
-
year.
 
Our management operating cash flow, e
xcluding certain items, improved by 
$28 million to $1.4 billion year
-
to
-
date. We returned $2.8 billion to 
shareholders year
-
to
-
date through dividends of $1.6 billion and share 
repurchases of $1.2 billion. For the full year, we expect to generate more 
than 
$6 billion in management operating cash flow, excluding certain items, 
and return more than $6 billion in dividends and share repurchases, 
including our previously announced increase in our quarterly dividend that 
took effect with the June dividend payment
.
 
Finally, from an earnings perspective, consistent with our previous outlook, 
we expect our core constant currency EPS to decline 5% for the year. Now I 
realize that the first cap came in a bit ahead of the consensus estimate, but 
you should not flow that
 
through to the bottom line as you model the full 
year. As I mentioned, A&M expense, based on how it was curved in last year 
and in this year, will result in a substantial reported increase in the back 
half. In addition, if we have upside in areas like com
modities, our intention is 
to reinvest those in the business to support and accelerate our brand 
building, innovation and productivity initiatives.
 
Net, the quarter came in as we expected. The pricing picture was positive, 
and our outlook for the year for 
earnings, cash flow and cash returns is 
exactly and completely consistent with what we previously shared with you.
 
And now we'll open the lines for your questions.

[Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming fr
om John Faucher with 
JPMorgan.
 
John A. Faucher

JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division
 
You talked about the convenience store business doing better generally, 
which would imply, I guess, that the large format store business is probably 
struggling a littl
e bit. So can you talk a little bit about some of the 
challenges there? Is it just fundamentally a consumer spending issue, or 
--
 
what color can you give us on the large format store business?
 
Indra K. Nooyi
 
John, I'm going to toss this over to Brian Corne
ll, and then maybe Al Carey. 
So Brian, do you want to take it from here?
 
Brian C. Cornell
 
Yes. And John, I think as you've seen, there has been considerable 
weakness in the core grocery channel, but that's being offset by growth in 
other channels: foodserv
ice, C
-
store and, certainly, club. So as we look at 
our business, we're managing through those channel mixes and making sure 
we're making profitable investments to grow our business and sustain the 
volume in those channels.
 
Indra K. Nooyi
 
Al, did you 
want to add anything?
 
Albert P. Carey
 
I'll just add one thing. It was mentioned earlier that the discounting for 
holidays, that's a disproportionate amount of the business, and we need to 
spread the value throughout the month rather than just during those 
holiday 
peak periods. And I think we're doing some work on that right now that I 
have optimism for in the future.
 
Hugh F. Johnston
 
John, this is Hugh. The only thing I'd add to that is, one of the things that's 
important to us in large format is that we ha
ve consistency in our pricing 
across the channels, and that's been a real point of emphasis for us. So to 
the degree that, that has something of an impact on volumes, particularly in 
areas like bottled water where we're not electing to go chase that type o
f 
volume, we don't view that as detrimental to the performance of the 
business nor do we do it as value creating by chasing those things. So from 
our standpoint, we're trying to maintain consistent levels of pricing discipline 
across large format channels.

Your next question comes from the line of Dara Mohsenian with Morgan 
Stanley.
 
Dara W. Mohsenian

Morgan Stanley, Research Division
 
I was hoping for more color on trends in the gas
-
convenience channel, post 
quarter end, over the last month or so 
here in the U.S. Have you seen any 
type of slowdown, or is the momentum continuing there? And what are your 
thoughts around the sustainability of some of the year
-
to
-
date strength, just 
given we saw weather boost first half results?
 
Brian C. Cornell
 
This i
s Brian Cornell. We're seeing very consistent performance trends in 
both the convenience and gas channels. Their traffic trends remain strong. 
They're seeing broad growth across regions, but very, very consistent traffic 
and revenue gains. So it's a channe
l that's performing very consistently 
across the country with strong traffic and revenue gain.
 
Indra K. Nooyi
 
And we have not seen a slowdown. Not seeing that at all.
 
Brian C. Cornell
 
We've not seen any signs of slowdown in the C&G channel.
 
Albert P. Carey
 
I'd add to that, and say that sometime ago, the convenience business was 
losing a fair amount of their volume for cigarettes, and they have done a 
pretty good job of offering food service that I think has picked up their 
business. So our trends are very s
olid in the convenience business.
 
Indra K. Nooyi
 
Go ahead, John.
 
John C. Compton
 
Dara, the other thing that the teams are doing is their more coordinated 
effort across Power of One snacks and beverages. And I think particularly in 
the convenience and gas c
hannel, that's a benefit to PepsiCo.
 
Indra K. Nooyi
 
And, what is it? We have 11 of the 15 top
-
selling SKUs in C
-
stores?
 
John C. Compton
 
Yes, 11 of the 15 top
-
selling SKUs. And as Hugh and Indra both mentioned 
in their comments, I mean, we're far and away t
he largest contributor of 
growth to the C
-
store channel.
 
Albert P. Carey
 
Our Mountain Dew and Gatorade business is very strong in the small format.
 
Indra K. Nooyi
 
And I think we have innovation and good execution of the DSD system. We 
were able to 
drive growth in this channel. Traffic still seems to be okay, 
Dara.
 
Dara W. Mohsenian 
-
 
Morgan Stanley, Research Division
 
Okay, that's helpful. And then, Al, at the Deutsche Bank conference, you 
seemed to be more focused on using mix to drive CSD pricing l
onger term 
than we've heard from Pepsi in the past. So is that an increased area of 
focus, and can you discuss how much tangible incremental benefit we could 
expect from that focus over the next few years? And then also, you 
mentioned managing the highs an
d lows from a pricing standpoint in terms 
of everyday versus holiday pricing more over time and mentioned it again 
here today. It sounds great in theory, but it's often hard to execute day
-
to
-
day. So in your mind, is that also a significant opportunity or 
something 
which takes a long time to play out?
 
Albert P. Carey
 
Well, I think 2 areas that will help us improve in the future, and this is 
balancing out the value across the month in the large format. And we're 
working on that, but it's tricky. It'll take u
s a little bit of time to get there. 
And the second thing is to offer flexible package opportunities in that 
channel as well, which we're putting capacity and capability in our system 
right now, so that in 2013, you'll see us offer more flex packaging, dif
ferent 
packages that will be variety packs and those kinds of things in the 
marketplace.

Your next question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane of Bank of 
America.
 
Bryan D. Spillane 
-
 
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division
 
Just 2 questions relate
d to the Europe and AMEA segments and profitability, 
specifically. First, in AMEA, just what effect did the implementation of the 
Tingyi relationship have on the profitability in the quarter? I guess what I'm 
trying to drive at is, was there a profit lift 
that we realized in the quarter 
because of the structural change? And then second, in Europe. Just in Russia 
--
 
the margin expansion there or the profit growth there, how much of that 
is a function of your pricing and maybe some improvement in the consumer
, 
and how much of it is still structural benefits? So integration benefits from 
Wimm
-
Bill
-
Dann. And I'm just trying to understand how much more runway 
we have in terms of margin growth there.
 
Hugh F. Johnston
 
Bryan, it's Hugh. Regarding Tingyi, we haven't 
disclosed specifics on the 
bottom line on that. It sufficed to say, in the context of the overall AMEA 
business, that we clearly got a bit of a benefit but it was not, by any stretch 
of the imagination, the big driver. The big driver was the organic 
perfor
mance of the business. Russia.
 
Zein Abdalla
 
Bryan, on Russia, I'd say the performance is just very balanced across top 
line initiatives and management of the cost [indiscernible] to productivity 
initiatives. Clearly, as we put these businesses together, we
 
have 
tremendous scale benefits as we drive supply chain consolidation, and that, 
obviously, is helping 
--
 
they're helping margin expansions. But equally, we're 
able to drive now a much more positive mix as we drive our brands into the 
convenience channel,
 
and also, we build out innovation that is highly 
accretive, highly accretive to the margin mix. So it's a very good balance 
across both.
 
Bryan D. Spillane 
-
 
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division
 
Has the nature of the competition in Russia changed at all? 
You've got so 
many more multinationals now operating in that market. Has that affected 
the competitive landscape at all?
 
Zein Abdalla
 
Clearly. I mean, Russia is an attractive market across all 
--
 
for all of the 
multinationals. But we enjoy considerable sca
le and considerable operating 
history in Russia. What it's allowed us to do is to build a talented 
management team and a capability across many years. So I mean, our 
sources of competitive advantage are both scale and the 
--
 
of the 
development of the capab
ility of our business over time.

Your next question comes from the line of Kaumil Gajrawala with UBS.
 
Kaumil S. Gajrawala 
-
 
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division
 
I know you maintained your guidance on COGS inflation and such. But I just 
want to a
sk, given the drought situation, if there's something we need to be 
thinking about 
--
 
perhaps about next year or maybe even perhaps from a 
supply chain standpoint, maybe there's not enough supply.
 
Hugh F. Johnston
 
Kaumil, this is Hugh. I'll handle that 
--
 
this one. From the perspective of 
2012, because of the forward buying or the hedging program that we have 
in place, really, nothing to discuss in that regard. Obviously, and I talked 
about this in the past, we're out about 9 months. So we were also startin
g to 
buy into 2013, given that it's already 
--
 
it was already June before the 
drought situation really started to hit and before prices started to pop in the 
last couple of weeks. The thing I would tell you in that regard is while grains 
are certainly up, 
remember that there is no individual commodity that 
accounts for even 10% of PepsiCo's overall commodity buy. So grains are 
up. Aluminum's obviously moved in the other direction. Oil and all of the 
things that flow out of energy move in the other direction
. So really nothing 
to report in terms of 2013 at this point, because we're not going to get into 
that until we get into pricing and get into more of the details of 2013. I do, 
though, just want to remind you that our basket of commodities is pretty 
broad.
 
So I know corn's certainly been in the news, but we buy an awful lot 
of other commodities as well. And the commodities numbers are moving 
both up and down depending on the individual commodity.
 
Kaumil S. Gajrawala 
-
 
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division
 
Okay, got it. And then if I can 
--
 
if I can ask you, maybe this is a softer 
answer, is operationally, obviously, earnings were a little bit ahead of 
expectations. You'll be spending that back behind the business. Is that in 
incremental spend? Are you stepp
ing up 
--
 
are you further stepping up how 
much you're going to be spending on marketing versus what your initial plan 
was, or is this part of the original plan?
 
Indra K. Nooyi
 
Go ahead.
 
Hugh F. Johnston
 
Yes. Right now, Kaumil, we're still 
basically saying we're going to spend 
5.7%, which was the number that we originally put out for the year. But 
we'll obviously continue as the year evolves to look at opportunities. And as 
the overall margin mix of the business comes in to the degree that w
e do 
have upsides, we will look to invest it behind 
--
 
behind brand
-
building 
activities. So 
--
 
but no, the 5.7% is still the number that we're talking to 
right now. The one thing to keep in mind in that regard, though, is there is 
marketing that we spend i
n the A&M line, which shows up through SG&A. 
There's also marketing in joint ventures that gets reported just in the 
consolidated joint venture line. And then there is marketing that is 
--
 
it 
comes in the form of bottler support, but it's bottler support t
hat is clearly 
A&M that occurs between gross and net revenue. Where we talked about 
5.2% to 5.7%, we were talking specifically about the SG&A, and that's the 
number that we're still saying is going to be consistent. But to the degree 
that we choose to do s
ome more marketing through bottlers, you could see 
some of those numbers change as well. We'll talk about that in Q4 as to 
where all of the numbers came out, but the one thing I want to emphasize is 
there's no change in the 5.7% number. That's the number t
hat we are 
managing to, and that's the number we'll look to hit. And as the business 
presents more opportunities, we'll evaluate what types of brand
-
building 
investment opportunities are before us at that time.

ne of Judy Hong with Goldman Sachs.
 
Judy E. Hong

I just wanted to drill into Frito
-
Lay a little bit. So from a share perspective, I 
know you talked about, sequentially, maybe getting a little bit better, and it
 
looks like the C
-
stores and non
-
measured channels are doing a little bit 
better. But just sort of taking a step back, if you can just tell us kind of what 
you're seeing from a competitive perspective and just what's holding back 
from Frito's 
--
 
from getti
ng better more quickly? And then on the profit side 
in the quarter, I'm just wondering how much of the margin decline was 
commodities. They're still 
--
 
they're not being fully offset by pricing. And 
then how much of that was marketing spending step
-
up?
 
Ind
ra K. Nooyi
 
Go ahead, Brian.
 
Brian C. Cornell
 
Yes. As Indra mentioned, we took a very disciplined approach to managing 
revenue and our channel mix during the quarter. We're really focused on 
investing in brand building, in innovation and continuing to deli
ver the 
productivity initiatives at Frito. I expect that's going to serve us well as we 
go into Q3 and Q4, and you're starting to see evidence of that in our P4 
share result, particularly during the important 4th of July period where we 
grow 
--
 
we grew sha
re at Frito. So I think we're well positioned right now to 
continue to see performance improvement in Q3 and Q4. We're going to 
continue to focus on being very disciplined in our revenue management and 
channel management mix and continue to invest in our b
rands and 
innovation to make sure that we can continue to deliver sustainable growth 
at Frito.
 
Indra K. Nooyi
 
Yes. Judy, if you recall, I think it was at CAGNY when John Compton 
presented, he talked about the Frito
-
Lay business growing at the 2 ends, the 
v
alue and the premium side, and we had a very, very, very strong position 
in the middle. The middle continues to grow. We were looking for the right 
model to compete against the value segment of the business and the 
premium segment. The premium segment, we 
started to compete with our 
growth ventures business, and that's doing very well. Again, also for small 
base. But it's doing well, and that growth will continue. Our challenge is to 
figure out the right model to play against the value players without 
impac
ting the middle, and we wanted to make sure we did it the right way 
and not take down the pricing level of the middle. And that's why when 
Brian talked about playing the channels and the portfolio very carefully, we 
want to make sure that we keep the prici
ng in place and don't take it down, 
because getting pricing back in the market is much harder than tweaking the 
product portfolio to go against specific consumer needs. So as the year goes 
on, you see improvement in Frito
-
Lay because we are fine
-
tuning the
 
model 
and doing better as the quarters go on.

15% that'
s not showing improvement?
 
Hugh F. Johnston
 
Yes. I mean, to talk to the ones that are doing better, Lay's was notably 
strong in the quarter. We really saw terrific results on Lay's, and Gatorade,

I just wanted to follow up on Judy's question. If you could talk about brand 
Pepsi, which is the centerpiece of everything you
're doing, just in terms of 
what we can look for, what you've seen so far. I know it's very, very early, 
but it's such a huge brand that 
--
 
within the total company. And I'd like to 
also understand what we can look for as progress measures in the Tingyi JV
 
going forward now.
 
Indra K. Nooyi
 
Al, you want to talk about brand Pepsi?
 
Albert P. Carey
 
Yes. Brand Pepsi, the campaign began in about April, and it's very early to 
try to indicate whether or not we've seen a result. But the thing that I like to 
look at is our single
-
serve business, which will be a first indicator, and that's 
usually not impac
ted by these holiday discounting overlaps. So we see 
growth in brand Pepsi on single serve for the first time in a very long time, 
and our brand equity scores have improved for the second quarter. So some 
improvement. We have Pepsi Next in the marketplace 
that is delivering 
about what we expected, very happy with it. And in the just recent few 
weeks, we've just launched the 
--
 
a new TV campaign and also 2 new flavors 
of the product. So let's say, cautiously optimistic on that brand.
 
Indra K. Nooyi
 
And on Ch
ina, Saad, you want to give some color on Tingyi?
 
Saad Abdul

Yes. Caroline, we really feel good about the progress of our transitioning our 
business in China to Tingyi. As you know, we've got the approval in the end 
of March, and we've spent the mont
hs of April and May and big part of June 
transitioning our business into our partner. We've moved upwards of 20 
plants and about 20,000 employees into that. Now I think the transition is 
complete, that we're going to see sequential improvement into our vol
umes. 
And basically, there are 3 areas where we will see huge improvement as we 
go Q3, Q4 and for next year. One, a new area is white areas we will have 
accessible to us that we would not have before. Two, we will have 
production availability for water and
 
other products, such as the Gatorade 
and that. And thirdly, we will benefit a huge deal from the distribution 
strength of Tingyi. So we really feel good about that alliance, and we're 
going to start bearing the fruit Q3 and going forward.

That's very helpful. Can I also just clarify? I think you said you did raise your 
efficiency target for the total company. Can you just remind u
s how much 
you've increased that now?
 
Hugh F. Johnston
 
This is Hugh. No 
--
 
I'm sorry, we didn't raise the efficiency target. So we 
said $1 billion 
--
 
$1 billion plus this year, $3 billion over 3 years. And that's 
exactly where we are. No change on that at 
all.

Your next question comes from the line of Bill Schmitz with Deutsche Bank.
 
William Schmitz

Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division
 
I have a long question. So I'm sort of confused on some of the numbers. So 
I think you said U.S. media spend was 
up 40%, and then you looked at sort 
of the year
-
over
-
year SG&A and that was down. And then I think you said 
100 basis points increase in that ad ratio on the back half of the year, which 
sort of implies that there was sort of flat advertising ratio on the 
front half. 
And then let's kind of take it a step forward. I was looking at the Pepsi 
Americas Beverages margins and given that shift away from the center store 
and towards the C
-
stores, you would have thought you would've seen a little 
bigger uptick in th
e margin structure. Can you sort of square this for me? I 
know it's a long question.
 
Hugh F. Johnston
 
Yes. Bill, why don't I take a shot at that, because that's a big causal chain 
you just laid out. The thing that 
--
 
first and foremost, the thing to keep i
n 
mind is, the way we talk about media is that's publicly reported media data. 
Okay? And that's based on the actual spending that's going into the 
marketplace. At the same time, when we talk about advertising and 
marketing expense, which is obviously insid
e of SG&A, that's curved over 
the volume curve during the course of the year. And you have to consider 
those numbers from 2 perspectives: number one, what's happening this year 
with the curve; and then number two, what's happened last year with the 
curve. 
And the way our spending 
--
 
or the way our curve worked last year 
was, you saw the A&M number fall off during the latter portion of the year. 
So we had, from an expense standpoint, more of the spending in the first 
half of the year, relatively speaking, co
mpared to the 2012 timing of the 
spend. So it's almost impossible to connect the media number to the A&M 
expense in the P&L. I wouldn't spend a whole lot of time doing that. And 
what I wanted to do when I gave you the A&M expense timing comments 
was not so
 
much to tie to the media spend, but rather to connect the fact 
that the year
-
over
-
year impact in H1 versus the year
-
over
-
year of impact in 
H2, it's much more substantial in H2. So hopefully, that kind of addresses 
your A&M question. Regarding the bottling
 
or the beverage 
--
 
PAB business 
and the impact on margins, there's 2 things to keep in mind there that are 
also important to balance out. On the one hand, the convenience store 
business performance was strong. On the other hand, the inflation that we 
have
 
inside of PepsiCo, particularly in beverages, is much more front loaded 
than it is back loaded. So those 2 are probably having something of an 
offsetting effect, and therefore, in the back half of the year, you should see 
the margin impacts start to impro
ve really in the PAB business in the back 
half of the year, due to the commodities overlap timing muting, while we 
certainly expect the C
-
store business to continue to perform well.

Great, thanks. And t
hen just to quickly follow up, did you see a benefit from 
the PET deflation? Because I think that's one of the few commodities you 
can't hedge out 9 months, and I think a lot of your competitors have talked 
about some relief there.
 
Hugh F. Johnston
 
Yes. Bi
ll, we actually can hedge out PET pretty well because of the nature of 
the relationships that our global procurement team has created. You're right 
in saying there's no market to do that. But through suppliers, we've been 
pretty successful in moving our PE
T buy further and further out over the last 
couple of years. So in terms of your question on any benefit, the answer is 
basically no. From our perspective, the commodities for this year have been 
largely hedged out for a couple of months now. So not a whol
e lot of change 
is going be coming in the balance of the year on that.

Your final question comes from the line of Ali Dibadj with Sanford Bernstein.

Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division
 
I want to follow up on a couple o
f things and ask a slightly different 
question. Just to follow up on Frito
-
Lay North America. In February, and I 
think since then, we've also heard you guys still expect flat volumes, flat 
margins. Now that's a little bit better than what we've seen in the
 
first half 
of the year. It sounds like you're expecting an inflection as you go into the 
back half of the year for Frito to maintain that flat margin
-
flat volume 
expectation for the year. Is that the right way to interpret your comments 
today?
 
Indra K. No
oyi
 
Brian?
 
Brian C. Cornell
 
Ali, it would be. I think we expect to see improved performance in the third 
and fourth quarter. The benefits of our investments in brand, the continued 
focus on innovation and productivity should show improvements in our 
third 
and fourth quarter results.
 
Indra K. Nooyi
 
And, Ali, we started the year across all of PepsiCo saying, ""Don't chase 
volume for the sake of volume, chase share in a very responsible way."" So 
we've tried to balance volume, pricing, revenue and profit i
n a very, very 
balanced way through the first half of the year.
 
Ali Dibadj 
-
 
Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division
 
Okay. So still sticking to flat margins, flat volume for the year for Frito?
 
Indra K. Nooyi
 
Yes.
 
Ali Dibadj

Sanford C. Bernst
ein & Co., LLC., Research Division
 
Okay. And then on PAB, the volumes, whether it be negative 1% or negative 
1.4%, were I guess a little bit lower than I'm hearing some folks expected. 
Can you help us disaggregate that? I know you're going to do it in your
 
Q, 
but disaggregate that between North America and the rest of PAB, Latin 
America. And then also between CSDs and fill, just to give us a sense of 
where the volumes were looking for each of those segments.
 
Hugh F. Johnston
 
Yes. Ali, this is Hugh. From the
 
standpoint of CSDs, again, we 
--
 
our focus 
was, first and foremost, on let's make sure that we get the right place 
--
 
pricing into the marketplace and let's make sure we maintain the consistent 
funding behind the brands and behind the innovation that we'v
e launched 
this year. So as you know, because you've been around the consumer space 
for a while, when you're doing brand building and innovation types of build, 
it takes a bit longer for those things to get traction. But when they get 
traction, they are mo
re advantaged than simply dropping price, and that's 
the strategy that we've chosen to follow. And frankly, the expectations that 
we had for the volumes in the business are basically right on where we 
would have expected them to come out, both from a volum
e perspective and 
from a market share perspective, in terms of the reported market share 
numbers that are out there. Regarding the other piece, the non
-
carbs in the 
overall volumes, I think the other factor that you have to consider is around 
this whole ar
ea of water and, in particular, case
-
packed water. We're in the 
business. We promoted sufficiently to stay in the business, but we're not 
interested in chasing case
-
packed water pricing down. We just don't think 
that's the right strategy for us. We do thin
k it's an important part of the 
overall Aquafina business, but we do 
--
 
we promote it just enough to really 
maintain our relevance. On the other hand, the single
-
serve side of water is 
--
 
obviously, it's a great business. It's a profitable business. We lik
e that 
business quite a bit, but we're not interested in chasing volume just by 
promoting case
-
packed water at the end of the quarter.
 
Indra K. Nooyi
 
Ali, the other thing, too, is we don't have as much of a tailwind on the 
distribution of energy drinks as 
anybody else might have. And second, our 
foodservice business is substantially different. As you know, our footprint is 
very different, and therefore, our foodservice volume uplift is overall lower 
than it might be for other people. So if you take into acc
ount these 
fundamental structural differences in our respective businesses, between us 
and competition, you'd see that we held value share, which is what we are 
focused on, in the measured channel business, and on foodservice, we 
gained share but from a ve
ry, very small base. And the energy drink is the 
big wildcard and something we distribute but we not 
--
 
we don't get as much 
tailwind as the market does.
 
Ali Dibadj

Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division
 
Okay. So that makes sense from the sp
irit of the answer. But would you care 
to offer numbers on North America CSD volume growth, Latin America fill, 
especially. So if you broke that down, would you care to offer those? I think 
a lot of that will be in your Q, but I was trying to get a head st
art on that.
 
Hugh F. Johnston
 
Yes. So basically, the way the numbers came in, North America volumes 
were down 2; North America volumes on CSDs were down 4; and non
-
carbs 
were up 1.
 
Ali Dibadj 
-
 
Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division
 
Okay, cool
. And then just the last thing, if you would indulge me. So I guess 
we do appreciate 
--
 
you've heard this from others as well. But we appreciate 
the change to how you're disclosing things like organic growth. And that 
--
 
for us, at least, that's been very 
helpful in understanding how you actually 
are operating. If we could push for another potential change or, at least, 
some clarity is 
--
 
within SG&A. So I think it might help answer some part of 
Bill's question a little while ago as well. So in your SG&A, o
bviously, you put 
your JVs. So there's a bunch of income with no revenue attached to it, 
whether it'd be Lipton or 
--
 
Tea, in your Starbucks or Muller or Almarai, I'm 
probably missing a few. So it's difficult for us, at least for me and maybe I'm 
just miss
ing something, to figure out what your real SG&A productivity is or 
what your real level of improvement is at the overall company level, but also 
at the 
--
 
perhaps even more importantly, the operating segment level. So is 
there consideration to split that 
out as you go forward, given it's become a 
big chunk, number one? And number two is to the question part. Can you 
help us understand what were the actual operating leverage on SG&A if you 
excluded those JV incomes that you report through that line item?
 
Hu
gh F. Johnston
 
Yes. Ali, this is Hugh. I hear your feedback on that one. And one of the 
things that we do every year is we both look at the disclosure to ensure that 
we're maintaining the right level of transparency without, obviously, giving 
away anything
 
that would be competitively sensitive. Now SG&A would be 
less concerning in that regard, although I'm not crazy about the idea of 
breaking out JV profitability. I hear your feedback on that. We, at the same 
time, also look at other big multinationals, and
 
we're trying to position 
ourselves where we're certainly at or better than most in terms of 
disclosure. But at a certain point, it also makes sense to limit the amount of 
disclosure based on, frankly, not giving away competitive information. So I 
apprecia
te the perspective. We're going to take a look at it again during the 
course of the fall as we think about 2013, and perhaps we can talk off
-
line a 
little bit more about some of the detailed thoughts that you have on that. 
It'd be helpful to get your point
 
of view.
 
Indra K. Nooyi
 
But, Ali, I'll tell you one thing. When we look at productivity, we look at 
every item of the cost structure, including G&A: what's the corporate 
unallocated, what's the infrastructure running to the sectors and are we 
actually mak
ing that bucket more and more efficient over time? And so, 
from an internal management of the cost structure, believe me, we are 
maniacally focused on any sort of overhead structure to run this company. 
And based on all of our benchmarks, our core G&As aro
und the company is 
among the lowest of any multinational company. So we feel good about the 
way we're managing G&A.
 
So let me just close by saying Q2 marked good progress against a clear, 
focused game plan that's allowing us to compete effectively today wh
ile 
positioning us for sustainable, long
-
term growth and shareholder value 
creation. And you have my and our entire leadership team's commitment 
that we'll continue to act with great urgency to deliver against our 2012 
targets and our strategic objectives.
 
So let me close by thanking you all for joining us and for the confidence you 
place in us with your investment. Have a great day.

were all in line with our assumptions.
 
Our focus this quarter was, first and foremost, to make sure we got our 
pricing into the market, and we are pleased with the level of pricing we 
achie
ved across each of our businesses. In addition, it was important to gain 
traction on the brand building, innovation, execution and productivity 
initiatives we communicated to you at our Investor Meeting on February 9, 
and we made good progress on each of t
hese, with momentum building as 
we enter the second quarter.
 
Before I discuss our progress on these initiatives though, let me quickly 
review the financial highlights for Q1. Our financial results were right in line 
with our expectations. Core EPS was $0.6
9. Net revenue grew 4% and was 
up 5% on a constant
-
currency basis and reflected strong price/mix across all 
of our businesses. Globally, price/mix was up 5.5%, and this pricing helped 
to offset the impact of about $300 million in commodity cost inflation.
 
We had revenue gains across each of our 4 business units on an organic 
basis. Global snacks revenue grew. Global beverage revenue grew. And in 
our nutrition portfolio, which is a subset of global snacks and global 
beverages, we saw a 10% revenue growth.
 
Em
erging markets revenue growth was particularly strong, up 13% on a 
constant
-
currency basis, led by strong double
-
digit organic revenue growth 
of 21% in India, 13% in Brazil, 33% in Saudi Arabia and 26% in Egypt, just 
to name a few. And division operating p
rofit declined 2%, again, in line with 
our expectations and a solid result, given the magnitude of the commodity 
cost inflation we absorbed in this quarter.
 
Hugh will take you through the financials and outlook in a few minutes. But 
overall, our Q1 results
 
are encouraging and indicated we're off to a good 
start and on track to deliver our full year financial targets.
 
So let me now turn to the progress we're making on our key initiatives for 
the year. We're focused on 5 big areas: brand building, innovation,
 
execution, productivity and driving cash returns. So let me walk you through 
each.
 
On brand building, when we met with you on February 9, we said we would 
do 3 things. First, increase our investment in advertising and marketing from 
5.2% to 5.7% of revenu
e this year, shift more of our spending from 
nonworking to working dollars and focus our A&M investments against our 
12 global mega brands to drive greater scale and impact with our spending.
 
And I'm pleased to report that we made good progress on all of t
hese 
initiatives. We significantly stepped up our media in key markets in Q1. For 
example, in the U.S. alone, our media spending was up 25%, and for the full 
year, we expect to achieve our targeted level of incremental investment. 
We're also being much mor
e productive with our so
-
called nonworking 
dollars, which is an incremental source of funding for stepped
-
up media 
investment.
 
One of the major drivers of this productivity is the rationalization of our 
agency partner relationships. In North American bever
ages, for example, 
we've reduced the number of partners from roughly 150 in 2011 to about 50 
today. And this rationalization is also driving better alignment in our brand 
messaging and marketing execution.
 
As we execute our brand
-
building initiatives, our 
expectation is to see our 
brand equity scores strengthen over the course of the year, building off of a 
solid base. And this should begin to translate to incremental top line benefits 
later this year and into 2013. We'll share with you our brand equity 
sco
recard results during the second quarter earnings call this year.
 
Our second focus area is innovation, where our goal is to double the 
contribution of our new products to our total net revenue, and our Q1 result 
in this regard are encouraging. Our innovati
on is targeted on a specific 
channel, cohort and occasion opportunities with a particular focus on 
emphasizing our mega brands.
 
For example, Pepsi NEXT, which offers a great cola taste with 60% less 
sugar, is off to a good start, and initial feedback is th
at the brand is sourcing 
volume from other categories, consistent with our objective of bringing back 
lapsed cola users. And while it's very early, the results are ahead of our 
launch expectations, and we've already achieved nearly one value share 
point.
 
P
ackaging innovation plays an important role in our innovation plans as well, 
and we've made good progress in this area. We're encouraged about the 
national launch of our differentiated 24
-
ounce can for regular and diet Dew, 
and this is showing positive cus
tomer and consumer responses in tests. We 
believe this product plays well to young males who are loyal Dew 
consumers.
 
Building off the success of the Brisk 1
-
liter package, we launched the Brisk 
iced tea gallon jug in 4 flavors in Q1 and the launch is off 
to a good start. In 
the first 12 weeks, Brisk jug achieved almost 2.5 points of volume share of 
ready
-
to
-
drink tea in grocery and drove total Brisk brand volume growth of 
14% across all channels in the United States.
 
We're also accelerating our premium inn
ovation to drive higher net price 
realization, and we're increasing focus on opportunities at the value end of 
the spectrum to capture incremental sales and keep value
-
oriented 
consumers engaged in our categories. For example, on the premium end, 
Quaker Me
dleys, offered in a convenient single
-
serve bowl, allows 
consumers to have a premium breakfast anywhere there's hot water or a 
microwave. It's made from a premium blend of hearty rolled oats and whole 
grains with tasty chunks of real fruits and nuts. Medle
ys targets busy adults 
who are seeking healthy choices that will set them up for a successful day.
 
The other example is Stacy's gingerbread and Stacy's cocoa, which deliver a 
differentiated snacking experience by providing seasonally relevant flavors to 
co
nsumers. And Stacy's pita crisps will attract new consumers to the Stacy's 
franchise.
 
In the more value
-
oriented offerings, Lay's Stax delivers a great tasting 
stacked potato chip at value price points. Stax grew net revenue 13% in the 
quarter and gained 2
 
points of value share in the stacked potato chips 
category, and we expect to see continued momentum as we launch new 
Hispanic
-
inspired flavors in Q3. And we're launching Taqueros in the U.S., 
which is a value
-
oriented indulgent, thick and hearty potato ch
ip that 
addresses the Hispanic meal occasions.
 
We're also accelerating our ability to lift and shift platforms and products 
around the globe. For example, we continue to leverage the success of our 
Do Us A Flavor campaign that originated in our Walkers bus
iness in the U.K. 
The program promotes consumer engagement by having consumers propose 
new flavors that are then voted online, with the winners being launched as 
new products. We've successfully expanded this concept to markets as 
varied as Holland, Saudi 
Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.
 
And we continue to expand our Quaker business globally. For example, in 
Australia, we launched a range of new products including Hot Oats and 
healthy bars and cookies under the Quaker trademark. And in Russia, we're 
usi
ng our extensive oats expertise to provide healthier offerings by launching 
oats
-
based products under the locally relevant Wimm
-
Bill
-
Dann's Chudo 
trademark. Our Quaker efforts are delivering solid results overall with 
double
-
digit revenue growth in markets
 
like the U.K. and China.
 
And finally, we're leveraging our big brands into new product platforms, 
giving us access to incremental cohort and channel opportunities. For 
instance, with Doritos, we've launched Doritos JACKED, the ultimate extreme 
snack that 
recently debuted at the South by Southwest Festival. JACKED is 
everything consumers love about Doritos, only jacked up for a bigger 
experience. It's 40% larger in size and thickness and offered in Enchilada 
Supreme and Smoky Chipotle Barbecue flavors, and 
it's supported by 
absolutely great advertising.
 
Doritos Dinamitas offers consumers everything they love about Doritos rolled 
in a taquito
-
like shape with explosive flavor. And we built upon our beverage 
relationship with Taco Bell to jointly launch 
Doritos Locos Tacos. Doritos 
Locos Tacos was introduced nationally on March 8 with approximately $60 
million in media support from Taco Bell. Over 60 million units have been sold 
to date, which is over 1.5 million tacos per day. Already, new line extension
s 
are underway to build on the success of this partnership.
 
So on innovation, we had a good level of new product innovation that began 
to launch in Q1, and you should expect to see the pace of innovation 
accelerate as we move through the year with great ne
w products across the 
full spectrum of our portfolio in both snacks and beverages globally.
 
Now let me turn to execution. We're measuring and driving execution across 
every element of the value chain to increase efficiency, quality and service 
to best
-
in
-
c
lass levels, and we're seeing good results across our functions 
and businesses. For example, our sales organization just gained Family 
Dollar as a new partner for our beverage business, opening up more than 
7,000 new points of distribution for our products
 
in North America. And the 
Papa John's conversion was one of our fastest ever with 3,000 outlets 
converted to PepsiCo products in 3 weeks. Overall, our sales organizations 
drove 6% growth in food service with gains of 4,500 new local food service 
accounts 
in Q1.
 
We're seeing strong execution in our DSD systems. For example, in our 
launch of Pepsi NEXT in the United States, we achieved over 90% ACV 
distribution in GDMx in 3 weeks, which is truly great execution. And our DSD 
system is driving terrific results
 
in the C
-
store channel in North America. Our 
net revenue across snacks and beverages was up 8% in the Convenience 
channel in Q1, and we were the #1 contributor to the C
-
store channel's 
entire growth in the United States.
 
And the final example I'll point t
o on execution is on our integration of 
Wimm
-
Bill
-
Dann. We've achieved higher
-
than
-
planned synergies ahead of 
schedule, and virtually all Wimm
-
Bill
-
Dann functions have been fully 
integrated with our One Russia operating model within the first year of the 
a
cquisition. So that's on execution.
 
Let me turn to productivity. As we shared with you in early February, we're 
targeting more than $1 billion in productivity this year and $3 billion in total 
over the next 3 years, which includes the restructuring program
 
we 
announced early this year and other productivity initiatives. Our productivity 
programs of 2012 are locked in, and we are very confident in delivering the 
targeted savings. We've made substantial progress against our productivity 
plans in the first qua
rter. Because most of the restructuring actions began in 
mid
-
Q1, the financial benefits of the restructuring will accelerate in Q2 and 
as we move through the year.
 
In addition to the restructuring program, we've also accelerated other 
productivity initiati
ves. We're driving hard against reducing the capital 
intensity of our business, and we are already seeing results in reduced 
capital spending. We're implementing programs like GES in Frito
-
Lay to 
improve the efficiency of our product distribution, and we'r
e increasing 
automation in our plants to drive higher labor productivity.
 
Finally, we're doing a better job leveraging global capability and know
-
how. 
By sharing best practices and implementing best
-
in
-
class processes, we're 
improving the operating perform
ance of each of our businesses. So we're 
encouraged by the pace and progress of our productivity plans.
 
Then we're taking steps to drive higher returns on our invested capital and 
cash returns to shareholders. We reduced our net capital spending in Q1 by 
$
122 million and reduced our net CapEx as a percentage of sales over the 
last 4 quarters by 80 basis points. We're achieving this both by driving 
higher utilization of our assets and by reducing the cost of replacement in 
growth capacity through value engin
eering and through enhanced global 
procurement management.
 
And we remain committed to returning cash to our shareholders. In the first 
quarter, we returned almost $1 billion in cash to our shareholders through 
dividends and share repurchases, and we expect
 
to return more than $6 
billion for the full year, an increase of approximately 12%. Our dividend will 
increase again this year with the June payment, making this our 40th 
consecutive year of dividend per share increases.
 
To recap, we're focused on brand b
uilding, innovation, execution, 
productivity and cash returns. We've made good progress in Q1. We expect 
momentum to build as the year progresses, and we are confident in 
achieving our 2012 goals in these areas.
 
Finally, let me comment on the alliance with
 
Tingyi that we announced on 
March 31 after the end of our Q1. The PepsiCo
-
Tingyi beverage system will 
provide Chinese consumers with some of the country's most popular 
beverage products, including Pepsi, China's top
-
selling cola; Mirinda, China's 
top
-
sell
ing flavored carbonated soft drink; Gatorade, one of China's top
-
selling sports drinks; China's top
-
selling tea and water brands sold under the 
Tingyi's Master Kong brand; and China's second
-
largest juice portfolio. 
Overall, this combination has created th
e #1 LRB manufacturing network in 
China by a wide margin and relative market volume share of 1.6x the next 
largest competitor's position.
 
In addition to creating this terrific combined brand portfolio, we also expect 
that this alliance will allow us to do 
the following: bring innovative new 
products to market faster; improve operating efficiency and reduce costs by 
combining local and global expertise in manufacturing and distribution; 
provide better service to PepsiCo's retail and food service customers in
 
China 
through Tingyi's superior distribution expertise and network; support new 
opportunities to develop local economies in interior and western China; and 
significantly accelerate the national distribution of PepsiCo's brands in a 
capital
-
efficient way, 
using Tingyi's extensive manufacturing and distribution 
network.
 
We are absolutely delighted to have established this partnership with Tingyi. 
Both Tingyi and PepsiCo have a long history of successful partnerships with 
other companies, and we believe this 
alliance will significantly enhance our 
beverage business in China in the near term while maximizing our future 
potential in the second largest and one of the fastest
-
growing beverage 
markets in the world.
 
And our Q2 will be the transition quarter for our 
China beverage business, 
and we expect to see the benefits of this alliance accelerate in the second 
half. The integration is well underway and progressing very nicely, and we 
look forward to updating you in our progress with the China beverage 
business.
 
S
o with that, let me turn the call over to Hugh Johnston. Hugh?
 
Hugh F. Johnston
 
Great. Thanks, Indra, and good morning, everyone. As Indra mentioned, the 
quarter came in, in line with what we expected. Reported net revenue was 
up 4%. Constant currency net 
revenue increased 5%. Net revenue included 
a 1 point FX drag and less than a point of M&A benefit, with the net revenue 
contribution from Wimm
-
Bill
-
Dann largely offset by the refranchising in 
Mexico where we no longer consolidate bottling revenue.
 
We reali
zed 5.5 percentage points of effective net pricing with increases 
across each of our divisions. Core gross margins were down 218 basis 
points, driven by higher commodity costs in the quarter, and core division 
operating margins were down by 91 basis points
, with productivity and 
SG&A helping to offset a substantial portion of the commodity inflation. All
-
in, this resulted in a 2% decline in core division operating profit and a 1% 
decline, excluding a 1
-
point drag from currency, in line with our 
expectations
.
 
Core corporate unallocated expenses increased in the quarter. There is also 
a $12 million change in corporate unallocated expenses related to our mark
-
to
-
market of deferred compensation balances but this is offset by a credit of 
roughly the same amount i
n net interest expense related to our hedges on 
the deferred compensation balances.
 
Net interest expense was $175 million in the quarter, an increase of $12 
million over Q1 of 2011, which is a function of both higher average debt net 
--
 
net debt balances a
nd slightly higher rates on our borrowings, offset 
somewhat by the deferred comp credit that I mentioned earlier. And our 
core tax rate for the quarter was 26.7%, which is 70 basis points higher 
than the rate of Q1 2011, driven by country mix and the favor
able resolution 
of some tax items in Q1 of last year. So in total, below
-
the
-
line items, 
mainly corporate expenses, interest and tax rate, drove 5 points of 
deleverage from our core constant
-
currency division operating profit decline 
of 1% to our core cons
tant
-
currency EPS decline of 6%.
 
Turning to our outlook. Consistent with the outlook we shared on February 
9, we expect our core constant
-
currency EPS to decline roughly 5% for the 
year. We anticipate continued strong effective net pricing, which will 
cont
ribute to net revenue growth but will likely negatively impact volumes.
 
We expect continued commodity cost pressures. Our estimate of 
approximately $1.5 billion of commodity inflation for the full year which is 
about a 7% increase year
-
on
-
year. We expect t
hat the rate of inflation in Q1 
will be the highest of the year, with the rate of inflation abating somewhat 
each quarter as we work our way through the year.
 
We anticipate productivity of more than $1 billion this year, which represents 
a substantial incr
ease versus our historical productivity target. The 
incremental productivity is largely driven by the restructuring program that 
we announced on February 9. The majority of the restructuring actions took 
place in the first quarter, and we expect the remain
der will take place over 
the course of this year, so the productivity benefits will accelerate as we 
move through the year.
 
We're investing more in A&M this year to support our brands, and we're 
making incremental marketplace investments in routes and rack
s. We expect 
A&M as a percent of sales to increase by approximately 50 basis points on a 
full year basis. We began to put more media in the market in quarter 1 but 
the impact of the A&M expense in the P&L will be more pronounced in the 
back half, based on 
how the accounting curve of the expense works.
 
Below the division operating profit line, we expect an increase in corporate 
unallocated expenses, reflecting higher pension costs related to the change 
in the discount rate and investments in productivity cap
ability. Net interest 
expense is expected to be higher, driven by higher net debt balances as 
--
 
and higher rates as we term out some of our debt. And we expect our core 
tax rate to be approximately 27% for the full year but with some variability 
each quar
ter. Based on current ForEx market consensus, currency 
translation would have approximately 2 points unfavorable impact on our full 
year core EPS.
 
As you model out the year, you should be mindful of 3 structural changes in 
particular. First, we refranchise
d our Mexican beverage business early in Q4 
of 2011. Second, we adjusted our ownership in our joint venture with 
Almarai, such that we are now in the minority. And third, we entered our 
alliance with Tingyi, which closed on March 31.
 
In each of these trans
actions, the accounting result is that we will no longer 
consolidate a substantial portion of the revenue. Including the impact of 
these transactions, we expect our core constant
-
currency net revenue 
growth to be in the low
-
single digits. Excluding the imp
act, we expect our 
core constant
-
currency net revenue growth to be mid
-
single digits, which is 
exactly what we communicated on February 9. As we report out the 
remaining quarters, we'll provide visibility into the impacts of these 
structural changes.
 
From a cash flow standpoint, reported cash used for operating activities was 
$690 million, which includes a $1 billion discretionary pension and retiree 
medical contribution. Net CapEx was down $122 million and down 80 basis 
points as a percentage of sales
 
on a rolling 4 quarters basis. Management 
operating cash flow, excluding certain items, was $79 million, which is a 
slight increase versus Q1 of 2011.
 
We returned about $1 billion to shareholders in Q1 through dividends of 
$816 million and share repurchas
es of $142 million. For the full year, we 
expect to generate more than $6 billion in management operating cash flow, 
excluding certain items, and return more than $6 billion in dividends and 
share repurchases, including our previously announced increase in
 
our 
quarterly dividend that will take effect with our June dividend payment.
 
Net
-
net, the quarter came in pretty well exactly as we expected. The pricing 
picture was positive, and our outlook for the year for earnings, cash flow and 
cash returns is comple
tely consistent with what we shared with you on 
February 9.
 
And now we'll open the line for your questions.
 
Indra K. Nooyi
 
Thanks, Hugh.
 
Jamie Caulfield
 
Jackie, we'll take the first question.
 
Question
-
and

Answer Session
 
Operator
 
[Operator Instructions] Our
 
first question is coming from Bill Pecoriello with 
Consumer Edge Research.
 
William Pecoriello

Consumer Edge Research, LLC
 
A question on Frito
-
Lay. One was the 
--
 
you talked a lot about the initiatives 
on the premium and value side. When do you expect to
 
see that begin to 
impact the share trends? What do you estimate the volume and value share 
did in Q1? And then on the profit performance in the quarter at Frito, was 
that 2% profit growth also impacted by that New Year shift that you 
quantified on the vol
umes there?
 
Indra K. Nooyi
 
So, Bill, P3, P4, we're already beginning to see share start to come back. In 
fact, if you look at the IRI data that's coming out today, you're already 
beginning to see Frito share improve steadily. I think the most important 
thi
ng, what we told all our businesses, focus on getting the pricing into the 
marketplace first, and then we can start slowly figuring out the revenue 
management to make sure there's a good balance. But we had to get the 
pricing in as early as possible, and F
rito did exactly what's needed to get 
done to cover commodity cost inflation. And in terms of the impact on 
profitability, for sure, the 53rd week had an impact on volume, revenue and 
profitability.
 
Hugh F. Johnston
 
Yes. Bill, I think what you can extrapol
ate from that is we said the volume 
impact was about 2 points. I think you would put the profit impact in a 
roughly similar place. So the 2 points they did would be closer to 4. And 
remember, this is the heaviest of the commodity impact for Frito
-
Lay in Q1
. 
So as we get through the year, the commodity impact on Frito
-
Lay will be 
less impactful. So that's kind of tying back to where you would expect Frito
-
Lay to be roughly normally.
 
William Pecoriello 
-
 
Consumer Edge Research, LLC
 
And then the improved share
 
performance that you're seeing now, is that 
coming from the initiatives on the premium and value side, or is it on all the 
core innovation in the mainstream segment?
 
Indra K. Nooyi
 
I think it's coming from all 3, Bill.
 
Hugh F. Johnston
 
Bill, you're going 
to 
--
 
as Indra said, you're going to steadily see those 
things impact positively during the course of the year, both core as well as 
the new products.

Your next question comes from the line of John Faucher with JPMorgan.
 
John A. Faucher

JP Morga
n Chase & Co, Research Division
 
In looking at your commentary on the North American beverage industry, 
you talked about sort of maintaining share in LRBs, which, at least from a 
reported results standpoint, we're not seeing. So a couple of questions on 
tha
t in terms of can you talk to us about what you're seeing that maybe not 
--
 
may not be showing up in the reported results? And then similar to what 
you talked about with the Frito piece, how should we judge your momentum 
in terms of market share as we go t
hrough the year?
 
Indra K. Nooyi
 
So, John, in Q1 x 53rd week, if you look at like
-
for
-
like Q1 in measured 
channels, GDMxC, which is really what we see from an IRI perspective, we 
gained 1/10 of value share. And we have to use measured data because 
that's an objective data set that we can 
measure ourselves by. Now when 
we talk about additional investment and changing the innovation model and 
really recommitting to this business in a different way, the results come 
steadily and over the year, as we talked to you early in February. What was 
v
ery encouraging was in the first quarter, we began to see positive results. 
And if you look at the P4 IRI data, one more time in GDMxC we gained value 
share. So on North American beverages, we look at those numbers and we 
say it's making great progress. I 
think the other aspect of the share 
numbers that made us very encouraged about the progress on the business 
was the co
-
channel value share. And we've made tremendous progress in 
that whole co
-
channel business, which is really the best part of the whole 
bev
erage business, and we feel good about the progress we've made there 
and the successes we've had in the co
-
channel business. And Frito
-
Lay, 
ditto. Period 1, period 2, we put the pricing into place. Started end of last 
year, we put it into place. And today'
s IRI data, period 4 IRI data is 
beginning to show the positive momentum from all of our initiatives. So as 
Hugh mentioned in his opening comments and I did in my opening 
comments, as the year progresses, quarter
-
by
-
quarter, you'll start seeing 
the busines
s strengthen. And we're really watching for the steady 
improvement in the business as the year goes on and make sure we do it 
the right way, not try to jerk the business around by pushing for volume in 
one quarter and trying to do something else in another
 
quarter, but steadily 
build the brands, steadily build the business and focus on value share in the 
measured channels in North America because that's the only objective 
measure that exists.

If I ca
n ask a follow
-
up on the cold drink stuff. So we've seen strength from 
other manufacturers in convenience and gas, and a lot of it's been pricing 
driven. I guess 
--
 
so 2 follow
-
ups here. The first would be, can you talk 
about units versus pricing in conven
ience and gas? And then secondly, can 
you sort of try and give us an idea how much weather has been a positive 
impact versus gas prices being a negative impact? If you have some 
thoughts on that.
 
Indra K. Nooyi
 
I think that weather versus gas prices have n
etted out, John. I mean, the 
convenience channel has been pretty strong in the first quarter, and we are, 

And in terms of units versus pricing, we don't have the numbers right now 
o
ff the top of our head. But Jamie or somebody will make sure that we get 
back to all of you on this question.
 
Hugh F. Johnston
 
Yes. John, the thing I would say is that we're seeing both price and feeling 
good about volume as well. Obviously, in a world whe
re everyone's trying to 
interpret what's going on with the economy generally, certainly, the 
convenience channel and the way it's held up well bodes well for both 
economic signals but also for our business. So we certainly feel good, both in 
terms of volum
e but we feel good competitively as well, as to what's going 
on in that channel.

I was hoping to get your perspecti
ve on the pricing environment in the U.S. 
CSD category and your confidence that price increases will hold here as we 
head into the summer.
 
Hugh F. Johnston
 
Yes. Dara, why don't I jump in on that one? What we've seen in the pricing 
environment is all of the
 
players in the industry being very steady about 
pricing. Haven't seen a whole lot of discounting. Occasionally though, a 
skirmish will pop up in the drug channel or something like that. But the 
broad indications are that the pricing that we saw in Q1 cont
inues to stick.

BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division
 
Just a question on the Europe segment. And I was surprised by how weak 
the margins were in the f
irst quarter and understand, I guess, there's some 
--
 
an accrual or a reversal on the trade receivables. But is there something 
else that's going 
--
 
that was specific to the first quarter that drove the 
profitability so low and the margins so low sequentia
lly? And if you can talk a 
little bit about maybe the outlook there just in terms of the profitability in 
Europe.
 
Hugh F. Johnston
 
Yes. So in terms of generally how Europe came in, Bryan, it was very much 
in line with our expectations and plans. There's a 
couple of factors to 
consider in that regard. Number one, the trade accrual fall out and fall in 
year
-
over
-
year. In the context of full year, it was relatively nominal. But in a 
2
-
month quarter and in a business where the profitability is obviously quite 
l
ow in the first quarter, I think it was $81 million in Europe for the quarter, 
it's 
--
 
it has market impacts relative to the impact on the year. Relative to 
margins, the other thing to consider is, in last year's numbers, we only had 
Wimm
-
Bill
-
Dann for 1 o
ut of the 2 months. And we only owned 77% of the 
business for that one month, and Wimm
-
Bill
-
Dann, obviously, is a lower
-
margin business. So that certainly presented something of a drag for the 
quarter. But we obviously don't give guidance on a sector
-
level
 
basis. But 
even in the environment that's as weak as it is in Europe, I think we've got 
to plan for it correctly, and it's certainly trending in line with our 
expectations.
 
Indra K. Nooyi
 
Bryan, the other thing I'd tell you is, even the team would tell yo
u, that first 
quarter is a small quarter, as Hugh said, only 2 periods. But as we go into 
P3, P4, the business is looking good, and very much in line with what we 
expected. And the Russia business, in particular, looking very, very good. I 
mean, we did gre
at on CSD share and the way we are re
-
architecting the 
juice business to be more disciplined about pricing, not chase volume at any 
cost and build the whole profitability of the business. The team is doing an 
absolutely superb job, and the Wimm
-
Bill
-
Dann d
airy business is doing 
exceedingly well. So we're looking at the overall Europe business and feeling 
good about how our team is managing through what I would characterize as 
a mixed economic environment.

Indra, if I could just follow up. One of the things that we've heard through 
this earnings season has been 
--
 
maybe I don't know if improvement but at 
least at Eastern Europe and Russia especially, the consumer may be 
stabilizing and, in some pockets
, maybe even a little bit better, just the 
macro environment not as depressed or at least not moving in the wrong 
direction. Can you comment on that at all? Is that 
--
 
have you seen any 
--
 
broadly any stabilization or any signs of improvement in that regio
n of the 
world?
 
Indra K. Nooyi
 
No, I'd say that region of the world is looking good. And as we looked at 
upping our investment in Russia a year ago, the fundamentals of that region 
of the world are good because you've got huge oil reserves in Russia. You'v
e 
got a well
-
managed economy on many economic fronts. And so we look at 
that part of the world and say the prospects for the whole Russia
-
CIS
-
East 
European cluster, if you want to think of that as one cluster, is very strong. 
And again, strong is a relativ
e term but it is good. And so in this world today 
where you've got GDPs ranging from negative to sort of high
-
single digits, 
this Russia
-
East Europe cluster is looking like a solid 2% to 4% GDP growth. 
That's very good today, and we're feeling good.
 
Hugh F
. Johnston
 
Bryan, one comment I'd add to Indra's comments as well. In Eastern Europe 
and Russia, we've probably got the broadest portfolio that we have 
anywhere in the company. And one of the benefits of that is when the 
economy is a little bit tougher, we
 
have products that sell well. When the 
economy is going well, we have premium products that tend to sell well. So 
we certainly feel good about the way that we've positioned ourselves 
strategically in that area.
 
Indra K. Nooyi
 
And the Power of One helps us enormously there because we can flex the 
distribution systems. We can load up the trucks with products that cube out, 
weight out. I think the Russia
-
East Europe
-
CIS cluster is probably our best 
example of Power of One, and tha
t's what's working so well right now.

Your next question comes from the line of Kaumil Gajrawala with UBS.
 
Kaumil S. Gajrawala 
-
 
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division
 
Can you speak a little more specifically on how Mountain Dew and Pepsi did 
in t
he quarter? And I believe the 24
-
ounce launch is in progress. If you could 
maybe just talk about how we should think about that.
 
Hugh F. Johnston
 
Yes. So Mountain Dew had a terrific quarter, I mean, feel great about where 
that brand is, and we obviously ha
ve 
--
 
had new products coming out 
against that. The 24
-
ounce can for regular and diet Dew is going along very, 
very well. It's 
--
 
it looks like a real premium innovation that's going to create 
incremental revenue and margin for us. The Pepsi business is go
ing to 
steadily improve over the course of the year. A couple of things to consider 
in that regard: number one, the Pepsi Max business continues to chug along 
very well; number two, Pepsi NEXT, as Indra mentioned, has really exceeded 
our expectations comin
g out of the gate; number three, the media that 
we've significantly increased in the first quarter. If you watch much TV, I'm 
sure you've seen lots of Pepsi ads out there; and then number four, we've 
got lots of new marketing coming against Pepsi that we'l
l talk about a little 
bit later this year. So I think what you're going to see with Pepsi is just a 
steady progression and a steady improvement in that business during the 
course of this year. And as we exit into 2013, we expect to feel pretty good 
about i
t.
 
Indra K. Nooyi
 
Kaumil, the other thing is this is a business over the years that has been 
characterized by price discounting, dealing sort of back
-
and
-
forth, trading 
share at the margin. With all the commodity cost increases, it was critically 
important
 
we put in place deliberate increases in pricing and manage this 
business very steadily and responsibly. And that's what we've been doing. 
So our goal is to look for steady share improvements through the year, so 
that we hold value share in LRB as the year
 
ends, and to make sure that we 
don't do anything silly just to go after any sort of a value gain. So value 
share is really our focus.
 
Kaumil S. Gajrawala 
-
 
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division
 
Got it. Maybe 
--
 
and thinking about NEXT, some innovations h
ave a halo 
effect on the core, others are cannibalistic. Where would NEXT fall?
 
Indra K. Nooyi
 
Interestingly, NEXT is sourcing from outside the cola category. In fact, it's 
even sourcing from outside the CSD category, which means that lapsed cola 
users are
 
coming back into the cola category. Now I want to make sure that 
you hear the appropriate caveat. It's too early to call this brand and say it's 
a gigantic success. But what's surprising to us is a few weeks after the 
launch, it's now almost one share poi
nt, which has not happened in a long 
time in any new product launch. So we are watching every metric very, very 
carefully. And every quarter, we'll update you on the progress of Pepsi 
NEXT. But it's really bringing back lapsed cola users, which is what's 
s
urprising.
 
Hugh F. Johnston
 
So not terribly cannibalistic.
 
Indra K. Nooyi
 
Yes.
 
Hugh F. Johnston
 
Not much at all.

Your next question comes from the line of Judy Hong with Goldman Sachs.
 
Judy E. Hong 
-
 
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division
 
Fir
st question is just in terms of bridging to the EBIT decline in the first 
quarter. I guess I'm just trying to better understand different components. 
You've got the commodity inflation. You've talked about the brand 
investment. But maybe if you can just gi
ve us a clarity on how much the 
brand investment step
-
up occurred in Q1, sort of the allocation by different 
segments as best as you can. And just give us clarity on sort of bridging to 
the EBIT decline and then how some of those components get phased out 
as 
we get into the back half of the year.
 
Hugh F. Johnston
 
Yes, Judy. Actually, if you go to what we shared with you on a full year 
basis, it was actually pretty consistent, with 2 exceptions. The curbing of the 
A&M has less impact in Q1, which is what we 
had shared earlier, and that's 

going to increase by 50 basis points on A&M during the course of the full 
year, but we curbed that with volume and then you're dealing with the curb 
of t
he prior year. So that had a little bit less of an impact in the quarter. And 
then offsetting that, as we shared with you at Feb. 9, the commodities had a 
bigger impact in the quarter relative to the impact of the full year. Other 
than that, everything els
e was pretty consistent with what we shared with 
you in the 
--
 
back at the Feb. 9 meeting.
 
Judy E. Hong 
-
 
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division
 
Okay. Hugh, the unallocated corporate expense though, just even including 
the pension step
-
up, just 
seems like you had a big step
-
up. So was there 
anything going on in that line item?
 
Hugh F. Johnston
 
No. I mean, nothing in particular. Corporate unallocated can be a little bit 
choppy, but there was nothing of note, and we indicated what we expect out 
of that for the year. So I wouldn't change how you're thinking about that for 
the year. There is no big news there.
 
Judy E. Hong 
-
 
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division
 
Okay. And then, Indra, just going back to Frito
-
Lay. And you talked about 
improvi
ng share performance in period 3, period 4, and you've talked about 
some innovation around the premium and the value segments. But maybe if 
you just sort of take a step back and look at Frito and maybe including 
Quaker sort of in the context of the broader
 
macro snacks, and you're seeing 
growth in some of the adjacent categories like snack bars maybe exceeding 
salty snacks, and how are you thinking about positioning Frito and Quaker 
kind of to really better address the faster
-
growth adjacent categories? And
 
are you thinking about perhaps focusing on stepping up innovation and 
spending around that arena?
 
Indra K. Nooyi
 
Judy, I mean, you captured in your recent note what we've been telling all of 
you for the last couple or 3 years, that the growth in all these
 
categories is 
coming from Fun
-
for
-
You, Better
-
for
-
You and Good
-
for
-
You, and it's critically 
important PepsiCo places its bets in all 3. And let me tell you what our 
strategy has been, and let me refer back to what trends you're seeing in the 
marketplace. 
In the Fun
-
for
-
You category, there's still growth, especially in 
salty snacks, value growth. And what we have to make sure is increase the 
permissibility of our Fun
-
for
-
You products by reducing the salt levels, going 
to heart
-
healthy oils. That is our ""hea
lth and wellness"" push in the Fun
-
for
-
You category, and we've been doing that over the last few years. The second 
leg of the strategy is dialing up our baked snacks, whether it's Baked! Lay's, 
whether it's Quaker Lite snacks, which is a baked snack, making
 
sure we dial 
that up. That's what we've been doing. And the third is really investing 
behind the Good
-
for
-
You snacks, because the growth rate of Good
-
for
-
You 
snacking and Good
-
for
-
You products across the world is about 2 or 3x that 
of Fun
-
for
-
You and Bett
er
-
for
-
You. And in fact, our nutrition business in Q1 
grew revenue 10%. So those categories are growing exceedingly rapidly. So 
what we're doing with Quaker 
--
 
I mean, as the quarter progressed, period 
3, period 4, the Quaker trends are looking positive. B
ut using the Quaker 
trademark, we're looking to launch more healthy snacks. But what we don't 
want to do is to launch much lower
-
margin commodity healthy snacks. We 
have to play in the value
-
added healthy snacking. And what we're looking 
for is new innovat
ion to play in the value
-
added healthy snacking, a new 
twist on bars, new ways to marry dips with chips so that the dips are very 
healthy and can provide a great source of a mini meal. So that's really what 
we're working on. For example, our Sabra hummus d
ips are just flying off 
the shelf. That's an example of a healthy accompaniment to any snack that 
you want. Our Stacy's business is doing very, very well. So I think the name 
of the game for Frito
-
Lay is slowly and deliberately building the business 
rather
 
than jerking the business around to gain short
-
term share. And I feel 
good. I mean, look at the IRI data for this period 4. You see very nice steady 
progress across the board.
 
Operator
 
Your next question comes from the line of Ali Dibadj with Bernstein.
 
A
li Dibadj 
-
 
Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division
 
So a few things. One is, we asked you this back on February 9 at the 
strategy reset and again at CAGNY about Frito
-
Lay North America and the 
growth in margins and the growth in top line. And I
 
just want to make sure 
we're 
--
 
you're still on the same page in terms of for this year 
--
 
despite 
what we've seen this quarter from margin and from a volume perspective, 
but for this year, you're going to be able to price away commodities. You're 
going t
o be able to hold or grow volumes and hold or grow margins. Is that 
still the expectation?
 
Hugh F. Johnston
 
Yes. I mean 
--
 
yes. So, Ali, what we're really focused on is ensuring that we 
are both getting the pricing through, and we will and certainly expect
 
to hold 
or grow margins. The volume, obviously, in Q1 was down 2, but we also said 
that we saw a negative 2 impact from the 53rd week. As the innovation gets 
out the door, we certainly expect to see all of the metrics from Q1 improve.
 
Indra K. Nooyi
 
And t
o focus on value share.
 
Hugh F. Johnston
 
Yes.
 
Ali Dibadj 
-
 
Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division
 
Okay, okay. So I think that's helpful because I think that's a yes. That's 
good that that's still consistent. Shifting gears a little bit, and th
is is more of 
a kind of philosophical question and maybe it's just me being confused 
again, but whenever we talk about shares on the beverage business, we're 
always refocused on LRBs versus just CSDs. You guys consistently talk about 
LRB shares. But doesn'
t that muddy the waters a little bit, and isn't that 
manifested in what we saw this quarter? I mean, you had pretty good non
-
carbs of plus 1, CSD is down 2, and in the end, you had a negative 1 in PAB. 
So how do you think about that balance internally? I k
now you're 
communicating it as an LRB and I understand why, but how do you think 
about that balance internally in funding the non
-
carbs piece versus the CSD 
piece? Because you have to be successful in CSDs, obviously.
 
Hugh F. Johnston
 
Yes. So Ali, I guess 
a couple of things. One, we think about the LRB category 
because we know consumer behavior at the end of the day is such that 
people cut across LRBs. It's a repertoire category, and it's certainly been 
that way for a while. The one thing that we point to a
s something of an 
exception in that regard is energy, because it's such a unique category from 
so many dimensions. In terms of how we manage, do we have expectations 
for CSDs, as well as for individual non
-
carbs and Gatorade and Tropicana 
and SoBe Life Wat
er and all those things? Yes, absolutely we do. Do we see 
ourselves in a position where we want to lose large amounts of value share 
in any of those categories? Certainly not. We would not want to see that. But 
we do have to also recognize and acknowledge 
the fact that it is a repertoire 
category. Certain of the subcategories have more tailwinds than others, and 
certain of them we have better brand positions, primarily in non
-
carbs. So 
we're going to look at our funding opportunities based on where we think
 
the 
best value creation comes from, and that value creation includes a 
recognition of we need to manage value share effectively. But LRB, we do 
think is the right way to think about it because of the repertoire nature of 
consumer behavior.
 
Indra K. Nooyi
 
And, Ali, if I look at overall North American beverage volume, if you look at 
about the 20 billion 8
-
ounce cases that are sold, I've been tracking this 
industry for a long time, it used to be sort of 60
-
40 carbs, non
-
carbs, shifted 
to 50
-
50. It's now shift
ing the other way. And so consumer behavior is 
shifting, that's one. And second, the way we look at this business, we look at 
profit per case across each of our categories, and we make sure the 
combination of businesses drives the best profit per case resu
lt for us. And 
that's what we do in each region of the country by brand, and we do that 
over the year.
 
Ali Dibadj 
-
 
Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division
 
That's helpful. But your portfolio is still very much skewed, certainly in North 
America
, to carbonated. So you have to win. You have to be successful in 
CSDs to win in LRBs. And it's tough for me, I guess, to differentiate those 2 
somewhat.
 
Hugh F. Johnston
 
Well, but I 
--
 
I think actually you just made your point and our point, which 
is, giv
en CSDs are such a substantial portion of our portfolio, we've set out 
as an objective hold or grow value share. And we can't allow CSDs to do 
poorly if we intend to do that. So I agree with your point. It's an and game, 
not an or game. We have to be able 
to do both.
 
Indra K. Nooyi
 
And, Ali, key thing is look at CSDs as a whole. I mean, look at LRBs as a 
whole, look at CSDs as a whole, because what happens is we start with LRB 
then we quickly come down to CSD. Then we quickly come down to colas, 
then we com
e down to regular colas, then we start defining the market too 
narrowly. So clearly, we look at overall LRB. And you're right. To gain 
--
 
I 
mean, to hold value share in overall LRB, you've got to do well in CSD, but 
CSDs as a whole. We've got Mountain Dew,
 
which is doing very, very well. 
Parts of the CSD portfolio doing well. The challenge is to play a deliberate 
profitable game in the whole CSD category, which is really what we're 
focused on.
 
Ali Dibadj 
-
 
Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division
 
Okay. That helps a lot. And just one last one, to shift gears. If you can 
remind us a little bit more about where the productivity is coming from 
specifically. So how much is in North America DSD? How much is just 
broadly GES or overhead? Just 

 
for you to
 
help us bucket that overall 
productivity, that'd be helpful.
 
Hugh F. Johnston
 
Yes. So in terms of 
--
 
we haven't really broken out the specifics of exactly 
where the $1 billion
-
plus money is going to come from. But certainly, you 
can expect more of it to c
ome from the North American businesses and both 
the Frito business and the 
--
 
or the PAF North American businesses, as well 
as the PAB business in North America. And then probably the next biggest 
area where you'll see it come from is Europe. AMEA will pro
bably be the 
smallest of the 4 for all of the reasons you might expect.
 
Indra K. Nooyi
 
Ali, you know what I feel good about? We've put in place a restructuring 
program. We put in place $1 billion productivity program. We announced it 
right after the Februa
ry 9 meeting. Our teams did a terrific job making sure 
they delivered on the restructuring program. And they did it flawlessly, and 
they did it with great sensitivity. So I'm actually feeling good about how well 
this was done without disrupting the busines
s.

For our final question comes from the line of Mark Swartzberg with Stifel, 
Nicolaus.
 
Mark Swartzberg 
-
 
Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division
 
I was hoping we could spend a minute or 2 
--
 
a few minutes here talking 
about AMEA a little b
it more. Because as you point out in the press release, 
and it's been evident for a while now, it's really been a standout region for 
you even in the more difficult recent years. Can you speak a little bit 
--
 
and 
markets are a factor here, right, just the 
dynamics there. But when you 
think about the strategy you've deployed in that market, can you speak a 
little bit to how relevant it is to your efforts to sharing best practices and 
other aspects of PepsiCo, and maybe use that as a platform for talking to 
t
his larger subject of learning from each other, so to speak, within the larger 
PepsiCo company?
 
Indra K. Nooyi
 
Yes, Mark, great question. AMEA clearly is riding the wave of GDP growth, all 
of these economies east of the Middle East. I think what we shouldn
't forget 
is our AMEA business has performed well in spite of all of the geopolitical 
issues they've had to handle, the natural disasters that happened in AMEA. 
So we have a resilient AMEA team and a good business in all of AMEA. So 
that's the good thing t
hat I'll tell you about AMEA. Now let me talk about the 
business model in AMEA. I think you've got a mix of developed, developing 
and emerging markets in AMEA. It's a unique region, besides the regional 
and cultural diversity. You can argue that Japan, Aus
tralia fall in the 
developed market, Korea, all of those countries. Then you've got parts of the 
Middle East that are more developing markets. Then you've got China and 
India, which fall more in the emerging markets category. So for each of 
these clusters,
 
what we have to do is sit down and think about what model 
can we take from the proven PepsiCo models adapted for the local countries, 
but then more importantly, how can we evolve local models, which play to 
the local cost structure, and then bring it back
 
to the developed market. I'll 
give you an example. We opened a value innovation center in India a year 
ago, and what we told them was rather than take our western equipment 
and our western approaches and cost reduce them, start clean sheet of 
paper in Ind
ia. Whether it's a cooler, a food service equipment, whatever it 
is, start clean sheet of paper and tailor that piece of equipment for the 
economics of the business in India, and then let's see how we can ruggedize 
it to bring it back to the west. It reduc
es the cost base significantly. The 
initial results from the value innovation center are very encouraging. And so 
I think piece by piece, we're looking at AMEA not just as a growth engine for 
the company for many years because the population of 
--
 
the perc
entage of 
young people in that part of the world is very, very high. So we have years 
of growth there. But we're now looking at it as an innovation source so that 
we can do reverse innovation, bring products and ideas from there at a very 
different set of 
economics back to the developed world for the value 
consumer or for whoever else. So it's a great learning lab and a growth 
source.
 
Mark Swartzberg

Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division
 
And that's helpful. And in terms of 
--
 
so there's an oppor
tunity there, and 
then of course, unlocking is another exercise. In terms of your ability to 
unlock that in whatever market might be appropriate or whatever sector 
might be appropriate, whether it's in North America beverage or Latin 
America snack, in term
s of unlocking, having that organizational capabilities, 
where are you, in your opinion, in that exercise?
 
Indra K. Nooyi
 
We're making progress. It's a big market. It's growing, changing. So the 
journey is never going to end there. I think the strength of 
PepsiCo is the 
Power of One. Because with snacks and beverages and the fact that we have 
a diversified portfolio, we're able to attract very good talent to our 
businesses in AMEA, and then we're able to give them extremely wide range 
of experiences, move t
hem from beverages to snacks and back and forth. 
And people love coming to work for PepsiCo. I'll be honest with you. Even 
people who get recruited out of PepsiCo, within 60 days or 6 months are 
always calling saying, ""Can I come back?"" That's the strength
 
of the 
company. So I think our teams there are all local, Mark. I'd say almost no 
expats. Everybody there is local. And so we have the benefit of local 
knowledge, and we have the benefit of getting those people to come to the 
developed market and transfer
 
some of the knowledge back to us. So I think 
AMEA is going to be a growth engine for many, many, many years. And our 
models are going to evolve. Our partnerships are going to evolve in AMEA. 
But we're going to have to play the game for each of those local
 
markets, 
not export our model there.

Great. And finally on 
--
 
that's helpful. And finally, on China. You just called 
out the 500 ml and also, of course, the Tingyi transaction closed, so 
--
 
or I 
guess at the 
--
 
shortly after the end of the quarter. But what 
--
 
to what 
extent was Tingyi a factor? And what did the 
--
 
what was the beverage 
performance there in the quarter, and what's going on in that market?
 
Indra K. Nooyi
 
The first quarter in 
AMEA, the China volume was impacted because of the 
600 ml to 500 ml trade down. So unit growth was robust, but volume growth 
was impacted. x China, volumes in AMEA grew spectacularly in double digit. 
So we had a very good quarter in AMEA. I think the real 
benefits of Tingyi 
you'll start seeing in Q3 because Q2's a transition year 
--
 
transition quarter, 
and we want to make sure the business transitions the right way. We build 
all the disciplines and really work with our partners in Tingyi to make sure 
this i
s a excellent transition to them. They're a great company incidentally. 
But starting Q3, I think you'll start seeing tremendous ramp
-
up in 
performance. So we look at the prospects of this business. We look at the 
relative market share that the system is go
ing to have in China, which is 
going to be the second
-
largest LRB market in the world, and we're feeling 
good at this point.
 
So in closing, Q1 marked good progress against a clear focused game plan 
that allowed us to compete effectively today, and it also 
positions well for 
sustainable long
-
term growth and value creation. You have my and our 
entire leadership's commitment that we'll continue to act with great urgency 
to deliver against our 2012 targets and our strategic objectives.
 
So let me close by saying
 
thank you to all for joining us and for the

Indra Nooyi
 
Thank you, Jamie, and good morning, everyone. We are very pleased with 
the results we reported earlier this morning for the fourth quarter and for 
the full year and with the substantial progress we'v
e made this year in 
further strengthening PepsiCo. We delivered great performance for the year 
by achieving core constant currency EPS growth of 12% and $6.9 billion in 
management operating cash flow, excluding certain items. Our financial 
performance is u
nderpinned by very strong performance across all our 
businesses, and I would like to recognize the superb performance of our 
many associates around the world.
 
Now details on our performance. We grew worldwide volumes in both snacks 
and beverages and the vo
lume gains were broad
-
based, a reflection of the 
attractiveness of the categories we compete in and of our strong competitive 
positions around the world. We maintained our clear global leadership in 
snacks, and in beverages we had very good global growth. 
We exited 2010 
with growth in the important North American beverage market. We 
maintained our leadership position in liquid refreshment beverages with 
volume and value share in measured channels. Outside North America, we 
had very strong volume growth in t
he key emerging markets of China, India, 
Russia and Turkey. We're heading into 2011 as an even better, more 
capable organization.
 
So let me point to four key examples. We've completed the acquisitions of 
and largely integrated our anchor bottlers. This has
 
made us more nimble, 
efficient and aligned across the enterprise in North America and in Europe. 
I'm pleased to report that almost one year into the integration, both the 
strategic and financial benefits we anticipated when we initiated the 
acquisitions a
re being realized. We exceeded our synergy target for 2010, 
and we have increased our estimate of the total synergies we expect to 
realize for 2012. The integration of the operations, which has been a major 
undertaking to be sure has gone smoothly, and we 
are meeting or exceeding 
virtually all of our key integration targets.
 
Second, we set up our investments in 2010 in two key areas, brand building 
and emerging markets infrastructure. We've increased our A&M behind key 
brands like Gatorade, Pepsi MAX and th
e incremental A&M budget is 
embedded in our financials going forward. And we also increased our 

more coolers in the market and adding route and distribution capacity ahead 
of the gro
wth.
 
Third, we just closed on the acquisition of Wimm
-
Bill
-
Dann, Russia's premier 
food and beverage company with leading dairy and juice brands. The 
acquisition strengthens our businesses in Russia and the broader Eastern 
Europe and CIS region where we alr
eady operate from a position of 
strength. Just as importantly, the addition of Wimm
-
Bill
-
Dann gives us a 
strong foothold in the attractive dairy category.
 
Fourth, we established our Global Nutrition Group to accelerate the growth 
of our functional and nutr
itious products portfolio. This effort will accelerate 
our innovation, research and development and strengthen our position in 
this attractive nutrition space. Our leadership team is now in place, and we'll 
continue to invest against this important initiat
ive. Let me be clear. This is 
not a new focus area for us. This is an area where we already have great 
global and local brand and a $13 billion base now, including Wimm
-
Bill
-
Dann. We have five nutrition brands which are over $500 million, including 
three t
hat are over $1 billion at retail. We're one of the top three global 
nutrition players today and we're building off of a great base and with a 
footprint and capability of a $60 billion enterprise which means we have real 
critical mass.
 
Next, in 2010, we pe
rformed very well and at the same time took advantage 
of our financial strength and flexibility to make important investments in the 
long
-
term health of the business. As we head into 2011, we are very mindful 
of the challenging competitive and economic lan
dscape. In developed 
markets where there are some signs of economic recovery in terms of GDP 
growth, the consumer outlook remains challenging. Unemployment is still 
high and consumer confidence measures are still not where they need to be. 
Those will likel
y continue to impact demand and the consumer will continue 
to be highly value conscious. On the other hand, we are fairly bullish on 
emerging markets, where our growth has been strong.
 
Commodity costs represents a major headwind for us in 2011. Like every 
other CPG [Consumer Packaged Goods] company, we expect to see very 
high levels of inflation in 2011. We're driving productivity to offset as much 

addressed the remainder of the inflation w
ith pricing. But the consumer 
landscape, particularly in developed markets, is shaky. And for that reason, 
we will be very judicious in our pricing actions because we don't want to 
shock the consumer with high levels of pricing and dampen demand for our 
pr
oducts and categories. And at the same time, we have to drive a 
reasonable level of profit growth. So our intention is to take a balanced 
approach to pricing given the circumstances.
 
But we're also prepared for what could be a highly competitive environmen
t. 
We've taken all these factors into account in providing our outlook for 2011. 
To the positive, we have good momentum as we enter 2011. Our portfolio of 
snacks, beverages and nutrition product works. We have the financial 
flexibility to absorb some of th
e inflationary pressures and to effectively deal 
with the potentially challenging competitive situation, while still delivering 
what we expect will be top
-
tier financial results given the current 
environment, so I'm feeling good about 2010, feeling good ab
out 2011.
 
And with that, let me turn it over to Hugh to go through the details and the 
operating results and our guidance.
 
Hugh Johnston
 
Okay. Great. Thanks, Indra. I'll start with a few comments on the macro 
environment, which I think will provide a helpf
ul context for the discussion of 
the operating results. Across the globe in 2010, we saw a mixed 
macroeconomic picture with little meaningful improvement from where we 
began the year. The expected economic and consumer
-
led recovery that had 
been predicted 
earlier in the year never really materialized in developed 
markets and due to a variety of factors, inflation has dramatically increased 
across both developed and emerging markets.
 
In the U.S., despite some glimmers of positive economic news, 
unemployment 
levels remain stubbornly high and GDP growth continues to 
be anemic. And in Latin America, while the macroeconomic picture in Mexico 
is moderately improving, it's still below pre
-
crisis levels and Venezuela 
continues to be an inflationary and macro
-
stabili
ty concern. In Europe, the 
macro environment across the sector remains largely unchanged with only 
modest GDP growth, high unemployment and the severe austerity measures 
impacting a number of markets, all of which continue to depress consumer 
confidence. O
n the other hand in most of the key markets in AMEA, the 
macros are promising as countries like China and India continue to witness 
robust 8% to 10% GDP growth, although inflation is a concern.
 
So with that, turning to our division performance. Let's start
 
with PAF, which 
is comprised of Frito
-
Lay North America, Quaker Foods North America and 
Latin America Foods. Frito
-
Lay demonstrated its ability to perform well in a 
challenging environment in 2010. For the full year, Frito
-
Lay generated 
positive unit grow
th, gained value share in salty snacks and measured 
channels, was one of the fastest growing CPG businesses at retail and 
adapted to evolving consumer needs through product innovation and finally, 
generated its strongest profit performance in a decade.
 
For
 
the full year, FLNA grew units in the low single digits. Volume declined 
by one point, reflecting the impact of overlapping last year's 20% More Free 
promotion, which was worth nearly two points of volume growth. For the full 
year, profit performance was 
very strong as a continued focus on 
productivity and favorable commodity cost resulted in FLNA generating 8% 
profit growth, the highest since 2000.
 
At the same time, we continue to evolve the product portfolio to adapt the 
changing consumer needs through t
he introduction of products like Tostitos 
Artisan Recipe and regional and ethnic
-
themed flavors across a variety of 
our brands. We're also reducing the sodium in a number of our key potato 
chip flavors by as much as 25%, and we began our initiative to make
 
a 
number of our products with all natural ingredients, no artificial flavors, no 
preservatives and no MSG to capitalize on one of the fastest
-
growing 
consumer trends.
 
In the quarter, FLNA had low single digit unit growth and volume was 
positive and as exp
ected. Volume was partially impacted by lapping the tail 
end of the 20% More Free promotion through the early part of the quarter. 
Profits grew 7% with continued tailwinds from commodity costs, as well as 
FLNA's ongoing productivity focus.
 
We continued our
 
solid performance in the FoodService Channel and we also 
saw solid growth in the C&G channel with the success of our urban strategy, 
which helped to drive a nearly one point gain in salty dollar share in that 
channel. Stacy's Pita Chips and Sabra dips als
o continue to deliver strong 
double
-
digit volume growth, reflecting our success in building a scale 
adjacency business behind these two great brands.
 
Performance at QFNA was quite frankly below our expectations as center of 
the store categories continue to
 
be challenged. We did, however, invest in 
our hot oatmeal business to improve our product quality, introduce new 
products and increase our A&M support to restage Quaker as the preeminent 
health and wellness brand. We also recently announced that Jose Loui
s 
Prado will be assuming leadership for the Quaker business. Jose Louis is a 
26
-
year PepsiCo veteran who knows how to grow businesses, he's 
passionate about the Quaker brand and we're confident he'll lead Quaker 
into its next growth chapter.
 
Our Latin Amer
ican Foods business had an outstanding year, with an 
acceleration of both top line and profits through the back half of the year. 
Full year volume increased 4%, reflecting solid growth in Mexico and 
throughout most of South America. Our profits in Latin Am
erica Foods grew 
11%, remarkable performance given the ongoing challenges of doing 
business in Venezuela. Both the top line and bottom line turned in double
-
digit growth in the back half of the year and importantly, Brazil performance 
accelerated in the se
cond half of the year with double
-
digit salty volume 
growth in the fourth quarter. In the quarter, our focus on value and 
investments in infrastructure and innovation drove strong performance in 
Latin America. Volume growth of 5% was broad
-
based, led by Me
xico, Brazil, 
Chile, Argentina and Colombia. Profit grew 28% primarily through volume 
gains, effective net price management and a focus on controlling operating 
costs.
 
Looking to 2011. We'll continue to drive growth on our core Snack business 
with all natural ingredients at FLNA, and our initiatives to reduce sodium and 
add more whole grains. Consumers have consistently told us they're looking 
for more snacks made with a
ll natural ingredients and this segment is 
growing almost 3x faster than total food and beverage category in the U.S. 
So this is an attractive opportunity for FLNA. Supporting our efforts, we're 
increasing our advertising investments in North American snac
ks and Quaker 
Foods and have plans in place to double our North American Power of One 
activities between snacks and beverages.
 
Moving on to PAB. We're pleased with the progress we've made in a highly 
competitive environment. We have largely completed the i
ntegration of our 
anchor bottlers and are delivering synergy targets above our initial 
estimates. We've widened our liquid refreshment beverage volume share 
advantage versus our primary competitor in measured channels during 
2010. We invested in key brand 
building and innovation initiatives and are 
still delivering positive results from those investments. Both our business 
and the category returned to positive volume growth in the back half of the 
year and in beverages as well, we're excited about the oppor
tunities to 
leverage Power of One to an even greater extent.
 
The category delivered about a point of volume growth for the full year. 
Against that backdrop, our North American Beverage business delivered 
positive organic volume growth in the fourth quarter
 
and for the second half 
of the year and had slightly better volume performance than our primary 
competitor in measured channels for the year and for the quarter, driven by 
our leadership in the faster
-
growing Non
-
Carbonated segment. Our focus 
continues to
 
be on investing for profitable growth.
 
In 2010, we had good success with innovation and naturally sweetened 
zero
-
calorie SoBe Life Water, the Gatorade G Series and our naturally 
sweetened reduced
-
calorie Trop50 fruit juice, as well as the expansion of our
 
super premium juice brand, Naked. At the same time, we targeted 
innovation on our CSD [carbonated soft drink] portfolio by relaunching zero
-
calorie Pepsi MAX and introducing the first mainstream all
-
natural CSD in 
Sierra Mist.
 
In Q4, we saw another sequen
tial improvement in our North American 
organic volumes with a 1% increase. Gatorade was a large part of the 
growth with volume up 8% in measured channels. We continue to be 
encouraged by the increased consumption trends and positive brand equity 
scores for
 
Gatorade as we strengthen the brand through advertising and 
innovation behind the G Series and the expansion of our retail footprint. 
We've been very happy with the results of our brand building behind our 
reduced
-
calorie and natural CSD offerings as well
. Pepsi MAX has doubled 
the rate of weekly sales volume since the date of the relaunch and has 
gained share, and Sierra Mist has seen a strong swing to positive volume 
growth since we launched Sierra Mist Natural.
 
In juices, we launched successful new pack
aging and flavors of Trop50 and 
drove a double
-
digit increase in sales of our Naked Juice brand through 
significant improvement in brand scores and expanded distribution, and 
Naked remains the share leader in the super premium juice category in 
measured ch
annels. And SoBe Life Water turned in another very strong year, 
building on our industry
-
leading innovation of natural zero
-
calorie SoBe Life 
Water Zero. For the year, we grew volume nearly 36% in measured 
channels, gained three points of volume share whil
e our closest competitor 
lost share and we strengthened brand equity.
 
In 2011, we continue to strengthen and reposition our beverage portfolio 
through innovations such as our planned launch of G Series Fit, the first line 
of products from Gatorade designed
 
specifically for the fitness athlete to 
provide fuel, fluid and nutrients before, during and after a workout. We will 
drive sustainable, balanced top line growth through superior execution, 
unlocking the growth potential of our local Foodservice business 
and 
judiciously balancing pricing needed to cover input cost inflation while 
providing value to our consumers. And we'll continue to transform our 
supply chain and drive additional productivity. The most important initiative 
in this area is the transition 
of small format Gatorade distribution to our 
direct store delivery system. We just executed the transition at the 
beginning of the year, and we're very, very encouraged by the early results.
 
Turning to Europe. The fourth quarter capped a strong year for th
e division. 
We successfully integrated the Bottling businesses, while at the same time 
delivering 5% organic beverage volume growth. We made great strides 
toward realizing the full potential of Power of One in many markets, and we 
acquired Wimm
-
Bill
-
Dann w
hich closed earlier this month. For the year, 
organic beverage volumes grew 5% and snacks grew 2%. The sector 
accelerated top line momentum in the second half of the year behind a focus 
on providing consumers differentiated value, increasing our marketplac
e 
competitiveness with investments in coolers and delivering locally relevant 
programs and promotions with our gains driven primarily in the key markets 
of Russia and Turkey.
 
In Q4, Europe delivered solid performance across both snacks and 
beverages. Snack
 
volume was up 3% and organic beverage volume grew 
5%, with particularly strong results in key emerging markets in Eastern 
Europe, including Turkey. Q4 profit performance was dampened by a 
reduced potato crop, resulting from the extremely hot weather in Ru
ssia this 
past summer. This resulted in a significant shortfall in our potato harvest, 
but we were able to mitigate much of the impact and still deliver solid profit 
gains.
 
Our Snack businesses continue to perform well in the fourth quarter in 
Eastern Euro
pe. In Russia, for example, we gained three value share points 
in an expanding category fueled by both innovation and gains in our core 
Lay's product lines. Throughout the region, we continue to offer consumers 
differentiated value underpinned by strong co
mmercial programs leveraging 
promotions, such as Walkers Rain promotion in the U.K. and the Free Money 
in the Bag promotion in Turkey, and we expanded our snacks product range 
through innovation of core and continue to expand into adjacent snack 
categories
 
like nuts and seeds.
 
Similar to snacks, beverage volume gains came primarily from Eastern 
Europe including Turkey and were driven by commercial programs, such as 
the travel promotion in Russia and the payoff from our investments in 
coolers in Russia and T
urkey. Wrapping up Europe, we closed on the Wimm
-
Bill
-
Dann acquisition earlier this month and our team has begun to execute 
the integration plan there. We're excited about the benefits Wimm
-
Bill
-
Dann 
brings to our Eastern European business in terms of scal
e, operating 
capability and the expansion of our product portfolio, and we're equally 
excited about establishing a meaningful foothold in the fast
-
growing value
-
added dairy category.
 
Asia, Middle East and Africa had an outstanding quarter to cap off an 
out
standing year. Volume gains in the quarter for the year were very strong 
in both snacks and beverages, and we strengthened our long
-
term 
competitiveness in key emerging markets through meaningful, sustainable 
marketplace investments. For the year, AMEA del
ivered snacks volume 
growth of 15%, beverage volume growth of 7% and net revenue gains of 
15%. Operating profit performance reflected higher sugar costs and a step 
up in our investment spending in China, as well as lapping the 2009 gain 
from our Calbee tra
nsaction.
 
In Q4, AMEA snacks volume was up 13%, beverage volume rose 8%, net 
revenue grew 16% and operating profit gained 23%. We delivered solid top 
line growth in both snacks and beverages across the region supported by a 
strong innovation agenda. And we
're seeing positive results from our recent 
marketplace investments with continued double
-
digit snack volume growth 
in key emerging markets, 9% beverage volume growth in China, far 
outpacing our primary international competitor and double
-
digit beverage 
gr
owth in India.
 
Snacks delivered the fifth consecutive quarter of double
-
digit volume 
growth, driven by strong gains across most emerging markets with growth 
in China, India and the Middle East leading the way. In China, volume 
growth of 28% was driven by c
ontinued strength in Lay's potato chips and 
nearly 50% growth in the Quaker portfolio. In India, volume grew 18%, also 
driven by potato chips and continued expansion of the Quaker business. 
Innovation including the launch of SunBites bread snacks which is 
delivering 
volumes significantly ahead of our expectations.
 
On the beverage side, we gained volume momentum from the prior quarter, 
driven by double
-
digit growth in India, continued high
-
single digit growth in 
China and an acceleration in growth in the bal
ance of the developing 
markets. In India, volume grew 11%, driven by strong double
-
digit growth 
in non
-
carbonated beverages. China continued its solid performance with 
growth driven by strong non
-
carb performance and high
-
single digit growth 
in CSDs. For 2
011, we expect AMEA will continue to grow volume above the 
PepsiCo portfolio average, and we'll continue to invest in building our supply 
chain and distribution infrastructure in key emerging markets.
 
Now turning to cash flow. We're extremely pleased with 
the strong cash flow 
performance for the year. Cash from operating activities and management 
operating cash flow, each came in better than the amounts we projected on 
the Q3 call, with particularly strong performance in working capital. You'll 
find the det
ails on these set out in the schedules in this morning's release. 
And I'm pleased to report that we returned $8 billion of cash to shareholders 
in 2010 through a combination of share repurchases and dividends.
 
Finally, I wanted to provide you with some add
itional details on our 2011 
guidance. For 2011, we anticipate core constant currency earnings per share 
to increase 7% to 8%. Based on current spot rates, we estimate foreign 
exchange translation would represent approximately one to two points of 
benefit t
o our 2011 full year core EPS growth. This guidance takes into 
account the following factors: to the positive, synergies from the bottling 
acquisitions. As we announced this morning, we've increased our estimate 
for total synergies through 2012 to more tha
n $550 million. We delivered 
more than $150 million in 2010 and the large majority of the remaining 
$400 million in synergies should be realized in 2011.
 
Second, the impact of the Wimm
-
Bill
-
Dann transaction. We anticipate 
Wimm
-
Bill
-
Dann will add approximat
ely $0.08 per share, which includes the 
transaction financing impact. Offsetting these benefits will be commodity 
cost headwinds. Our commodity cost inflation is expected to be in the range 
of $1.4 billion to $1.6 billion. We'll offset a portion of the inf
lation with 
pricing and productivity, but we don't expect to fully cover the inflation. 
We're also factoring in the need for some flexibility to react to competitive 
pressures, especially in beverages. We'll also make incremental discretionary 
investments 
in brand building and in emerging markets growth. More 
specifically, these will largely be stepped up A&M, particularly in beverages 
and in S&D as we add capacity for growth in emerging markets.
 
Below the operating line, we anticipate having negative lever
age in 2011, 
which is driven by several factors. First, we'll invest in our global nutrition 
initiative, which is being managed from the corporate center. Second, we'll 
have higher pension cost expense related to the amortization of past losses. 
Third, int
erest expense will increase faster than operating profit as a result 
of higher balances, most of which is related to the bottler and Wimm
-
Bill
-
Dann acquisitions and some impact from higher rates based on the forward 
curves. Fourth, we'll reflect a minority
 
interest expense at corporate related 
to the Wimm
-
Bill
-
Dann below the line, offsetting consolidation of Wimm
-
Bill
-
Dann's full operating result above the line. And fifth and finally, we do not 
expect a meaningful decrease in our effective tax rate for 2011
 
and estimate 
our full year core tax rate will be approximately 27% as it was in 2010.
 
Moving to cash flow. We estimate CapEx will be in the mid
-
$3.5 billion 
range, which includes capital spending associated with Wimm
-
Bill
-
Dann, and 
we anticipate share rep
urchases of approximately $2.5 billion. We'll have a 
53rd week in 2011 and we're treating the impact of the 53rd week as non
-
core, so it is not included in our core constant currency earnings growth rate 
guidance at all.
 
As you think about the phasing of 2
011, our first quarter core EPS growth 
will likely be negative and this is driven by several factors. We're lapping a 
very low core tax rate from Q1 2010 when the rate was below 23%. Also, in 
the first quarter, we'll have higher interest expense as we lap 
two months of 
2010 without debt associated with the bottler acquisitions and the related 
bottler profits for that period will not offset the higher interest because the 
first two months are seasonally very low from a profit performance 
perspective. In fact
, the European operations of the former PBG and PAS 
operate at a loss in the first two months. So we'll likely have a mid
-
single 
digit decline in core EPS in Q1, but that's been completely factored into our 
full year 7% to 8% EPS guidance.
 
Beyond 2011, we 
expect core constant currency EPS growth to be in the 
high single digits, taking into account our longer
-
term assessment of the 
competitive, economic and inflationary outlooks for the foreseeable future. 
Overall, our guidance reflects a balanced approach t
o managing our business 
to both deliver the short term and to build the long term.
 
Net, we feel great about our businesses. We operate in attractive growing 
categories where we have strong competitive positions globally, both in 
snacks and in beverages, an
d we have clear unmatched structural 
advantages with our extensive go
-
to
-
market systems, we have 
extraordinary operating capability, a broad geographic footprint and 
advantage brands.
 
We'll continue to leverage these advantages to drive what we believe wil
l be 
top
-
tier results in the CPG space, and at the same time, we're making 
important moves to strengthen and build our core snack and beverage 
franchises and our large attractive Nutrition business to enhance the 
durability of PepsiCo's growth going forwar
d.

I wanted to have some 
more details around the Frito

Lay North America 
situation with the volume and price mix flattish in the fourth quarter. Can 
you talk about what your outlook is for the top line for that division? In 
2011, do you plan to take more pricing? I guess later in 
the year some of 
the hedges roll off. And what do you think are the main drivers of the 
sluggish top line that we've been seeing recently?

quarter fro
m the second and third quarter where our volume had been down 
2% to 3%. As Hugh said, as we entered the fourth quarter we had four to 
five to six weeks of negative lapping still on the impact of the bonus bags. 
That finally got put behind us. We do, like e
very other CPG company, there 
was a channel where we had been impacted due to assortment, pricing and 
merchandising, and I'm pleased to say today that we have resolved that, 
and we're moving forward in a positive direction in that specific channel. We 
had 
an issue, as you know too, with SunChips. SunChips had been a fast
-
growing brand. We converted that business to the compostable package. 
That package had an issue in the marketplace in terms of the noise, and we 
have phased that package out, but we remain 
committed to having 
environmentally friendly package in the marketplace and we hope to in the 
back half of this year to do that. And third, we had some impact from ""value 
competitors"" who benefited from deflation and chose to take pricing down. 
We chose no
t to follow them down. They are now inflationary and they are 
starting to take prices back up. In the quarter, as Hugh said, we also 
invested behind this launch to get ready for the all natural conversion, and 
we spent behind that, and that is now rolling 
into the marketplace, where 
half of our portfolio now will be all natural, the largest gluten
-
free portfolio in 
North America, and we reduced sodium levels by 25% on some of our key 
products. Having said all that, to get to your question, our anticipation 
is 
that Frito
-
Lay can return back to sort of the low
-
single digit volume growth, 
and so far in the first part of this quarter we're pleased to start to see that.

On the tortilla chip category, do you see that the category i
tself is slowing 
down? Or is it about share losses to some of these other niche players?
 
John Compton
 
Bill, as you've seen in the IRI data, there are 
--
 
back to the value competitor 
message that I gave you, there are some very low
-
price value unflavored 
to
rtilla chip competitors out there. On the flavored tortilla chips side, 
Doritos, as you know is 95% share of the marketplace and continues to 
grow. So on tortillas, we're hopeful that this launch into all natural is a way 
to differentiate that brand even f
urther. We had a big launch behind the 
Fiesta Bowl to sort of kick that off, and so we're just now starting to activate 
the marketing from that. We also have a value brand, our own called 
Santitas, that we are judiciously using more aggressively, notably i
n the 
West Coast markets to compete against these low
-
priced competition.

Your next question comes from John Faucher of JPMorgan.
 
John Faucher

JP Morgan Chase & Co
 
Guys, I guess what I'm struggling to figure out here is a little bit of the tone.
 
So you guys have spent a lot of capital in terms of buying the bottlers, 
you've spent capital in terms of buying Wimm
-
Bill
-
Dann. We'll probably see 
greater nutrition M&A going forward. So you're investing this capital and yet 
the growth rates are coming d
own and yet you say you feel great about the 
business. So can you help me triangulate on that? And I understand it's a 
difficult operating environment, but walk me through why you're so positive 
when we continue to see numbers come down here. It just doesn
't kind of 
square up.
 
Hugh Johnston
 
I think you really have to kind of consider the big factor that's out there that 
we're working our way through, which is what I consider to be a very high 
rate of inflation. When you're talking about $1.4 billion to $1.6
 
billion of 
inflation, you're really in the 8% to 9½% growth of commodity costs. So 
obviously, in a business that has something of an exposure to agricultural, 
as well as energy, that type of inflation has a pretty profound impact, and 
we're obviously addr
essing that. Now are our brands strong enough that we 
could price to completely cover it? Sure. But we actually don't think that's 
wise for our categories, we don't think that's wise for customers and 
consumers and for the long term. So as we add up the en
tirety of the 
portfolio and we look at the benefits that you point out and we also look at 
the challenges that we see both in developed market economies, as well as 
the high rate of inflation, we look at it and say 7% to 8% profit growth in 
this environmen
t, we do expect it to be top tier. Have we invested capital in 
really getting into some new growth platforms? You bet. But at the same 
time, we're continuing to deliver strong cash flow return to shareholders. So 
as we really balance out our equation, ther
e are some tough macros we're 
facing, but the portfolio is continuing to perform and we're continuing to 
compete successfully and invest behind the right things to build the 
durability of PepsiCo. And I think that's why we feel good about where we 
are and 
why we feel the long term. We're a terrific investment relative to 
what else is out there.
 
Indra Nooyi
 
John, if I can just add to this. PepsiCo today with the Wimm
-
Bill
-
Dann 
acquisition becomes a $63 billion company. For a $63 billion company to 
continue t
o grow EPS 7% to 8% with huge commodity headwinds and a 

that is significantly higher than cost of capital, continue its march to 
geographically expand the portfolio and go in to th
e right categories where 
the consumers are going in the future, which is the nutrition category, I 
think is an absolutely terrific performance scorecard for our company. So we 
feel great about it. Had we not had the continued macroeconomic 
sluggishness and
 
this extraordinary commodity inflation, we are a solid 
double
-
digit player. So you've got to take all of this into consideration and 
understand where we're coming from, and on balance, we look at our 
company and say, boy, if you could find other companies
 
like ours, you 
should go ahead and invest in them.

Your next question comes from Ali Dibadj of AllianceBernstein.
 
Ali Dibadj

Bernstein Research
 
One about kind of your long
-
term guidance and one about price. In terms of 
long
-
term guidance, it's 
just odd to me that it took something like 29 
minutes until you mentioned lowering your long
-
term EPS growth guidance, 
although it seems that there might be something a little bit more important 
to that. And I wanted to give you 
--
 
can you talk a little bi
t more about it, 
and ideally, disaggregate it into its pieces. So if you think back to your 
Analyst Day and some of the slides that you put up there, it's not synergies 
it sounds like, it's not corporate, obviously in the LOBs. Can you talk about 
where you
're feeling the pressure, where you're estimating more pressure 
going forward, again, long term and quantify some of that for us, please?
 
Indra Nooyi
 
Ali, first thing. It's right up in the headlines of our earnings release, okay? 
So it took almost two seco
nds before you got to that in the earnings release. 
In the script, we have to tell the whole story because this is a Q4 call, if you 
recall, so we have to tell you what we did in Q4. We have to walk you 
through the businesses for a very, very large $60 bil
lion company until we 
get to what to expect in 2011 and 2012 because the long
-
term guidance is 
really about 2012. Let me be crystal clear on something, if you can tell me 
exactly where we're going on the global macroeconomics, especially in the 
developed m
arkets, if you can tell me exactly where we're going on 
commodity inflation, we can tell you exactly what the performance is going 
to be. At this point, there's considerable uncertainty, we have no idea what 
the commodity markets are going to look like in 
2012 and beyond. We have 
no idea what the developed market economic situation is going to be, 
whether it's going to improve robustly or whether the sluggishness is going 
to continue. On balance, considering all these factors, we believe it's prudent 
to gui
de to a high
-
single digit growth. Let me be crystal clear. For a $63 
billion company, which is growing top line 5%, 6%, 7% to generate high
-
single digit EPS growth is simply fantastic. In the CPG space, it is top
-
tier 
growth. So we have to make sure we tak
e into account all of these factors 
when we give you guidance.
 
Ali Dibadj 
-
 
Bernstein Research
 
So what macroeconomic situation are you modeling going forward? Are you 
modeling current, are you modeling worse? I mean, no one obviously has a 
crystal ball, bu
t how are you guys thinking about it?
 
Hugh Johnston
 
Ali, we look at a variety of scenarios rather than model a point estimate 
specifically, because if one thing has been proven over the last couple of 
years is, with volatile economics in developed markets 
and a specially 
volatile commodity environment, for anyone to go out and try to model a 
point estimate and say, that's going to be my number is, frankly, either 
incredibly prescient or not very insightful at all. So the way we approach it 
actually isn't to
 
say, here is the scenario that we're counting on. What we 
say is, based on this reasonable range of scenarios, some of which have 
unemployment a little higher, some of a little bit lower. Some of which have 
consumer confidence a little higher, a little lo
wer. Some of which have 
inflation higher and lower. We triangulate and say, what do we think that the 
portfolio can do under this various set of scenarios? And based on that, what 
comes out of it is, we think in order to continue to invest in the business,
 
in 
order to get to the new growth platforms while continuing to grow our core 
business, we think high
-
single digits is the most prudent long
-
term 
guidance. Now might that change, depending on what the economic 
scenarios actually evolve to, you bet. But we
 
think right now, rather than tell 
you, you know what, the markets are so volatile we don't know where it's 
going. What we do is, we try to model a variety of them and we say, you 
know what, we think under almost all the scenarios we can get to high
-
single
 
digits and still do the right things for the long term of the business 
and the long term of the equity. So that's how we get to that number.
 
Ali Dibadj

Bernstein Research
 
You mentioned a couple of times, difficult pricing environment between 
beverages. Can you help to segregate that a little bit, it sounds like it's more 
developed, but if you think about juices which we'd expect to be up, sports, 
CSDs, other, what are you seeing and where can we think about the highest 
potential of a difficult
 
environment?
 
Eric Foss
 
Ali, it's Eric. Well, let me first of all say that, as we've said before, as we 
think about pricing, particularly in this kind of economic environment, our 
pricing strategy and approach really starts and ends with the consumer. And 
so if you look at what we attempted to do the latter part of 2010, if you look 
at how we're approaching 2011, I'd say the best word to describe how we're 
approaching pricing is balanced, and the reality is, is that we are trying to 
optimize the consumer va
lue equation and impression, while also balancing 
the volume and margin trade
-
offs on the P&L. And so again, we talked about 
in fourth quarter, the fact that we initiated some post
-
Labor Day pricing. We 
did end up having to deal some of that back given the
 
competitive 
conditions, but at the end of the day, we believe the right long
-
term 
approach for this business is to take a very balanced approach. We did show 
price appreciation in fourth quarter. We intend to show price appreciation 
and balance the volume
 
price trade
-
off in 2011. And again, if you look at the 
history of the beverage category in North America, the reality is, is that 
there is no history that a volume at all cost mentality or taking a price
-
based 
marketing approach has any strategic or susta
inable ability with it. So I 
think at the end of the day, if you look at what we delivered in fourth 
quarter, we delivered volume growth and pricing growth. We had good mix 
performance, we also got some rate appreciation and again, we'll take that 
same bal
anced approach into 2011.

You obviously have a set of assumptions incorporated in your guidance. If

point, as Hugh said, we've looked at a range of scen

And then just a quick one on productivity, you mentioned you're look
ing for 
some productivity to offset the inflation, is this incremental to the programs 
that we've been talking about for some time? Or is this a part of the regular 
plans?
 
Hugh Johnston
 
No, it's part of the regular productivity that we get. We've obviously
 
worked 
hard to get productivity in the algorithm this year, but it's part of our regular

I guess for you, Indra or Eri

you could give us kind of a state of the union. We heard a little bit from you, 

pretty clear. It seems like certainly in carbs and i
n some cases in non

you are losing share. So I was wondering if you could speak a little bit more 
broadly about where you think you are and besides kind of '11, if we think 
longer term where do you think some of the measures you're undertaking 
today
 
will improve the position you're in today.
 
Indra Nooyi
 
Mark, I'm just going to give you some headlines and then toss it to Eric. Let 
me start by saying, we focus on measured channels because our 
FoodService business is much smaller. In measured channels, 
which is the 
freedom of choice channels, we gained volume share versus our principal 
competitor in 2010. I want to underline that. We gained volume share and 
we extended our lead versus our principal competitor in measured channels. 
I want to underline tha
t. That's in the IRI data, you can look at it.

Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.
 
Is that a carbonated comment, is that an LRB [liqu
id refreshment beverage] 
comment? It's surprising to hear you say that.
 
Indra Nooyi
 
It's an LRB comment. Look the marketplace is now LRB, you can talk about 
segment selectively when you want to, but the LRB market, we remain the 
leader and we've widened ou
r lead over our principal competitor. Look, the 
Foodservice business has always been a different issue for us because we 
were not a big player in that business. Now with the acquisition of the 
anchor bottlers, in 2011 and going forward, as we've told you a
t our 
Investor Meeting, we're going to focus back on the Foodservice business, but 
excluding Foodservice we outperformed our principal competitor on volume 
and gained volume share in 2010. We feel very, very good about that. Let 
me turn to Eric to give you
 
more of a state of the union report card. Go 
ahead, Eric.
 
Eric Foss
 
Sure. I would describe the state of the union of our North America Beverage 
business as follows: first of all, 2010 was a year of major transformation and 
major progress. The reality is, is we completed the merger, not just of two 
companies but of three co
mpanies, which I think increases the degree of 
difficulty, and I think our leadership teams performed flawlessly literally 
across the three benchmarks I laid out early in that process, which were the 
milestones on progress in North America were going to be
, do we complete 
the integration on time and do we achieve the synergies? We've done both 
of those. In fact, we beat the synergies last year, and we raised the long
-
term outlook. The second milestone is do we improve the top line of this 
business? In fact,
 
we did that. We saw increased sequential volume 
improvements throughout the year with our best performers being in fourth 
quarter. We saw three quarters of top line growth, which I think is very 
encouraging, not just for us, but for the broad North Americ
a beverage 
market. Our third milestone was to improve the profitability, and again we 
did that each and every quarter. So again, a year of major, major progress 
in North America. We have very strong fourth quarter, volume was positive, 
top line was balance
d, real strong improvement in profitability, and again as 
Indra mentioned, we saw positive share swing versus our primary 
competitor, both in fourth quarter and on a full year basis. And our 
performance in third quarter and fourth quarter was very, very st
rong across 
North America. So the integration is on schedule, and again, we feel very 
pleased with where we are. We still have opportunities and we'll address 
those, but at the end of the day, I think the key word to describe our North 
America business is 
a year of major transformation and a year of major 
progress.

I wonder if we could kind of flesh out a little bit more of this spending topic, 
A, for U.S. beverage and then, B, where appropriate, some of the em
erging 
market spends. But staying on the U.S. beverage side, I guess I don't know 
how comfortable you're going into channel intentions, but can you give us a 
little bit on how much of the spend increase is A&M related, how much of 
that is below the GP line
? Just talk a little bit about some of the initiatives 
given your view of what's happening in U.S. beverage that you think will 
advance the success you think you have in '10?
 
Hugh Johnston
 
Mark, this is Hugh. When we start getting down into these low level
s of 
details around where spend is happening, candidly, I'm not sure it's really all 
that productive. I think the key message is that you should walk away with 
from last year's spend are, number one, we invested money in brand 
building, particularly in the
 
U.S. and in the North America market. And 
number two, we invested pretty significantly in China, and we shared both of 
that with you at the higher level. What was the outcome last year? Well, as 
we mentioned, versus our primary competitor, we gained LRB s
hare in the 
U.S. in measured channels, and that was just the one place where we know 
there's data. And then in the other, in China, we gained CSD share versus 
our primary competitor. So with that level, I think we can point to it, and 
say, as we make these
 
investments, the investments are working. To try to 
disaggregate all of the pieces of the investments, I think, is largely 
unproductive, and I think what we'd really leave you with is, we said last 
year 11% to 13% EPS growth. We delivered 12%. We're telli
ng you this 
year, we're going to deliver 7% to 8% EPS growth, and we've given you 
some cash numbers as well. And I think at that level I think it's the 
appropriate conversation for us to have. So I know there's always a strong 
desire to get into more of th
e details, but frankly I think the conversations 
often get relatively unproductive, and the amounts of money that we're 
talking about in the context of a $60 billion PepsiCo, I think, that really is 
best left to management to manage.

Indra, can you expand for us internationally on the incremental investment, 
what type of projects, where you're seeing new opportunities expand on the 
scope of the increase, an

that's driving that M&A thinking?
 
Indra Nooyi
 
Carlos, investments in emerging markets continue. I mean, those markets 
are growing si
gnificantly top line, economies are growing. We continue to 
invest in India, continue to invest in China, Russia, selectively in South 
America. We are beginning to increase our investments in Africa, but very 
judiciously, and in some other countries in Sou
theast Asia, whether it's 
Indonesia or other countries in the Pacific Rim, we are beginning to look at 
all of these economies and seeing more opportunities for investment in our 
core categories. Second, from an M&A perspective, there are many tuck
-
in 
acqui
sition opportunities in snacks, in the Global Nutrition Group, many 
opportunities are coming up. Now as I mentioned to you last year, we've 
had more opportunities than ever before being presented to us, but again 
we are quite diligent in our financial anal
ysis and unless we believe an 
acquisition can really create value and sort of plus up any platform that we 
have, we don't really make that acquisition. So we've looked at many, many 
deals, walked away from many, and only take on those like Wimm
-
Bill

Dann 
w
hich give us scale, give us a window into a much larger marketplace and 
then can meaningfully contribute to accelerating top and bottom line for the 
region or for the company as a whole. So that's really what we've been 
focused on. And the good news is, we
 
have a process where we track the 
results of all of our investments. To give you an example, China, we stepped 
up our investments in China in 2010, 2009 and 2010, and we're beginning to 
see significant volume growth because of the marketplace investments 
we 
made. So that's how we track investments and the return on the

I wanted to go back to the Frito

ions 
there. One, just from a category perspective, clearly the economy has had a 
negative impact on the trends, but just taking a step back and thinking 
about salty
-
snack as a segment within macro snacks. You've got other 
categories like confectionary that
's growing at a faster pace, even 
throughout the downturn. So is salty
-
snack just more cyclical category that 
has seen more negative impact? Is it just hit the saturation level that the 
growth is harder to come by? And then on the pricing side, what should
 
we 
be monitoring going forward to sort of gauge the ability for Frito to take 
more pricing to offset inflation? Is it more consumers, is it just looking at the 
value brands and looking at the price gap?
 
John Compton
 
Judy, this is John. Let me come back to
 
the first part of your question 

low

single digit unit growth, so that implies that there still is the ability for 
Frito

Lay in the category to continue to grow. Obviously the volu
me was 
offset by the impact of the bonus bags. We were also in a deflationary 
environment, so no, we and others didn't price during that time frame. And 
to your point about confectionary, if I look at sort of who were the fastest
-
growing consumer packaged 
goods companies in North America, Frito
-
Lay 
once again was at the top tier of that. The only companies that grew faster 
than us were to your point confectionary, but confectionary did have 
inflation and there was pricing notably in the chocolate market. So
 
there is 
nothing that we see. The category can at a minimum still grow with 
population growth, 1%, 1½%. People are continuing to use mini meals 
throughout the day, i.e. snacking, so we still have the ability to grow 
occasions in our business. And as long 
as we remain relevant to consumer 
trends, be it health and wellness on the one hand, or the changing 
demographics on the other, or the aging of the population on the third, then 
we ought to continue to be able to grow the business like we have in the 
past.
 
So we're optimistic as we look forward about Frito
-
Lay in our Snacking 
business overall. There are puts and takes in any given point in time. Was 
2010 our best year in terms of volume? No, and we've made some changes 
to correct that going forward.

And then on the pricing side, John? What should we be...
 
John Compton
 
Yes, sorry, I forgot that point. On the pricing side, I think I've said this on 
the last call, we sort of see the first six, seven months of this year, as o
ur 
prices that we have in the market today we're pleased with, and there isn't a 
lot of price mix in Frito
-
Lay right now. In the back half of the year, sort of 
August going forward, we'll adjust as we close out our fourth quarter 
positions, and it's absolu
tely going to be inflationary. To what degree yet, we 
haven't finalized.

Hugh, you've cited some below the segment operating income expenses that 
will hit 2011 like pension expenses, the investment behind the Global 
Nut
rition Group. Can you quantify how much those are?
 
Hugh Johnston
 
Yes, so Judy, again, what we're really trying to do is get everyone zeroed in 
on the EPS rather than get into all the individual elements of what's going on 
inside of the P&L. As I 
mentioned, if anything we'd expect to see from 
operating profit down to EPS flat to negative leverage. So I think from that 
you should have enough information to basically model what they'd look like 
in total.

Thank you. Let me just wrap up. We
 
feel good about the year we just 
delivered. We feel great about the progress we've made in strengthening our 
businesses. We feel good about the momentum we have going into 2011, 
and we feel good about delivering on our targets we've shared with you 
today.
 
If we can leave you with one single message, we expect to make our 
portfolio work to deliver top
-
tier performance in 2011, just as we have in 
recent years. Thank you for joining us this morning. I look forward to 
speaking with you again soon and seeing th
ose of you who'll be at CAGNY 
later this month. Thank you.

cause our actual results to differ materially from those predicted in such 
forward
-
looking statements. Statements made on this conference call should 
be co
nsidered together with the cautionary statements and other 
information contained in today's earnings release and in our most recent

And now, it's my pleasure to introduce Indra Nooyi.
 
 
Indra Nooyi
 
 
Thank you, Jamie, and good morning everyone. Because this is our year
-
end 
call, I intend to provide a broader con
text today on PepsiCo's journey, our 
progress to date and our expectations for the coming year. As we entered 
2012, I shared with you that we needed to use the year to reinvest in 
PepsiCo. Our business strengthened during the course of the year, with the 
f
ourth quarter looking particularly good. And we are well positioned to 
compete and create value as we enter 2013.
 
 
Let me look back on the year and I think we made good progress on several 
fronts. First, we delivered on all of our financial commitments. Ou
r 2012 
organic revenue growth was squarely in the middle of our long term target 
range of mid
-
single digits, with growth of 5%, both in the quarter and for 
the full year, reflecting a good balance between volume growth and net 
pricing.
 
 
We grew organic rev
enue growth across each of our businesses, both for the 
quarter and the full year, with particularly strong growth in emerging and 
developing markets. And we also had very solid growth in a number of our 
large developed markets businesses like Frito
-
Lay No
rth America where 
organic revenue was up 5% in the quarter, driven by strong volume growth 
and was up 4% for the year. We stepped up investment in our brand by 
increasing our advertising and marketing support by 50 basis points of net 
revenue, exactly on t
arget.
 
 
We delivered our earnings per share directly on target. We exercised very 
disciplined cash management. Our capital spending was 4% of net revenue 
for the year, below our target of 4.5%, a 20% reduction from our 2011 
CapEx investment level. We also 
saw improvement across each our key 
working capital metrics, particularly a decrease in inventory days and 
increase in payables days. All of these contributed to extremely healthy cash 
flow for the year.
 
 
Our management operating cash flow increased 3%, ev
en with the $1 billion 
after tax discretionary pension contribution and cash payments related to 
the major restructuring actions we implemented in 2012. Excluding the 
pension and restructuring cash outflows, our management operating cash 
flow increased 20%
 
or by more than $1.2 billion compared to 2011. This 
cash flow performance enabled us to return $6.5 billion to PepsiCo 
shareholders through a combination of share repurchase and dividends, a 
16% increase from 2011.
 
 
Just as importantly, we leveraged our 2
012 investments to strengthen the 
competitiveness of our businesses across a number of key dimensions that 
will drive long term value creation. First, we enhanced the equity of our 
global brand. We increased our spending across geographies and across both 
the food and beverage businesses. Importantly, these increased investments 
made across the spectrum of our brand from expanding our media spend in 
Good
-
For
-
You product platforms like Quaker to ensuring the competitiveness 
of our large, Fun
-
For
-
You brands l
ike Pepsi and Doritos.
 
 
And we not only stepped up the level of investment in A&M, but we also took 
steps to improve its efficiency and effectiveness by better leveraging our 
global scale and driving consistent brand positioning and coordinating 
advertisin
g, creative and production activities. By doing this, we made our 
investment dollars work harder, allocating a greater percentage of the 
investment to what we refer to as working A&M, that is media and other 
consumer facing activities that drive greater aw
areness and regard for our 

both in higher brand equity scores and in market share results that are 
beginning to improve nicely.
 
 
Second, we stepped up our game
-
in innovation by br
inging to market more 
balanced offerings, from line extensions that bring additional locations to our 
existing products and to new product platforms that are truly 
transformational. I am particularly pleased at both the number and rate of 
our new product p
latform as these typically have higher greater staying 
power and also the opportunity for consistent growth over a number of 

Medleys, a high quality oatmeal with real fruits and n
uts which was just 
named breakfast product of the year for 2012.
 
 
Pepsi Next which delivers real cola taste with 60 percent less sugar and 
achieved more than $100 million in retail sales in its first year. Starbucks 
Refreshers, our 60 calories sparkling be
verage that provides a delicious 
boost of natural energy from green coffee extracts and real fruit juice and 
Gatorade Energy Chews, a convenient form of carb energy to fuel athletes 
prior to athletic competitions.
 
 
In snacks, Doritos Locos Tacos sold more 
than 325 million shelves, 

history, and expanded our presence in the food service channel. We are 
gearing up for year
-
two of our Doritos partnership with Taco Bell, with even 
more exc
iting products. And Quaker Yogurt Bars, originally launched in 
Canada, were a great example of our lift and shift model, as we successfully 
introduced them in the United States, driving recent U.S. share gain in bars.
 
 
And we believe we are still in the ea
rly stages of reaping the benefits of our 
investments in R&D over the past several years. During 2012, we continued 
to invest in the R&D platform that will drive us future innovation and we will 
continue to do so in 2013. Now our R&D investments are highly
 
focused. We 
are investing in technologies and capabilities that will enable us to deliver 
differentiated taste, functionality, packaging, and other benefits to 
consumers over the next five years and beyond. All of which we believe, will 
enable us to creat
e differentiated product platforms that resulted in 
incrementality both at the top and bottom line.
 
 
Third, we delivered on our productivity commitment. We executed a 
comprehensive restructuring program and accelerated our productivity 
efforts across the v
alue chain. How we make, move and sell our products. 
We de
-
layered the organization and improved its efficiency. We reduced our 
headcounts and we rationalized our supply chains to reduce cost and 
investment in fixed asset. As a result of these efforts, we 
delivered in excess 
of $1 billion in productivity in 2012. And we are continuing to drive 
productivity across the entire value chain and across all of our businesses.
 
 
We have a robust pipeline of projects, from leveraging best in class supply 
chain activi
ties around the world, to increasing automation across the value 
chain from raw materials handling through to the route truck, to 
implementing new processing technologies that enable us to both increase 
asset utilization and reduce input cost. Now much of 
this is enabled by the IT 
investments we have made over the past several years, giving us greater 
visibility into our performance metrics across the globe. Some of these 
changes, from small actions repeated millions of times to utilizing new 
technology tha
t changes the overall cost of key processes. Both of these 
give us high confidence that we will achieve a three
-
year, $3 billion 
productivity target through 2014. And even more importantly, we have 
already begun the work on our next big tranche of producti
vity.
 
 
Fourth, we stepped up our execution game in 2012. In North America, we 
continued to drive cross
-
category in
-
store programming to increase the 
frequency with which our snacks and beverage products are purchased in 
the same basket, resulting in increa
sing in our share of our cross
-
category 
co
-
purchases in the United States. So while we have a great deal of 
opportunity to sharpen our capabilities of brand building, innovation, 
productivity realization, market place execution, I believe that 2012 marked 
a turning point for PepsiCo. We truly stepped up our game and created a 
foundation for continued improvement and competitive advantage.
 
 
Now let me turn to our businesses and comment briefly about them in five 
buckets. I am going to talk to Frito
-
Lay North
 
America, North American 
beverages, other developed markets in the group, developing in emerging 
markets as a group, and our Good
-
for
-
You nutrition businesses. Let me start 
with Frito
-
Lay North America.
 
 
Frito obviously plays a critical role in the PepsiCo
 
portfolio. It still enjoys 
terrific leadership in the growing savory snack category with lots of room to 
grow in the overall macro snacking market share in the United States and 
North America as a whole. Specifically, Frito's focus on generating steady, 
p
redictable growth and value creation by sourcing occasions from other 
macro snacks category, growing into the premium segment of snacks, and 
selectively competing in the value tier of the category. And doing all of this 
in a sensible, margin accretive, com
petitively advantaged manner.
 
 
As you saw in the fourth quarter and for the full year, Frito
-
Lay North 
America generated very healthy organic top line growth, which is an 
encouraging sign that our strategy and execution are both working. As we 
look to 2013
, we expect continued steady top line growth. And because we 
have returned to a more normal commodities environment with lower 
inflation, we expect the top line to have more balance between volume and 
pricing. Our goal is to gain value share in a sustainab
le way over the long
-
term through iconic brands, differentiated targeted innovation and flawless 

pleased with their progress.
 
 
Let me now turn to beverages North America and let me
 
start by giving you 
my perspective on the CSD category. To begin, there is still growth potential 
in Carbonated Soft Drinks outside of Colas. Evidence the fact that Mountain 
Dew, our second largest CSD trademark, grew volume in North America in 
2012 and w
e continued to innovate behind you as you saw with the launch 
of Mountain Dew Kickstart earlier this week.
 
 
However, Colas have been under pressure for some time now. Colas have 
declined as consumers have increasingly sought greater variety in their 
repert
oire of beverages. For this reason, we diversified our portfolio in North 
America actually that begun in the early 1990s when we embarked on a 
strategy to be a total beverage company and as a result of multiple steps in 
the diversification, today we have t
he leading position in liquid refreshment 
beverages in measured channels in North America. Almost 40% of our North 
American beverage volume is non
-
carbonated and only a fifth of our North 
American beverage volume is full sugar Cola.
 
 
Our non
-
carbonated por
tfolio is very strong, with great brands in isotonics, 
juice and juice drinks, ready
-
to
-
drink teas, ready to drink coffee and waters, 
all of which have good growth prospects and we continue to innovate in 

ch in Colas? Simply put, 

meaningful innovation in Colas since the introduction of Diet in 1960s. Our 
research indicates that consumers still love bubbles. They love the Cola 
taste, but
 
would like to lower their caloric intake without the taste of artificial 
sweeteners.
 
 

natural sweeteners and flavoring aimed at producing calories with no 
compromise on taste. We have som
e promising projects that are currently 
going through the FDA review process that once commercialized could 
potentially alter the trajectory of our Cola business in a meaningful way. And 

 
behind 
trademark Pepsi with marketing and innovation in order to maintain 
consumer excitement in the brand.
 
 
Now besides our work on disruptive innovation, across the entire North 

to
 


alternatives to improve profitability and returns and to drive further value 

rt our progress on these initiatives which 
will allow us to further unlock value from the PepsiCo North American 
beverage portfolio.
 
 
Other developed markets. These businesses are relatively well positioned. 
We have very strong leadership positions in salt
y snacks in many of these 
markets and our beverage portfolio is strategically well positioned with a 
highly developed zero calorie carbonated soft drink and non
-
carbonated 
beverage portfolio. Even in a relatively difficult macro environment, our 
major west
 
European markets as a group grew snack and beverage volume 
in 2012.
 
 
Moving on. We continue to see very good growth in our developing and 
emerging markets, with organic revenue growth of 9% in the fourth quarter 
and for the full year 2012. Over the past f

invested to increase the significance of our emerging and developing 
markets within our total portfolio so that we could provide a more attractive 
growth profile for PepsiCo overall. We are growing in these important 
markets b
y driving greater penetration, frequency of consumption through 
tailored distribution models and by offering locally relevant innovation and a 
broad spectrum of value oriented offerings. These markets still have 
relatively low per capita consumption and th
erefore provide sizeable 
runways for future growth.
 
 
Moving to major developing markets. Let me speak to a couple of key 
countries. We have a terrific position in Russia where we are the number one 
food and beverage business by a factor of two. And in the 
fourth quarter, 
our organic revenue growth in Russia was 10%, demonstrating our ability to 
leverage our brand, scale and product spread to drive growth in this 
important market. A second developing market, Mexico. We have a powerful 
snacks business with cl
ear leadership in both salty snacks and biscuits. We 
have combined our salty and biscuit businesses into one unit, driving greater 
synergies and growth. And just over a year ago, we strengthened our 
Mexican beverage business, through the consolidation of o
ur bottling system 
under a new joint venture that increased our scale and stepped up our 
operating capability. And our snacks and beverage businesses in Mexico 
continue to find new ways to work together on joint promotion and creative 
channel development i
nitiatives.
 
 
The strength of our operations in Mexico was evident in the fourth quarter 
with organic revenue growth of 7%. Moving on to our emerging market 
businesses which are largely centered in our EMEA sector because EMEA is 
predominantly an emerging m
arket business because we have relatively 
small presence in countries like Japan. Within the Asian emerging markets 
we have strong salty snack leadership. Our China beverage business was 
recently strengthened by a formation of a partnership with Tingyi, gi
ving us 
a [system] relative market share advantage of 1.5 times.
 
 
And in India, we recently further consolidated our bottling network, which 
will drive greater scale and advantage in that market. In the Middle East, we 
enjoy a five times relative market sh
are in snacks and a three times relative 
market share in beverage. Reflecting the strength of our business across 
EMEA, we enjoyed, double
-
digit organic revenue in 2012 with especially 
strong organic revenue growth in Saudi Arabia, India and Pakistan.
 
 
Let
 
me now turn to our nutrition business. Over the years, we have built a 
strong Good
-
for
-
Your portfolio across the key platforms of food and 
vegetables, grains, and sports nutrition. We have strong well
-
positioned 
brands like Tropicana, Quaker, Gatorade, Sa
bra and Stacy's. We are 
innovating with differentiated products that are worth paying more for. We 
are increasingly leveraging these brands and product portfolios globally and 
we are intelligently addressing gaps in our portfolio, as we did with protein 
th
rough the value
-
added dairy platform with Wimm
-
Bill
-
Dann in Russia, and 
through our capital efficient Muller and Almarai joint venture that leverage 
both PepsiCo and our partners unique capability.
 
 
Now these Good
-
for
-
You products are an attractive categor
y with strong 
growth tailwinds and good margins, and offer the potential for continued 
value creation for many years to come as consumers migrate more of their 
beverage and snacking habits to include more protein, food and vegetable 
and grain, and value
-
ad
ded dairy products. Because consumers are both 
very loyal and willing to pay price premium for products in these categories, 
we have continued to see the opportunity to create a great deal of value 
through investing behind Good
-
for
-
You innovation, and expe
ct that we will 
continue to accelerate our efforts in this attractive space.
 
 
Overall, we feel good about the state of the company, our execution 
capabilities, and the caliber of our associates. Now, on to our outlook for 

hat there are still considerable unresolved 
economic and political issues in the United States and Europe, and there are 
number of emerging and developing markets that are also subject to 
economic and political volatility. So it's against this uncertain ma
cro 
backdrop that we are providing our outlook. Now, Hugh, will provide a lot 
more color on the financial outlook in a moment, but in summary for 2013 
we expect mid
-
single digit organic revenue growth with contributions from 
each of our division, driven by
 
continued relatively strong growth in 
developing and emerging markets. And we expect 7% core, constant 
currency EPS growth reflecting the earnings associated with solid organic 
revenue growth and our continued focus on productivity and strategic 
investmen
ts.
 
 
Well, let me wrap up my comments before I turn it over Hugh. We believe 
we have a stronger business as a result of investments we made and the 
actions we took in 2012. And we are well positioned as we head into 2013 
with lots of runway for growth in t
he future. We have strong presence and 
attractive and highly complementary growth categories. Our product 
portfolio has broad appeal across dayparts, need states, cohorts, and 
occasions from indulgent products to nutritious Good
-
For
-
You offerings.
 
 
Our glo
bal footprint is balanced with well
-
established positions in virtually 
every emerging, developing and developed market in the world, with 
strategies and business models tailored to maximize our performance in 
each market. We have an enviable portfolio of w
ell
-
defined brands that 
consumers know and love. Our advantage supply chains enable us to 
achieve superior reach with greater efficiency. And we have deep offering 

content with the sta

brand, accelerate innovation and drive relentlessly productivity and 
excellence in every aspect of our business.
 
 
So with that, let me turn the call over to Hugh Johnston.
 
 
Hugh Johnston
 
 
Thanks Indra 


questions. For 2013, we expect core constant currency EPS growth of 7% off 
our core 2012 base of $4.10.
 
 
We expect orga
nic revenue of mid
-
single
-
digits, core constant currency 
operating profit growth of approximately 6% and approximately 1 point of 
leverage below the operating profit line, driven by share repurchases, offset 
somewhat by higher net interest expense of appro
ximately $90 million from 
higher debt balances.
 
 
And we expect our core effective tax rate to be approximately 27% for the 
full year. Within these expectations we assume positive price mix, low single 
digit commodity inflation, productivity of $900 million
 
and A&M growing at 
least in line with our net revenue growth.
 
 
We continue to manage our commodities using a systematic hedging 
program and at this point we have more than half of our commodity 
exposures covered for the year with more coverage in the clos
-
in quarters 
and the level of coverage will ramp up as we move further into the year.
 
 
We expect the rate of inflation to be fairly consistent across the quarters in 
total and that rate of inflation will be more pronounced in foods than in 
beverages. Our p
roductivity assumption is completely in line with the three 
year, $3 billion program that we launched last year and the savings will be 
used to help offset inflation as well as provide funding for investment back 
into the business.
 
 
One of our key investme
nt areas was supporting our brands with advertising 

net sales, meaning you should expect A&M spending of at least 5.7% of 
sales which was our 2012 base line investment. In addition, w

accelerating our investment in research and development and innovation.
 
 
We anticipate foreign exchange translation to have up to a 1 point negative 
impact on our net revenue, operating profit and EPS for the full year and this 
includes the impac

approximate $100 million non
-
core charge related to the devaluation of our 
monetary assets in Venezuela in Q1. And we anticipate structural changes 
primarily bottler re
-
franchisings will have a nega
tive impact on our full year 
net revenue growth of approximately 1 point.
 
 
As you model out the first quarter, we expect foreign exchange translation 
to have a negative 2 point impact on EPS. Revenue in the first quarter will 
have an estimated 3 point nega
tive impact from structural changes and a 
negative 1 point impact from foreign exchange translation.
 
 
From a cash flow perspective, we except management operating cash flow 

flow 
through even more efficient working capital management and continued 
tight controls over capital spending.
 
 
For 2013, we expect to see continued improvement in our key working 
capital metrics and to manage net capital spending to $3 billion which is well 
w
ithin our long term target of less than or equal to 5% of net revenue.
 
 
From an M&A perspective, consistent with our past comments, we believe 
the portfolio was largely where it needs to be and consequently we do not 
see the need for any large scale M&A. A
s a result, we will continue to return 
strong cash flow to our shareholders. We just approved a new three
-
year 
$10 billion share repurchase program to succeed the current program that 
expires in June of this year, and our board has approved a 5.6% quarterl
y 
dividend increase beginning with or June payment.
 
 
In total, we expect to return approximately $6.4 billion to shareholders in 
2013. $3.4 billion in dividends and $3 billion in share repurchases. Next, our 
outlook for 2013 is consistent with our long
-
ter
m targets for net revenue, 
operating profit and EPS. We expect to drive improved margins and 
improved net ROIC, and we expect to generate and return cash flow to our 
shareholders and that remains a top priority for the company. With that I 
will wrap it up 
and operator we will take the first question.

A question on Frito. If we look at the track data, whether it
's the absolute 
level of sales or even the market shares, the results today are better than I 
think we would have expected. So can you talk a little bit about what's your 
scene and maybe in the non
-
track channel there. And then if you think 
about the marke
t share issue, how should we be thinking about Frito's share 

of the whole Frito

Lay business. Thanks.

John, good morning. Brian Cornell is right here. So let me have 
Brian talk 
about the Frito

Lay business.
 
 
Brian Cornell
 
 
I think we saw a very balanced result in the quarter. I think the overall 
investments we have made in brand building, in innovation, our focus on 
productivity and execution, really played out well in
 
the fourth quarter. And I 
think you saw that equate to growth in our value share or volume share and 
also improvement in unit share. So we are very pleased with the execution 
in the quarter. We would expect that to continue as we go into next year.

nd just sort of where you see that

year? And just some more color in terms of the underlying performance and

Yeah. You know the integration has gone exceeding
ly well, Brian, and the 
business is performing at CapEx levels. You know I have here, Zein, who 

question?
 
 
Zein Abdalla
 
 
Yeah, as Indra said, Bryan, the integration has gone excepti
onally well. As 
we did the due diligence on the whole Wimm

Bill
-
Dann acquisition we 
realized that we are buying a business with very strong brands and a very 
strong management team. And obviously those two things really do support 
your ability to integrate
. I think the other thing that we would really call out 
is that as we have merged these businesses, it's given us the opportunity to 
really strengthen our go
-
to
-
market systems across our total businesses. And 
again as I have told you about many times, when
 
you think about Russia 
with its multiple time zones, the immense geography, that the strength that 
you have in reach across that country as a result of the scale of your 
operation is critical. And Wimm
-
Bill
-
Dann has given us a real step up in that.
 
 
And I
 
guess the final thing we would call out is that the innovation 
opportunity that it brings to really strengthen our snack and beverage 
approach by getting us into that morning day part and our ability to leverage 
our assets into a whole new day part, has r
eally proven out as well. So we 
are just immensely pleased with both the top and the bottom line 
performance, the synergy that it's brought into the business but also the 
growth potential that has opened up for us in Russia.

Just want to get a better sense of, I guess your thought process on the 
returns of the investments
 
you made this year and as manifested in your 
2013 EPS guidance. Because the 7% core numbers sounds a lot like other 
CPG companies; but most other CPG companies didn't go through a big 
reinvestment year and a negative 7 EPS type number. So I totally get th
e 

not just macro challenges, but there may be structural challenges in the 
business versus other CPG companies? How do you gain confidence that that 
is not the case?
 
 
Hugh Johnsto
n
 
 

guidance that we shared last year, we set that out within the context of 
making those investments. So what we were doing with the investments in 
2012 was certainly known to us when 
we said mid
-
single digit on revenue 

particular surprise. In addition to that, as we talked about, the investments 
we were making were in brand building, they were in innovation, and they
 
were in execution. And obviously the returns on those things are not an 

towards is strengthening the franchise and extending the duration of 
performance of the company.
 
 
So as w
e put our numbers together and it all really goes back to the fact 
that we broadened our product portfolio, we expanded our geographic 
portfolio and then we felt like at that moment we had a good opportunity to 
so called fuel up the race car to basically d
eliver an extended period of mid
-
single digit revenue and high single digit earnings per share by virtue of 
strengthening our innovation, our brand building and our execution 

an un


about that guidance.
 
 
Indra Nooyi
 
 
If I could just add something to what Hugh said. If you go back to 2012, the 
big rei
nvestment we made in the company and the down earnings is 
because we had extraordinary commodity inflation. All of it was not 
reinvestment. Commodity inflation was extremely high. Going into 2013, we 


headed to the lower level and we have a very uncertain macroeconomic 

account while we manage this very large company and not try to get ahead 
of our teeth an

Good morning. So Hugh, there is not much gap between your 2013 mid
-
single digit organic top
-
line gro
wth guidance and 6% profit growth. So can 
you discuss your expectations in a little more granularity around margin 
performance in 2013, and why you wouldn't see greater margin expansion 
with both the strong productivity as well as fairly benign commodity c
osts 
and flat ad spend as a percent of sales?
 
Hugh Johnston
 
 

billion P&L. we talk about productivity. We talked about the low single digit 
commodities. We talked about A&M being 
at least 5.7% and we also talked 
about making investments in R&D and innovation. All of those are factors. In 
addition to that, as you certainly know and is common across CPG 
companies, the faster growth comes from developing and emerging markets 
and there
 
is a bit of a margin drag out of the faster growth in those markets. 
Obviously over time the margins will increase in those markets, but it takes 
a bit of time for that to happen. So as we put all of the numbers together, 
risk access the plan, we felt lik
e going from 5 revenue to 6 up profit to 7 EPS 
was the right guidance for 2013.
 
 
Dara Mohsenian

Okay. And then just following up on the R&D comment, Indra, you touched 
on innovation that could eventually impact your beverage business in a
 

little stronger to me today. Are you closer to commercialization on the 
beverage side of the business? Can we expect something there in the short 
to medium term?

Good morning. Hey, can you talk about the update on the US DSD system? I 
think you said at the Analyst Day it was 12 to 18 months to decide how it 
was progressing. So can you just give us an update on, relative to the plan 
you put in place last Fe
bruary, how you think things are progressing there 
and if anything has changed down the strategic alternatives front.
 
 
Indra Nooyi
 
 
Well, as we talked about on the script, we are doing a lot of things with our 
North American beverage business. We are inves
ting in brand, all the brand 
equity scores are trending up nicely. We are optimizing the supply chain to 
reduce cost, doing a lot of work in price
-
pack strategy and while doing all 
that, we are looking at structural alternatives. Sensible structural 
altern
atives to improve profitability and returns. Bill, early next year we will 
report our progress on these initiatives. And we want to make sure that as 

something in the short

I guess I just wanted to ge
t your perspective on pricing outlook in North 
America across both snack and beverages. And in the context of just the 
CSD category as a whole being a little bit sluggish, consumer a little bit still 
challenged. And in snacks with more benign commodity env
ironment, can 
you just give us your confidence level in achieving some type of price 
realization in 2013 to kind of be part of that 5% or mid
-
single revenue 
growth algorithm.
 
 
Hugh Johnston
 
 

ndpoint of 
the foods businesses, I think what you are going to expect to see for the 
year is modest pricing. Obviously the numbers that you are seeing right now 

you will start 
to see modest pricing come into place inside of the food 
businesses. In the beverage business, we have got our North American 
pricing in place. We are satisfying with the pricing that we have been able to 
get out into the market place. And we think it's co
nsistent with the algorithm 
we provided and we are comfortable with that in the context of the 
commoditized environment that we are facing in 2013.

I would

to

How your volume looked in the quarter and what your strategy is in terms of 
the portfolio of CSD versus non

carbs. I think you are starting to get a little 
bigger in juices, sports drinks
 
are growing there. If you could just talk a little 
bit about that.
 
 
Indra Nooyi
 
 
Ever since the refranchising of our beverage business at Tingyi, the business 
has strengthened quarter after quarter. And our business in China, especially 
as we are going to
 
the Chinese New Year as we speak, is looking very 
strong. Remember the refranchising to Tingyi was done from a position of 
strength. They brought to the market, teas, some juice and juice drinks. We 
brought to the market some juice and juice drinks, and w
e brought a very 

the size of the next player. As I look at the business today, February second 
week and year
-
to
-
date, and looking back over the last couple of quarters 
since the r
efranchising, the business is strengthening. And usually in the 
December period, in anticipation of Chinese New Year, you start seeing some 
weird volume numbers, but the best way to look at it is through Chinese 
New Year. And we are in the middle of the Ch
inese New Year as we speak 
and I would say that through this Chinese New Year, our volumes are 
looking extremely attractive at this point. The market is robust and I think 
we have ourselves a good business in China.

I wanted to follow
-
up on the impact of the U.S. macro environment on both 
the snacks and beverage business. Because it occurs to me that 
--
 
it seems 
like 
for most of the past couple of years you've had a depressed 
environment for those key channels and some of your higher margin 
channels. And now there's counter currents going on. You have a little bit, it 
seems better consumer confidence, but at the same t
ime you are getting hit 
with this payroll tax. Would you say the fourth quarter was a better 
sequentially from the third quarter as far as your takeaway on performance 
in those macro
-
sensitive channels? And looking into 2013, do you see 
sustained improveme
nt in those channels for your products? Thanks.
 
 
Indra Nooyi
 
 
Jonathan, you are asking the question of the impact of the economic 

difficult quarter to read because Q1 is full of storm
s in the East Coast, 
storms in the Midwest, and retail activity is influenced by all of these 
weather
-
related activities which have nothing to do with the underlying 
performance. All I would tell you is, as we came out of Q4 going into Q1, 
notwithstanding 
the fact that we've had all these weather
-
related issues and 
we are overlapping a very warm winter from last year, retail trends are 
okay, by and large holding up. Week
-
to
-
week there are some changes, but 
overall they are holding up and our business is hol
ding up too.
 
 

still seeing foot traffic and gas prices haven't gone up too much. So on 
balance our retail activity still seems to be holding up and our business is 
holding up, becau
se again as I said, Q1 is probably the most difficult quarter 
to extrapolate from, especially January and February because weather plays 
havoc on traffic, business and overall performance. So we plan accordingly.

Good morning. One of the great prospects for me for Pepsi was always a 
potential for increasing snack sales and penetration outside of the U.S. so I 
was wondering if you could update us on the p
otential for that strategy. And 
then returning to the U.S. the CSD categories are getting a lot of pressure 
on sugar drinks, obesity and I was wondering how Pepsi plans on attacking 
those claims and is there a need for increased spending?
 
 
Indra Nooyi
 
 
Tha
nk you for asking the question. Internationally as we said in our script 
our snack business is doing very, very well, Mexico, Latin America all over 
Western Europe, East Europe, Middle East, you name it, Asia Pacific. There is 
not a country in the world th
at our snack business is not doing well. More 
importantly many, many countries of the world, the snack business, 
piggybacks off of our beverage business very nicely. We take talent from our 
beverage business, put them into the snack business and in many ca
ses 
they even share a common distribution system. So our snack business is 
looking good. Low per caps in many countries so we have lots of room to 
grow going into the future. So good prospects. Turning to sugared 
beverages in North America as we said in ou
r script, a couple of decades ago 
we started to diversify the portfolio. We are the number one liquid 
profession beverage company in measured channels in North America and 
we have a very diversified portfolio where 40% of our volume in North 
America comes 
from non
-
CSDs. And so we feel good about the portfolio.
 
 
Yes there is a lot of talk about sugared beverages and sort of negative 
conversation going on about it. Diversification of the portfolio is one thing. 
Investing in disruptive technology as we talked 
about is the second thing. 
And we started to do both several years ago. Diversification a couple of 
decades ago, investment in disruptive technology about three to four year 
ago and we've been very consistent in talking about it for the last three to 
four 
years because we anticipated this market trend a couple 

 
three years 
ago. And I think we are in a good position. The challenge is not to do 
anything stupid in the short term in terms of chasing share just in order to 
maintain some sort of a volume share.

4/21/14,Pepsi,"Good morning and welcome to PepsiCo's first quarter 2014 earnings 
conference call. (Operator Instructions) It is now my pleasure to introduce 
Mr. Jamie Caulfield, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. 
Caulfield, you may begin.
 
Jamie 
Caulfield
 
Thanks, Jackie. With me today are Indra Nooyi, PepsiCo's Chairman and 
CEO; and Hugh Johnston, PepsiCo's CFO. We'll lead off today's call with a 
review of our first quarter 2014 performance and outlook, and then we'll 
move on to Q&A.
 
In an effort 
to get to as many analyst questions as possible within the hour, 
we're going to have a one
-
question limit, so we should be able to get 
through the full queue of analysts, when we get to the Q&A.
 
Before we begin, please take note of our cautionary statement
. This 
conference call includes forward
-
looking statements, including statements 
regarding 2014 guidance and our long
-
term targets, based on currently 
available information. Forward
-
looking statements inherently involve risks 
and uncertainties that could c
ause our actual results to differ materially from 
those predicted in such forward
-
looking statements.
 
Statements made on this conference call should be considered together with 
cautionary statements and other information contained in today's earnings 
relea
se and in our most recent periodic reports filed with the SEC.
 
Unless otherwise indicated all references to EPS and operating profit growth 
are on a core basis. In addition, references to organic revenue results in this 
call exclude the impact of acquisiti
ons and divestitures, structural changes 
and foreign exchange translation.
 
To find disclosures and reconciliations of non
-
GAAP measures that we use 
when discussing PepsiCo's financial results, you should refer to the glossary 
and other attachments to this 
morning's earnings release and to the 
Investors section of PepsiCo's website under the Events & Presentations tab.
 
As we discuss today's results, please keep in mind that our first quarter 
comprises the 12 weeks ended March 22 for our North American operat
ions 
and the months of January and February for the vast majority of our 
operations outside of North America.
 
Now, it's my pleasure to introduce Indra Nooyi.
 
Indra Nooyi
 
Thank you, Jamie, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us 
this morning. W
e are very pleased with our first quarter results. Organic 
revenue grew 4% overall, with global snacks up 5% and global beverages up 
3%.
 
Core gross margins improved by 40 basis points and core operating margins 
improved by 50 basis points. Core constant cu
rrency operating profit grew 
7% and core constant currency EPS grew 10%. We achieved our targeted 
productivity savings in the quarter and remain on track to achieve our full 
year target of $1 billion.
 
On a rolling four
-
quarter basis, our core net ROIC impr
oved by 110 basis 
points and now stands at 16.5%, and we returned $2.1 billion to 
shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases, a 47% 
increase versus last year. And as we previously announced, we expect to 
return $8.7 billion to shareholders
 
in 2014 in the form of dividends and 
share repurchases, which represents a 35% increase over our 2013 cash 
return to shareholders.
 
Now, we all know that the world continues to be a volatile and uncertain 
place and we certainly saw indications of this in t
he first quarter. The heavy 
lifting we've done to transform our portfolio and capability is yielding results. 
I believe, our results reflect the power of our portfolios of products and 
brands and the strength of our geographic footprint.
 
Additionally, the 
investments we made to strengthen our brand, innovate 
more effectively, drive better execution and operate more efficiently by 
leveraging our global scale and portfolio complementarity are all beginning 
to pay off. As a consequence, we've been consistently
 
meeting or exceeding 
our financial goals, and more importantly, we have increased confidence in 
the future prospects for our business.
 
Today, we believe our business is well
-
positioned to deliver top
-
tier return in 
the current volatile environment, as a r
esult of the very deliberate steps 
we've taken and the investments we've made over the years.
 
First, the balance and diversity of our product portfolio, ranging from fun
-
for
-
you to good
-
for
-
you products across snacks and beverages, gives us the 
ability to 
manage through issues in any individual business. Together, these 
businesses have an attractive growth rate in the mid
-
single digits.
 
Second, investments we made to enhance the equity of our $22 billion brand 
are all translating to success in the marketpla
ce. These powerful brands 
account for more than 70% of our annual retail sales, in fact our brands hold 
the number one or number two position in many of our markets, and several 
of our brands like Mountain Dew, Doritos, Gatorade, Lays and Quaker Oats 
virtu
ally define their categories.
 
Looking across our largest markets, we have the leading position among top 
brands with nine of the top 40 packaged food and beverage trademarks in 
the U.S., which is most of any CPG company. We have nine of the top 50 
packaged
 
food and soft drink brands in Russia, which is again most of any 
CPG company. We have seven of the top 50 in Mexico and six of the top 50 
in the U.K., and again in both countries we are leaders.
 
The strength of our brands is clear in our ability to achiev
e consistent net 
price utilization. In 2013, beverages and snacks each achieved 4 points of 
net pricing. In the first quarter of 2014, beverages and snacks achieved 2 
points and 4 points of net pricing respectively.
 
Third, we stepped up our focus on differ
entiated innovation. Our annual R&D 
investment is up more than 25% since 2011. We have also created unique 
linkages between consumer and shopper insights and product development, 
using the signs of our demand space as framework. As a result, 2013 was 
one o
f PepsiCo's best years ever for innovation with PepsiCo products 
accounting for nine of the top 15 new food and beverage introductions 
across all measured U.S. retail channels.
 
In the first quarter of 2014, products launched over the past three years 
made 
up 8% of our total net revenues. The good news is that our innovation 
is becoming more incremental and is contributing to positive price mix.
 
Fourth, the investments we made to expand our footprint in developing and 
emerging market are fueling our growth. 
As a group, D&E markets grew 
organic revenue 9% in the first quarter, following 10% growth for the full 
year in 2013.
 
In the first quarter, Russia and Brazil led the way with double
-
digit organic 
revenue growth, followed by India which delivered high
-
singl
e digit organic 
revenue growth. Our broad array of food and beverage products range from 
value to premium
-
priced products and enabling us to earn sales from 
consumers across the economic spectrum.
 
Fifth, we are delivering on all our productivity targets an
d significantly 
lowering the cost base of the company. By leveraging our global scale, 
eliminating duplication and deploying new technologies, we are driving the 
highest level of productivity in our company's history.
 
We are on track to achieve our three
-
y
ear $3 billion productivity program in 
2014 and we are poised to begin executing on our next major productivity 
program, targeting $5 billion over five years, beginning in 2015, focused on 
increasing automation, deploying more shared services model, optimi
zing 
our manufacturing footprint and optimizing our go
-
to
-
market systems.
 
Since 2011 we've increased our core net revenue per employee by 9%, 
increased our core EBIT per employee by 5%, reduced net capital spending 
as a percentage of net revenue by 80 basi
s points from 4.9% for full year 
2011 to 4.1% over the past four quarters, and improved our average cash 
conversion cycle by 33% to 24 days in 2013 from 36 days in 2011 and we 
continue to look in every area of our business for sensible ways to do even 
more
.
 
And finally, we are executing better, faster and more efficiently within our 
operating segments and then further benefiting through increased 
coordination across our product and geographic portfolios. And let me just 
give you a few recent 
examples of our complementary portfolio and our 
execution capabilities at work.
 
Our Super Bowl execution demonstrated outstanding delivery of print, 
outdoor, mobile, digital and in
-
store programming. PepsiCo delivered a 
united effort to leverage our NFL pa
rtnership and drove unprecedented 
national and local impact with both consumers and customers.
 
Each business executed the property very effectively and PepsiCo's 
combined activation was one of our most compelling expressions of better 
together, with coordi
nated advertising, promotions and merchandizing 
across our snacks and beverage portfolios, which helps drive incremental 
sales and share gains.
 
Second, building on the growing consumer appetite for ridged cut chips and 
the strong performance of Lay's Deep 
Ridged chips in the U.S., U.K. and 
Spain in 2013, we'll offer versions of Lay's Deep Ridged potato chips in over 
20 markets around the globe in 2014 with additional markets planned for 
2015.
 
Our global execution leverage is common product specifications, b
randing, 
hedged graphics and ad copy. At the same time, we've built on our beverage 
partnership with Buffalo Wild Wings by introducing Ruffles Deep Ridged 
Classic Hot Wings flavored potato chips inspired by Buffalo Wild Wings. So 
what we are doing is lever
aging our global category structure and getting 
new products to market faster across more geographies, more cost 
effectively and in more channels.
 
Third, during the quarter we kicked off the 2014 Pepsi soccer campaign, our 
largest global football marketing
 
effort to date. Over 100 markets will be 
executing and locally adapting the campaign around the world. Our global 
superstar football squad brings together an unprecedented wealth of 
international talent that spans five continents and includes 19 of the wo
rld's 
greatest players, including the great Lionel Messi.
 
The campaign unites the worlds of football, music and art, reaching fans 
with distinctive packaging, point of sale, out
-
of
-
home communication and 
engaging content. This program drives higher consume
r awareness and 
regard, allows us to leverage our global scale of product complementarity 
and gives us the flexibility for targeted local execution.
 
Next, our highly successful Lay's Do Us A Flavor campaign represents a 
great blend of global brand building
 
elements. This campaign now expands 
more than 15 countries and is an excellent example of how we lived and 
shift best practices around the world. Breakthrough digital and mobile 
engagement is embedded in every single touchpoint, all the way to shelf.
 
This
 
year in the U.S., we've increased consumer engagement by inviting 
consumer to choose both flavor and type of chip. As part of this year's 
contest, a judging panel will narrow down the contest submissions to four 
finalist flavors and then these four finali
st flavors will be fully developed at 
Frito
-
Lay culinary experts and unveil this summer.
 
The winning flavor is determined by fan votes, will be revealed in November 
with a grand prize winner taking home $1 million. This program has driven 
high levels of co
nsumer engagement and is an extremely efficient marketing 
tool because of the massive earned media benefit that begun on each of the 
markets where we launched it. And finally, we have accelerated productivity 
best practices across the organization.
 
For exa
mple, as our global enterprise system or GES continues to rollout 
across Frito
-
Lay North America, we are beginning to apply the same 
concepts and tools to our North American beverage business and in some 
international markets. And these initiatives will ma
ximize asset utilization by 
reducing distribution centers, leveraging automation, deploying fleet and 
route trucks more efficiently, and reducing inventory, while improving 
service and product freshness.
 
So with all this as a backdrop, let's take a look at
 
how the business has 
performed, starting with our North American businesses. Frito
-
Lay North 
America delivered another quarter of very strong results. Organic revenue 
grew 4% and core constant currency operating profit grew 6%. The U.S. 
salty snacks categ
ory continues to grow retail sales at a mid
-
single digit rate 
and Frito
-
Lay's delivering a good balance between volume growth and price 
realization.
 
Revenue growth in the quarter was led by good performance across our five 
largest brands, Lay's, Tostitos, 
Doritos, Cheetos and Ruffles, and each grew 
between low and mid
-
single digits. We continue to execute product and 
packaging innovation, targeted incremental macro snack occasions, including 
the launches of Rold Gold Pretzel Thins, Twistos Snack Bites, Lay'
s Air Pops, 
Lay's Kettle Cooked Lattice Cut Chips and our ready
-
to
-
go market pack that 
offers a broad assortment of macro snacks.
 
Quaker Foods North America delivered positive organic topline in the quarter 
and gained value share at retail in each of its c
ore categories, hot cereals, 
ready
-
to
-
eat cereals and snack bars.
 
Turning to North American Beverages. We are really encouraged with the 
continued progress we are making. In the quarter, we held U.S. liquid 
refreshment beverage value share and achieved pos
itive net price realization 
at retail, ahead of the category and our primary competitor.
 
Notably, PepsiCo has held or gained relative U.S. LRB value share in 
measured channel versus our closest competitor in each of the last four 
quarters. And we continue 
to manage the business responsibly with 
consistent pricing across carbonated and non
-
carbonated beverages.
 
Within the LRB category, we held or gained value share across a number of 
important subcategories, including CSD, sports drinks and ready
-
to
-
drink te
a 
and coffee. And we grew retail sales in measured channels in the U.S. for 
regular colas and Mountain Dew, both within CSD and for Gatorade, Lipton 
Tea, Starbucks Coffee and Naked Juice within our non
-
carb portfolio.
 
We are investing in R&D to drive susta
inable innovation and we are off to a 
good start, beginning with the first quarter launches of Brisk Half and Half, 
Gatorade Fierce Blue Cherry, and Kickstart Black Cherry and Limeade to 
name a few. In addition, we continue to expand our package offerings 
and 
we are seeing good success with strong double
-
digit growth in mini cans and 
we have more than doubled the sales of our 12 ounce glass bottles in Q1.
 
These practices enable us to realize new price
-
packed revenue benefits, 
while providing flexibility to 
maintain price competitiveness. So that's the 
North American story. Our other developed markets in Western Europe also 
performed well, but organic revenue for these markets are up 3.5% in the 
first quarter.
 
Let me now turn to developing and emerging market
s. In Mexico, we are 
managing through the new taxes on certain foods and beverages that were 
enacted recently. We've taken pricing in snacks and our bottle has taken 
pricing in beverages to pass the taxes through to the consumer.
 
In the quarter, the elasti
cities and volume declines in Mexico was in line with 
what we expected. And we have been dealing with the situation throughout 
the year and expected to continue to depress consumer demands, but 
results so far are consistent with our planned assumptions.
 
In
 
Venezuela, we are managing through high inflation, political unrest, 
supply chain disruptions and continued uncertainty regarding the applicable 
exchange rate. But given all these challenges our businesses in Venezuela 
performed well in the quarter with o
rganic revenue up strong double
-
digits 
across both snacks and beverages.
 
Brazil delivered double
-
digit organic growth, revenue growth, led by organic 
revenue growth in snacks. In Russia, organic revenue rose double digits, and 
double
-
digit growth in snacks
 
and high
-
single digit growth in beverages. And 
we saw strong organic growth in a number of other East European markets, 
including double
-
digit organic revenue growth in Poland, high
-
single digit 
organic revenue growth in Turkey.
 
Moving across to our Asia,
 
Middle East, Africa businesses. Organic revenue 
growth was led by Pakistan, a strong double
-
digit organic revenue growth, 
followed by Egypt and the Philippines, which also grew double
-
digits and 
India which grew high
-
single digits.
 
China organic revenue d
eclined low
-
single digits in line with our 
expectations. Performance was muted, given strong high
-
single digit 
comparisons from Q1 of 2013 and some business disruption related to our 
bottlers restructuring in Q1 of 2014 to drive increase efficiency through
 
greater integration.
 
We expect the business to return to its normal trajectory as we enter Q3. 
We remain committed to the developing and emerging markets as they have 
a long runway for growth, driven by increasing demand for a convenient, on 
trend afforda
ble products, supported by a rapidly growing middle
-
class and 
we are well
-
positioned to capitalize on these opportunities.
 
Let me conclude my comments by saying we are off to a good start in 2014, 
with the pieces of our portfolio working together to genera
te healthy topline 
and bottomline performance. Clearly, there are a number of challenges 
around the globe, but the shape and resilience of our portfolio combined 
with strong execution and aggressive productivity should enable us to 
navigate successfully th
rough the current environment.
 
So with this, let me turn the call over to Hugh Johnston.
 
Hugh Johnston
 
Thank you, Indra, and good morning, everyone. Let me spend a few minutes 
discussing the quarter and our outlook for 2014, which is in line with the full 
year guidance issued in mid
-
February. Overall, the quarter came in largely 
as expected with pricing act
ions, commodity inflation and productivity, all in 
line with our expectations.
 
For Q1, organic volume grew 2% in snacks and was even versus the prior
-
year quarter in beverages. Organic revenue grew 4%. On a reported basis, 
net revenue was even versus year 
ago, reflecting 3 points of unfavorable 
foreign exchange translation and nearly 0.5 point negative impact, primarily 
from the franchising of our Vietnam bottling operation.
 
Commodity inflation was up low
-
single digits. Our core gross margins 
improved about
 
40 basis points and core operating margins increased 50 
basis points. Core constant currency operating profit grew 7% in the 
quarter. Our core effective tax rate was 23.7%, approximately 80 basis 
points below Q1 2013.
 
Our fully diluted share count decline
d 1.5%, reflecting the benefits of our 
ongoing share repurchase program and core constant currency EPS grew 
10%.
 
So between the core constant currency operating profit growth of 7% and 
core constant currency EPS growth of 10%, we achieved about 3 points of
 
leverage, driven by lower interest expense or lower tax rate and share 
repurchases. And we returned $2.1 billion to shareholders year
-
to
-
date in 
the form of dividends and share repurchases during the quarter, which is 
47% above year ago levels and reflect
ive of our commitment to return cash 
to shareholders.
 
Turning to guidance. The world does remain a volatile place as evidenced in 
places like Mexico, Venezuela and Eastern Europe. So even with the strength 
that we saw in the first quarter, our full year gu
idance remains unchanged.
 
Consistent with what we said back in February, for the full year 2014 we 
expect mid
-
single digit organic revenue growth and core constant currency 
EPS growth of 7% and we expect low
-
single digit commodity inflation and 
productivit
y savings of approximately $1 billion.
 
Below the division operating profit line, we expect corporate cost efficiency 
driven by our productivity initiatives, a core tax rate of approximately 25% 
and a reduced share count from our share repurchase program.
 
F
oreign exchange is expected to negatively impact net revenue and core 
earnings per share for the full year 2014 by approximately 3% and 4% 
respectively, based on current market consensus rates. Taking our 2013 
core EPS of $4.37 and applying our guidance im
plies 2014 core EPS of 
approximately $4.50, consistent with our prior guidance.
 
As many of you know, the foreign exchange picture in Venezuela is very 
dynamic at the moment. Our first quarter results were translated to U.S. 
dollars at 6.3 bolivars to the U
.S. dollar. Our current FX forecast, which is 
based on current market consensus rates assumes a blended rate of 
approximately 9 bolivars to the U.S. dollar for the balance of the year.
 
To help you with the FX sensitivities on Venezuela, for the full year 2
013, 
Venezuela generated approximately 1% of our net revenues and 2% of our 
operating profit.
 
In addition, as of the end of our international Q1, which includes January 
and February, we have approximately $380 million of net monetary assets in 
Venezuela, v
alued at 6.3 bolivars to the U.S. dollar, which would be subject 
to revaluation, if there is a change in the exchange rate we use. As we did in 
2013, we would expect to treat any revaluation of the net monetary assets 
as a non
-
core charge.
 
As you model out
 
the second quarter, I'd ask you to consider the following. 
First, our EMEA division will face very difficult operating profit comparison 
due to the following: A, a $137 million gain recorded in Q2 2013 related to 
the re
-
franchising of the company's bottli
ng operation in Vietnam; and B, 
27% year
-
over
-
year core constant currency operating profit growth in Q2 
2013, when excluding the above mentioned gain.
 
Second, foreign exchange translation should have an approximate 4 point 
unfavorable impact in the second 
quarter revenue and approximate 5 point 
unfavorable impact on second quarter EPS, based on current market 
consensus rates. Revenue in the second quarter will have an estimated 15 
basis point of negative impact from structural changes due to the Vietnam 
re
-
franchising.
 
Below the net operating profit line, net interest expense is expected to 
increase in the second quarter versus last year, primarily reflecting higher 
debt balances and higher rates. And our tax rate is expected to be higher in 
the second quart
er of 2014 versus both, the second quarter of 2013 and the 
first quarter of 2014.
 
Finally, our stepped up share repurchase activity will occur throughout the 
year, but is expected to have a more pronounced impact in the second half 
of 2014 and into 2013. F
rom a cash flow perspective, we continue to expect 
full year free cash flow excluding certain items of more than $7 billion. We'll 
continue to drive cash flow
-
through efficient working capital management 
and continued tight controls over capital spending.
 
Net capital spending should approximate $3 billion, which is well within our 
long
-
term target of less than or equal to 5% of net revenue. We expect to 
return approximately $8.7 billion for shareholders in 2014, a 35% increase 
over 2013, through a combinati
on of $3.7 billion in dividends and a $5 billion 
share repurchase program.
 
And as a reminder, our previously announced 15% dividend per share 
increase will commence with the June payment. This represents the 42 
consecutive year of an annual dividend increa
se and an approximate 60% 
payout ratio based on 2013 core EPS. At yesterday's closing stock price, it 
represents a 3.1% yield and will bring our 10
-
year annualized dividend per 
share compound annual growth to 11%.
 
So to summarize, our 2014 outlook is uncha
nged from our last call. We 
expect to drive improved full year margins and net ROIC and discipline 
capital allocation and returning cash to shareholders remain top priorities for 
the company.
 
With that operator, we'll take the first question.
 
Question
-
and
-
Answer Session
 
Operator
 
(Operator Instructions) Our first question is coming from Bryan Spillane of 
Bank of America.
 
Bryan Spillane 
-
 
Bank of America
 
Just wanted to talk a little bit further about Russia and maybe just the way 
we should think about modelin
g it going forward. So if you could maybe 
parse out for us on the double
-
digit growth, how much was pricing? And 
then maybe how the performance was snacks versus dairy? And then finally 
just as we're looking forward, given the exchange rate volatility, the
 
increase 
in input cost there, just how we should think about modeling profitability in 
Russia, kind of over the next couple of quarters?
 
Indra Nooyi
 
Bryan, I'm going to provide some overall comments on Russia and then I'll 
transfer to Hugh to provide you 
more detail. Let me just say, our business in 
Russia is a good one. Both in Russia and Ukraine businesses are doing well. 
The climate there has been very friendly to business and we have great 
relationships with the government, the local retailers. So the 
business is a 
very good business.
 
Clearly, the current geopolitical issues are impacting more the ruble and the 
Russian [indiscernible] as opposed to basic consumer demand, because 
they've devalued, input cost have gone up, and therefore consumer prices 
have had to go up. The consumer is e
xtremely resilient in both countries at 
this point, so we have to watch and wait and see how things evolve. But 
those, as overall comment, let me just toss it to Hugh to give you some 
more color in details.
 
Hugh Johnston
 
For Russia in the first quarter, we
 
had 10% revenue growth. Volume did 
grow across the businesses. You are calling out one of the questions that we 
wrestle with, which is the dairy inflation we faced in the business. The good 
news from that perspective is because we have such strong brands 
across 
the dairy category and as a leader there in many of those brands, we do 
have the ability to take pricing successful and that's where the consumer has 
been quite resilient against that pricing.
 
So I would expect to see some level of volume growth and
 
then we will 
continue to take pricing to cover the vast majority of our inflation in the 
country. And we expect that we're going to see continued profit growth 
coming out of Russia. And that's true across all of the businesses, snacks 
and beverages.

Just want to talk a little bit about the pricing environment in North America 
in CSDs. You guys are reporting solid pricing. Coke, mean to say, Cokes had 
the p
ricing for carbonated soft drinks was up. We're not really seeing that in 
the market in terms of looking at the syndicated data. So could you talk a 
little bit about what you're seeing in the category? Whether some of the 
discounting we've seen has been ab
le to stabilize demand a little bit? And 
then how you see the pricing going as we look into the summer selling 
season.
 
Indra Nooyi
 
I think at this point, I'd say we have been extremely disciplined in pricing 
across all parts of the LRB portfolio in all cha
nnels. Now and then we see 
some interesting pricing behavior in one retail channel or in one category, 
but as far as PepsiCo is concerned, John, we have, as we've communicated 
with you, decided to be extremely responsible and take pricing up both in 
carbs 
and non
-
carbs and that's what we've been doing in all channels.
 
Going to the summer selling season, that's going to be our strategy going 
forward, I think especially in the category like CSDs, taking down pricing is 
not going to drive up demand too much. S
o I think we have to play the 
overall LRB portfolio very, very carefully and balance pricing between CSDs 
and non
-
carbs and figure out a way to grow the whole pie very, very 
carefully. That's what we are doing and that's what we hope to see in the 
marketpl
ace going into the year, but we can only talk about ourselves.

I was hoping to just get a little bit more color on Mexico. You talked about 
the elasti
city being pretty in line with your expectation. Can you talk about 
how much volume was down in beverages and snacks? Any major 
differences you're seeing from a consumer reaction perspective across both 
categories? And then a key be, is it profit decline t
hat we saw in the first 
quarter, can you just talk about how much that was with Mexico?
 
Indra Nooyi
 
Judi, I mean the details on the volume decline in Mexico, things like that, 
we're not going to give you that level of detail, but overall I'll tell you, we'
ve 
modeled out a trend that have elasticity. And interestingly, it's coming in 
exactly as we modeled out.
 
But let's be careful here. It's only about three months into the year after the 
taxes have gone into effect and it's going to effect on multiple, mult
iple, 
multiple categories, but the Mexican consumer is trying to figure out how to 
rebalance their basket. So I think we're going to let this thing play out 
another month or two, because our first quarter was just two month, so let's 
wait and see how this 
plays out in the next three or four months.
 
And I think we'll get a much better read as to what this taxation is going to 
do in Mexico and also what strategies we can deploy in terms of revenue 
management to really address price points for the consumer 
--
 
that would 
attract the consumer. So I'll tell you as an economy, Mexico remains robust 
and we still believe enormously in the Mexican economy. I think we have to 
give it time to allow this taxation to play through.

Hugh, the international profit results were very strong even against the 
tough comp and excluding the gain and better than expected FX. From a 
margin perspective, should we view t
he Q1 strength as an aberration in a 
light seasonal quarter? Do you think the strong performance can continue in 
the balance of the year? And then also, can you give us update on the 
potential for emerging markets margins to expand longer
-
term as you gain 
scale and if we should expect an inflection point in emerging markets 
margins any time soon?
 
Indra Nooyi
 
Go ahead, Hugh.
 
Hugh Johnston
 
A couple of things on that. Yes, you're right. The emerging or the 
international margins expanded probably more than you'
re going to 
consistently see across the board in the first quarter. The productivity 
programs are kicking into the place and obviously that's helping us. In 
addition to that, some of the new pricing that we putted in is helping as well, 
but Q1 was probably
 
a bit better than what you would expect over the 
course of the year.
 
The balancing act, of course, in developing and emerging markets as we 
have talked about before is one of how rapidly do you increase margins 
versus pricing a bit below your commodity in
flation, in order to increase 
consumer adoption of our products and our categories, and also frankly to 
build competitive strength for ourselves through scaling and gaining market 
share across the businesses. I do think that by virtue of the scale gains, w
e 
will see natural margin accretion over time. To some degree, given the 
investments that we've made in brands, we can control how quickly we 
increase the margins in those businesses.
 
But frankly, what we're trying to do is build great 
competitive fortresses 
around the rest of the world, in places like Brazil and places like Russia and 
in places like India and China, in order to frankly generate lots of long
-
term 
value for shareholders. So the strategy we're following is to capture 
suffi
cient short
-
term financial gains in those markets, yet at the same time 
build great fortresses like we have here in North America for the long haul, 
in both the snacks and the beverage business.

Couple of quick ones. Just in terms of cash flow in the quarter, I mean it 
looked like there were some working capital anomalies, and I know you've 
maintained your cash flow guidance for the year. So could
 
you just explain 
kind of what happened there? And then I just have a really quick follow
-
up.
 
Hugh Johnston
 
Yes, Bill, you're right. This is Hugh. We had some timing on payments and a 
few timing items on inventory as well. Those are correct. In fact, they'
re 
already correcting through margin. And as we get to the full year, you will 
see the cash flow come in exactly as we expected.
 
As you try to manage cash flow, managing on a quarterly basis our cash flow 
is a little bit trickier than earnings on a quarter
ly basis. You're going to see 
some more bumps and it will be a bit more inconsistent, but I would expect 
the cash flow to come in as we expected for the year. And working capital 
will improve strongly during the year.

Ju
st wondering, there is a huge disconnect between the results, topline that 
Coke put up in Europe and you. And obviously Russia is a huge part of your 
Europe business, but in Western Europe and the U.K. in particular, which is a 
big business for you, could 
you talk about how your European beverage 
business performed? And what you're seeing in that market, please?
 
Indra Nooyi
 
I just think, our European business again, investments in brands, 
investments in stepped
-
up execution is all beginning to payoff. And o
ur 
bottling partners are also performing very well. And I'd say across the board, 
pretty much in every country in Western Europe and parts of Eastern 
Europe, whether it's a company
-
own bottling operation or a franchise 
operation, first, our bottlers are he
althy, which helps. And on top of that, 
they are executing exceeding well.
 
And I think the portfolio plays in our favor too. Pepsi MAX, for example, is a 
wonderful, wonderful product and is doing very well in the U.K., in the 
Nordic countries. So the choic
e of the portfolio works. The fact that we have 
financially strong bottlers helps. And third, I think businesses like Tropicana 
doing exceedingly well in France and the U.K.
 
So we have on target products, healthy bottlers and great execution, and 
together 
they're all beginning to work in Europe. So we're feeling good about 
the shape of the portfolio. And what I'd say is, what we can control, we're 
doing well. When it comes to geopolitics or macroeconomic turmoil, we try 
to navigate through it. But what we c
an control, we are doing a very job 
with it.

Our next question comes from the line of Steve Powers with UBS.
 
Steve Powers

UBS
 
Indra, I thought maybe we could just talk a little bit about the productivity 
programs, $8 billion effectively over eig
ht years is clearly impressive, and 
about a $1 billion per year run rate its about 10% less to EBITDA or is equal. 
Obviously that's not the expected flow
-
through, so can you give us just a 
little bit more sense of where the productivity is going from, in t
erms of 
reinvestments
 
And how you're measuring return on that investment, and then also in terms 
of where the productivity is being sourced from? It sounded like from some 
of your comments that there is a shift going on, changes of focus perhaps 
between Fr
ito
-
Lay in North America to beverages, but is that correct, and 
perhaps maybe some quantification around the productivity opportunities 
there?
 
Indra Nooyi
 
Hugh wants to take it and then I'll add to it.
 
Hugh Johnston
 
First, in order to understand all 
these numbers, it maybe helpful to give a bit 
of context on the overall environment they're operating within. The cost 
base that we're drawing productivity from is what we refer to is operating 
expense. What's important is what that excludes. That excludes
 
A&M, that 
excludes any financing cost below the line, and tax and things like that, that 
also excludes commodity. So it's really kind of the operating expense of the 
company, including corporate expenses. So that's point number one.
 
It's about $28 billion
, $29 billion in terms of the overall size of that bucket. 
So when you're talking about $1 billion a year of productivity, you're talking 
about somewhere between 3.5% and 4% productivity out of that bucket. For 
a company that's a growth company, that's rea
lly quite strong productivity. 
We benchmark that against other companies that grow the revenues in mid 
single
-
digits and we do feel quite confident about that strong productivity.
 
Now, to your question around where does it go? That question is really a 
mar
gin question, which is a bit more complex. But let me share a few 
thoughts that may help you bottle it and also just give you a little bit of an 
understanding of how it works.
 
Number one, based on our mix of countries, of course, there is operating 
expense
 
inflation inside of those operating cost. The operating expense 
inflation inside of that bucket is also going to run in the 3% to 4% range 
depending on the particular year. Drivers of that obviously are labor 
increases. That bucket is about half labor cos
t, and obviously that's naturally 
inflationary.
 
In addition to that as the business grows, it is somewhat volume variable. 
So you're going to get a better growth in those expenses based on volume 
increases as well. So that's a bit of an offset as you think
 
about the margin 
flow
-
through.
 
The second margin flow
-
through question is around geographic mix. 
Obviously, we're growing more quickly in developing and emerging markets. 
As Dara asked about earlier, margins in those markets are lower. The 
natural drag ou
t of those markets is probably about 30 basis points per year. 
Now that's something that, if we were to take our prices more aggressively 
we could chose to mitigate, but frankly for shareholder value creation over a 
five
-
year timeframe, we think that's the
 
wrong decision. So we're willing to 
live with that 30 basis point margin drag.
 
And then the third piece is how we manage pricing in individual markets, is 
both an outcome of what our pricing strategy is vis
-
à
-
vis commodities, and 
in addition to that, what
 
the competitive situation is in that particular 
market. So that tends to be a bit of a margin drag as well.
 
So when you put all of those pieces together, I think what you can expect 
from us is, is that margin improvement overall of about 30 basis points o
r so 
per year. We ought to be able to do that on a reasonably consistent basis, 
and combined that with the mid single
-
digit revenue growth and below the 
line leverage, I think our long
-
term guidance have high single
-
digit is what 
you'd be thinking about.
 
S
o hopefully that gives you some sense as to taking the productivity and 
mapping it all the way through to the guidance. If you'd like to spend more 
time on that, obviously, Jamie and the team can spend more time with you.
 
Indra Nooyi
 
And the productivity i
n Frito
-
Lay and North American beverages, it's across 
every part of the company. And as Hugh said, it's in G&A, it's literally 
corporate costs, everything. What we don't talk to is A&M and R&D. Those 
are the two that we've said are protected. We'll focus o
n ROI on those two 
investments, but we're not going to cut that to make the numbers.

Our next question comes from the line of Mark Swartzberg with Stifel.
 
Mark Swartzberg 
-
 
Stifel
 
Two questions. I'm hoping to try to better understand from the thin
king that 
you and your board have on TSR and CEO transition. On TSR, the 35% 
increase that you're announcing again, so to speak, or is a repeat of what 
we heard from the fourth quarter, is a very healthy, nice, good number. Can 
you give us some sense about
 
the philosophy driving that?
 
I think one thing I'm really trying to better understand is you're putting 
optimal leverage target out there, do you do something to help us think 
beyond '14, how we should be thinking about how much cash shareholders 
get back
 
from the company, again from a beyond '14 perspective? So 
looking for some color on TSR? And then simply any update on, Indra, how 
you are thinking and the larger Board is thinking on the subject of CEO 
transition?
 
Indra Nooyi
 
You want to take this up, an
d I will talk about CEO transition.
 
Hugh Johnston
 
Mark, from the perspective of TSR, I guess in terms of going beyond 2014, 
we haven't provided any specific guidance around share repurchase. We'll do 
that as we get into the next year. We've got a long hist
ory of share 
repurchase. We've been repurchasing our shares since 2001. So there is 
certainly a reasonable expectation that the share repurchase will continue to 
be relatively high. I don't want to get into 2015 guidance on share repo until 
we get closer t
o that timeframe.
 
In terms of TSR, though, perhaps from a different perspective, I would think 
about it from the standpoint of our long
-
term guidance is high single
-
digit 
EPS. So let's take the midpoint of that over time, and call it 8%. That's 
probably a 
reasonable proxy for share price increase assuming the market 
holds relatively stable.
 
Add to that, the dividend yield, right now that yield is, as I mentioned 
earlier, 3.1%. It's probably going to wind up hovering around the 3% range 
over time. So I would
 
think of an 11 TSR is probably being a reasonable 
range to expect out of PepsiCo. We think with that combination of high
-
single digit EPS and a 3% or so yield, that's probably going to be near the 
top of the class in terms of TSR within the CPG space and 
within the F&B 
space. So that's the way I would think about it, more focusing on the TSR 
rather than the short
-
term cash return forecast.
 
Indra Nooyi
 
And in terms of succession, Mark, we start talking about CEO succession and 
all C
-
suite succession, the da
y after you appoint anybody into that job, 
because we have a very, very orderly succession process. The Board reviews 
it every other board meeting. We look at emergency succession, long
-
term 
succession. We have very deliberate talent development models wit
hin the 
company. And PepsiCo is known for that. We have an outstanding group of 
leaders within the company who can assume bigger and bigger jobs, but let 
me assure you at this point, I'm still on the Chair.

Our final question comes from the line o

Bonnie Herzog

Wells Fargo
 
I just have a quick question on the double
-
digit increase in your advertising 
and marketing expense for Frito
-
Lay and if we should expect that level of 
investment to continue? And then you've re
ported flat organic beverage 
volume growth in North America this quarter, which is quite positive. So 
could you drill down a little further and maybe give us an idea where some 
of this strength came from in terms of channels and brands?
 
Indra Nooyi
 
I 
will take the beverage question and then Hugh you can take the question 
on the A&M and Frito
-
Lay. As I mentioned on my prepared remarks, Bonnie, 
I tell you, we had a very, very good first quarter in North American 
beverages. I think we had growth across th
e board in all parts of the 
portfolio. We gained or held value share in CSDs, sports drink, ready
-
to
-
drink tea, coffee.
 
We grew retail sales in measured channels in the U.S. for regular cola's and 
Mountain Dew within CSDs. Gatorade, Lipton Tea, Starbucks C
offee, Naked 
Juice and non
-
carbs, this is one of those quarters, in spite of the fact that we 
had bad weather for some of the days of the first quarter, which caused 
some routes not to service accounts, this is the quarter where innovation 
stuck, our execu
tion was terrific, and we just performed well.
 
But let's also make sure we recognize that now for several quarters, we have 
held or gained value share in U.S. LRB in measured channels. So I think all 
the investments, the focus on execution, brand building 
in North American 
Beverages is beginning to payoff. We're feeling good about the prospects in 
this business.
 
Hugh Johnston
 
And Bonnie, I will talk about the advertising and marketing spending in 
Frito
-
Lay. Obviously, when we increase A&M across the company
, a couple 
of years ago, Frito
-
Lay certainly got their share of that increase. And it's 
worked, is the great news. We've seen the brand equity score has increased. 
And we've seen our ability to price successfully increase because the brands 
are stronger.
 
R
egarding go
-
forward, what we've said is, we do not expect A&M as a 
percent of revenue to go down. So that will line in the centers, as Indra 
mentioned, regarding where we sit as a company. Beyond that, it really 
comes down to not a strategic move anymore. 
We need to increase A&M for 
the competitive reasons, because we think we're underspending.
 
But frankly, we'll base it on the opportunities that we see in the demand 
spaces that we're working within and within the innovation ideas that we 
have. So you might
 
see a growth faster than revenue in a year or two, 
because we have some great products that we're putting out there.
 
You might see it, because we have a great combination idea of something 
we want to advertise between the beverage business and the snack f
ood 
business, and we'll always take advantages of those opportunities when we 
have that kind of an insight. But there is no strategy to increase A&M faster 
than revenue with Frito
-
Lay. I would expect to see them grow basically in 
line. That's a big idea.
 
I
ndra Nooyi
 
So let me just bring this to a close. Thank you all for your questions. In 
closing, I think we have taken the necessary steps to position ourselves for 
sustainable long
-
term growth. We're off to a good start in 2014 and we've 
done a good job nav
igating through an uncertain and volatile environment.
 
And I believe the first quarter of 2014 is a good example of how well
-
constructive portfolio, appropriate investment and disciplined execution can 
drive high quality top and bottomline results. Our fir
st quarter results give 
me confidence that our plans are working and that we are on track to deliver 
our financial goals in 2014.
 
So let me thank you for your time this morning and for the confidence 
you've placed in us with your investment. Have a great d

PepsiCo, Inc.
 
Thank you, Jamie, and good morning, everyone.
 
As you saw on this morning's release, we concluded 2016 with anoth
er 
strong quarter of operating performance, capping off a very successful year. 
The operating environment continued to be challenging in 2016. So in this 
context, I am pleased to report that we achieved or exceeded each of the 
financial goals we shared wit
h you at the beginning of the year.
 
To recap, we grew organic revenue 3.7%, in line with our goal of 
approximately 4%. We met our goal of expanding core operating margins, 
which were up 80 basis points compared to 2015. Core constant currency 
EPS grew 9% v
ersus our initial goal of 6%. Keep in mind this includes the 
impact of deconsolidating Venezuela, which was approximate 2.5 point drag 
on earnings. Excluding the impact of deconsolidating Venezuela, core 
constant currency EPS grew 12%. We generated $7.8 bi
llion in free cash 
flow, excluding certain items. We substantially exceeded our goal of $7 
billion. Core net ROIC expanded by 190 basis points and now stands at 
21.5%, well in excess of our cost of capital. And we met our goal of 
returning $7 billion in ca
sh to shareholders through dividends and share 
repurchases, bringing our 5
-
year cumulative shareholder cash returns to $38 
billion.
 
And reflecting our continuing commitment to providing attractive cash 
returns to our owners, I'm also pleased to announce th
at we are increasing 
our annualized dividend per share for the 45th consecutive year beginning 
with our June 2017 payment, to $3.22 per share, which represents a 3% 
yield based on yesterday's closing share price.
 
We had notably good operating performance a
cross our operating segments 
for the year. Our two largest divisions, Frito
-
Lay North America and North 
America Beverages, each had strong well
-
balanced performance with volume 
gains, net price realization and margin expansion, driving high single
-
digit 
co
re constant currency operating profit growth. And despite the macro 
volatility and weak currencies in many of our key overseas markets that 
impacted our reported results, our international divisions delivered very solid 
organic revenue growth, led by high 
single
-
digit growth in our developing 
and emerging markets businesses as a group, with particularly strong 
performance in Mexico, China and Egypt, which grew organic revenue in the 
double digits.
 
Our results reflect our commitment to plan and manage our bu
siness in a 
way that's self
-
sustaining and balances delivery of attractive short
-
term 
financial results with long
-
term shareholder value creation. We achieve this 
by executing a virtuous circle model that combines top
-
line growth, 
productivity and signific
ant reinvestment in the business. Our top
-
line 
performance is underpinned by strong market positions in growing 
categories and an enviable portfolio of leading brands. And it is fueled by a 
product innovation engine built on consumer and shopper insights, 
deep 
research and development capabilities, and the broad market reach afforded 
by our advantaged go
-
to
-
market systems.
 
Our top line growth is also supported by strong collaborative customer 
relationships. Customers value our relationships with them becaus
e we 
deliver growth. Our brands and products drive basket size and an extremely 
high velocity off the shelf, and therefore generate significant cash flow for 
our retail partners. Our customers value our robust innovation, the in
-
store 
labor benefits of DSD
 
[Direct Store Delivery], and our sophisticated 
consumer and shopper insights.
 
The strength of our customer relationships was evident in the most recent 
Kantar Retail PoweRanking in the United States, where we achieved the top 
spot as the number one best
-
i
n
-
class manufacturer, and we earned top 
marks in the individual categories of most important brands, use of digital 
platforms, insights and category management, growth and profitability, 
supply chain management, clear company strategy, and sales force and 
customer teams.
 
Beyond this impressive recognition, our capabilities and diligent execution 
enabled us once again to be the largest driver of growth for our food and 
beverage retail partners in the United States, which is our largest market. In 
fact, while
 
we represent less than 10% of retail food and beverage sales, in 
2016 we drove 18% of the total retail sales growth of food and beverage. 
This compares to a net decline in sales for all other $5 billion
-
plus 
manufacturers combined.
 
Our success is also sup
ported by an aggressive and relentless drive for 
productivity that contributes to current financial performance and provides 
the funding for investments that will sustain our growth into the future. 
These substantial investments have largely been directed 
at capabilities that 
fuel top line growth. So to strengthen our brands, we've increased our 
advertising and marketing as a percent of sales by 145 basis points over the 
past five years and increased it by 40 basis points in just this past year 
alone.
 
At th
e same time, we have directed a higher percentage of our A&M budget 
from non
-
working A&M to consumer
-
facing working A&M to increase returns 
in our A&M spending. And we have strengthened our capabilities in digital 
marketing, enabling us to execute marketin
g campaigns that seamlessly 
weave together social media, traditional media, and point of sale for greater 
impact.
 
We've increased our investment in R&D by 45% since 2011 and have spent 
approximately $3.5 billion on R&D and food quality and safety initiativ
es 
cumulatively over the past five years. In addition, over the past several 
years, we have amplified our own financial investments in R&D by expanding 
and strengthening our relationships with key strategic suppliers and 
academic and research institutions 
to leverage their capabilities to our 
benefit.
 
We've also established a global design center staffed with world
-
class 
creative talent. Increasingly, we are incorporating design beginning in the 
earliest stages of innovation to take into account the entire 
purchase
-
to
-
consumption cycle, and this is resulting in the creation of not just products, 
but truly memorable experiences for our consumers.
 
Our R&D capability investments have led to the creation of new products in 
the short term and to the development o
f new platforms, ingredients, and 
packaging with longer
-
term potential for breakthrough benefits, such as 
sugar, calorie, fat and sodium reductions, and more sustainable packaging 
alternatives. Under this robust innovation agenda, net revenue from new 
prod
ucts, which we define as products introduced within the past three 
years, has averaged more than $5 billion since 2013.
 
And we are pleased to report that in 2016, PepsiCo accounted for over 17% 
of innovation sales at retail, as measured by IRI in the Unite
d States, more 
innovation than from the next four innovation contributors combined. And it 
has also advanced our portfolio transformation. For example, we launched a 
number of new low and reduced calorie drinks in 2016, such as new recipes 
of Mirinda and 7
UP with 30% less sugar, which is rolling out in over 80 
international markets.
 
Meanwhile, we saw great momentum across our nutritious and functional 
beverages. Naked Juice is on its way to being our next $1 billion brand, 
while Tropicana launched Tropicana
 
Essentials Probiotics, making it the first 
brand to bring probiotics to the mainstream juice consumer. Gatorade Frost 
exceeded $1 billion in measured retail sales, pushing Gatorade over a high 
watermark of $5 billion in measured retail sales. And our Russ
ia team 
launched a new J7 apple juice that delivers all the fiber of a single apple in 
every glass.
 
At the same time, we grew our portfolio of healthier snacks with Quaker 
Breakfast Flats, a snack we plan to roll out in more than a dozen countries 
over the
 
next two years. We are building on the success of Baked Lay's by 
broadening our lineup of baked products. And we're expanding Sabra, a 
brand that generates roughly $800 million in estimated annual retail sales. 
We are expanding it beyond hummus into a ran
ge of products, from 
guacamole and salsa to Greek yogurt dips and spreads.
 
Simply put, when it comes to transforming our portfolio, we are making 
considerable progress. In fact, some people are surprised to learn that our

nted for 12% of net revenue in 2016. 
What we refer to as everyday nutrition products account for approximately 
25% of our portfolio by net revenue. These are products that include 
positive nutrients like grains, fruits and vegetables, or protein, plus thos
e 
that are naturally nutritious like water and unsweetened tea. And what we 
refer to as guilt
-
free products comprises about 45% of net revenue. This 
broader definition includes the everyday nutrition products plus diet 
beverages and other beverages with fe
wer than 70 calories per 12 ounce 
and snacks with low levels of sodium and saturated fat.
 
We've also made disciplined investments in our physical infrastructure. Over 
the past five years we've invested approximately $14 billion in property, 
plant, and equi
pment to support the growth of our business, maintain a safe 
work environment, use less energy and water, and achieve the highest 
levels of quality and safety in our products.
 
We also recognize that we're living in an era where all of our 
stakeholders, 
from shareholders like you to our consumers, associates, and partners, are 
all increasingly expecting corporations like ours not only to make a profit, 
but to do so in a way that's responsive to the needs of the local communities 
where we ope
rate. And that's exactly what we've been doing, making 
investments to lift up farmers and workers, small businesses, families and 
children, from Mexico, where Quaker launched a pin oat malnutrition 
prevention trial with over 1,000 low
-
income children; to P
akistan, where we 
tripled the number of girls benefiting from our I am PepsiCo mentoring and 
social program; and forging strong ties with local communities. Forging 
strong ties with local communities isn't just the right thing to do. It's also 
the right th
ing to do for our business, reinforcing the bonds that will sustain 
our success over the long
-
term.
 
And finally, we are investing in our most valuable asset of all, our people by: 
expanding paid family leave; adopting flexible work arrangements; 
enhancing 
our learning and development programs; and many other actions. 
We are building a workplace that is diverse and inclusive and that will 
continue to attract the top talent in industry in all levels of the organization.
 
In summary, we've established solid mom
entum in our business, with strong 
financial performance generated through a healthy balance of top
-
line 
performance and productivity. And we have made, and will continue to 
make, investments in capability and infrastructure that we believe will 
strengthen
 
the competitiveness of our business and lengthen the duration of 
our financial returns. Our results for 2016 reflect the effectiveness of this 
approach and gives us confidence in our ability to continue to perform well 
going forward.
 
With that, I'll turn 
the call over to Hugh to cover the 2017 outlook. Hugh?
 
Hugh F. Johnston

PepsiCo, Inc.
 
Thank you, Indra, and good morning, everyone.
 
Moving on to our outlook for 2017, as we set out in the release, we expect 
organic revenue growth of at least 3%, as we ex
pect to continue to benefit 
from successful product innovation and strong marketplace execution, 
tempered by a cautious macro outlook. And we expect core earnings of 
$5.09 per share, which assumes core constant currency growth of 8%, offset 
by an expected 
3 percentage point drag from foreign exchange translation 
based on current market consensus rates.
 
Let me touch on the key considerations and assumptions embedded in our 
outlook. We expect currency to be headwind as a majority of our major 
currencies, incl
uding the Mexican peso, the pound, the Egyptian pound and 
Turkish lira and others, are expected to devalue relative to the dollar based 
on the current consensus outlook.
 
Our guidance assumes a 3
-
point unfavorable impact on both revenue and 
core earnings pe
r share. We expect raw material inflation to accelerate, both 
by an increase in our basket of commodities and additional pressure from 
transaction ForEx. We expect A&M as a percent of sales to be roughly in line 
with 2016. We expect continued operating mar
gin expansion through a mix 
of where we are sourcing the expansion will be more heavily skewed to 
SG&A versus the COGS you have seen in recent years. And we expect our 
core effective tax rate to be approximately 24%.
 
Productivity will continue to contribut
e to our margin expansion, enabled by 
several important foundational initiatives we've put in place. First, by 
investments we have made in technology, starting with our implementation 
of SAP in the early 2000s, followed by implementation of many other 
comp
lementary software, hardware and advanced manufacturing technology 
solutions that we are leveraging on a global scale.
 
Second, by our aggressive environmental sustainability programs that 
reduce our use of resources, particularly energy, packaging and wate
r. 
Third, the global operating model we put in place beginning in 2012 has 
reduced management layers, increased management spans, promoted best 
practice sharing and accelerated decision
-
making.
 
And the fourth, Smart Spending, our version of zero
-
based budg
eting that is 
capturing substantial savings across all major discretionary spending 
categories. For example, by increasing our use of relatively inexpensive 
teleconferencing by 30%, we also cut travel expense by over 30% and 
increased the productivity of o
ur associates by reducing the time they spend 
in airports and on planes.
 
Our productivity agenda, focused on driving both efficiency and 
effectiveness, has resulted in approximately $1 billion of annual savings 
since 2012 and is expected to generate approx
imately $1 billion again in 
2017. Over just the last three years, it has contributed to 140 basis points of 
core operating margin improvement, and led to a 510 basis point increase in 
our core net ROIC.
 
And our productivity programs have driven greater eff
ectiveness across our 
value chain by increasing manufacturing throughput, expanding SKU 
capacity, improving job quality for our front
-
line associates, creating a safer 
work environment, reducing our environmental footprint, improving product 
freshness for 
our consumers and enhancing our customer service.
 
Turning to cash flow, we expect to continue to generate strong cash flow and 
to exercise discipline over capital allocation, with prudent reinvestment into 
the business and the majority of our free cash flo
w returned to shareholders. 
So for 2017, we expect: approximately $10 billion in cash flow from 
operations; net capital spending of approximately $3 billion; approximately 
$7 billion in free cash flow, excluding certain items; cash dividends of 
approximate
ly $4.5 billion; and share repurchases of approximately $2 
billion.
 
Finally, as you update your models, I'd like to highlight the following. As it 
relates to the first quarter, we expect both our organic revenue growth and 
core EPS growth rates to be below
 
our full
-
year guidance levels due to four 
factors. First, at this stage of the quarter, we expect organic sales to decline 
at our AMENA [Asia
-
Middle East
-
North Africa] division, driven by increased 
levels of volatility throughout the region and Chinese Ne
w Year timing. 
Second, holiday calendar shifts will modestly impact our top
-
line results in 
North America. Third, FLNA and NAB face very difficult operating profit 
growth comparisons, as they lap both input cost deflation from last year. 
And finally, we ex
pect foreign exchange translation to be a low single
-
digit 
headwind on both reported revenue and EPS based on current market 
consensus rates.
 
With that, we're ready to take the first question.

Just a question about the 3% organic sales growth guidance for 2017. One, I 
just want to clarify. Is the 53rd week in the base? And then second, I think, 
Hugh, you touched on the tough macros as a consideration, so if you can, 
just expand upo
n that. Is that a comment about North America, a comment 
about markets outside the U.S.? Just a little more color there would be 
helpful.
 
Hugh F. Johnston 
-
 
PepsiCo, Inc.
 
Sure, happy to, Bryan. Two things, one, in terms of the 53rd week, it is not 
included
 
in the base. So the 3% is an apples
-
to
-
apples comparison between 
2017 and 2016. That's a clean comparison. Number two, nothing specific in 
terms of anything attached to PepsiCo's business performance, I think our 
3% revenue guidance reflects just a cautio
us outlook on the macros globally 
as well as a reflection of what is even a more volatile world relative to the 
volatility that we've seen in the past few years. So the combination of that 
increased volatility relative to the recent past and our general ca
ution as we 
provide guidance at this time of the year has led us to the 3% growth 
outlook 

 
at least 3% growth outlook.

Good

Hey, good morning, guys. So historically, you've had pretty consistent gross 
margin expansion over the last few years. This quarter was obviously a bit of 
a change with the modest year
-
over
-
year c
ompression. So, Hugh, can you 
give us some more detail on what drove that different performance in Q4? 
And it sounds like in 2017, you're expecting muted expansion in terms of 
gross margin. So I guess what's changed on the gross margin front? And has 
anyth
ing changed in terms of the way you're managing pricing versus your 
commodity bucket? Thanks.
 
Hugh F. Johnston 
-
 
PepsiCo, Inc.
 
Yeah, happy to, Dara. Two comments on that, number one, the Q4 gross 
margins were not a surprise to us in any way, shape, or form
. I think as we 
had mentioned during the course of the year, our expectation was for 
inflation in commodities to pick up a bit in the fourth quarter, and that's 
exactly what happened. Now when we take pricing, we take pricing for the 
entire year. So we got
 
a little bit of extra gross margin expansion during the 
first three quarters as we took our annual pricing, and we got a small 
amount of compression, 25 basis points, in the fourth quarter.
 
As we look forward into 2017, in the first half in particular, be
fore we lap the 
inflation that we saw in 2016, we do expect to see a higher level of low 
single
-
digit inflation in commodities. And that combined with our annual 
pricing outlook will probably result in a bit of pressure on gross margins.
 
As I mentioned in 
the script that I just shared with you all as well, I would 
expect to see more of our operating and margin expansion coming from 
SG&A rather than coming from cost of goods. That's a result of an 
intentional strategy. As we saw ourselves moving to a slightl
y different 
commodity environment, we focused more of our productivity energy on 
SG&A to accommodate that to enable continued operating margin 
expansion.

Great, thanks. Good morning. I just wanted to ask about reinvestments of 
the 53rd week. I thought it was interesting in the press release that you 
mentioned not just reinvesting in growth, but also reinvesting in 
productivity. So i
f you could talk a little bit about that, it would be great. And 
then also, in the outlook for the tax rate, is there anything incorporated for 
the change in accounting treatment for stock option? Thanks.

So, Lauren, let me talk a little bit about productivity reinvestment first. We 
have lots of productivity initiatives over the course of the company, whether 
it's things like GES, which we've been doing at Frito for a number of 
years 
and we've now expanded it into Latin America, as well as different types of 
capability building that continue the momentum that we've seen on 
productivity. With the 53rd week, we thought there was a good opportunity 
to continue to invest and accelera
te that. We did so, particularly in Latin 
America but as well as in other businesses in Europe and to some degree in 
AMENA as well. That is going to be a part of the SG&A gross margin story 
going forward.
 
As relates to your question on tax treatment, the a
nswer is yes, it is 
included.

hank you.
 
Ali Dibadj

Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC
 
So I had two questions. One is just to follow up a little bit more on the SG&A 
piece to it. Particularly in this quarter, it was down quite low, 110 basis 
points, to our math, I believe. Can you 
talk a little bit more about what 
drove that? Was advertising and marketing any piece of that driving 
downward in the SG&A line for this quarter and then, how we should think 
about it progressing it forward? It looks like you're going to be focused more 
on
 
that, but what is that going to be from a SG&A perspective and what the 
buckets of productivity are for that?
 
And then a second, if I could, is just on your share repurchase guidance. I 
think it's about $2 billion; it has been about $3 billion. Can you ta
lk a little 
bit about that decision
-
making or is that just again cautious on the operating 
macro environment so a little bit more cautious on the share buybacks? 
Thank you.
 
Indra K. Nooyi 
-
 
PepsiCo, Inc.
 
I'm going to let Hugh answer this. I'll just tell yo
u one thing, Ali. As I 
mentioned in my script, investments in A&M, R&D, those we're not backing 
off of. We've increased investment in A&M. We've increased investment in 
R&D and we'll keep investing money in areas that drive the top
-
line growth 
of the compa
ny, but, Hugh, why don't you talk about the SG&A productivity 
plan and the share repurchase guidance?
 
Hugh F. Johnston 
-
 
PepsiCo, Inc.
 
Sure, happy to. And, Ali, just to be even more specific on the A&M question, 
A&M was level for the fourth quarter, so the
 
SG&A increase that you saw, 
the productivity increase in SG&A for the quarter, was not driven by A&M at 
all. A&M was level for the quarter as a percent of sales.
 
Regarding the benefits that we expect to see going forward, I think it's 
reflective of two th
ings. Number one, it's continuing rollout of things like 
GES, which obviously make our selling system more effective. And as we 
take those capabilities in different forms to various regions of the world, 
you're going to continue to see more benefit in that
 
regard. That's big point 
number one. Big point number two is around Smart Spending. As I think 
we've mentioned in earlier calls, we really focus Smart Spending on four 
categories in this year. We still have another 27 or 28 categories of spend. 
So you'll 
continue to see Smart Spending having a significant influence on 
our SG&A going forward.
 
Regarding your question on share repurchase, I think, more than anything 
else, that is driven by the fact that, I believe as you know, certainly many of 
our investors 
know, that we have been returning capital to shareholders in 
excess of free cash flow over the course of the last several years. By moving 
that number to $2 billion, that basically brings our cash return in line with 
our free cash flow generation, which ob
viously puts us in a very sustainable 
position going forward. Obviously, as everything else, to the degree there 
are changes in guidance, we'll update it, but, right now, that is our guidance 
and that's what we would expect for the year.

Judy E. Hong 
-
 
Goldman Sachs & Co.
 
Thank you, good morning. So, Hugh, your comment about the first quarter 
organic revenue growth that will come 
in below your full year outlook, I was 
just trying to get a little bit more color because, I mean, AMENA is not a 
huge region for you, so for that to be really a big cause, it seems a little bit 
more exaggerated. And then, also, just in light of softer tre
nds that we've 
seen in North America for some of the food and beverage categories, I'm 
just wondering if that also has an impact on your 1Q outlook.
 
Hugh F. Johnston 
-
 
PepsiCo, Inc.
 
Yes, Judy, happy to answer that. You're absolutely right. AMENA is only pa
rt 
of it. If you recall, part of my comments as well reflected holiday timing. Let 
me point to two things in particular that do have a meaningful impact on the 
quarter. Number one, New Year's actually this year fell into our 53rd week. 
In previous years, t
hat's fallen into week one of the new year. So in effect, 
we lost New Year's out of this year. Now, the reality of it is because it fell 
into the 53rd week, we also really lost it out of last year as well. It wasn't 
captured in either year. So that takes a
way from our Q1 in North America.
 
Number two was the timing on Easter. We lose a week of the Easter build 
out of Q1. That moves into Q2. Those two big factors are basically the 
holiday timing point that I was making, and that focus is very specifically on 
our North American businesses. Other than that, our North American 
businesses are performing well. There's no issue with the performance of the 
businesses, but the holiday timing at both ends of the quarter do have a 
negative impact on it.
 
In addition to t
hat, as we mentioned earlier, and this is part of AMENA's 
numbers, the timing impact on Chinese New Year, the move forward pulled 
some of that into the fourth quarter, whereas in the previous year, it had 
been entirely in the first quarter. So those are th
e specific holiday timing 
references, but nothing in the first quarter relating to the businesses 
themselves in terms of negative implications for performance.

A quick clarification and then just a forward
-
looking question. On the 
clarification, maybe it's too early and I missed s
omething, but I think you 
guided to 10% core EPS growth coming into the year, back in September. 
And you just delivered a really solid Q4 that beat expectations, exceeded 
your own guidance, et cetera. And yet, you're saying you only delivered 9% 
core EPS g
rowth on the year. So if you can help me bridge that, that would 
be great. And then on the go
-
forward, your 3% organic growth guidance this 
year, 8% core EPS growth guidance, it represents a wider spread that we've 
seen in guidance starting out the past fe
w years, even with the lower implied 
buyback.
 
So that implies really solid margin flow
-
through. And I'd just like a little bit 
more color on where that confidence comes from, because the glass half full 
view is that you feel great about the momentum. I gue
ss the glass half 
empty view is that today's outlook is a bit more of a stretch that maybe 
we've seen in the prior few years, so just some comments there would be 
great. Thanks.
 
Hugh F. Johnston 
-
 
PepsiCo, Inc.
 
Yes, Steve, happy to. Regarding the 
first one, just to clarify on the numbers, 
when we talked about 10%, that 10% number was ex
-
Venezuela. We 
delivered, ex
-
Venezuela, 12%. The 9% reference that you heard us talking 
to earlier was inclusive of the Venezuela overlap. So when you exclude 
Venezu
ela, the 10% became 12%. Hopefully, that clarifies it. If not, you can 
speak to the IR team. But the simple answer is the 10% that we had 
projected actually became 12% at the end of the year.
 
Regarding your question around the slightly wider gap between re
venue 
growth and EPS growth, I think the revenue growth, as both Indra and I 
referenced earlier, is reflective of the fact that we are certainly cautious 
about the macros and the volatility and we want to ensure, as we do, that 
we give guidance that we hav
e a very high confidence level that we can hit 
and, ideally, if the world turns out to be a better place, we can beat.
 
Regarding EPS, we have a very clear line of sight in terms of our productivity 
plans for the year. And it's really the productivity plans
, more SG&A focused, 
that will drive the operating margin improvement that will allow us to stay 
on the 8% EPS guidance.
 
Indra K. Nooyi

And basically what we're saying is what is under our control, we intend to

on question regarding the 53rd week

the windfall away from your North A

Sure, ha
ppy to. Good morning, Bonnie. Regarding the 53rd week, we 
prioritize investment funding not based on where we have upsides, but 
where the best opportunities are for growth. So some of the reinvestment in 
the business fell into North America, but some of it
 
fell into our international 
businesses because we continue to see great opportunities for growth there. 
Obviously, internationally, the dollar continues to be a bit of a challenge. But 
that said, we still see terrific long
-
term value creation opportunitie
s across 
many of our international businesses, and we want to invest in those 
businesses. So we took the opportunity with the 53rd week to do so.
 
As regards our go
-
forward on SG&A, I think you'll continue to see us, as I 
mentioned earlier, really drive pro
ductivity out of both the selling system 
and out of Smart Spending in order to continue to see margin expansion, so 
nothing further to add on that, other than the fact that we do continue to 
see opportunities there for further cost reduction.

Good morning, Indra, and good morning, Hugh. I would like to come back 
on 
this productivity effort you are doing, especially around SG&A first, and 
then I've got a second quick question. So with Kraft Heinz moving away 
from DSD, what's your assessment of DSD for your operations, as consumer 
is moving more to e
-
commerce? And to A
MENA, could you give us a bit more 
granularity in terms of forecasted U.S. beverage growth going forward, the 
split between non
-
carbonated beverages and carbonated beverages? Thank 
you.
 
Indra K. Nooyi 
-
 
PepsiCo, Inc.
 
On DSD, DSD is the strength of our comp
any. Given the nature of our 
categories, which are high velocity, relatively low value density, DSD is 
critical because they're impulse, and how we merchandise the product really 
drives the growth of the category. So we are totally committed to DSD. And 
we
 
continue to make investments in DSD to modify it as we go along to 
account for whatever disruption happens in the retail channels. So PepsiCo 
remains committed to DSD.
 
Regarding the beverage outlook in North America, we've always tracked 
liquid refreshmen
t beverage growth as a whole. We've expected for the past 
decade or more that there will be shifts within the category from carbonated 
soft drinks to non
-
carbonated soft drinks, and we've managed the portfolio 
accordingly. So I think you should focus on LR
B [Liquid Refreshment 
Beverage] as a whole. And our expectation is that the overall LRB category 
will grow slightly above population growth and around GDP growth. And 
that's really what our anticipation is for the LRB category growth going 
forward.

Oh, good. Sorry. Sorry, I didn't hear you. I just had a couple quick ones. The 
first is just on the guidance for operating and then free cash flow. It looks 
like it's down slightly for 2017. And it doesn't make a lot of sense when you 
have
 
decent organic growth and what the currency impact is. You're going to 
do the $1 billion in productivity again. So can you just give us some color on 
that?
 
And then the second question is just some of the share trends we're seeing 
in the U.S. with Frito. 
So the category is slowing, but also there's some 
share softness, and the same thing with Gatorade. So as you look into next 
year, do think that stuff will firm up, or are we just missing something 
because so much is in untracked channels now that that dat
a is less relevant 
than it used to be? Thanks.
 
Indra K. Nooyi

PepsiCo, Inc.
 
In the case of share in North America, we track LRB share. We track savory 
share. We track salty share, macro snack share. We track it every which 
way. And as we've always said, 
we want to make sure we balance share 
growth and profitability very, very judiciously. Our goal is never to hit the 
pricing lever too much in order to gain share. We want to make sure that we 
keep the pricing architecture across our portfolio very, very co
nsistent over 
the quarter and over the year. So I wouldn't worry about small perturbations 
in share in any one quarter, in any one category. This is something we 
monitor very, very carefully.
 
And I'd say both Frito
-
Lay North America and our North America B
everage 
business as a whole are doing well. Gatorade, in particular, is one of our 
crown jewels, and the business is performing very, very well. We have a 
leadership position in the isotonic category. And the business is performing 
exceedingly well in the 
category, which involves active thirst, which is really 
what we track. So, Hugh, let me turn it over to you to answer the first part 
of the question.
 
Hugh F. Johnston 
-
 
PepsiCo, Inc.
 
Yeah, Bill, regarding free cash flow, you're right. The number is down 
sl
ightly, driven by two things: number one, the impact of foreign exchange, 
as you had speculated; and number two, a slightly higher level of CapEx, 
although lower than our 5% long
-
term guidance on CapEx. So CapEx will be 
up a little bit but still inside of 
the guidance that we've given you in the past.

Hi, thank you, two lines of questio
ns. One, Hugh, just so I'm clear in terms 
of the free cash flow, are there any other items that you haven't called out 
yet of size that will impact the conversion in 2017?
 
Hugh F. Johnston

PepsiCo, Inc.
 
No, nothing at all.

In fact, we continue to make tremendous progress on working capital, and 
our cash conversion cycle is actually negative at this point.

In terms of Frito
-
Lay, very consistently improving profit growth on a 
multiyear basis, and it seems that the revenue 
management that you 
deployed in the second quarter of 2015 was a good catalyst for that. So I 
what hoping you can give us an update on future opportunities around 
revenue management for Frito
-
Lay? Thank you.
 
Indra K. Nooyi

I think that's wa
y too detailed a question, Vivien. I'd just say that over time, 
across the company, not just Frito
-
Lay, but across all of PepsiCo, we have 
actually dialed up our revenue management capabilities. We've built revenue 
management centers of excellence across N
orth America. And we've 
improved our understanding of household down to a very granular level that 
allows us to tailor products and packaging for individual households and get 
the price utilization we need, because we can put the right assortment on 
the sh
elves based on the trading area of that particular store and the 
households that that store targets. I think that's what drives revenue 
management. And you're going to see that being deployed across North 
America. And hopefully, that'll result in better re
venue realization as we go 
forward.

Good morning. Thanks so much. I was interested in a little more detailed 
description of what happened with your 
Mountain Dew franchise. I know 
Mutant had a C
-
store rollout, pretty small. I don't know how successful that 
was, but what your plans are for Dew and then specifically Pepsi, Diet Pepsi, 
and if you could comment on the demonetization in India and whether th
at 
had any impact on your beverage or snack business. Thank you.
 
Indra K. Nooyi

PepsiCo, Inc.
 
Caroline, good morning. Good to hear you. The Mountain Dew franchise is 
alive and energetic, pardon the pun. If you include regular Mountain Dew, 
Diet, all the 
variants in Kickstart, it's a thriving franchising and perhaps one 
of the best
-
performing franchises in the CSD universe. And we intend to 
continue to invest behind Mountain Dew. We intend to continue to invest 
behind Kickstart and the franchise is doing w
ell.
 
Regarding Diet Pepsi, we had a bit of a hiccup with Diet Pepsi with the 
rollout of the aspartame
-
free product, but now with the relaunch of the zero
-
sugar Pepsi, putting it on the Super Bowl, we're back in business. It's a 
great tasting product. It is
 
a great tasting product. In fact, I'd say it's the 
best tasting diet in the market. Try it. And I think our plan is to invest 
behind the zero
-
sugar Pepsi rollout and make sure that it is the diet for the 
Pepsi portfolio.

And on demonetization, across the board for pretty much all of industry and 
CPG in particular, because it hit the individual retailers significantly, 
demonetization had a significant impact on our India business in Q4.
 
And 
there's still some lingering effects. I'm not sure we are totally out of the 
woods. It's a big country, a massive change because it's currency that was 
about 80% of the circulation out in the country that was taken out of 
circulation, and the implemen
tation had its share of challenges. So our hope 
was that by the time Q2 rolls by, we would be through the bulk of the 
demonetization challenges. And the new currency and the digital currency 
will be back in circulation and we'll be back to retail activity 
coming back to 
normal.

Indra, on Mexico and the UK, I wonder, because of the vote back in June in 
the UK and the election here in November and its effect on Mexico or at least 
the perceived effect, could you lift the hood for us a little bit on those two 
markets
, give us some sense what, if anything, is changing in the way of 
consumption behavior in Mexico since November, in the UK since June? We 
look at the data. We read, but you guys are there operating. So I'm just 
wondering if you're seeing a deterioration in
 
Mexico and an improvement 
perhaps in the UK in the way people are behaving vis
-
à
-
vis your products?
 
Indra K. Nooyi

PepsiCo, Inc.
 
We are basic food and beverage. I don't believe political actions impact 
consumption of our products. And we're not seeing a
ny deterioration in 
activity versus our products, and the market growth continues.
 
Hugh F. Johnston 
-
 
PepsiCo, Inc.
 
Yeah, Mark, just to expand on that, I was down in Mexico last week and the 
market looked terrific. Our business looks terrific. I saw no imp
lication there. 
And in terms of the UK as well, we've seen no meaningful business impact 
from some of the things happening in the political arena at all.

Thank you for your questions. So to summarize, we are pleased with 
our 
results for 2016 and that gives us confidence in our performance as we enter 
2017. We are committed to continue to manage everything within our 
control in what we expect will be a volatile and uncertain macro environment 
in order to deliver attractive 
results in the short
-
term, as we continue to 
position the business for long
-
term success. Thank you all for joining us this 
morning and for the confidence you have placed in us with your investment. 
Thank you.

10/17/13,Pepsi,"Good morning and welcome to PepsiCo's First Quarter 2018 Earnings 
Conference Call. Your lines have been placed on listen
-
only until the 
question
-
and

PepsiCo, Inc.
 
Thank you, Operator. With me today are Indra Nooyi, PepsiCo's Chairman 
and CEO; and Hugh 
Johnston, PepsiCo's CFO. We'll lead off today's call with 
a review of our first quarter performance and full
-
year 2018 outlook and 
then we'll move on to Q&A.
 
Before we begin, please take note of our cautionary statement. This 
conference call includes forwa
rd
-
looking statements, including statements 
regarding 2018 guidance based on currently available information. Forward
-
looking statements inherently involve risks and uncertainties that could 
cause our actual results to differ materially from those predicte
d. 
Statements made on this conference call should be considered together with 
cautionary statements and other information contained in today's earnings 
release and in our most recent periodic reports filed with the SEC.
 
When discussing our financial result
s on today's call, we will refer to certain 
non
-
GAAP measures, which exclude certain items, such as the impact of 
foreign exchange translation, from our reported results. You should refer to 
the Glossary and other attachments to this morning's earnings rel
ease and 
to the Investors section of PepsiCo's website under the Events and 
Presentations tab to find full explanations and reconciliations of these non
-
GAAP measures.
 
And now, it's my pleasure to introduce Indra Nooyi.

PepsiCo, Inc.
 
Thank
 
you, Jamie, and good morning, everyone. Thank you all for joining us 
this morning. We will start off with an overview of the first quarter and a 
discussion of each of the operating sectors performance in a little more 
detail. And then Hugh will cover the 
full year outlook.
 
For the quarter, we delivered $12.6 billion of net revenue and core earnings 
of $0.96 per share. Within the P&L, gross margin was impacted by input cost 
inflation. Operating margin was further impacted by the front
-
line bonus we 
announce
d earlier this year. Foreign exchange translation had a positive 
impact of approximately 2 percentage points to both net revenue and 
reported EPS. And below the operating profit line, we benefited from a lower 
core effective tax rate.
 
The majority of our b
usinesses performed very well in the quarter, excluding 
our North American Beverage division. In fact, excluding NAB, the company 
generated 4.6% organic revenue growth and 7% core operating profit 
growth, when excluding the one
-
time front
-
line bonus. Howev
er, our North 
American Beverages sector continues to work through some challenges.
 
So let's start with a discussion of NAB, separating long
-
term strategy from 
short
-
term executional issues. As you know, we've been transforming the 
business over many years,
 
to build a product portfolio that meets 
consumers' desires through a repertoire of great
-
tasting beverages, 
especially beverages with fewer or zero calories, and in an assortment of 
packages that satisfies a broad range of occasions, from immediate person
al 
refreshment, to family meal accompaniment, to social gatherings.
 
And our focused and sustained transformation initiatives at NAB have been 
very successful on multiple dimensions. We have shifted our product mix to 
faster
-
growing subcategories and provid
ed more lower and zero sugar 
options, including recent innovations under the Mountain Dew, Gatorade, 
Propel, Lipton Tea House and Starbucks trademarks. Since 2010, we have 
increased our volume mix of non
-
carbonated beverages by 7 percentage 
points.
 
We have
 
established and maintained strong leadership positions in many of 
the most attractive non
-
carbonated beverage categories, including ready
-
to
-
drink tea, ready
-
to
-
drink coffee and sports hydration and in the most recent 
quarter, grew value share in a number
 
of the fastest growing categories, 
including tea, enhanced water and sparkling water.
 
We have increased our CSD package variety, so that our mix of non
-
traditional packages, that is, everything other than 2
-
liter and 20
-
ounce PET 
and 12
-
ounce cans, has in
creased from 14% in 2011 to 21% today.
 
We have reconfigured our supply chain to handle increased complexity and 
greater product assortment. For example, we have substantially increased 
flexible can line capacity. We expanded our co
-
pack (5:01) network to g
ive 
us greater packaging flexibility in an asset
-
light model. And we're 
approaching having 60% of our route network converted to delivery via our 
GeoBox trailers, (5:11) and we have equipped many of our trucks with 
chillers to expand our chilled DSD networ
k.
 
We have brought equipment innovation to market, providing product 
customization and convenience with our Spire fountain device and made 
nutritious options more broadly available with our Hello Goodness vending 
machines. And we have ramped up our R&D and
 
innovation efforts to launch 
products that are on
-
trend with consumers.
 
For example, this February, we introduced bubly, a new flavored sparkling 
water with no artificial flavors, sweeteners or calories, and a brand and 
packaging that convey a playful and
 
upbeat sense of humor.
 
And we recently launched Drinkfinity, now available online in the United 
States. This unique beverage system addresses growing consumer demand 
for customizable nutritious beverages in the most sustainable packaging.
 
We believe our s
trategy is sound and is positioning us well for the future; 
however, we are focused on the past three quarters, where our financial 
results have not lived up to our expectations for the North American 
Beverage business. So what is the issue? Simply put, wh
ile most parts of the 
business are performing well, recent losses in cola market share in North 
America have led to subpar top
-
line and bottom
-
line performance over the 
past three quarters. We have studied in detail the causes for the share loss 
across eve
ry dimension.
 
The overwhelming driver is that, despite moderately increasing our media on 
trademark Pepsi over the past three years, our share of voice has fallen 
dramatically relative to our key competitor, who has substantially stepped 
up their media spe
nding on colas over the past two years.
 
To address this, we have allocated increased media to trademark Pepsi. And 
we have tightened and elevated our brand communication, beginning with 
the launch of our new Pepsi Generations campaign.
 
The campaign support
s all the brands under the trademark Pepsi umbrella, 
and this will enable us to more effectively leverage the media investment 
across our full Pepsi portfolio.
 
Importantly, we plan to substantially and sustainably support the campaign 
throughout the year, 
while remaining disciplined on pricing. We are already 
seeing positive results from the campaign, with research telling us that the 
campaign is driving higher advertising recall, higher brand recall and higher 
brand regard with consumers. And our share per
formance has also begun to 
improve. These are important first steps. As we sustain the campaign, we 
anticipate it will translate to further improving sales and market share 
results.
 
Encouragingly, beyond trademark Pepsi, North America Beverages is 
performi
ng reasonably well in the context of a highly competitive 
environment. Our tea portfolio under Lipton and Pure Leaf has over the past 
17 quarters grown retail sales in the range of mid
-
single digits to as high as 
21%.
 
Our enhanced water portfolio is perfor
ming well, with our premium LIFEWTR 
continuing to grow nicely as it enters the second year since its initial launch. 
And bubly's early results following its 2018 launch are exceeding our 
expectations. KeVita, our line of premium organic live probiotic beve
rages, 
grew retail sales 50% in Q1, following 66% growth for the full year 2017. 
And Starbucks ready
-
to
-
drink coffee grew retail sales 3% in the first quarter, 
following 4% growth in 2017, despite a number of new competitive entrants 
in the category.
 
Furth
ermore, we are pleased with both the improved trajectories and the 
outlook for both Mountain Dew and Gatorade. Both brands posted improved 
retail sales performance in the quarter versus the second half of last year. 
And our positive outlook for these trade
marks are underpinned by robust 
2018 innovation.
 
In January, we launched MTN DEW ICE, a clear lemon
-
lime flavored DEW 
made with a splash of real juice with just 100 calories per 12
-
ounce serving, 
and it is off to a strong start. Additionally, we expect our
 
Summer 2018 
limited
-
time offering of MTN DEW BAJA BLAST to perform well, especially 
relative to our DEW Summer 2017 LTO, which fell short of our expectations.
 
Also, this summer, we will launch Gatorade Zero. Gatorade Zero will address 
the large and 
growing demand by athletes for additional hydration options. 
We are introducing a Gatorade that provides all the hydration and electrolyte 
solutions of base Gatorade without the carbohydrates. Gatorade Zero will 
give our athletes more flexibility in combin
ing hydration with other fuel 
sources to meet their overall sports hydration and nutritional needs. Taken 
together, we believe our plans will drive continued improved performance in 
the business.
 
Finally, beyond the strategic and execution actions I just m
entioned, we 
continue to consider all available options to drive greater shareholder value 
from NAB.
 
Now moving on to Frito
-
Lay North America. We had solid performance, with 
balanced volume growth and net price utilization and continued strong 
market share
 
results, driven by great marketplace execution, innovation and 
creative brand marketing. For example, building on the success of our 2017 
launch of Lay's Poppables, an entirely new growth platform for Frito, we 
extended the Poppables product line
-
up with 
the introduction of new Lay's 
Poppables Honey Barbecue and a new 12
-
count multipack of Poppables Sea 
Salt.
 
We continue to drive net revenue growth through increased trial and 
household penetration, which, when combined with increased purchase 
frequency fro
m the expanded product line
-
up and year long media support, 
should continue to scale up this promising new brand extension.
 
We have also extended success of our Simply sub
-
line by introducing new 
package varieties with the Simply variety pack and a three
-
f
lavor lineup of 
single
-
serve packages for Simply Lay's, Cheetos and Doritos offerings. The 
expanded package variety is enabling us to more fully capitalize on 
consumers' growing desire for organic non
-
GMO snacks with no artificial 
ingredients.
 
Demonstratin
g our focus on lifting and shifting successful ideas around the 
globe, we recently introduced Red Rock Deli to select markets in the U.S. 
Red Rock Deli has been a breakout success in Australia that addresses 
millennials' desire for high
-
quality food offeri
ngs, with credentials like Non
-
GMO Project Certification and no artificial flavors or colors.
 
Another example of lift and shift is our launch of the innovative Lay's Smile 
campaign, a concept that has its roots in a similar campaign we initially ran 
in Chi
na. This year, we are harnessing the power of sharing a smile and 
having a positive impact along the way.
 
With Lay's Smiles, we put more than 40 unique smiles on Lay's bags. And 
with each purchase of a Lay's Smile bag, donated a portion to Operation 
Smile.
 
The photogenic and humorous elements of the campaign, combined 
with a compelling purpose
-
driven element, have driven terrific exposure for 
the brand through social media.
 
At Quaker Foods North America, our portfolio of Quaker branded products 
had mid
-
sing
le
-
digit retail sales growth, boosted by the continued success of 
overnight oats and supported by a new ad campaign highlighting the 
functional benefits of oatmeal.
 
Let me now turn to our sectors outside of North America. We are pleased 
with the 8% organic
 
revenue growth we saw in our developing and emerging 
markets as a group, which is an acceleration from the 6.5% growth we had 
in the fourth quarter of 2017. Stable to improving macro conditions, 
combined with strong market execution, have led to very stro
ng growth 
across many of our key international markets. Within Latin America, organic 
revenue grew 10% in Mexico, high teens in Brazil and 20% in Argentina.
 
In AMENA, we had strong double
-
digit organic revenue growth in China, 
India, Egypt and Pakistan. Th
e growth in the sector continues to be diluted 
somewhat by beverage tax
-
related declines in Saudi Arabia.
 
In our Europe Sub
-
Saharan Africa sector, Turkey and Poland organic 
revenue grew high teens, while Russia and South Africa grew mid
-
single 
digits. Even
 
within the developed markets of Europe, we saw solid low 
single
-
digit growth in the UK and Spain, mid
-
single
-
digit growth in France 
and high single
-
digit growth in Germany.
 
Importantly, the strong top
-
line performance translated to impressive 
bottom
-
line 
results, with core constant currency operating profit up 9% in 
ESSA, 10% in AMENA and 17% in Latin America. The strong international 
results are, in part, a reflection of our initiatives to leverage our scale by 
increasingly coordinating commercial activit
ies across markets and sectors. 
Example, with the increased global focus on zero
-
calorie beverages, we have 
continued to strengthen and scale our distinctive Pepsi Black under the MAX 
or Zero Sugar brands, depending on the market, which drove double
-
digit 
organic volume growth globally and the United States in 2017.
 
We have almost tripled our global footprint from 28 markets at the 
beginning of 2015 to 77 markets this year. We are leveraging our Pepsi 
Generations campaign internationally, airing our This is
 
the Pepsi ad across 
55 markets and the soccer
-
themed copy under the Generations campaign 
across more than 60 markets. And we have expanded Lay's Oven Baked to 
14 markets, with plans to nearly triple that number in the next two years. 
And the Lay's Smiles 
campaign mentioned earlier has now been launched 
across markets in each of our sectors and grew retail sales mid
-
teens in the 
first quarter.
 
Net
-
net, we're encouraged by the momentum we're seeing across many of 
our key international markets and solid finan
cial performance by Frito
-
Lay 
North America. And although North American Beverages is in the process of 
a turnaround, we have plans in place that we expect will lead to improving 
performance.
 
With that, let me turn it over to Hugh.
 
Hugh F. Johnston

Pepsi
Co, Inc.
 
Thank you, Indra, and good morning, everyone. I'll just provide a quick 
update on the outlook, and then we'll move to your questions. From a macro 
perspective, we remain pretty positive. We see continued broad
-
based GDP 
growth, with developed mark
ets stable and developing and emerging 
markets accelerating. And in most of our key markets, including the U.S., 
the picture is relatively positive, with strong employment, consumer 
spending and consumer sentiment data.
 
However, within this broadly positiv
e picture, there remains a risk of 
geopolitical volatility in certain markets. From an industry standpoint, we 
continue to see pretty challenging conditions, including: dynamic retail and 
consumer landscapes; a very competitive environment; some currency 
v
olatility, most recently, in the Mexican peso, Russian ruble, Turkish lira and 
Brazilian real, and commodity inflation.
 
As Indra mentioned, within our businesses, the majority of our divisions are 
performing well, and we expect NAB's results to improve as 
the year 
progresses. So putting this all together, our guidance for 2018 remains 
unchanged. Specifically, we expect organic revenue growth at least in line 
with our 2017 growth rate, or 2.3%.
 
As we move through the year, our expectation is that we will con
tinue to see 
some level of gross margin compression from inflationary input costs. 
Normally, you would see the gross margin contraction offset with SG&A 
productivity. But, as we shared with you in February, with the benefit of a 
lower effective tax rate in
 
2018, we are making investments to fortify the 
business, as well as fund the front
-
line bonus. And these investments will 
largely offset the productivity
-
driven margin improvement.
 
We expect our core effective tax rate to be in the low 20s. And we expect 
core earnings per share of $5.70 or a 9% increase compared to 2017 core 
earnings per share of $5.23.
 
We continue to expect and we continue to generate strong cash flow and to 
exercise disciplined capital allocation, with prudent reinvestment in the 
busines
s. For 2018, we continue to expect free cash flow of approximately 
$6 billion, which includes approximately $9 billion in cash flow from 
operations, including a $1.4 billion discretionary pension contribution made 
in the first quarter, and net capital spen
ding of approximately $3.6 billion.
 
We continue to expect to return approximately $7 billion to shareholders in 
2018, with cash dividends of approximately $5 billion, reflecting a 15% 
increase in the annualized dividend per share starting with the June 
pay
ment, and share repurchases of approximately $2 billion. And, as we 
mentioned on the last conference call, we still see the prospect for even 
higher cash returns as we begin to fully realize the benefits of greater global 
cash mobility beyond 2018.
 
Finally
, as you update your models, I'd like to highlight the following. We 
continue to expect our core constant currency EPS growth to be higher in 
the second half than in the first half, as we will lap NAB's softer performance 
and natural disaster
-
related busin
ess disruptions in the second half. And we 
expect variability in the timing of productivity savings, investments, which 
includes the accrual of the front
-
line bonus, and net commodity inflation, to 
contribute to relatively better performance in the second 
half of 2018.
 
With that, we're ready to take the first question.

Thank you. Your first question comes from the line of Dara Mohsenian of 
Morgan Stanley.

Morning, Dara.
 
Dara W. 
Mohsenian

Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
 
Hey. Good morning. So, Indra, on the Beverage business, obviously a 
disappointing few quarters, I'd also argue if you go back longer
-
term, you 
could argue it's somewhat disappointing a performance, even including the 
so
lid results from back in 2015, 2016. And we continue to see this wide 
dichotomy between the snacks business performance and Beverages. You 
articulated that with the corporate ex Beverage numbers earlier.
 
So with all that as context, you mentioned all avail
able options on the call 
earlier. And, as you think about that, is that more a sort of options and 
structure maybe that we've seen in the past, perhaps tweaked a bit for 
today's environment or is that seriously considering more radical changes? 
And I'm try
ing to get a sense for the level of sort of discontent within the 
organization around these Beverage results.
 
Indra K. Nooyi 
-
 
PepsiCo, Inc.
 
So, Dara, that's a good question. So let me start off by saying, we are 
talking just about North American Beverages
. As I look around the world, 
given some of the actions in many countries on beverage categories, 
selected beverage categories, we have actually performed quite well 
internationally in beverages, not just as PepsiCo, but the PepsiCo system, 
because our bot
tlers have their own beverage businesses, too. So if you look 
at the total, the beverage system of PepsiCo has actually performed 
extremely competitively.
 
The issue is in North America, and the issue is really the last three quarters. 
We look at the perfor
mance of the business constantly. If I look at it post 
the reinvestment we made in 2012, the business has actually performed 
quite well, very competitive, but performed quite well. And 2014 coming into 
2015, 2016 and even the first half of 2017 was good. T
he last three quarters 
have been worrisome for us.
 
And let me talk a little bit about this, and I am reflecting back in the last 15 
years of looking at North American Beverages, in particular. Whenever we 
have a competitive situation where somebody is goin
g through a financial 
transaction with beverages, clearly, that creates room for reinvestment, 
which starts to perturb the competitive balance. And that's what we are 
seeing in the last three quarters, because of stepped up investment resulting 
from busine
ss model changes. The question is should we allow this to pass 
or should we step up and invest along with our competitor and that's a big 
question we asked ourself.
 
For three quarters, we said let it pass, because all of these have a 
timeframe. And once th
at temporary investment phase is over, the business 
comes back to a competitive equilibrium. But we don't want to be a net 
share donor, especially in CSDs, especially in colas. And so we'll go toe
-
to
-
toe and increase our spending in colas, in particular, b
ut we're going to 
remain very responsible on pricing.
 
The key thing is this is a business that's highly competitive in North America. 
There's no question about it. It's a big business. It's a profitable business. Is 
it the same profile as salty snacks? No,
 
but it generates a lot of U.S. cash, in 
the mid
-
teens profitability. I think that's a very, very attractive business in 
the staples space. And it gives you enormous clout with retailers because 
the velocity on this categories are phenomenal.
 
And I will te
ll you one thing. Anybody who is in the beverage business 
always wants to be in the salty snack business. And anybody who's in the 
salty snack business always wishes they had a beverage partner because 
you can't have a salty snack without a beverage.
 
So we
 
have the combination together. We just have to keep making sure 
that our portfolio works. And that's what we are doing. We like (24:19) the 
fact that we have to go through these short
-
term issues with performance, 
but believe me, our team is maniacally fo
cused on getting this business back 
to track in the second half of this year. And we will, sequentially improving 
every quarter.

Your next question comes from the line of Lauren Lieberman of Barclays.
 
Indra K. Nooyi 
-
 
PepsiCo, Inc.
 
Morning, Lauren
.
 
Lauren R. Lieberman 
-
 
Barclays Capital, Inc.
 
Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to talk a little bit about productivity. The 
profitability outside the U.S. really accelerated, and productivity was 
highlighted kind of ranked first in the description of each b
usinesses in the 
release. So could you talk a little bit about the balance of kind of productivity 
savings outside the U.S. versus within the U.S.? And as we go forward, 
should we expect more savings to come out of international and perhaps to 
start to see
 
some margin build or are you still more prioritizing reinvesting, 
maybe pricing a bit below the rate of inflation to continue consolidating 
market share internationally? Thanks.
 
Indra K. Nooyi 
-
 
PepsiCo, Inc.
 
You know, our goal is not to price below infla
tion. That's not our goal. What 
we're trying to do is build frequency and penetration. That's all we focus on 
in every market. And market
-
by
-
market is a function of what the nature of 
the competition is. Because in many of these markets, we have local 
comp
etitors, too, and we have to think about our pricing architecture versus 
local competition.
 
So at every point in time, Lauren, we are looking across geographies to 
really figure out how best to grow the businesses. Is it frequency, is it 
penetration? Do we
 
want to actually create a price umbrella for other local 
competitors to come in or do we want to remain with a price premium that's 
reasonable and allows us to build a business?
 
So while doing this, sometimes, we let productivity flow through. Other 
times
, we reinvest it back in the business. So it's, again, literally a case
-
by
-
case basis. The net
-
net result of all of this is, as a company, overall, we are 
focused on productivity like you won't believe it.
 
We think all the digital technologies that are com
ing, all the new ways we 
can work to improve agility, improve flexibility, de
-
layer the company, 
there's so much we are looking at, is actually going to increase the 
productivity of our company. It's just that we have to make sure we have 
enough beta tests
 
done with all the new technologies in the company, that 
when we roll it out across the company, they actually yield results, as 
opposed to flopping.
 
So we're in the process of doing all the beta tests now to make sure that 
they actually yield the kind of 
results that we're looking for. Rest assured, 
you might see short
-
term international productivity, but overall, we're 
looking at global productivity initiatives. Hugh, did you want to add 
anything?
 
Hugh F. Johnston 
-
 
PepsiCo, Inc.
 
No. I was just going to c
omment on that as well. The productivity balance 
won't change. It will be consistent across the globe.

Morning, Bryan.
 
Bryan D. Spillane

Bank of America Merrill Lynch
 
Hey, good morning, everyone. So I guess I want to follow
-
up on Dara's 
question, just about NAB. And I guess as you think about all the available 
options to drive greater shareh
older value, would that actually include 
separating or selling NAB? Is the international business still important to 
have the scale benefits and you'd keep one and not the other or is that 
really not kind of what you're implying when you talk about all ava
ilable 
options?
 
Indra K. Nooyi 
-
 
PepsiCo, Inc.
 
That's not what we are talking about when we talk about all available 
options. The beverage business is still a global business. It's very linked, the 
North America business to the international business. And 
it's very linked to 
our snacks business. It provides very important scale in many important 
international markets and provides us a seat at the table with customers 
here in the U. S. So I think the beverage business is very important.
 
The real question we 
are asking ourselves is how best do we handle the 
operating aspects of bottling? We've gone back and forth between a 
separate company, part of PepsiCo. Is it best as a stand
-
alone public entity 
or is it best in the hands of multiple franchisees? The eviden
ce is not clear. 
And we want to make sure we just don't engage in financial transactions for 
the sake of financial transactions, but whatever we do is really setting the 
company on a sustainable path.
 
So we're looking at what models exist out there. We're 
looking at what we 
did in the past. And we are trying to see how best to operate this very 
attractive, but very competitive beverage business that creates shareholder 
value and also does not detract from the overall performance of the rest of 
PepsiCo.

print from the top line, but I was hoping you could touch on price realization. 
You did cycle quite a tough compare. But it does also look like in the scanner 
data, that there might be a slight softening in pricing, driven by competitive
 
promotional activity. So if you just offer any color on that, that would be 
helpful. Thank you.

Yeah, I'm happy to answer that. Good morning, Vivien. No, I would take the 
pricing as 
more temporary in nature. I think when we get to the end of 
2018, you're going to see Frito
-
Lay pricing that's very much in line with what 
you've seen in the past. I wouldn't expect any dramatic dislocation in that 
regard. Quarter
-
to
-
quarter, price can wig
gle a bit, but by the end of the 
year, you're going to see the same consistent Frito, both from a pricing 
perspective, as well as from a profit perspective, that you've seen in the 
past.

Macquarie Capital (

Good morning. Thanks very much. Good morning, Indra. I'm wondering if I 
got this right, but it 
looks like your spending on A&M was down in the first 
quarter North American Beverages. If I did get that right, can you just help 
us, regardless, understand sort of the pacing of the spend behind this 
business? And which brands in particular, is it really
 
very cola
-
focused? Are 
you going to be spending heavily on all your brands? And what the strategy 
is, just a little more to get us some confidence in a back half recovery.
 
Indra K. Nooyi 
-
 
PepsiCo, Inc.
 
Hugh, why don't you take it and then I'll follow up.
 
Hugh F. Johnston 
-
 
PepsiCo, Inc.
 
Yeah, happy to. Hey, Caroline. A couple things on that, number one, we kind 
of have to separate the accounting from the actual spending in the 
marketplace. From an accounting perspective, as, of course you know, A&M 
gets s
pread out on a curve. As the volume was a little bit softer in the first 
quarter relative to our expectations for the year, less of the spend would 
have been booked in the first quarter. And so you're seeing a timing 
difference in what appears in the books
.
 
In terms of media spend in the marketplace, we were actually up strong 
double digits and strong double digits across the big brands. So I wouldn't 
over
-
focus on what the A&M showed up in the financial books. That's a 
product of GAAP convention. In terms 
of actual advertising in the 
marketplace behind the big brands, it was up significantly.
 
Indra K. Nooyi 
-
 
PepsiCo, Inc.
 
And in terms of going forward, Caroline, which is the second part of your 
question, in most of the brands that we have, we're spending a
t very 
competitive levels, and they're all yielding the right results. The only place 
where we're outspent in the marketplace is in colas. And we were surprised 
by the extent to which media spending was taken up in colas by 
competition.
 
So we're going to s
tep up our advertising behind trademark Pepsi, with a 
little bit of a focus on Zero Sugar and Diet Pepsi. And at the end of the day, 
we don't want to be a share donor. We want to be responsible in pricing. We 
want to be responsible in portfolio management,
 
to go where the consumer 
is going. At the same time, being a share donor is not our cup of tea.

Hey, guys. So I wanted to go back to pricing in North America Beverages for 
a moment. You may remember, we were quite vocal in pushing that price 
rationality is the best for shareholders in CSDs, at least. And, look, to your 
credit, you
 
were early adopters of the sustainable price/mix that we've been 
seeing in CSDs in North America. But actually, now there's a little bit more 
controversy about it. I think I'd argued it's the biggest investment 
controversy we are hearing right now, certai
nly since Coca
-
Cola reported a 
couple days ago. And the controversy is whether price/mix will become more 
competitive or not.
 
Now to be clear, you reported pricing up in NAB. DPS reported pricing up in 
NAB, or their equivalent. KO had pricing down. I don't
 
know if you listened 
to the call or not, but they excused it away with Easter compares and freight 
cost, oddly, and (33:26) price, et cetera. But investors are trying to figure 
out that controversy in particular. What will price/mix look like in North 
Ame
rica Beverages for you, for your competitors, in the context of KO's, 
hopefully, confusion in terms of their pricing and your talk of reinvestment? I 
get that you're being clear in terms of being responsible on pricing; want to 
get a better sense of what t
hat is, and how we should think about price/mix 
in North America Beverages going forward.
 
Indra K. Nooyi 
-
 
PepsiCo, Inc.
 
Again, mix is very important, because based on the mix, you'll see what the 
price realization is going to be. But, Ali, I'll tell you s
omething. We've said 
this for several years now, and I'll repeat it. The message that all our NAB 
chaps (34:14) have is make sure that we never return to what happened in 
2011, 2012 when there were $5 cubes. That's not going to happen. We want 
to make sure
 
that, especially with inflation creeping into the business, we 
price to cover inflation. I think it's very important with the category growth 
of about 2%, that we play this market in a very responsible way, so that we 
don't further depress the category.
 
N
ow, here's a challenge. Single
-
serve clearly has better price realization. 
And as the mix of single
-
serve versus groceries shifts, clearly, you'll see 
some pricing perturbation. But from our perspective, we are watching 
grocery pricing very, very carefully
. And we want to make sure we don't 
destroy the pricing architecture across the industry. And that's really the 
game we are playing. But we're not going to lose the game because of 
media spending, because at the end of the day, pricing discipline is one 
th
ing. But if it's a question of media spending to make sure that the 
consumer understands that Pepsi is still a strong, vibrant brand, we're going 
to spend on media.
 
And we are maniacally focused on making sure we use every opportunity 
with mini cans, with 
other packaging formats, to cover inflation to the extent 
we can, although that's difficult, but inch the pricing up. That's what we're 
focused on right now.

thinking about just raising the overall bucket? And then for Hugh, Hugh, you

Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.
 
Good morning, Indra. Hi, Hugh. Also NAB; 
I know we're spending a lot of 
time on that, but it's important. Firstly, a clarification response to your 
response to Bryan's question, are you also saying refranchising is not on the 
table when you say you're not interested in hiving off beverage? And th
en 
also, Hugh, you mentioned strong double
-
digit increases on the big brands. 
Why do you think the volume didn't respond better to those increases?
 
Indra K. Nooyi 
-
 
PepsiCo, Inc.
 
On refranchising or any other option, Mark, I didn't say no to anything. I 
di
dn't say yes to anything. All that I said was we're studying all of the 
options, because we have gone back and forth with the bottling business 
over the last decade or two.
 
And I don't believe just doing a financial transaction for the sake of short
-
term f
inancial results is the optimal way to create shareholder value. What 
we are trying to see is, given the dynamics of this business going forward, 
given that the mix of products is likely to change, with more hot fill, more 
non
-
carbonated, more nutritious b
everages coming on to the marketplace, 
how best do we manage the concentrate business versus the bottling 
business, so that we don't have to engage in a financial transaction every 
five or 10 years. That's what we are trying to do.
 
We are looking at struct
ures that exists today to see whether they are 
operationally easy to execute or do they sound good in the short term, but 
they're very, very, complex and operationally a nightmare to operate. We're 
studying that. We're also looking at other structures, bec
ause I've always 
told you, the bottling business is a utility, low earnings growth, lots of cash. 
How do you operate the bottling business like a utility? What's the best 
structure to do that? That's what we are thinking through, stay tuned.

And, Mark, as regards to the increase in media spending, certain marketing 
levers work very quickly, distribution and price being the chief among them. 
Advertising and marketing, there is a building effect over the course of 
several quar
ters. So I think you actually did see some responsiveness in 
Dew, and even Pepsi improved a bit, but it's going to take a few quarters for 
the Pepsi business to fully respond to the increased advertising in the 
marketplace.

Great. Good morning. I was just wondering if you could give us a little bit of 
help, and sorry to go back on North American beverages. But is it really as 
easy as just spending more money and driving share of voice or is it quality 
of the share of voice? A
nd I'm just wondering if you can just kind of give us 
some metrics or some evidence of the work that you've done that it's purely 
a question of share of voice, that you have the right message. You just need 
to get it out more, and that the brands are essen
tially healthy. It's just 
you're being outspent.
 
Indra K. Nooyi 
-
 
PepsiCo, Inc.
 
Robert, we look at this all the time. Clearly, the quality of voice is important. 
You cannot just spend with a poor message. The message that we had the 
last two years, I don't
 
think resonated as much. But the new Pepsi 
Generations campaign is resonating exceedingly well. It's scoring very high. 
The recall, the regard numbers are all extremely high. And as we go through 
the summer, you'll see more advertising for Pepsi Zero Suga
r, Diet Pepsi as 
new products come in. You will see a trademark campaign, augmented with 
some specific additional messaging on Pepsi Zero Sugar and Diet Pepsi. And 
believe me, we are maniacally focused on the quality of the message to see 
if it's resonatin
g with the traditional users, which tend to be more the 
boomers, and then recruiting the new people, which is the millennials.
 
And we are watching all of these cohort groups to make sure that the 
message is getting through, that Pepsi is a refreshing drink
. It's great for fun 
times together, and it's great with food. And the recent campaign with Aaron 
Judge is gaining a lot of attention. And we feel good about the messaging. 
But at the end of the day, having a great message, but not conveying that 
regularly
, especially with a competitor who is on air all the time, is not the 
right approach. And so we are going to step up the advertising, and we will 
constantly look at how it's resonating with consumers. And if we have to 
make a little tweak here and there, w
e'll do it.

Good morning. Hello, Indra. Look, just to follow
-
up on this North American 
Beverage comme
ntary you've made, I mean, obviously, investment bankers 
listening on this call will be knocking on your door and giving you plenty of 
ideas and suggestions. But I want to make two questions. One, why do you 
really think that beverages, whether the concent
rate, with or without 
bottling, gives you greater strength in terms of having a seat at the table? I 
could argue the opposite, right? That the poor performance in beverages 
maybe dilutes that seat when you're having discussions about Frito and all 
the grea
t innovation you are putting through there. So maybe just remind us 
and convince us, why really having beverages, whether concentrate, with or 
without bottling, really helps.
 
And the second question, which is related to that, in the hypothetical 
scenario t
hat you did not have beverages, tell us what do you think you 
could do better? I mean, I could argue that the relationship with Tingyi could 
be expanded. I could argue that you could be a lot more aggressive 
overseas in expanding your snacks footprint. And
 
I could maybe argue in 
that you could do a lot more without beverages, but if you can comment on 
that. I mean, you have opened the door to these questions, of course, with 
the commentary that you made today. Thanks.
 
Indra K. Nooyi

PepsiCo, Inc.
 
Pablo, f
irst of all, the investment bankers have been knocking on our door 
forever. They have lots of great ideas. But at the end of the day, as I said, 
the ideas have got to make sense. They've got to make business sense and 
shareholder value sense. And we've bee
n thinking through all of this a lot. 
Hugh, why don't you take the first part of the question and I'll come back 
and add to it?
 
Hugh F. Johnston 
-
 
PepsiCo, Inc.
 
Yeah, happy to. Good morning, Pablo. I would respectfully disagree with you 
on the notion that 
not having beverages would increase our sway or our 
influence with retailers. The fact is we're the number one food and beverage 
company in North America. We're the number two food and beverage 
company globally. We have impulse categories and expandable 
co
nsumption. And we've consistently driven growth for our retailers because 
of the fact that we have impulse categories and strong brands, and they've 
been well marketed over time. So as our retailers are looking for growth, 
they inevitably come first to Pep
siCo because of the size of the two 
businesses. It's not to say either one of them isn't a terrific business alone. 
We just think the two of them are better together, and I have a lot of 
evidence to support that. So I do think that the retailers value what
 
we bring 
to the table in their entirety.
 
Indra K. Nooyi 
-
 
PepsiCo, Inc.
 
Again, Hugh, adding to your comment, in North America, if you take the 
biggest retailers, they do top
-
to
-
top meetings and a joint business plan 
session, maybe with three companies. An
d PepsiCo is a company that is a 
must do a top
-
to
-
top with because we are such a big part of the store, such 
a big part of the growth. And most large retailers will say, if PepsiCo doesn't 
grow, we can't grow because it's such a big part of the high veloci
ty 
categories.
 
So our joint business plan, top
-
to
-
top meetings, may be one of the few 
where the senior
-
most leaders of the big retailers attend these meetings. 
Second, I go over to Europe, and individually, our businesses may be 37th 
or 50th in importance 
to a retailer. But together, we are in the top 10, but 
not just in the top 10, we are the fastest growing. And very often, we end up 
with top
-
to
-
top meetings with European retailers, and I attend many of 
them. And the reason that they ask for the top
-
to
-
to
p is because together, 
we drive a lot of the sales growth of the retailer, and we are high
-
velocity 
categories and bring the traffic in. And we are very innovative across both 
categories.
 
So I think that what we are looking at right now is a short
-
term per
formance 
issue with North American Beverages. We know exactly what needs to get 
done and we are off doing it. And we have come off three, four years of 
terrific performance. So we've got three quarters of performance miss and 
we are going to fix it, period

RBC Capital Markets LLC
 
Yeah, good morning, everyone. Hi, good morning, Indra. I guess a lot of 
your commentary on the Beverag
e business has been around just stepping 
up marketing. But we haven't really talked about much on execution. And 
I'm just wondering, because if you're in the marketplace and you look at a 
refranchised Coke territory versus a Pepsi territory, you can see a 
very stark 
difference in terms of pre and post a refranchising for Coke. And so I'm just 
wondering. How can you compete in that type of situation where you have 
these independent franchisees just spending a lot more of their own capital 
in improving execut
ion at retail versus a company
-
owned bottling operation? 
So I just was hoping you can give me some context around that as we think 
about some of the options you might have in the future.
 
Indra K. Nooyi 
-
 
PepsiCo, Inc.
 
You're right, Nik. You know what? And this is just our observation, because 
we've studied all these in great detail. In the first couple of years of 
refranchising, when the parent company gives you a bit of a break, you're 
spending the parent company's mon
ey. After the first 18 months, it's your 
money that you have to spend. And right now, those independent bottlers 
are operating on very, very low margins. So the real challenge is going to be 
after the first 18 months after refranchising, are they going to 
be spending 
their own money off of lower margins already to do what they've been doing 
in the first 18 months post
-
refranchising where they got some breaks from 
the parent company.
 
I don't know. The jury is out. All that I tell you is, the evidence in a co
uple of 
cases where we've seen the first 12 months pass after refranchising, we are 
already seeing execution drop off significantly. Again, I'm not passing any 
judgment, I'm just giving you an observation. Believe me, what we are 
doing is studying their mo
del in great detail. And if we believe their model 
makes sense, and if we believe that it's a model that can be executed 
without having to buy back the bottlers again in a few years down the road, 
the advantage is we can follow it easily. We are in studyin
g mode at this 
point, along with all other options.

we're seeing pretty consistent positive 
pricing across all of the channels. So nothing that you see in the IRI or 
Nielsen data is different than what we're seeing overall. Second, as regards 
the year, yeah, we absolutely expect pricing that's consistent w
ith what 
we've seen in the past couple of years. The business pricing performance 
has been kind of in the 1% to 2% range; price/mix, it's typically been 
around 2%. I think that's probably a reasonable assumption for us. Again, 
all subject to what happens i

Stephen Robert Powers

Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
 
Good 
mornings, Indra. Thank you. Building further on the discussion of 
snacks and beverages belonging together, as you think about the path to 
improvement in NAB, I'm just wondering what the role, the relationship with 
Frito
-
Lay is expected to play in that impr
ovement. Because as I listened 
earlier to the plans for NAB improvement, there definitely seem to be many 
NAB
-
specific initiatives underway. But in the context of a broader better 
together Power of One strategy, I guess I continue to be somewhat 
surprised 
there aren't more joint snacks and beverages efforts being 
prioritized, such that Frito's enduring strength can theoretically lift 
Beverages. Is that just a misconception on my part, that there aren't more 
or there isn't more explicit cooperation between t
he two businesses or is 
there evidence that joint beverages versus snacks execution still remains 
elusive? Thanks.
 
Indra K. Nooyi 
-
 
PepsiCo, Inc.
 
Oh, great question, Steve. I'd say that there's stuff that happens together 
behind the scenes and stuff that h
appens that's visible to all the consumers. 
For the big holidays, you do see joint promotions. The idea of Power of One 
is not to force joint activity, even if it doesn't (51:58) make sense, because, 
sometimes, just based on the marketing calendar with var
ious retailers, Frito 
and Pepsi may be on deal at different times. So we have to be very, very 
careful that we don't force deal activity when it doesn't make sense. But 
Super Bowl was an example where the two came together in a significant 
way.
 
But let me 
speak behind the scenes. We talked about the joint business 
planning. We talked about technology transfer. Frito
-
Lay had GES. NAB had 
GeoBox. (52:26) They're all the same technology. So we negotiate with 
suppliers in one place. We have the same chassis for
 
both Beverages and 
Frito
-
Lay. The go
-
to
-
market system shares all the best practices between 
the two entities.
 
When we think about customer management, customer databases, how you 
think about managing the whole customer relationship, we have Power of 
One c
ustomer teams. Our Walmart team is one team. And so behind the 
scenes, in dealing with the customers, we are one company. From a 
execution and a shelf perspective, we do displays and joint activity when it 
makes sense. Foodservice, we go together as much a
s possible. We do have 
joint programs between beverages and snacks. That gives us a much better 
seat at the table for many foodservice negotiations.
 
Then our Hello Goodness vending machine, which we're now rolling out 
pretty fast, that's got both beverage 
and snack better
-
for
-
you, good
-
for
-
you 
options in the machine. And that's what's allowing us to win university 
accounts because they love the fact that we're putting in good
-
for
-
you, 
better
-
for
-
you products in machines. And there's both snacks and 
beverage
s, and we take care of fulfilling it.
 
And so I think there's lots going on behind the scenes. Your question sounds 
like music to my ears because I'd like to do more and more and more. But 
you've got to be a little bit careful that you don't do Power of One
 
for the 
sake of Power of One. You do it because it makes sense, in terms of driving 
sales or lowering costs.
 
Then talent, one thing I shouldn't forget. The great thing with NAB is, 
because it's so competitive, if you take a Frito
-
Lay person, put them in N
orth 
American Beverages and send them back to Frito
-
Lay, they're much better 
executives because they now really learned what it is to be in a dogfight. 
And so from a talent development, we actually like NAB as a wonderful 
talent development area where you 
really earn your stripes for playing in a 
highly competitive sort of not just large competitors, but a whole bunch of 
small competitors, and how you navigate that whole minefield.

there a timeline here that will govern the process? In other words, will 
investors know next quarter, by year
-
end, et cetera? So if you could just 
build on that, I thin
k that would be helpful for people.
 
The broader question I have, though, is on the Gatorade business and your 
view for the sports drink category. Trends have slowed there, seemingly on 
health and wellness concerns. Gatorade's lost some market share, despit
e 
higher levels of investment. Can you discuss, Indra, your outlook for the 
Gatorade business now, how that possibly may have changed over the past 
year or two, and your level of confidence that new product innovation can 
improve your trends? Thank you.

The first question 

 
and, Hugh, I'll make some comments. If you want to 
add something, please do. Look, looking at the best way to operate North 
American Beverages is not something new. We've been talking about it for 
the last 
two years on the call. So we always look at it and say, hey, what's 
the best way to create value. And that's something we're maniacally focused 
on. And we've studied other companies' activities. We've looked at creative 
options on our side.
 
But, again, we 
have to make sure whatever we do does not take us back to 
the old system of having problems between the bottling company and the 
concentrate company, because this is a big, attractive category. And so 
there is no timeframe, Kevin. When we get to a place wh
ere we think it 
makes sense to do something, we'll share it with you. But at this point, 
we're not going to give you any date because we don't know. We haven't 
come up with the solutions yet. We're still studying.
 
In terms of Gatorade, the business is stil
l very, very strong. This is like the 
ready
-
to
-
drink coffee business. When some new competitor comes in and 
decides to drop the pricing substantially and take some share from 
distribution, the leader, especially the leader like Gatorade, has to be very 
jud
icious in not trying to compete on pricing. And so what happens is, we 
allow some distribution build to happen. Then we watch to see what happens 
to velocities of that product. And right now, what we are seeing is, there is 
some competition in sports drink
s.
 
But after the first distribution build, velocities are dropping off. And if some 
of these companies are actually preparing for sale, you do see them taking 
on some actions that are not sustainable in the long term. In those cases, 
Gatorade just has to b
e very responsible and very careful in its response. 
It's got to be surgical, and that's what we are doing. We are watching 
Gatorade shares like a hawk. And whenever we have a competitor that's 
trying to build distribution through pricing, there's a point 
or two that we 
might lose, but we always gain it back. It's still the strongest franchise in 
sports nutrition, bar none.

Good morning. A quick question for you, I mean, as the retail environment 
changes, consumer evolve, is there greater room for collaboration on 
distribution, both from an efficiency standpoint and potential environmental 
ben
efits? I'm thinking specifically within the U.S. or North America? Thanks.

Yeah, Brett, this is Hugh. I think there is always opportunities to do that 
within the boundaries of 
competitiveness. So if nothing else, hopefully, this 
management team has convinced you that we're always looking for avenues 
for growth that provides good returns. And to the degree that those 
opportunities present themself or to the degree that we're able
 
to turn over 
rocks and ferret them out, rest assured, we'll take advantage of them as 
quickly as we can.

7/25/13,Pepsi,"Good morning and welcome to PepsiCo's Second Quarter 2014 Earnings 

will be archived at www.pepsico.com. It is now my pleasure to introduce Mr. 
Jamie Caulfield, Senior Vice 
President of Investor Relations. Mr. Caulfield, 
you may begin.
 
Jamie Caulfield
 
Thank you, operator. With me today are Indra Nooyi, PepsiCo's Chairman 
and CEO; and Hugh Johnston, PepsiCo's CFO. We'll lead off today's call with 
a review of our second 
quarter 2014 performance and outlook, and then 
we'll move on to Q&A.
 
We have kept our comments brief this morning and intend to conclude the 
call by 08:45, to be respectful of your time during a busy earnings week, 

f your questions as we can. Before 
we begin, please take note of our cautionary statement.
 
This conference call includes forward
-
looking statements, including 
statements regarding 2014 guidance and our long
-
term targets based on 
currently available informa
tion. Forward
-
looking statements inherently 
involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ 
materially from those predicted in such forward
-
looking statements. 
Statements made on this conference call should be considered toget
her with 
cautionary statements and other information contained in today's earnings 
release and in our most recent periodic reports filed with the SEC.
 
Unless otherwise indicated all references to EPS and operating profit growth 
are on a core basis. In addi

As we discuss today's results, please keep in mind th
at our second quarter 
comprises the 12 weeks ended June 14, for our North American operations 
in the months of March, April and May for most of our operations outside of 
North America. As we have mentioned in our earnings release this morning, 
core operati
ng profit growth rates are impacted by lapping a $137 million 
gain from the re
-
franchising of our Vietnam beverage operations in the 
second quarter of 2013, partially offset by incremental investments of $46 
million made in the prior year quarter
 
Now, it's
 
my pleasure to introduce Indra Nooyi.
 
Indra Nooyi
 
Thank you, Jamie, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us 
this morning. We are pleased with our second quarter and our first half 
results. Despite operating and what continues to be a challeng
ing and 
volatile macro environment, we have been consistently meeting or 
exceeding our financial goals over the last two and half years. I believe our 
results reflect the hard work we have done over the last several years to 
position our business for susta
inable success; specifically our investments to 
strengthen our brands, innovate more effectively, expand our geographic 
footprint with strategic acquisitions, drive better execution, and operate 
more efficiently by leveraging our global scale and complemen
tary product 
portfolio.
 
Today, these actions and investments are producing consistent tangible 
results. Based on the strength of our first half results, in our outlook for the 
remainder of the year, we are increasing our full year core constant currency 
20
14 EPS growth outlook to 8%.
 
So let me share with you some of the performance highlights of the second 
quarter. Organic revenue grew approximately 4%, with global snacks up 5% 
and global beverages up 2%. We managed the business responsibly 
achieving three 
points of effective net pricing to effective price packed 
revenue management. Each of our four business units delivered organic 
revenue growth led by high single
-
digit growth in EMEA and mid
-
single digit 
growth in Europe and PepsiCo Americas Foods.
 
Develop
ing and emerging markets posted solid 8% organic revenue growth 
led by low double
-
digit growth in China, high single
-
digit growth in Brazil 
and mid single
-
digit growth in Russia. Innovation continue to play an 
important role in our topline growth and accou
nted for 9% of our net 
revenue.
 
Core gross margins improved by 60 basis points. Excluding the Vietnam 
gain, that is incremental investment from the second quarter of 2013, our 
core constant currency operating profit rose 6%, core operating margin 
improved 
by 65 basis points and core constant currency EPS grew 9%. On a 
rolling four
-
quarter basis, our core net ROIC improved by 30 basis points 
and now stands at 16.5%. In the first half of 2014, we returned $4 billion to 
shareholders in the form of dividends an
d share repurchases, a 46% 
increase versus last year. As we previously announced, we expect to return 
$8.7 billion to shareholders in 2014 in the form of dividends and share 
repurchases, a 35% increase over our 2013 cash return to shareholders.
 
Importantly
, we achieved our targeted productivity savings in the quarter 
and remain on track to achieve our full
-
year target of $1 billion, which 
represents approximately 3.5% of our operating cost base excluding 
commodities and A&M expense.
 
This year we successfull
y complete the three
-
year $3 billion productivity 
program we launched in 2012 and we are now focused on our next 

-
year 5 billion productivity programs for 2019 announced 
earlier this year which is really centered on four key areas.
 
First, 
embedding more automation in our operations replace labor with 
capital. Second, expanding shared services, including global financial shared 
services for the handling of routine back office transaction processing. Third, 
restructuring, manufacturing to opt
imize our global manufacturing footprint. 
And fourth, restructuring our go
-
to
-
market systems to optimize our 
distribution network.
 
As a result of these initiatives, we expect to see continued improvement in 
net revenue and core earnings before interest and
 
tax as per employee, as 
well as margin expansion and returns on invested capital.
 
So with all this as a backdrop, let's take a look at how the business has 
performed, starting in North American. The North American consumer 
picture continues to be weak wit
h retail sales among the top, the food and 
beverage manufactures roughly flat in the quarter, a slight deceleration from 
the first quarter.
 
In this challenging environment, PepsiCo grew sales at retail across each of 
its North American snacks and beverage 
businesses and was a largest 
contributed to retail sales growth among the top 30 manufactures.
 
Frito
-
Lay North America performed well with organic growth of 2% and core 
constant currency operating profit growth of 5%. Net price utilization was 
somewhat mut
ual in the quarter, as we benefitted from commodity cost 
deflation.
 
Core operating margins expanded 80 basis points despite an increase in 
advertising and marketing and affected savings from our productivity efforts. 
Our top
-
line growth is driven by streng
th across most of our largest 
trademarks, with Lays, Doritos and Cheetos each posting revenue growth in 
the low to high single digits.
 
Our broader macro
-
snack offering were also doing well with strong 
performance in shelf stable dips, crackers, our line of
 
Smartfood snack and 
the Sabra line of refrigerated hummus, dips and spread. As we look to the 
second half, we are encouraged by the strength of our innovation and 
consumer engagement program leveraging some of our biggest brands.
 
In April, we launched Dor
itos Jack mystery flavors with nationwide 
distribution. Consumers voted for their favorite mystery flavor online. Earlier 
this month, we revealed the three flavors, Spicy Street Taco, Chocolate 
Chipotle Bacon and Caribbean Citrus Jerk. Spicy Street Taco wa
s a consumer 
voted favorite and we launched it this fall as a permanent Jack flavor.
 


nearly four times a submissi

 
On July 17, we announced the four finalist among consumer submitted 
flavors, Cappuccino, Cheddar Bacon Mac & Cheese, Mango Salsa and Wasabi 
Ginger. And these products are now hitting store shelves. Our consumers 
wi


innovation.
 
On July 2, we launched Doritos Loaded exclusively at more than 5500, 7
-
Eleven stores nationwi
de. Doritos Loaded is a delicious hot snack served with 
melted Nacho Cheese and encrusted with Doritos. Our launch of loaded 
created a great deal of tradition and social media buzz generating more than 
750 million impressions to
-
date. And it has also featu
red on Jimmy Kimmel 
live.
 
Each of these programs has a strong demonstration of how we are 
leveraging our Culinary center to create unique great tasting new products 
and driving excitement in the vendors to create a consumer engagement.
 
Turning now to 
Quaker Foods North America, despite continued challenges 
across most central store food categories, we gained value share at retail in 

-
to
-
eat cereals and snack 
bars both in the quarter and year
-
to
-
date. C
ore constant currency operating 
profit growth rose 5% of the quarter with operating profit margins 
expanding 155 basis points.
 
We are pleased with the performance of our recent innovation in 2014. We 
launched Quaker Express Cups which provides Quaker Insta
nt Oatmeal in 
the convenient on
-
the
-
go cup. We also introduced the first of its kind hot 
cereal; Quaker Warm & Crunchy Granola which delivers both the wholesale 
goodness of Quaker Oatmeal and the satisfying crunch of market grain 
granola.
 
And finally, we a
re continuing to build in the success of our Real Medleys 
platform this time in a ready to eat cereal form. In North American 

the second quarter and in the first half, we gained U.S. L
RB value share and 
achieved positive net price realization at retail.
 
Notably, PepsiCo has held or gained relative U.S. LRB value share in major 
channel versus our closest competitor in each of the last five quarter. In the 
quarter, we also achieved greate
r net price realization retail and our primary 
competitor and the category overall.
 
Within the LRB category, we held or gained value share across a number of 
important sub
-
categories including CSDs, sports drinks, ready to drink tea 
and chilled juice and w
e grew retail sales in major channels in the U.S. for 
regular CSDs led by trademark Mountain Dew just up mid
-
single digits and 
with our non
-
carb portfolio for Gatorade, Lipton Tea, Starbucks Coffee and 
Naked Juice.
 
In the quarter, PAB grew both organic rev
enue in core constant currency 
operating profit with core operating profit margin expanding by 25 basis 

innovation front. In the second quarter, we introduced PEPSI SPIRE, our 
state
-
of
-
the
-
a
rt beverage dispensers which allows consumers to create more 
than 1,000 customized beverages with a touch of screen while providing our 
food service partners flexible, cost effective, reliable equipment that best fits 
their needs.
 
PEPSI SPIRE is currently 
available in select U.S. locations and will continue 
to roll out for the rest of the year. On May 5, we also brought Mountain Dew 
Baja Blast to the shelves for a limited time, leveraging on the success of the 
fountain brand ahead of Taco Bell. Mountain Dew
 
Baja Blast is a second 
largest and fastest growing fountain beverage sold at Taco Bell and may now 
expand the reach of the fan favorite brand.
 
And concurrent with the launch of the Doritos Loaded, we introduced Solar 
Flare, our tropical punch take on Moun
tain Dew exclusively at 7
-
Eleven. We 
are leveraging of the high purchase coincidence of Dew and Doritos with 
joint advertising, point
-
of
-
sale communication and promotion. And we are 
pleased with the performance of our expanded package offerings with strong
 
double
-
digit growth in mini cans as well as 12 ounce glass bottle from the 
second quarter.
 
These new packages have enabled us to realize new price packed revenue 

another American 
story. Western Europe performed well with organic 
revenue 3% in the second quarter in a difficult retail and competitive 
environment.
 
Turning now to developing and emerging markets. In Mexico, we continue to 
navigate for the new the new taxes on certain fo
ods and beverages. And as 
a reminder, we've taken pricing in snacks and our bottler has taken pricing 
in beverages to pass the taxes through to the consumer.
 
In the quarter, in Mexico, our volume decline in snacks moderated 
sequentially while beverage volu
me returned to growth as consumers began 
to adjust to the higher prices and our systems drove beverage share gains 

price increase throughout the year and expect some quarterly volati
lity to 
continue, our results so far are in line with our expectations.
 
In Venezuela, we are managing through high inflation, political unrest, 
supply chain disruptions and continued uncertainty regarding the applicable 
exchange rate. Despite all the chall
enges, our businesses in Venezuela 
performed very well in the quarter with revenue up strong double
-
digits 
across both snacks and beverages.
 
Brazil delivered high single
-
digit organic revenue growth, led by double
-
digit 
organic revenue growth in beverages 
and high
-
single
-
digit organic revenue 
growth in snacks. We did a particularly effective job leveraging our global 
soccer properties in this market during the time when soccer was very much 
top of mind. Our integrated campaign featured an impressive roster 
of the 

digital, out
-
of
-
home, in
-
store and point
-
of
-
sale marketing.
 
In Russia, organic revenue rose mid
-
single digits with double
-
digit growth in 
snacks and low
-
single digit growt
h in beverages. And we saw strong organic 
revenue growth in a number of other East European markets, including high 
single
-
digit growth in Turkey and low double
-
digit growth in Poland.
 
Moving across EMEA. Organic revenue growth was led by Thailand, which 
p
ronged double
-
digit organic revenue growth, followed by Egypt and the 
Philippines, which also grew double
-
digits.
 
China organic revenue grew low double
-
digits driven by strong growth in our 
snacks business. The productivity restructuring program initiated 
by our 
bottling partner in the first quarter has achieved solid progress. Our partner 
has taken a well
-
planned deliberate approach to execute the program to 
ensure that our entire system is positioned to capture its full long
-
term 
efficiency and effectiven
ess benefits.
 
We remain committed to the developing and emerging markets as we 
believe they have a long runway for growth driven by increasing demand for 
our convenient on trend affordable products supported by rapidly growing 
middle class.
 
We believe we a
re well positioned to capitalize on these opportunities. So to 
conclude, we are off to a terrific start in 2014 with the pieces of our 
complementary portfolio working together to generate healthy top line and 
bottom line performance as we also step up the 
terms on investments and 
cash returns to shareholders.
 
Clearly, there are number of challenges around the globe but the shape and 
resilience of our portfolio combined with strong execution and aggressive 
productivity should enable us to navigate successful
ly to the current 
environment. Let me now turn the call over to Hugh. Hugh?

Thank you, Indra and good morning everyone. Let me spend a few minutes 
discussing the quarter and our upwardly revised core constant currency 
earnings per share outlo
ok for 2014. First for Q2, organic revenue grew 
3.6%. On a reported basis, net revenue was up 0.5 point versus a year ago, 
reflecting 3 points of unfavorable foreign exchange translation and a slight 
negative structural impact primarily from the refranchis
ing of our Vietnam 
bottling operation. Commodity cost had low single
-
digit inflation. Our core 
gross margins improved about 60 basis points and core operating margins 
rose 10 basis points.
 
Core operating margin rose 65 basis points when excluding the gain 
from 
refranchising Vietnam net of incremental investments from last year. Core 
constant currency operating profit grew 3% and approximately 6% excluding 
the Vietnam gain and investments from last year. Our quarter effective tax 
rate was 26.3, 2 percentage 
points above Q2 2013.
 
Our fully diluted share count declined 2%, reflecting the benefits of our 
ongoing share repurchase program. And core constant currency EPS grew 
3% and 9% when excluding the Vietnam gain and investments from last 
year. And we returned 
$4 billion to shareholders in the first half in the form 
of dividends and share repurchases which was 46% above year ago levels 
and reflective of our commitment to return cash for shareholders.
 
Now turning to guidance. As Indra mentioned, based on the stre
ngth of our 

full year core constant currency EPS growth target to 8%, up from 7% 
previously. Our other targets remain unchanged. We expect mid single

Below the division operating profit line, we expect corporate cost efficiency 
driven by our productivity initiatives, a core effective tax rate of 
approximately 
25% and a reduced share count from our share repurchase 
program.
 
Foreign exchange is expected to negatively impact net revenue by 3 
percentage points and core earnings per share by 4 percentage points for 
the full year 2014, based on current market consens
us rates. Taking our 
2013 core EPS of $4.37 and applying our guidance implies 2014 core EPS of 
approximately $4.54.
 
As many of you know, the foreign exchange picture in Venezuela is very 
dynamic at the moment with three different exchange rates and the 
pos
sibility for a converged mechanism. Our second quarter results were 
translated to U.S. dollars at VEB6.3 to the U.S. dollar. Our current FX 
forecast, which is based on current market consensus rates, assumes a 
blended rate of approximately VEB9 to the U.S.
 
dollar for the balance of the 
year.
 

expect foreign exchange translation to have an approximate 2 point 
unfavorable impact on both third quarter revenue and third quarter EPS 
bas
ed on current market consensus rates. We do expect to ramp up 
advertising and marketing expense in the quarter and below the division 
operating profit line, net interest expense is expected to increase in the third 
quarter versus last year, primarily refle
cting higher debt balances and higher 
rates.
 
From a cash flow perspective, we continue to expect full
-
year free cash flow 
excluding certain items of more than $7 billion. We will continue to drive 
cash flow through efficient working capital 
management and continued tight 
controls over capital spending. Net capital spending should approximate $3 
billion, which is well within our long
-
term target of less than or equal to 5% 
of net revenue. We expect to return approximately $8.7 billion to 
share
holders in 2014, a 35% increase over 2013 through a combination of 
$3.7 billion in dividends and $5 billion in share repurchases.
 

outlook for the full
-
year 2014 to 8% from 7%. We expect
 
to drive improved 
full
-
year margins and net ROIC and discipline capital allocation and returning 
cash to our shareholders, remain top priorities for the company.

Wanted to follow up on the Frito results. From an organic revenue standpoint 
it is the weakest quarter you guys have put up in a while. You had some 
promotional activity o
r give us the flavor in the year
-
ago period. So I guess 
can you talk a little bit about what you are seeing in the general 
environment out there? How much the weakness for the quarter was what 
you saw generally in FDM in Q2? And then as we look to the back
 
half back 
half of the year, and you talked about maybe a little bit more new product 
activity, etc., what is the confidence level in terms of Frito volumes and/or 
organic revenue improving in the back half of the year? And as part of that, 
is the promotio
nal environment getting any worse given some of the 
weakness in volumes we have seen across the food industry? Thanks.
 
Indra Nooyi
 
Thank you, John and thank you for your question. We are not particularly 
considered about the Frito
-
Lay performance. Clearly 
the North American 
retail environment saw an abrupt slowdown in period five and we were very 
careful to manage this business responsibly and not hit the promotional 
lever in order to just drive revenue or volume growth. We also delayed one 
marketing activi

in performance. So at this point, based on all the trends we are seeing, the 
strength of the marketing calendar in the second half, our A&M spending 

ductivity programs, we feel 
pretty good about Frito

Lay.

As we looked at the gross margins for the quarter, can you just parse out for 
u
s how much benefit you have gotten from gross margins from just pure 
pricing? And how much of it was maybe just from commodity cost inflation 
coming down? Just trying to get I guess an understanding as we are pacing 
forward if there is more momentum here o
n gross margins.
 
Hugh Johnston
 
Yes, good morning Bryan. Obviously it was a combination of a couple of 
things, Bryan. Number one, the commodity inflation environment right now 
is relatively muted. It was in line with our expectations because of the 
previous
ly discussed forward buying program that we have for commodities, 

comfortable with what our outlook is on the front.
 
Number two, without that particularly in more inflationary countri
es we are 
getting some pricing and we expect to continue to do that. In businesses 


forced to do that.

I wanted to ask a little bit about the sustainability
 
of these clearly good 
results that we have seen so far. And in particular, when you look at each of 
the segments, Europe is the only segment out of the six where you call out 
advertising and marketing being up. In fact a couple times you see lapping 
of in
cremental investments. So this is now the second quarter in a row 
where we see kind of a similar narrative. So I'm trying to get a sense from 
you guys of what is overall happening to advertising and marketing in the 
first half of the year. Because it seems
 
like it is going down as a percent of 
sales. And do you view that as sustainable going forward or do you expect 
there to be a ramp up on advertising? And as you talk about that, which is 
the core question on sustainability, if you could throw in a comment
 
about 
Russia. I think there are some concerns about that, we have heard that from 
some other companies for sure in your sector and the sustainability there, as 
well as your Latin America growth being driven by Venezuela and Argentina 
where there is a ques
tion mark. But advertising was the main question and 
the other two add
-
ons if you could please.
 
Indra Nooyi
 
So Ali, it is a big question. One of the things you said, and we have been 
very
-

et 
out as an A&M goal for the year, we will not cut it. We will spend it based on 


the big A&M step up in 201
2, we made a commitment to us, also then to you 
that A&M is something that we will hold as a percentage of sales. And we are 
going to keep that number through the year. So you should feel very
-
very 
comfortable that across the company, the number is going t
o remain at 
5.9%. I thought that I had to say that number. It will rise with sales and it 

 

Russia, clearly there are some geo
political issues. Our businesses is doing 
just fine at this moment, but you know we are basic food and beverage and 
the Russian consumers still need to eat and drink. And so, except for the FX

want to comment about Venezuela.

environment. The good news from our perspective is that we do have strong 
market positions in the snack
-
food business
 
and our beverage business is 
doing actually quite well down there right now. As a result we are but able to 

and as a result we feel compatible with the trajectory at the Latin Am
erican 
business. So to tie all of that together, Ali, your question around the 
sustainability of the results, obviously we contemplate the volatile realm that 

made commitments around 

And as a result we feel comfortable raising the guidance in spite of all those

Can you guys just take a stab at why you think the categories, especially in 
the US, have been so weak recently, and then maybe what you think it is 
going to take to kind of get them accelerating aga
in? Because obviously, 
they are trending way below trend.
 
Indra Nooyi
 
Well, I think overall food and beverage has decelerated from years ago. 

produce, fresh grocery products, more
 
making your food as home as 
suppose to buying package food and beverages. And I think people have 
also been eating out, so food away from home is doing just a little bit. And I 

ou
r innovation, strength of the complementarity of the portfolio and that fact 
that we have very popular distribution systems into the retail stores, this 
launch is enabling us to be the largest contributor to growth among the 30 
largest manufactures in the 
U.S. retail environment. So I think as long as we 
keep innovating and leveraging our distribution system and really helping 
the retailers offset some of their labor cost through our DLT systems in high 
velocity category, we should be able to drive growth. 
And then on the food 
service side, they are now with the Culinary centers both in beverages and 
snacks and all the work we are doing on complementary offerings between 
snacks and beverages has been to drive a lot of excitement in food services, 
whether it 
be Buffalo Wild Wings or 7
-
Eleven, food service or Taco Bell. I 
think more and more food services customers are coming to us and saying, 

matter if somebody comes into buy a product
 
from the sea store and they 
also be attracted to stop by the food service side and pick up something for 

relatively low growth North American retail environment and positioning 
our

really our strategy. And I think our portfolio as a fact that we have high 
velocity categories is making us a very valuable partner to retailers all 
across the country.

Clearly at the corporate level you realized significant pricing in Q2, it drove 
mostly organic sales growth. So I just wondering how comfortable you are 
goi
ng forward that that strong pricing can continue given the moderate 
commodity environment as well as the challenged consumer. And then 
secondly, Hugh, we have really started to see a turn in the operating margin 
performance for the Company the last couple 
of quarters here, if one strips 
out the Vietnam gain. So I was hoping you could also give us an update on 
the key drivers behind that year
-
to
-
date performance and sustainability 
going forward as we look to the back half.
 
Indra Nooyi
 
Yes. In terms of pricin


innovation helps us drive pricing, in countries where we believe that inflation 
is high we take pricing to cover the inflation
 
to the extent we can. We do a 
lot of revenue management in order to get pricing. So pricing is something 
we realized through surgical management of innovation, in market pricing, 
revenue management and very careful execution, based on the different 
channe
ls. And the balance of the year, we feel comfortable that we can 
sustain pricing and our goal is to focus on value share always, because I 
think in categories that are slowing down in particular, focused just on 
volume is an unhealthy trend. So we are very
, very careful to make sure 
that we carefully balance pricing with volume growth and not try to go for 

growth and get good pricing realization.
 
Let me turn to Hugh to talk about the
 
operating margin.
 
Hugh Johnston
 
Sure Dara, obviously we saw very good operating margin accretion in Q1 
and then Q2 the number was 65 basis point, I think you will continue to see 
good operating and more improvement year
-
over
-
year as we progress 
through th


going to continue to see good operating margin improvement. And the big 
driver behind that of course is the 

put out there, that productivity program directly attacks the $28 billion

productivity program, you are seeing and in fact flow through the bottom

I guess maybe on the margins a little bit more. Overseas and really outside 
of the Americas y
ou have made good progress on the profit growth and 
margin expansion this year in Europe especially. A bit less so though in 
EMEA, even adjusting for that Vietnam gain. Can you talk about the puts and 
takes there in each region perhaps, if you could, diffe
rentiating between 
progress in snacks versus beverages in each region? And maybe as you do, 
given that we have seen you re
-
franchise beverage businesses in China, 
Mexico and Vietnam recently, what is the likelihood that you might pursue 
similar efforts in 
other geographies whether Western Europe, Russia or India 
where you still hold the bottlers? Thanks.

takes by region, but broadly speaking Europe has been relatively stabl
e. 
Even those retail environment is difficult, geo

year

over

saw improving margin trends. We
 
have been one of the strong performers 
from a top line basis in Europe and again the complementarity of our 
categories is really helping drive traffic and top line growth at many 
retailers. I just had a series of talks with many European retailers and I 
m

many of those retailers by a significant factor. So I feel pretty good about 
the European trends.
 
In the case of EMEA, parts of EMEA that are going to significant geopolitical 
issues. T
he Middle
-

issue in Saudi Arabia.
 


the facts that as we me


rush it, we want to make sure we do it responsibly, we want to make sure 
we do it right because at the end of the day we are try
ing to build a very 
efficient and effective system. And we are making sure that we work 
constructively with our bottling partner Tingyi to end up with a system that 
really plays at its strength which is in almost 1.6 times the size of the next 
competitor. 

 
In terms of refranchising our business, where we think it makes sense, 
where we think our partner is stronger and where we think we have a 
partner, where we refranchise the business to ensure 
the continued health of 
the business, we will look at it. But if we believe that refranchising could 
jeopardize the business, we will not refranchise it. So we look at it on a 
case
-
by
-
case basis. In Vietnam, you saw that we did refranchise the 
business; in
 
Mexico, where the business is performing very well. I mean 
countries where it makes sense, we do it. So stay tuned as we find 
interesting opportunities, we will be back to talk to you.

So I just wanted to go back to maybe North America beverages and talk 
about the pricing environment. Clearly I think some of the industry 
participants have become a little bit more rational in terms of the pricing 
strate
gy. We are going to be

start to lap the pretty heavy promotional 
period you saw a year ago around Labor Day. So just your thoughts on the 
competitive environment and the pricing outlook in North America CSD. And 
then secondarily, just thinking about the
 
diet trends, and we are lapping a 
big decline that you started to see in a year ago period. So what are you 
seeing just in terms of now more consumer perception around the diet 
portfolio and your efforts to perhaps address that issue?

Pricing environment is just fine. I think that we have rational pricing and

Indra, just wanted to quickly talk ab
out Mexico, especially the beverage 
performance, pretty encouraging. Is that in
-
line with expectations that you 
will see year
-
over
-
year growth so soon after the higher tax implementation 
there? And also, does this reduce the threat of similar taxation effo
rts in the 
US or what you will model if some similar tax is adopted here?
 
Indra Nooyi
 
On the Mexico beverage performance I think when we refranchised our 
business to the combination of Polar and GEUSA and created GEPP that 
company is performing very well. 
In market execution is excellent and they 
are doing a very good job. So I think the reason we are growing the 
business is because of superior execution. In the case of taxes in North 
America, the good news Amit is we have a total portfolio of carbonated, n
on
-
carbonated, full sugar, low sugar, all kinds of products. So from a consumer 
perspective if they shift from one category to another, there is always a 
PepsiCo product they can have for any need state, for any sugar level, for 
any taste, for any flavor.
 
So I think that, that is the advantage of the PepsiCo portfolio. And 
incidentally, they can also pair it with a great snack. So we feel good about 
the complementarity of the portfolio, the breadth of the portfolio in North 
America and our goal is to make s
ure there are no discriminatory taxes but 
to work constructively with state governments and other organizations to 
make sure of whatever is done, is done responsibly.

Obviously you are not going to change the Company's view on a breakup in 
this call, but there are two data items I wanted to ask you about. One is on 
the corporate unallocated and how it is built up. Do you intend to share that 
bui
ld up? And then the second one is on the subject of dis
-
synergies, it's 
been a couple years now since you put a number out there, you put the 
$800 million to $1 billion number out there talking about separation related 
dis
-
synergies. Is that still in numbe
r you abide by? And do you have any 
plans, if it is a number you abide by, to share that build up?
 
Indra Nooyi
 
Mark I was hoping you talked about the good quarter, but having said that, 
hoping unallocated we have given you the numbers, we have said that if
 
you 
look at the total corporate cost, about half of it is compliance cost which is 
about the lowest of any company. The other half is either the vision cost we 
carry at corporate because we want to manage the volatility; for example 
like pension costs or 
commodity mark
-
to
-
market. The others, you know 
smaller bucket which is centrally driven capability cost because we want to 
make sure that we protect those costs and build the capability. So the 
numbers we put out remain unchanged. In terms of this synergy,
 

reason for those numbers to change. I mean we spent an incredible amount 
of time checking the ties on this and this is the conservative estimate. And 
this company is engineered as one, and we feel very comfortable about the 
vigor with which we 
analyzed the proposals and we stand by our 800 million 
to a billion

dollar number. So thank you for the question.

Indra Nooyi
 
Thank you, Jamie and good morning everyone and thank you all for joining 
us. We will start off with an overview of second quarter performance and a 
discussion 
of each of the operating sectors in a little more detail and then 
Hugh will cover the full year outlook.
 
For the quarter, we delivered $16.1 billion of net revenue driven by 2.6% 
organic revenue growth and core earnings of $1.61 per share, a 7% increase 
on
 
a core constant currency basis. Overall, we are pleased with our 
operating and financial performance in the quarter especially given 
continued commodity inflation and other headwinds in the quarter such as 
the Brazil transportation strike. In the quarter,
 
organic revenue growth 
accelerated sequentially from the first quarter. The majority of our 
businesses performed very well, with particularly strong performances by 
Frito
-
Lay North America and each of the international sectors and NAB, 
North American Beve
rages posted another quarter of sequential 
improvement in both organic revenue and operating profit performance.
 
Frito
-
Lay North America delivered balanced volume growth and net price 
realization driven by great marketplace execution, innovation and creati
ve 

flavor and product variety in single
-
serve multi
-
packs, we launched a 20
-

Cheetos to Ruffles with an expanded mix 
of flavors and this clearly help 
drive 10% net revenue growth in our overall variety pack business. We 
launched Ruffles Mozzarella 'n Marinara, our latest bar food inspired flavor to 
meet the expectations of existing fans and capture the attention of new 
c
onsumers seeking a unique and fun flavor experience. And this contributed 
to Ruffles 10% net revenue growth in the quarter. And Doritos Blaze 
launched earlier this year with the most talked about Super Bowl ad 
continues to perform well above our initial ex
pectations and contributed to 
6% net revenue growth in trademark Doritos in Q2. So overall, we are 
feeling very good about Frito
-

momentum.
 
Turning to North American Beverages, the marketplace remains highly 
dynamic, but 
generally rational. With this as a backdrop, we are encouraged 
by the trending improvement in both net revenue and operating profit 
performance. After a slow start in the earlier part of the second quarter both 
for the category and North American Beverages
, we saw momentum 
improve and a return to net revenue growth in the back half of Q2. Within 
the business, trademark Pepsi continued to make progress towards more 
stable performance. As we mentioned last quarter, we have stepped up 
media support on trademar

As a result in the second quarter, we began to see improvement in a number 
of key brand health metrics that is leading to better net revenue 
performance as the year progresses. So, we intend to stay the course
 
increasing investment behind brand support in the second half of the year 
with the aim of driving further top line improvement. At the same time, we 
remain laser focused on higher growth categories with appropriate brand 
investment and robust innovation. 
For example, bubly, a cleverly marketed 
new entrant in the fast growing sparkling water segment launched earlier 
this year and it continues to perform exceedingly well.
 
Gatorade Zero, our latest hydration innovation with zero sugar and all the 
electrolytes
 
of Gatorade just launched and is off to a great start. More 
importantly, trends on overall Gatorade performance have also recently 
accelerated and we are excited by the return of Mountain Dew Baja Blast, 
our summer limited time offer that just hit the she
lves. So overall, we have 
seen sequential quarterly improvement at NAB and we expect to see 
continued acceleration in top line performance in the third quarter.
 
At Quaker Foods North America, our hot cereal business posted its fourth 
consecutive quarter of
 
market share gains and delivered mid single
-
digit 
retail sales growth supported by our new ad campaign highlighting the 
functional benefits of oatmeal. In addition, Quaker light snacks had double
-
digit retail sales growth in our Aunt Jemima pancake busine
ss, grew both 
retail sales and market share for the seventh consecutive quarter.
 
Turning now to our sectors outside of North America, we are pleased with 
more than 6% organic revenue growth we saw in our developing and 
emerging market as a group. Strong ma
rketplace execution combined with 
stable macro conditions have led to continued solid growth across many of 
our key international markets though growth was negatively impacted by the 
11
-
day transportation strike that broadly disrupted commerce in Brazil. 
W
ithin Latin America, organic revenue grew 3.5% driven by mid single
-
digit 
digit growth in Mexico and double
-
digit growth in Argentina and Colombia. 
We estimate the Brazil strike depressed overall net revenue growth for Latin 
America by approximately 2 perc
entage points.
 
In our Europe sub
-
Saharan Africa sector, Russia, Poland and South Africa 
each grew organic revenue high single
-
digits and Turkey had double
-
digit 
organic revenue growth. Even within the developed markets of Europe, we 
saw mid single
-
digit or
ganic revenue growth in the UK and high single
-
digit 
growth in France. And in AMENA, we had strong double
-
digit organic 
revenue growth in China and Egypt, high single
-
digit organic revenue growth 
in Pakistan and Australia, and solid mid single
-
digit organi
c revenue growth 
in India. This strong top line performance translated into impressive bottom 
line results with core constant currency operating profit up 12% in our 
international divisions as a group fueled by fundamental operating 
performance and the gai
n this year from the Thailand refranchising partially 
offset by lapping the gain from our sale of Britvic shares in 2017.
 
The international results are in part a reflection of our efforts to increasingly 
lift and shift successful initiatives from one marke
t to many and innovating 
on our big global brands in locally relevant ways. For instance, in Latin 
America, we are innovating with Quaker Super Foods, a new premium 
platform with differentiated ingredients such as oats with rye, amaranth, 
flaxseed and quin
oa. In ESSA, we have lifted and shifted Off the Eaten Path, 
a premium range of plant
-
based snacks from the U.S. to the United 
Kingdom. And in AMENA, we have taken our successful Sunbites platform 
from the U.S. to Australia by launching Sunbites Grain Waves
 
Plus with the 
goodness of Australian whole grain corn, wheat and oats for beetroot and 
sweet potato. At the same time, they have also launched in the U.S., Red 
Rock Deli, one of our most successful brands in Australia. Net, we are 
encouraged by the moment
um we are seeing across many of our key 
international markets. NAB is making steady improvement and Frito
-
Lay 
North America is performing well. Importantly, as we have managed the 
business for strong performance today, we are also taking steps to enable to
 
continue to perform well in the decades ahead. We are pleased to report that 
in the coming days we will publish our most recent sustainability report 
discussing our progress against and commitments to our sustainability goals.
 
We encourage you to read the
 

minutes this morning to provide you with the highlights. We are in millions 
of pantries and refrigerators worldwide. So we know we have a tremendous 
opportunity and responsibility to use our scale to make a pos
itive impact on 
the world. Our customers, employees and partners feel good knowing that 
there is a shared journey of sustainable transformation making our products 
more nutritious and more resource efficient, dialing up the taste while 
reducing our environ
mental footprint. Our investors can feel good knowing 
this makes us a stronger business over the long
-
term, that we can also do 
well by also doing good. 12 years ago, we embarked on a journey of 
PepsiCo, as we call, Performance with Purpose. Since then, mu
ch has 
changed at PepsiCo and around the world, but the underlying principles 
behind Performance with Purpose remain. Much of our early work on 
Performance with Purpose requires us to think differently about our business 
and make the kinds of long
-
term inv
estments from researching and 
developing new more nutritious products to finding ways to reduce water 
and energy use across plants and farms that will help us deliver on the 
vision of making our growth, our operations and our impact more 
sustainable. Susta
inability has been defined as meeting the needs of the 
present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their 
own needs. Over the last dozen years, we have tried to meet the needs of 
the present, while strengthening the ability of fut
ure generations to meet 
this integrating that aspiration into our goals for products, planet and 
people.
 
Let me briefly comment on each. When it comes to products, we have built 
on our legacy as the first company to voluntarily remove trans
-
fats from our 
s
nacks by reducing added sugars, sodium and saturated fat in many of our 
products launching a revolutionary nutrition
-
focused vending option, Hello 
Goodness and growing our portfolio of what we define as Good for You and 
Better for You options from about 38
% of revenue in 2006 to roughly 50% 
last year. We also teamed up with others in our industry to form The Healthy 
Weight Commitment Foundation removing 6.4 trillion calories from our food 
and beverage products surpassing our collective pledge by more than 4
00%. 
And through Food for Good, we have provided 18 million nutritious servings 
to low income U.S. families since 2009.
 
Regarding planet, we have raised the bar for what it means to be a 
responsible corporate water steward earning the prestigious Stockholm
 
Industry Water Award. We have invested more than $40 million since 2006 
to provide safe water access around the world benefiting nearly 16 million 

made our delivery fleet more energy e
fficient eliminating the need for over 1 
million gallons of diesel fuel since our electric vehicle initiative began in 
2010. The equivalent of keeping more than 2,000 passenger cars off the 
road for the year, while also making our beverage coolers and vend
ing 
machines 60% more energy
-

purchasers of recycled PET. In fact if more recycled PET were available we 
would buy it. We have also launched the first 100% compostable chip bag in 
test markets, while diverting
 
more and more of our waste from landfill, 
approximately 95% as of 2017. And for people, we have re
-
imagined what it 
means to support our associates from ushering onsite and near
-
site 

on
line course offerings to help associates upgrade their skills to navigate our 
rapidly changing world. We have also helped lift up the communities we 
serve playing a critical role in disaster relief efforts from Texas to Florida and 
Puerto Rico, Mexico to E
cuador and China to the Philippines.
 
While we still have work to do in certain areas, we are incredibly proud of 
the progress we have made. Our aspiration of being a good company, good 
ethically and good commercially continues to come to fruition using a 
b
roader, more lasting impact than we ever imagined and setting a standard 
that companies across our industry and beyond aspire to meet. Looking 
ahead, we will continue viewing our work through both the microscope and a 
telescope, focusing on the most granul
ar details, grams of saturated fats, 
parts per billion of greenhouse gas, the number of women in management 
roles as well as the larger ambition of building a business that acts in 

company and what is right for our communities, because at the end of the 
day, there is no separating the two.
 
With that, let me turn it over to Hugh.
 
Hugh Johnston
 
Thank you, Indra and good morning everyone. I will just provide a quick 
update on the outloo
k and then we will move to your questions. From a 
macro perspective, we maintain a fairly positive view overall. However within 
this broadly positive picture, there remains risk of volatility both in 
geographic markets as we saw in Brazil in the most recen
t quarter and in 
currencies as witnessed by the recent sharp rise in the strength of the U.S. 
dollar. From an industry standpoint, we continue to see pretty challenging 
conditions, including a dynamic retail and consumer landscape, a very 
competitive envir
onment and ongoing commodity inflation. So putting this 
all together in considering our year
-
to
-
date performance, our guidance for 
2018 remains unchanged. Specifically, we expect organic revenue growth at 
least in line with our 2017 growth rate or 2.3%.
 
As
 
we move through the year, our expectation is that we will continue to see 
some levels of gross margin compression from inflationary input costs. 
Normally, you would expect to see the gross margin contraction offset with 
SG&A productivity, but as we have s
tated previously with the benefit of a 
lower effective tax rate in 2018, we are making investments to fortify the 
business as well as having funded the U.S. frontline bonus and these 
investments will largely offset productivity driven margin improvement. W
e 
expect our core effective tax rate to be in the low 20s and we expect core 
earnings per share of $5.70 or a 9% increase compared to 2017 core 
earnings per share of $5.23.
 
We expect to continue to generate strong cash flow and to exercise 
disciplined capi
tal allocation with prudent reinvestment into the business. For 
2018, we continue to expect free cash flow of approximately $6 billion, 
which includes approximately $9 billion in cash flow from operations, 
including a $1.4 billion discretionary pension con
tribution made in the first 
quarter and net capital spending of approximately $3.6 billion. We continue 
to expect to return approximately $7 billion to shareholders in 2018 with 
cash dividends of approximately $5 billion, reflecting a 15% increase in the 
a
nnualized dividend per share that began with the June payment and share 
repurchases of approximately $2 billion.
 

expect our rate of earnings growth to be substantially higher in the
 
fourth 
than in the third quarter. This is due to the timing of investments and the 

previously announced refranchising of our Czech Republic, Hungary and 
Slovakia business oper
ations to benefit our fourth quarter earnings, and 
finally based on market consensus forecast, we expect foreign exchange 
translation to negatively impact both net revenue and operating profit in the 
second half of the year reversing the ForEx benefits tha
t we had in the first 
half.
 
With that operator, we are ready to take the first question. Operator?
 
Indra Nooyi
 
Hello. Operator?
 
Jamie Caulfield
 

difficulties in having your 
questions fed to us. So if I could ask you just to 
remain patient for a minute while we sort this out. Thank you.
 
Question
-
and
-
Answer Session
 
Operator
 
[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Dara 
Mohsenian of Morgan Stanley.
 
Indr
a Nooyi
 
Good morning, Dara.
 
Dara Mohsenian
 
Hey, good morning. So, Indra, clearly, there has been a lot of investor focus 
around the number of pressure points in the CPG industry in terms of pricing 
power brand demand fragmentation etcetera, etcetera and ba
sically that 
some of the traditional advantages of larger CPG companies are breaking 
down. In that context, I was hoping you could give us some perspective on if 
there are areas of significant investment or operational changes at Pepsi 
going forward beyond
 
what you have already done to help position the 
company versus some of those industry challenge is and how realistic a 
long
-
term high single
-
digit earnings growth algorithm beyond 2018 is if you 
need to reinvest it again some of those pressure points? And
 
within that 
answer I was hoping specifically you could touch on price mix, you have 
obviously had strong pricing realization in the last few years with the 

thoughts on price mix 
also within that? Thanks.
 
Indra Nooyi
 
Thanks, Dara. And first of all, I think you asked me about 10 questions 
within one question, but given that we had this technical difficulty, I guess 
you are entitled to ask these 10 questions. I think you asked a sort
 
of very, 
very interesting questions, I think the changes we are seeing in the industry 
are quite interesting and I think the changes that we are seeing benefit 
companies that have already invested to build scale, building international 
footprint and have 

not the time for companies to go and plant flags in new countries and try to 

companies are small, niche single country companies w
ith small brands who 
grow it to a certain level and then flip it or very large established scale 

just planting the flag actually built scale. And I think PepsiCo is one of those 
few c
ompanies that have actually over the years invested to build scale, put 
the right partnerships in place, built a diversified portfolio and actually 
solidified our presence and we made all the investments over the years.
 
So that part of the investment is be
hind us. This next tranche of investments 
relate to digitalization thinking through more automation in our plants, in 
our go
-
to
-
market systems figuring out how we can unleash more 
productivity, but more efficiency and effectiveness not just efficiency, if 
efficiency and effectiveness so that we can serve the changing retail world in 
more efficient and productive base, because retailers are going to go 
through their own changes and they are going to look at a few players to be 
the anchor suppliers to them wh
ile they handle with all kinds of changes with 
a large portion of the CPG world. And I think PepsiCo with its DSD systems 
and with its high velocity categories, its brand portfolio, and most 
importantly, innovation becomes a very valuable partner across th
e world. I 
mean I have often said this to you, when we had just snacks and beverages 
going to large European retailers, we were like 37 in a number of 50 on the 
list now with our combined approach and the Power of One approach, we are 
in the top 5 or top 7
 
suppliers driving a lot of the growth. They look at us 
and say there are these large companies the drive a lot of growth in our 
anchor suppliers that we should just have great relationships with, leave 
them aside, while we focus on all of the other player
s that we need to either 
prune the portfolio or figure out how to make them more efficient. So we are 
making investments in digitalization, more automation in plants, rethinking 
our innovation process and making sure that we fragment or segment our 
innovat
ion between premium, mid and value and deal with each country and 
each marketplace with that sort of an architecture. And then we are getting 

that a big burst of innovation re
quired. All that we are doing is investing as 
we go along. And I think Hugh talked about the fact that we have been 
making investments in the business. We have been doing that deliberately 
and carefully over the years. And we are going to continue to do th
at. We 
are going to look for ways to unleash productivity and every time we have 
productivity we are going to see how we judiciously reinvest in the business 
that we can keep this engine going. And in terms of price mix, innovation is 
a big driver of price
 
mix as is revenue management and we are improving 
our revenue management skills all the time applying more digital tools. 
When it comes to innovation, we are thinking more and more about 
segmenting on innovation and we are also thinking about how to incub
ate a 

every big region of the world. So overall, we feel very comfortable with our 
overall strategy.
 
Operator
 
Your next question comes from the line of Andrea Teixeira of JPMorgan.
 
A
ndrea Teixeira
 
Hi, thank you and good morning. So I appreciate your answer to that, but I 
was hoping if you can update us on your outlook for NAB since the last call 
as you are considering strategic alternatives? And in light of this combined 
approach with
 
technology I just mentioned using the European example I 
would appreciate if you can elaborate? Thank you.
 
Indra Nooyi
 
I will provide some opening comments, Andrea and then pass it to Hugh to 
give more color. What we told you in the last call is that you 
should expect 
to see sequential improvement in North American Beverage performance. 

Every part of the business in North American Beverages is showing 
sequential improvement. In the se
cond part of Q2, we saw significant 
improvement in performance and as we go into Q3, we feel good about the 
trend rate. We are playing a very responsible game in terms of advertising 
and pricing. And with commodity inflation, we will continue to play a 
res
ponsible 

 
take a responsible position in this marketplace by pushing 
through pricing. So at the end of the day, our North American Beverage 
business, which participates in a highly competitive category needs to be 
managed very, very carefully especially a
t a time when there are changes in 
the marketplace from lots of competitive activity. And look there is always 
going to be short
-
term preservations when our competitors go through 
major changes in their business models, our challenge is to maintain a very 


 
Hugh Johnston
 
The only thing I would add, Indra, is hopefully you all have seen that this 
management team is a
lways focused on creating value both in the short
-
term and in the long
-
term and achieving the right balance between the two. 
And as we look at all of the businesses that, that is our most significant 
focus and I think we will continue to do that just as we
 
have.
 
Operator
 
Your next question comes from the line of Pablo Zuanic of SIG.
 
Indra Nooyi
 
Good morning Pablo.
 
Pablo Zuanic
 
Thank you. Good morning, Indra. Good morning, everyone. Two quick 
questions. One, I understand that you are reinvesting in the tax b
enefits, 

beverages or is it pretty much evenly across the business? And the second 
question which is related to that when you see a success that Coca
-
Cola has 
had with the Diet Coke n
ew products and with Coca
-
Cola Zero Sugar, any 
thoughts in terms of how things would be done different on the Pepsi side of 
things? And the reason I asked that is that if the brands themselves having 
been improved in terms of innovation, how much is reinve
stment and more 
marketing going to help? Thanks.
 
Indra Nooyi
 
Pablo, we reinvested tax benefits on additional media for NAB and wherever 
the businesses needed investment, we put it in. The idea is not just to 

judiciously, so that we get return from the 
investments. And we also reinvested some of the tax benefits in our frontline 
bonus, so that especially people in the United States where the tax benefits 
of really accrued can benefit from the upside. Now, when 
it comes to our 
North American Beverage business, we are investing in CSDs, especially 
trademark Pepsi. And we are investing more in trademark Pepsi, because we 
saw stepped up investment in media from our competition. So we are doing 
that. When it comes to
 
the Zero Sugar portfolio both between Diet Pepsi and 


 
I hate to use the word flying off the shelves but is doing exceedingly well. 
When it comes to Diet Pepsi, Diet Pepsi is also 
back to good performance. 
And I have to tell you the flavor portfolio on Diet Pepsi and whatever 
competition launched, you might want to look at the numbers in a little bit 

throw t
oo much innovation to this marketplace and sort of obfuscate the 
numbers from our perspective, Zero Sugar portfolio between Diet and Zero 
Sugar is doing well and is doing well on the sustained consistent basis and 
we are playing the long game, Pablo, in te
rms of overall liquid refreshment 

game and we feel good about where we are headed.
 
Operator
 
Your next question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane of Bank of 
America.
 
Bryan Spillane
 
Hey, good morning everyone.
 
Indra Nooyi
 
Good morning, Bryan.
 
Bryan Spillane
 
Hugh, I just wanted to pickup on you made a comment in terms of the 
forward guidance about gross margins still being under pressure in the 
second half. So, I guess couple of quest
ions. I guess that implies we should 
expect that gross margins might be down in the second half? And then 

guess also maybe transactional FX, if you could just kind of walk us through
 


 
Hugh Johnston
 
Yes, Bryan, happy to do that. So, a couple of comments. When I say gross 
margins under pressure, I 
am talking about relatively nominal pressures we 
have seen over the last several quarters. A combination of a couple of 
factors on gross margin, number one, obviously commodity inflation has 
picked up a bit. Certainly, we have seen a bit more in oil and in
 
addition to 
that in aluminum; second, transport costs have also been under some 
pressure with the driver shortage in the United States; and then third, in 
international markets, as you know where we have seen some inflation, we 
do tend to price a bit behi
nd inflation and try to drive productivity in order to 
offset that and then obviously we are reinvesting the tax benefit in the form 

normally might in SG&A. So, those are the sever
al factors that are driving it. 
Overall as I said, we expect full year to be on the 9% that we originally 
committed to and we are balancing the internal workings of the P&L to make 
that happen.
 
Operator
 
Your next question comes from the line of Ali Dibadj 
of Bernstein.
 
Indra Nooyi
 
Good morning, Ali.
 
Ali Dibadj
 
Hey, guys. So just wanted to ask a little bit more about the sustainability of 
your results going forward along three dimensions. First, is the sustainability 
of one
-
timers like Thailand and Britvic a
nd coming up on Czech Republic 
here in your core results, should we continue to expect things like that to be 
a consistent part of your algorithm going forward? How much more of those 
types of things you have to sell? Second, in terms of pricing, it contin
ues to 
be a big driver obviously for Latin America and you are willing to continue to 
sacrifice a little bit of volume there again, how much longer you think that 
sustainable? And then third on NAB improvements very pleased that they 
are on track both you 
and I, can you give us more about whether you 
believe that was actually driven by advertising increases, was there an 
advertising increase in particular in NAB overall as opposed to just Pepsi, 
could you call that Pepsi, because you called out Pepsi, but I
 

the release for the segment, NAB or is there something else that drove that 
improvement and so will that improvement you guys believe continue not 
just going to this quarter, but going forward?
 
Indra Nooyi
 
I am going to take the third one 
and then Hugh, I am going to toss it to you 
to talk about the first two, okay. NAB improvement, again, Ali as I 
mentioned, we are playing the LRB game. We are looking to improve our 
position in the liquid refreshment beverage category, because we play in 
p
retty much every category in LRB most of them with very, very strong 
brands. And in terms of A&M spending, we increased A&M spending on 
trademark Pepsi as we mentioned we were going to do and because the A&M 
gets curved in, you will see the benefits flowin
g through in Q3 and Q4 more 
as we go through and we are seeing the improvement in brand health 
metrics and we are seeing a sequential improvement in the performance of 
the business. So believe me, we have focused maniacally on tracking the 
performance and 
the result of all of our increased spending. And what we 
are seeing in the results, that gives us confidence to tell you what we told 
you on the call today. So on balance, we are feeling good about the NAB 
performance trends. Now, let me turn it to Hugh to
 
talk about the one
-
timers and pricing, especially in countries like 

 
regions like Latin America.
 
Hugh Johnston
 
Yes, happy to, Ali. In terms of one
-
timers, if you look at our record over the 
last 4 or 5 years, we have always had some one
-
timers whether it


to continue to be a factor as it has been. In terms of Latin America, without 
a doubt, where you have high inflation environments, we have tended to 
price through the vast ma

improved our revenue results sometimes at the expense of volume. As you 
see the inflation rates come down in those countries, obviously our pricing 
will diminish, but we do expect that our volume will pickup 
as a result of that 
and we expect to continue to see strong results out of Latin America and 
other places that have historically had high inflation where the numbers 
have come down a bit.
 
Indra Nooyi
 
But I think the most important thing on one
-
timers, we d

-
timers 
to deliver earnings, we do one
-

business model for those countries and what we are trying to do is to 
strengthen the core business, so that they have the right partner to boost 
the performance of tha
t beverage business in certain markets we will 
franchise it to them and if think we have better off operating it, we will do 
that. So I think we use one
-
timers in a very judicious strategic way to 
improve the overall performance of the company.

Judy Hong
 
Good morning. So, Indra, I guess I just wanted to get a little bit more color 
on the Gatorade performance, trends have gotten a little better recently the 
comps are getting easie

also get a better sense of maybe some of the brand health metrics that you 
talked about is really to maybe that was I think more of a Pepsi trademark 
comment, but on Gatorade specifically? And then as you
 
think about 
Gatorade Zero, a little bit more color just in terms of the positioning of that 
particular line and how much marketing investments that you are making on 
that line? Thanks.
 
Indra Nooyi
 
Gatorade is actually doing very well and this weather is helping for sure, but 
the underlying Gatorade trademark is very, very strong and Gatorade always 
attracts new players into the marketplace and they come in with either lower 
prices or they try to com
e in and build distribution and they might take a few 
share points in any quarter or two, but then over time if you look at it over a 
period of 5 or 7 years, the Gatorade franchise has been extremely resilient 
and is basically held on to its leadership pos
ition. We have innovated to build 
shoulders with the Gatorade recovery drinks, the Gatorade Chews before 
you start exercising and then we have segmented along flavors and then 
across different sports. Many of our consumers wanted a Gatorade Zero for 
the li

needed and so we launched Gatorade Zero. Even though there is Propel 
also, they wanted to be seen with the Gatorade. So, we launched Gatorade 
Zero and we keep advertising along the entire tr
ademark and we have never

Your ne
xt question comes from the line of Lauren Lieberman of Barclays.
 
Indra Nooyi
 
Good morning, Lauren.
 
Lauren Lieberman
 
Good morning. Thanks. I was curious you had mentioned sort of two 
different types of comments around brands and innovations. So one bucket 
w
as sort of the discussion of lift and shift continuing to support and build 
your biggest franchises and then Indra you also mentioned the idea of 
incubating niche brands or companies within market? So, I was curious if 
you could kind of put those two toget
her and in particular what I have been 
most curious about is how PepsiCo is thinking about a small brand strategy if 
you want or need to have one in the beverage business, because when I 
look at some of the work you have done in the last 2 years, LIFEWTR, 
bubly, 

slowly and patiently through single serve and discovery. So, I was curious 
your thoughts around the viability of a small brand strategy within PepsiCo 
and if that was somethin
g you are were focusing on? Thanks.
 
Indra Nooyi
 

last 5 years of beverages, we have had some spectacular new products 
which for any small startup company would have been a bloc
kbuster, but for 
PepsiCo because we have put it through DSD system unless it reaches the 

because many times the space has to come out of the core cooler or the 
core isle and so 
we look at differential velocity and then the DSD system 
tends to kill it. And if I look at products like Lemon Lemon from last year, it 
was rated the best new product launch of last year. It reached a pretty 
impressive level of sales yet on the DSD system
 

because it was cannibalizing space from a core CSD category. So what we 

separate group just like we did with e
-
commerce we have taken it out of the 
core head

take some of the best new products that we launched and reached a certain 
size, but we never really allowed it to thrive in the DSD system we were 
nurtured and incubated in whatever distri
bution system they think is the 
best for it and when it reaches a certain size, we can decide whether it 
should come into the DSD system or not. And this group is also going to look 
at other venturing brands they can bring in and we want to create an 
envir
onment where we have a business within a business, a small 

consumer that loves discovery brands, while allowing the big brands to 
thrive in the overall mothership. And this is not new to
 
PepsiCo North 


business and we are going to play with these businesses, because there is a 
consumer that is wi
lling to pay for discovery brands and they can reach a 
decent level of growth and so we are going to go off and see how to make it 

what happens in the next few months and years.

Your next question comes from the line of Steve Powers of Deutsche Bank.
 
Steve Powers
 
Hey, good morning. Thanks. So going back to North America Beverages for a 
minute, it does indeed look like we are on track for a return to growth in the 
second half
, which is great. I just love a little bit more context about what 

launch like Gatorade Zero better realize price mix as inflation builds more of 
an inflection in core Pepsi or just
 
are there one or two priorities on your 
scorecard that you could call out for us that will be great? And then secondly 
as you have been open about your ongoing assessment of strategic options 

tuting a 
standalone entity you are putting in the hands of multiple franchisees or 
keeping it as part of PepsiCo. I am just curious as to whether or not you 
have narrowed in on any subset of those options or what the timeframe 
might be for you be in a posi
tion to communicate your path forward to 
market? Thanks.
 
Indra Nooyi
 
Hugh?
 
Hugh Johnston
 
Yes, Steve, happy to answer those questions. First, in terms of the priorities, 
if nothing else what we saw last year and we have certainly seen in this year 
we need t
o be able to both make sure the big businesses are on track in 
North America Beverages, those big businesses obviously are Pepsi, 
Mountain Dew and Gatorade. What we have seen over the last couple of 
quarters is certainly a strengthening in the Mountain Dew
 
business both the 
core green bottle business as well as the innovation with Ice and now the 
return of Baja Blast, which has always been a Mountain Dew fan favorite. 

back on track a
nd we are very excited about the innovation. Gatorade Zero 
really meets, I think a very unmet need for the lapse Gatorade user, 

they want the Gatorade brand. And then Pepsi, where
 
we knew we needed 
to increase the advertising, we knew we needed to have a good campaign 
this year that obviously takes longer to do. The quantity is easier to turn on, 

of big
 
priority is making sure the big businesses are doing well. Second is 
continue to execute against the innovations in the newer categories whether 


s the additive that sort of creates the 
growth in the business. The core brands grow at a certain rate and all of 
those new innovations create the incremental growth. So, I think we need to 
be able to do both North America Beverages obviously a big nuance 
complex 
business and we need to do more than one or two things well. We need to 

happening. Regarding strategic options nothing new to report on that, we 
will continue to look at optio
ns to create value not only in that business, but 
across all of our businesses.

Indra Nooyi
 
Hey, Bonnie. Good morning.
 
Bonnie Herzog
 
Thank you. Hi, good morning. So I just wanted to talk about Frito
-
Lay North 
America, your growth really has been impressive both on the top and bottom 
line. So, how sustainable is this from a long
-
term perspective? And then 
could you guys walk through for 
us any productivity initiatives that you have 
specifically implemented in Frito
-
Lay that you possibly could implement 
across the rest of your businesses? Thanks.
 
Indra Nooyi
 
On the Frito
-
Lay, the reason the growth is impressive is because Frito
-
Play 
plays 
in salty snacks and the entire macro snacks space is there for the 
taking. And so Frito
-
Lay focuses on the core and then inches out of the core 
by taking occasions from the rest of macro snacks and the innovation engine 
is very geared to going out and buil
ding both frequency and penetration and 
picking up more and more snacking occasions. And as long as they keep 
doing that, they should be able to deliver the group. The DSD apparatus is 
an extremely impressive machine and that actually helps sustain Frito
-
L

growth. In terms of productivity initiatives, we have talked about GES, 


-
bottlenecking the system because it

more customer
-
specific in our picking. And so GES has actually been a big 
benefit for us and then deploying more digital technologies across Frito
-
Lay 
is actually delivering more productivity. The good news is as Nort
h America 

 
tools that North American Beverages develops goes to Frito
-
Lay and what 
Frito
-
Lay develops, comes to North America. And so we have a wonderful 

businesses and so we can take the cu
stomer base both traditional trade up 
and down the street and big organized accounts and figure out how to serve 
them better, whether you call it geo box at our beverage business or GES in 
Frito
-
Lay, there is a lot of information exchange going on. And ove
rall, I 
think both businesses are high velocity businesses and they are able to 
unleash productivity to reinvest to keep this growth engine going. Do you 
want to add anything, Hugh?

Amit Sharma
 
Hi, good morning everyone. Hugh, a quick clarification, you did say you 
expect to take pricing in NAB CSGs, can you talk about how quickly we 
should expect you to rollout 
pricing and to what extent? And then another 
one, gas prices are now multiyear high, are you seeing any change in 
consumer behavior, especially in the C
-
Store channel?
 
Hugh Johnston
 
Yes, to answer your first question first, I think you will see incremental
 
pricing benefit in the third quarter and then you will see more in the fourth 
quarter. Regarding gas prices, convenience channel was up about 3% I 
believe overall for the second quarter. So I think given the healthiness of the 

than offsetting the gas price increases.

historically and how 
representative you think that is of future CapEx either in absolute terms or 
relative to sales?
 
Hugh Johnston
 
Yes. So, our previously discussed long
-
term guidance is equal to or less than 
5% of net revenue, no update on that right now
, bigger investments in a 
couple of places. Latin America, we have seen capital spending go up as we 
have implemented some of the GES solutions that Indra has mentioned on 
the previous question. Number two, we are investing more in Frito

Lay, 
because we ar
e identifying projects to drive continued growth in 
productivity. And number three, North America Beverage as the single

serve 
strategy has continued to be successful we are adding capacity in certain

Your next question comes from the line
 
of Robert Ottenstein of Evercore.
 
Robert Ottenstein
 
Great. Thank you very much. And Indra in the past you have given us a little 
bit more color in terms of market share gains and value share gains and 
clearly you are doing very well outside of the U.S. Ca
n you perhaps give us a 
little bit of sense of where you are gaining share and importantly 
international markets and where things are more challenging? And then 
secondly, bubly off to a great start, perhaps if you could maybe stand back a 
little bit and gi
ve us a sense of where you see yourselves take your water 
strategy and what percentage of the business it is right now? Thank you.
 
Indra Nooyi
 
In terms of share gains internationally, I think overall salty snacks globally, I 
think in 75% of the markets we 
are holding or gaining share. Remember 
internationally, we also have a lot of local low cost competitors. In spite of 
that, I think 70% 75% of markets we hold or gain share, I think in 60% of 
markets we are gaining share and about 75% we either hold or gai
n, I am 
giving you rough numbers, Robert. In terms of beverages again in many of 
the markets that we participate as PepsiCo about 50% or 60% of markets 
we are actually holding or gaining share and then the other markets we go 
in and out, well, one quarter 
we may gain share, one quarter local 
competitor or a global competitor may gain share. So we trade shares on a 
quarterly basis based on what we are lapping or what specific, a blockbuster 
marketing initiative is being implemented at that time, but overall 
what we 

anything crazy just to gain share. We participate in a very responsible way 
and somewhere between 60% and 75% of our markets if we can hold or 


what we are focused on globally both the snacks and beverages and now 
more and more in our nutrition businesses, which we are trying to figure out 
what the relevant marketplaces and how do we calculate a fair marke
t share 

 
Hugh Johnston
 

volume, Robert, round numbers and in terms of water strategy obviously we 
have a case pack water bus
iness that provides baseload volume and then we 
are increasingly segmenting that business whether it be with flavored still 
waters, whether it be with flavored sparkling waters in the form of bubly, 
whether it be in the form of LIFEWTR, which obviously app
eals to a large 
consumer segment, one, that continues to grow well for us. So I think you 
will continue to see us segment the water category into profitable niches to 
go along with the large scale case pack water business.

Your next question comes
 
from the line of Nik Modi of RBC Capital Markets.
 
Nik Modi
 
Yes, good morning everyone. Good morning. So Indra I was hoping you 
could provide some of the logic behind the various refranchising initiatives 
PepsiCo has undertaken in the international markets
 
and how any early 
learnings could inform the beverage strategy in the U.S.? And I guess the 
main question is, is it even translatable? That would be really helpful to 
understand.
 
Indra Nooyi
 

e points. 
When we re
-

portfolio of beverages, because Pepsi internationally in many markets, we 

we partner with somebody
 
who has their own LRB products and together we 
cover the entire line. An example would be something like a Postobon in 
Colombia that has their own line of non
-
carbs and then we come in with our 
portfolio and together, we have a fantastic leadership positi
on in Colombia. 
What we are looking at and Hugh talked about our Czech Republic, Hungary 
and Slovakia beverage operations, we are refranchising into a partner who 
already has the lineup of LRB and we complete the portfolio. So our system 
actually is much m
ore robust than people realize, because as a system we 
are much stronger than just PepsiCo in the international beverage business 

learnings are make sure if you are going to re
-
franchis
e, re
-
franchise to 
somebody who knows how to run the beverage business and they have a 
portfolio that together the one plus one is a three not detracting from our 

those are the learn
ings from our beverage refranchising.

Your next question comes from the line of Bill Chappell of SunTrust.
 
Bill Chappell
 
Thanks. Good morning. Question on just the momentum on NAB that you 
talked about is it kind of started slow and had good 
momentum at the end, I 
mean, that tracks with kind of what we saw in North America weather in 
terms of cold and wet late March, April early May and then came back 
roaring and then very hot? So trying to understand what you see that makes 

 
beyond weather, I mean, the whole 

 
lifting the whole 
category, are you seeing kind of market share especially in CSDs, are you 
seeing some things stabilize or what gives you so much confidence that 
carries through as we get to kind of normal weather and 
albeit easier comps 
in the back half?
 
Indra Nooyi
 

hot weather helps the beverage business, but I think on top of that, our 
brand health metrics are all trending the right way. 
The business is trending 
the right way. And pretty much all of our franchises we are seeing sequential 
improvement in performance. And so even businesses that have difficult 
lapse we are seeing sequential improvement in performance. So I think if 
this cont
inues, this bodes well for NAB.
 
Indra Nooyi
 
So thank you all for your questions. Let me summarize, the business overall 
is performing well in a highly dynamic environment and we remain on
-
track 
to deliver our financial goals for the year. We remain highly 
focused on 
driving better operating performance from North American Beverages and 
we are encouraged by the sequential improvement we have seen in NAB. 
Just as important even if you remain highly focused on performing well in 
the current and coming quarters
, we remain committed to continuing to 
transform the business to strengthen its sustainability and durability to 
perform well far into the future. Thank you for joining us this morning and 
thank you for the confidence you have placed in us with your invest
ment. 
Thank you.

Indra Nooyi
 
Thank you, Jamie and good morning everyone. Thank you all for joining us. 
As most of you know, we announced in August that I'm stepping down as 
CEO of PepsiCo after
 
12 years in the role effective tomorrow. And so today 
will be my final conference call with you. Actually my 75th and final, if you 
also include the calls I've participated in as CFO.
 
After we complete the primary business at hand, reviewing the results a
nd 
outlook and taking your questions. I'd like to ask for your patience and allow 
me to make a few concluding remarks at the end of the call.
 
So, moving on to business; for the quarter we generated $16.5 billion of net 
revenue driven by 4.9% organic revenu
e growth and delivered core earnings 
per share of $1.59, a 9% increase on a core constant currency basis. 
Overall, we are pleased with our operating and financial performance in the 
quarter.
 
The organic revenue growth represents another quarter of sequenti
al 
acceleration and the highest rate of organic revenue growth in 12 quarters. 
The majority of our businesses again perform well, but particularly strong 
performances by our international sectors and solid performance by Frito
-
Lay in North America.
 
And whi
le North American beverages profit performance was impacted by 
inflation and a double
-
digit increase in advertising expense, the sector 
posted 2.5% organic revenue growth with a good balance between volume 
growth and net price realization.
 
Frito
-
Lay North 
America delivered balanced volume growth and net price 
realization driving by strong innovation and brand marketing. For example, 
in June we launched Stacy's Cheese Petites inspired by French Cheese Puff, 
these bite
-
sized cheese snacks have real cheese bak
ed inside creating a 
sophisticated snacking experience.
 
In fact cheese is the primary ingredient. Petites are a good source of calcium 
and have six grams of protein per serving, and they come in a resealable 
pouch making them great for a convenient on
-
the
-
go experience.
 
Over the summer, Doritos and Mountain Dew partnered on our Worlds 
Collide program to appeal to our Gen Z consumers who thrive on 
accelerating experiences. The program highlighted the brands recent 
innovations, Doritos Blaze and Dew Ice and r
ewarded consumers to 
purchase both products with merchandise and experiences.
 
The eight
-
week media campaigns supporting the program span social media 
channels that are also featured on Pandora to reach our consumers' 
distinctive music. Tostitos' growth was
 
fueled by new products such as 
Roasted Red Pepper and Black Bean and Garlic.
 
To support the product launches we created the program to drive trial during 
the summer get
-
togethers. Our Buy, Ride, Get Together already program 
allowed consumers to scan a cod
e of specially marked bags to redeem a $5 
lift credit making it even easier for our consumers to get safety to and from 
summer parties. And Cheetos benefited from the launch of Cheetos Flaming 
Hot Chipotle Ranch earlier this year, appealing to consumers gr
owing desire 
for intense flavors.
 
Cheetos further benefited from our Cheetos Museum Win What You See 
campaign, with our first
-
ever Cheetos promotion supported by TV 
commercials directing consumers to winwhatyousee.com where we invited 
our fans to find and 
submit unique Cheetos shapes to have a chance to win 
what they see. We garnered more than 80,000 submissions and the program 
is now been localized and rolled across seven additional countries and 
counting.
 
Turning to North American beverages, while the mar
ketplace remains highly 
competitive, we are encouraged by improving overall category growth trends 
and a generally rational pricing environment.
 
We had another quarter of sequential organic revenue performance and 
improvement. Organic revenue growth of 2.5
% is the best you've seen in 
NAB in eight quarters and was driven by retail sales growth in Starbucks 
ready
-
to
-
drink coffee, Lipton ready
-
to
-
drink tea, Gatorade, our water 
portfolio, Pepsi and Mountain Dew.
 
Certainly strong innovation across the portfolio 
is contributing to the 
improving performance. For example, LIFEWTR continues its journey 
advancing and showcasing sources of creativity with the launch of our Series 
6 Bottle themed diversity and design.
 
LIFEWTR achieved more than $150 million in measured 
retail sales in 2017 
which was its introductory year. And is on pace to achieve more $200 million 
in measured retail sales in 2018.
 
Bubly, a new flavored sparkling water where there's no artificial flavors, 
colors or calories which we launched in February 
of this year continues to 
perform exceeding well and has projected to exceed a $100 million in 
measured retail sales in this first year.
 
Mountain Dew's performance is benefiting from the launch of Mountain Dev 
Ice, another launch which should surpass a $10
0 million of retail in its first 
year from launch, and from the return of Mountain Dew Baja Blast as our 
summer limited time offering.
 
And in June, we launched Gatorade Zero. With zero sugar and all the 
electrolytes of Gatorade Thirst Quencher, Gatorade Ze
ro is providing 
hydration options for more athletes in more occasions and is off to a strong 
start.
 
And we believe our stepped
-
up advertising and marketing, particularly on 
trademarks Pepsi and Mountain Dew, are also starting to contribute to 
improve perfo
rmance as we saw sequential net revenue accelerations in 
both trademarks in the third quarter.
 
Commodity inflation, operating cost inflation particularly in transportation 
cost, product mix and stepped
-
up advertising expense each pressured our 
profit 
performance in the quarter. However, we expect that our recently 
implemented pricing actions will improve profit performance in the coming 
quarters.
 
At Quaker Foods North America, our hot cereal business posted its fifth 
consecutive quarter of market share
 
gains supported by our marketing 
campaigns highlighting the functional benefits of oatmeal and innovation like 
Simple and Wholesome Organic Hot Cereal, a Multigrain Hot Cereal with no 
artificial colors or preservatives.
 
In addition, Quaker light snacks ga
ins market share with high singe digit 
retail sales growth. In our Aunt Jemima pancake business, grew retail sales 
for the eighth consecutive quarter.
 
And to close out our conversation in North America, we are pleased to report 
that in the third quarter Pe
psiCo was the largest contributor to food and 
beverage growth at retail in the United States.
 
Turning to our sectors outside of North America, we are extremely pleased 
with the 10% organic revenue growth we saw in our developing and 
emerging market as a gr
oup, which is the continuation of the strength and 
experience across many of these markets in the first half.
 
Strong marketplace execution led to continued solid growth across many of 
our key international markets. Within Latin America organic revenue grew
 
10% driven by high single digit growth in Mexico and double
-
digit growth in 
Argentina, Brazil and Colombia.
 
The LatAm team is doing an excellent job, building our business and growing 
our market share in key countries in the region. In our Europe sub
-
Saha
ran 
Africa sector, Russia and South Africa each grew organic revenue high 
single
-
digit, while Turkey and Poland had double
-
digit organic revenue 
growth. Even within the developed markets of Europe, we saw mid single
-
digit organic revenue growth in the UK a
nd France. Again, continued good 
performance from this team.
 
And in AMENA, we had strong double
-
digit organic revenue growth in China, 
Saudi Arabia, India and Egypt, and high single
-
digit organic revenue growth 
in Australia. Excellent results from our AMEN
A team. This strong top line 
performance translated into impressive bottom line results with core 
constant currency operating profit up 12% in our international divisions as a 
group.
 
The international results reflect our initiatives to continue to expand 
d
istribution of our big global brand and to innovate in locally relevant ways. 
For example, we continue to drive international growth of our zero sugar 
Pepsi Black and Pepsi Max trademarks with introductions of lime and cherry 
flavors across Easter Europe, 
lime in the Nordics, and lime and vanilla 
flavors in the Philippines.
 
We are driving growth in Doritos internationally, whether through expansion 
to new markets like China where the brand just celebrated its first 
anniversary since launch, to innovation in
 
existing markets like India, where 
we launched Doritos Heat Wave.
 
And the Quaker's trademark continues its global expansion. From the launch 
of Quaker's super food in Mexico, to our launches of Quaker Kids and Quaker 
multigrain instant oatmeal platforms i
n China.
 
Finally, during the quarter we reach an agreement to acquire SodaStream. 
As we said on the day of the initial announcement, we believe PepsiCo and 
SodaStream are an inspired match.
 
Daniel Birnbaum and the rest of the SodaSteam team have built an 
e
xtraordinary company that is offering consumers the ability to make great 
tasting beverages while reducing the amount of waste generated.
 
That focus is well aligned with performance with Purpose, our philosophy of 
making more nutritious products while limi
ting our environmental footprint. 
Together, we can advance our shared vision of a healthier, more sustainable 
planet. SodaStream will also add to our growing water portfolio while 
accelerating our ability to offer personalized in
-
home beverage solutions 
ar
ound the world.
 
From breakthrough innovations like Drinkfinity to beverage dispensers like 
Spire for foodservice and Aquafina water stations for colleges and 
universities. We are finding new ways to reach consumers beyond the bottle 
and the SodaStream is f
ully in line with that strategy.
 
As we previously announced the acquisition was unanimously approved by 
the boards of both companies. The transaction is subject to a SodaStream 
shareholder vote, certain regulatory approvals and other customary 
conditions a
nd consummation of the transaction is expected by January of 
2019.
 
Net, we are encouraged by the momentum we are seeing across many of 
our international markets. In North America, Frito
-
Lay continues to perform 
well, North American beverages is making stea
dy improvement, and our 
recently implemented pricing actions will help improve profit performance in 
North America. And finally, we are excited about the new opportunities that 
the pending SodaStream acquisition represents.
 
With that, let me turn it over t
o Hugh Johnston.
 
Hugh Johnston
 
Thank you, Indra and good morning everyone. I'll jut provide a quick update 
on the outlook and then we'll move to your questions. After considering our 
year to
-
date performance and other factors we've updated our guidance for
 
2018.
 
Specifically, we now expect at least 3% organic revenue growth for the full 
year. We now expect our core effective tax rate to be between 19% and 
20%. We continue to expect core constant currency EPS growth of 9%.
 
However, we now expect core earning
s per share in U.S. dollar terms of 
$5.65, which reflects a one
-
point headwind from foreign exchange 
translation based on current market consensus rates due to the recent 
strengthening of the U.S. dollar. This is an 8% increase compared to 2017 
core earnin
gs per share of $5.23.
 
We continue to expect strong cash flow and to exercise disciplined capital 
allocation with prudent reinvestment into the business. For 2018 we 
continue to expect free cash flow of approximately $6 billion which includes 
approximately
 
$9 billion in cash flow from operations, including a $1.4 billion 
discretionary pension contribution made in the first quarter. And we now 
expect net capital spending of approximately $3.3 billion.
 
We continue to expect to return approximately $7 billion 
to shareholders in 
2018 with cash dividends of approximately $5 billion reflecting a 15% 
increase in the annualized dividend per share that began with the June 
payment and share repurchases of approximately $2 billion.
 
Finally, as you update your models, I
'd like to highlight the following items 
to consider for the fourth quarter. Frito
-
Lay North America is lapping 5% 
organic revenue growth from the fourth quarter of 2017.
 
We expect operating profit to decline in our AMENA division as we lap strong 
results 
and a refranchising gain in Jordan from the fourth quarter of 2017. 
We expect the previously announced refranchising of our Czech Republic, 
Hungary and Slovakia business operations to benefit ESSA operating profit in 
the fourth quarter.
 
And finally based o
n market consensus forecast, we expect foreign exchange 
translation to negatively impact both net revenue and operating profit by 
approximately three percentage points in the fourth quarter.
 
With that, operator, we are ready to take the first question.
 
Question
-
and
-
Answer Session
 
Operator
 
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of 
Dara Mohsenian of Morgan Stanley.
 
Indra Nooyi
 
Good morning, Dara.
 
Dara Mohsenian
 
Hey, good morning. Congratulations Indra, on an illustrious c
areer of Pepsi 
and best wishes for you in the future.
 
Indra Nooyi
 
Thank you.
 
Dara Mohsenian
 
So, the quarter itself clearly saw a large acceleration of the organic sales in 
emerging and developing markets that's in contrast to some of the fears out 
there ov
er slowing macro. So, I was just hoping you could give us some 
more detail there on what drove the sequential improvement? Do you think 
it's more category growth accelerating or Pepsi market share picking up, 
maybe some of the key countries behind that. An
d then most importantly, 
just are those drivers sustainable as you look going forward beyond Q3 as 
you think about the strength in the business in the quarter?
 
Indra Nooyi
 
Hugh.
 
Hugh Johnston
 
Yes. So from an international perspective, I think we saw remark
ably broad
-
based results. The list of countries that had a strong quarter is probably too 
long to enumerate on the call. We'll use up our entire time doing that. 
Maybe most notably I think if we saw a strong volume growth both in snacks 
and in beverages. S
nacks were somewhere between 4% and 5% volume 
growth, beverages between 3% and 4%. And I think it really does sort of 
demonstrate that both the power of the portfolio and then in addition to that 
the relatively broad
-
based strength of economic performance 
around the 
world.
 
So, I think we do expect international to continue to perform very well. I 
think the portfolio was sturdy and well insulated. Look, at any given time as 
countries are disrupted, we always have some exposure to those disruptions. 
But by an
d large I think we have a remarkably powerful international 
business.
 
Indra Nooyi
 
And our execution also picked up quite a bit.
 
Hugh Johnston
 
Yes, absolutely.
 
Operator
 
Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Grundy of Jefferies.
 
Indra Nooyi
 
Good mo
rning, Kevin.
 
Kevin Grundy
 
Good morning, Indra. And I want to extend my congratulations as well. Can 
we start on the North American beverage business? Results improving. So 
congratulations on that. But coming at costs when we look at the margin 
pressure ye
ar
-
over
-
year and understanding the freight and commodities are 
playing apart, but you're also picking up your advertising and marketing 
spending. So maybe you could touch on the ROI on the spent if you're 
satisfied at this point?
 
And then two, maybe touch 
on the necessity to maintain higher levels here 
into Q4 and even next year particularly behind CSDs and sports drinks as we 
look at the some of the market share trends we see in the Nielsen data in 
order to maintain this level of growth? Thank you.
 
Hugh Jo
hnston
 
Hey Kevin, it's Hugh Johnston. Couple of things on that. You're right. The 
P&L was negatively impacted by two things. Number one was cost pressure 
both transport cost and aluminum were up. Number two, it was the 
increased in advertising and 
marketing spend across a number of our 
businesses. Maybe just we'll step back a little bit in terms of the way that we 
think about advertising and spending levels. Our intention generally 
speaking is to be competitive on advertising and spending levels, bu
t not to 
accelerate beyond competition.
 
Our goal is to win based on the quality of our advertising and the execution 
that follows that advertising rather than that the level itself. So I think we 
will maintain levels of spending that are competitive, but n
ot beyond 
competitive. Regarding the input cost inflation whether it's transport or 
whether it's aluminum, our history is always been to price through inflation 
in our developed markets. We'll look to do that here. We did that post Q3. 
It's fairly unusual 
to take pricing in the middle of the summer. So despite 
the fact that we felt some of that pressure in the summer, we didn't take 
pricing until September. I think you'll see the profit picture improve in Q4 as 
a result of that pricing.

Your next q
uestion comes from the line of Bryan Spillane of Bank of 
America/Merrill Lynch.

Hey, good morning everyone, and Indra, really just want to wish you the 
best going forward. It's been a pleasure the last 20 years covering you.
 
Indra Nooyi
 
Than
k you. Thank you very much.
 
Bryan Spillane
 
I guess the bigger question I would have is just 
--
 
you're looking at the 
business today in this year, right? We've seen some an increase in 
investment for advertising and marketing. We've also seen SodaStream as 
a 
relative to some the acquisitions you've done in the past a little bit bigger, 
which Soda suggests that there's just more of a need to sort of invest to 
continue to drive the top line.
 
So I [Indiscernible] yes, Indra, if you could if you could just sort 
of address 
this. We are at a point now where there is just a need to spend more 
whether it's operating expense or M&A to sort of drive the top line or was 
this year sort of more of an anomaly?
 
Hugh Johnston
 
Hey, Bryan, it's Hugh. Those are too fairly point
s, so let me address them 
separately. In terms of capital allocation broadly no change in policy here. 
We talked about $500 million here in tuck
-
ins that continues to be our stated 
policy. SodaStream in a lot of ways is a unique asset in that it gets into 
a 

consumers who preferred to prepare beverages at home, whether they be 
just sparkling water, whether they be flavored beverages. So I would view 
[Indiscernible] to increase in a
dvertising and marketing in the beverage 
business as anything more than a response to competitive increase and 

the future. I think our expectation as we said before is we want to 
compete 
on execution, we want to compete on the quality of innovation that we want 
to compete on the quality of our marketing and we think we are well 
positioned to do that particularly whether integrated system.

Your next question comes from the 
line of Ali Dibadj of Bernstein.
 
Ali Dibadj
 
Hey guys, first Indra very start 
--
 

company and frankly the whole industry, so we feel very good about that, so 
would love to hear what made you decide to go after 12 grea
t years and 
maybe that will be in the closing remarks but would love to hear that at or 
now or later. And then more specifically about the quarter, clearly the 
topline has been very good, the margins have seen little bit of pressure and 
we understand about
 
the advertising increases as well as some of the 

able to insulate a lot of that through the $1billion or year of cost savings 

n that, are you 

on the margins or do you think that has led to continue for many more years 
and to insulate you guys from what we are seeing from this quarter and 
most recent quart
ers on margin pressure? Thanks.
 
Hugh Johnston
 

forward, the bucket which we drive productivity, we call operating expenses 

inflation of about 3% to 
4% partly because the bucket is more tilted internationally where inflation 


no

opportunity out there for further productivity.
 
Regarding your question on whether we can continue to drive growth 
through the P&L funded by productivity. I think broadly the answer to that is 
y
es, in a lot of ways I think that the third quarter was reflective of the timing 
of our pricing decisions where we decided to take those post Q3 rather than 
during the quarter which obviously pressured margins a little bit, and it was 
also reflective of co
ntinued investments that we are making in top line 

about 6% in the quarter, R&D spending was up about 22% in the quarter, e
-
commerce spending was roughly double in the quarter.
 
So I th
ink in many ways what you saw was a timing issue in terms of the 
timing of commodity increases versus the pricing increase and continued 
investment in the business while delivering the short
-
term performance that 
frankly in many ways has been emblematic [p
h] of interest entire 12 years 
in running the company or posture in doing so over the last 20 or more 
years with the company.

said all along to the degree that we have upsides from tax and things like 
that we intend to deliver our guidance and invest back in the business. You

more as holistic sports nutrition on a sports field platform and our teams are

we imagine it to be, not

I think the wonderful thing about PepsiCo is that we reinvent ourselves

coming down the pie that are going to force us to rethink many many parts 
of our cost structure, but we started that work
 
several years ago and I think 
over the next year or so you will start seeing a lot of these taking root, and 
how we implement these in the company and reshape our cost structure for 
the new realities is really going to separate the great companies from th
e 

companies and we will re
-
shape our cost structure using technology as a big 
driver and I think will also use data analytics and insights to think about 
innovation a whole lot differently
.
 
So I feel good about where we are. We have made a lot of investments, the 
trick now is to keep investing in the company judiciously so that we deliver a 
good balance of short term results and make investments to keep this 
engine going into the future.

Good morning, Bonnie.
 
Bonnie Herzog
 
Good morning and congratulations to Hugh and Indra, we all wish you really 
the very best in the future. And I had a quick questio
n on your guidance. 
Your outlook for organic sales is now slightly higher for the year, but it 
implies a sequential deceleration in Q4, so could you guys first reconcile that 
for us and then whether you are being conservative or is there something 
else goi
ng on and then I was also hoping to hear an update on your current 
thinking on the strategic options you are exploring for your beverage 

more progress and you know determining the rig
ht path for this business 
and really what your latest thoughts are on potential benefits of 
refranchising? Thanks.
 
Hugh Johnston
 
Yes, happy to jump in on that. Number one, I would remind you that the Q4 
lap on revenue is more difficult that Q3 was so while
 
the guidance does 
imply a sequential slowdown in Q4 some of our thinking is driven by that. 

how the quarter comes. And regarding North America beverage and 
refranchising nothing ne

always do, the one thing that I would say generally is we do think the 
integrated system does make us more innovative, it does make us faster to 
respond to customer needs and it does make us more cost com
petitive. So 
those are the hurdles that we have to overcome if we were to see some 
benefit to refranchising in the future.

Good morning and 

 
and hi Indra congratu


women, so congratulations. I just 

 
my question is on Frito North America 

historical

which has a very difficult lap. I know you had some one
-
time payments in 
the first quarter on bonuses, but as Frito has always been such a great 
driver of growth for the total company Frito
, North America is there a point 
at which the margin expansion story thinking longer term maybe needs to 
slow as you invest in new opportunities?
 
Hugh Johnston
 

we think that, that 
business is so strong in its ability to leverage new ideas 
and new technology and to scale them relatively quickly to provide increased 
margin overtime. In terms of the short term numbers that you are speaking 
to, what are the factors affecting Frito
-
Lay t
his year is transport cost. Now 
transport in Frito was more heavily internal relative to beverages which uses 
more common carriers. So beverages has been more exposed to the driver 
shortage and the impact in terms of transport cost, but Frito
-
Lay is not 
im
mune to that it does use some common carrier and there is some wage 
inflation and the driver pool is well up. One of the things you will see Frito
-
Lay do is take some pricing in the fourth quarter particularly in single served 
which I think will mitigate t
he impact of the inflation and you will see their 
margin performance return to a more normal, a more normal margin 
improvement.

trayed? Thank you.

division specific perspective and on a division specific quarterly perspective 
particularly not. I would view it as the business is both improving but i

improving in a broad based way. So watching volume alone may not be as 
meaningful as watching the combination of volume and revenue particularly 

non
-
carbs and premium produc
ts which are obviously they moved the 
needle less on volume but they moved the needle on revenue in a 
substantive way. So, again I think the message here in terms of North 
America beverage is continued sequential improvement in the overall 
business. The pr
icing will obviously help in Q4 as well and we think we are 
getting that business back on track with the investments behind the 
advertising and the innovation that we have.

to look at it from, when you look at your potential partners from a 
bowling side, if that also a consideration in your decision to keep the current

Thank you, all the best Indra. All the best, two quick questions if I can. You 
know a bit forward think in terms of snacks, it seems to me that yes, Frito is 

 
I 
would argue. We have seen a lot of the food companies coming into to 
snacks, so just help us frame how Pepsi fits in there, because from my 

and they have seen adjacencies very l
ightly maybe perhaps not to dilute the 
core, but the market seems to be moving and shifting away from salty into 
those other categories, so is that a concern how should we think about that?
 
And the second very, very brief is there room for a closer collabo
ration with 
Starbucks in the case of coffee. I mean, obviously Starbuck now is doing 
things with Nestle overseas and in the U.S. is there room for Pepsi to do 
something with Nescafe for example if you can comment on that, thank you.

Yes, Pabl

-

of salty into savory, really over the course of the past decade or more 


 
salty and into savory. I think the good 
news is the combination of our consumer insights which are broad
-
based 
around how people consume snacks, I think leads us into savory in a fairly 
effective way. The reality of it is consumers don't think in these in
dustrial 
terms like salty or savory. They think about occasions and they think about 
what they feel like eating. Frito
-
Lay's insights I think are extremely well
-
positioned to pick the right areas to go and to develop the right products to 
take advantage of
 
those consumer opportunities. And then in addition to 
that, the scale of the Frito
-
Lay operation, once a decision is made to enter a 
new subcategory, I think allows us to be very very successful very very 
quickly.
 
The scale being from the perspective of b
rands, from the production 
systems, from the distribution systems, so I think you'll see Frito
-
Lay 
continue to be very successful in the savory area. Regarding your second 
question around Starbucks, look, we've had the Starbucks partnership now 
for the bet
ter part of 20 years. It's been remarkably successful for both of 
us. I think you'll continue to see us expand and build on the relationship with 
Starbucks.

Our next question comes from the line of Robert Ottenstein of Evercore ISI.
 
Indra Nooyi
 
Good morning, Robert.
 
Robert Ottenstein
 
Good morning and congratulations. Two questions, Indra, a little bit more 
big picture. 
First, a few years ago you describe and I think you were talking 
more about the U.S. consumer is somewhat confused on health and wellness 
issues in terms of how they were viewing sugar and artificial sweeteners. I 
think there's probably three years ago. So
 
I'd loved to get an update in 
terms of your thinking about U.S. consumers is looking at the health and 
wellness space and particularly with regards to sugar and artificial 
sweeteners?
 
And then the other question is perhaps maybe give us a little bit more 
insight into your successor. Obviously he has done a fantastic job on the 
international front, but maybe a little bit of thought of kind of the things that 
he's done in his past that could be very helpful with the rest of the 
organization? Thank you.
 
Indra
 
Nooyi
 
Yes. So I'll just speak to the U.S. consumer. What we have been seeing over 
the past three years is that even though there's occasional confusion on 
artificial sweeteners good for you or not, why not real sugar. What's wrong 
with the high fructose c
orn syrup, those kinds of questions, there is a 
general trend towards health and wellness, whether its consumption of more 
zero calorie, flavored waters or drinking diet products or lower calorie 
products, there's definitely a trend towards whole grains, c
loser to nature. 
So that trend might vary in speed year
-
over
-
year, but the trend is there.
 
And as a millennials age, I think they are driving this trend more and more. 
And the availability of more healthy products whether its ready prepared 
meals or home d
elivery of anything that's healthy is actually taking away 
any barriers to buying a healthier products whether it's better for you or 
good for you products. So I think you're going to see an acceleration 
towards that trend as the years go by.
 
Now Ramon is 
an outstanding executive and you'll get a chance to get to 
know him over the next few weeks and months. The good thing is a lot of 
the trends we are seeing in the U.S. have already happened in Europe, 
whether its retail consolidation, whether its trends to
wards health and 
wellness, competition amongst all of the European food and beverage 
companies where warehouse delivered products are really have to negotiate 
to the retailers, all of those trends, Ramon is a veteran of. And he's going to 
bring all those s
kills to the United States.
 
Second as you know over the last year as President, Ramon has been 
leading the productivity program for the company, been leading innovation. 
So I think he's uniquely suited to bring a fresh pair of eyes to everything we 
do here
 
in North America while preserving its knowledge of the international 
market. Finally, he's just a good guy. I think you'll find his mix of operating 
expertise, plus his ability to think about customers, consumers, and bring 
the two together, to be refresh
ing. So get to know him. I think you will be 
very happy with what you see.

So, maybe something you will cover in your closing remarks, what will you 
have done differently should you have the opportu
nity to rewind time? And 
then more in the business, right now, your campaign, Pepsi generations and 
increased A&M behind the brand did probably enough to stabilize the brand 
Pepsi this year? Now, good thing that the campaign was probably pleasing to 
boomer
s with some nostalgia retro back, but not sure it's attracting the 
consumer into the franchise. So could you please share with us Pepsi 
specific, I mean, brand KPIs especially as 
--
 
in regards to millennial 
consumers, please?
 
Hugh Johnston
 
Yes. So as you m
ight imagine that the KPIs on Pepsi are the ones that you 
would traditionally look at. First, the highest level market share performance 
and velocities in the stores from a consumer perspective we tend to look at 
purchase intent regard relevance to consume
rs. A lot of this stuff is done 
through survey work. And we have seen over time the metrics that we 
measure while it may not be immediately responsive. They do tend to prove 
out over time sales trends both positively and negatively.
 
And the good news is wh
at we are starting to see are given the increases in 
advertising early green shoots of improvement in those performance 
metrics, that again do overtime tend to correlate with sales performance.
 
Indra Nooyi
 
Thank you all for your questions. Just, let me mak
e some closing comments. 
After 12 years at the helm of the company, today is my final day as CEO. It 
ends my 24
-
year career as a PepsiCo Executive. I have been blessed to have 
had the opportunity to lead such a great company and work with such 
incredible p
eople including our outstanding board, executives and other 
associates, our customers and other partners, our shareholders and all our 
other stakeholders.
 
You know 12 years is a long time as a CEO, and even though I have a lot of 
fuel still left in my tank
. I wanted to do something different with my life. 
Spend more time with my family and give the next generation in PepsiCo a 
chance to lead this great company.
 
Throughout my tenure however, we've strived to achieve a difficult balance 
between attending to s
hort term pressures while managing for the long
-
term. And I'll leave today proud of the work our team has done. We were 
pioneers in business sustainability and social responsibility and embedded 
the sense of purpose in everything PepsiCo does guided by our
 
Performance 
with Purpose philosophy. We have transformed our product portfolio by 
growing our good for you and better for you option from about 38% of 
revenue in 2006 to roughly 50% in 2017.
 
We more than doubled our investment in research and 
development to 
expand our more nutritious offerings and minimize our environmental 
impact. We became an even more valued partner to our retail customers. 
We were selected as a number one food and beverage supply in the United 
States in the most recent 2017
 
Advantage Report and named Best
-
in
-
Class 
Manufacturer by Kantar for the second year in a row.
 
We've made positive contributions to communities around the globe in which 
we operate through our support of access to clean drinking water, human 
rights, nutrit
ion, agricultural programs and many more initiatives. And we 
invested significantly new capabilities in areas like design and e
-
commerce 
to better position our company for a successful future.
 
In the midst of managing the business for the long
-
term, we als
o delivered 
strong and consistent financial performance specifically during the period 
2006 to 2017. Net revenue grew more than 80%. We added a new billion 
dollar brand almost every other year. We returned $79 billion to 
shareholders through dividends and 
share repurchases. Our market 
capitalization increased by $68 billion. Dividends per share nearly tripled 
from $1.16 to $3.17, and we generated total shareholder return of 162%.
 
Finally and very importantly, we have been on Ethisphere's list of most 
ethica
l companies for the past 12 years. For all of this I am grateful to my 
outstanding PepsiCo associates who gave so much to PepsiCo and me over 
the past 12 years.

with a review of our third 
quarter 2014 performance and outlook and then 
we will move on to Q&A. We have kept our comments brief this morning and 
intend to conclude the call by 08:45 and we will do our best to get to as 
many of your questions as we can.
 
Before we begin, please take 
note of our cautionary statement. This 
conference call includes forward
-
looking statements, including statements 
regarding 2014 guidance and our long
-
term targets based on currently 
available information. Forward
-
looking statements inherently involve risks
 
and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from 
those predicted in such forward
-
looking statements. Statements made on 
this conference call should be considered together with cautionary 
statements and other information cont

in our most recent periodic reports filed with the SEC.
 
Unless otherwise indicated, all references to EPS and operating profit growth 
are on a core basis. In addition, references to organic revenue results in this 
call
 
exclude the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, structural changes 
and foreign exchange translation. To find disclosures and reconciliations of

comprises the 12 weeks ended Septem
ber 6, for our North American 
operations in the months of June, July and August for most of our operations 
outside North America. As you saw in the release, we are no longer reporting 
PepsiCo Americas Foods as a business unit. Consistent with our prior 
pra
ctice, we continue to report results for the divisions that had comprised 
PAF, namely Frito
-
Lay North America, Quaker Foods North America, and 
Latin America Foods. This change does not have any impact on the overall 
results of PepsiCo or these divisions. A
lso reflected in our Q3 2014 core 
earnings results are aggregate gains associated with the divestitures of 
approximately $34 million and a $23 million impairment of a brand in 
Greece.
 

 
Indra Nooyi
 
Thank you, J
amie and good morning everyone. We are pleased with our 
results for the quarter and year
-
to
-
date, particularly given the continued 
macro challenges we see across the globe. Specifically in developed 
markets, the consumer category demand continues to be slu
ggish and in 
developing and emerging markets, there is continued macro and political 
volatility, most notably in Eastern Europe, the Middle East and a number of 
markets in Latin America. In other key emerging markets, China, India and 
Brazil even though th
e political environments are relatively stable, GDP and 
consumer spending growth remains mixed.
 
Despite these challenges, our businesses performed well in the third quarter 
and year
-
to
-
date. Global volume grew in both snacks and beverages in the 
quarter an
d year
-
to
-
date. Organic net revenue grew at a rate ahead of 
volume in the quarter and year
-
to
-
date reflecting execution of effective 
revenue management strategies and successful introduction of innovative 
new products.
 
In the quarter, organic revenue grew 
3.1% with developing and emerging 
markets up high single
-
digits led by key contributions from the BRIC 
markets. And notably, our developing and emerging markets business has 
proven to be resilient with high single
-
digit organic revenue growth year
-
to
-
date,
 
including double
-
digit growth in Egypt and India, high single
-
digit 
growth in China, Brazil and Turkey, and mid single
-
digit growth in Russia.
 
In North America, Frito
-
Lay led performance with 3% organic revenue 
growth in the quarter and year
-
to
-
date. And 
core gross and operating 
margins both expanded by 45 basis points in the quarter aided by the 
benefits of our global productivity initiatives. Year
-
to
-
date, core gross 
margin expanded 50 basis points and core operating margin expanded 35 
basis points.
 
Over
all, core constant currency EPS grew 11% in the quarter driven by the 
solid operating performance supplemented by responsible financial 
management. Importantly, these results have translated to strong cash 
generation and consequently strong cash returns to
 
shareholders. Returning 
capital to shareholders is a top priority and we are pleased to report that 
year
-
to
-
date we have returned $6 billion to shareholders in the form of 
dividends and share repurchases and we remain on track to return a total of 
$8.7 bi
llion to shareholders in 2014, which is a 35% increase over our 2013 
shareholder cash returns.
 
Based on the strength of our year
-
to
-
date results and our outlook for the 
fourth quarter, we raised our full year core constant currency EPS growth 
target to 9% 
from 8% previously. We believe our year
-
to
-
date performance 

environment, retailers value the benefits of partners with strong brands and 
high velocity products that drive traffic, b
uild basket size and generate 

business with PepsiCo. And as a company, we continue to strengthen our 
business to position it for continued successful performance well into the 
futu
re. And we are encouraged by the progress we are making in three 
areas, in particular: first, leveraging our complementary product portfolio 
and global scale; second, product and packaging innovation; and third, 
productivity.
 
So, let me give you a quick up
date on each of these areas and share some 
of the tangible evidence we are seeing as proof of our progress starting with 
how we are increasingly leveraging the complementary nature of our 
products and brands. A case in point is Mountain Dew and Doritos. De
w and 
Doritos have extremely high co
-
purchase incidence. In the U.S., over 60% of 
Mountain Dew households buy Doritos. Both brands are deeply rooted in 
gaming with legacies of high engagement partnerships and activations 
around Blockbuster video games. In 
the U.S. this fall, Dew and Doritos are 
giving consumers access to Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare. They are going 
to give them exclusive in
-
game gear, double XP and rapid supply rewards.
 
And all of this is to dial up their gaming experience. Only Mountain 
Dew and 
Doritos consumers will be able to unlock these coveted advantages and 
customize their gaming experience through the Fuel Up for Battle promotion. 
A number of our largest customers will run better together programs linked 
to this promotion and we ar
e concurrently reintroducing on a limited time 
basis a true gamer favorite, Mountain Dew Game Fuel, in original citrus 
cherry and a new lemonade flavor.
 
Across many of our international markets, we are focused on driving greater 
co
-
purchase incidence of La
ys and Pepsi with joint packaging graphics, 
sports properties, point
-
of
-
sale material, ad copy and promotions. These 
cross branding activations are now taking place in many of our key markets 
across the globe. For example, Poland, we created excitement for
 
the Lays 

was supported by ads and point
-
of
-
sale material featuring the soccer great 
Lionel Messi.
 
Similarly in Colombia, we ran joint Lays, Pepsi and Tropicana Quaker soccer 
team prom
otions offering discounts and prized for joint purchases in the 
organized way. And across the Middle East, we had great success of our joint 
Lays Pepsi promotions during the Ramadan season. In addition to the 
commercial benefits afforded by these cross cat
egory promotions, we 
continued to yield cost synergies through continued integration. For 
example, integrating our snack and beverage media sourcing in China, fully 
consolidating and integrating our administrative functions under one roof in 
Russia and con
solidating common carriers for snacks and beverages in the 

 
The second area is product and package innovation. We continued to make 
very good progress. As evidenced on a rolling four quarter 
basis our 
innovation as a percentage of sales is steadily increasing and is up 90 basis 
points versus the comparable year ago period. And in our biggest markets, 
the United States, we were the largest contributor to retail sales food and 
beverage growth bo
th in the third quarter and year
-
to
-
date which really 
benefited from the strength of our innovation. And we are seeing innovation 
success across brands and geographies. For example, at Frito
-
Lay North 
America we launched our 2014 Lays Do Us a Flavor campai
gn. And this 
followed its past success in the U.S. and 12 other markets around the globe. 

& Cheese, Mango Salsa and Wasabi Ginger hot bite. This program helped to 
drive strong mid
-
s
ingle digit Lays net revenue growth in the third quarter.
 
At Quaker Foods North America we have launched Quaker Express Cups to 
capitalize on the ever growing demand for greater on
-
the
-
go convenience. 
And Quaker Warm & Crunchy Granola which delivers both t
he wholesome 
goodness of Quaker oatmeal and the satisfying crunch of multigrain Granola. 
So while center of the store category growth remains challenged the success 
of these and other new products launched by Quaker have contributed to 
value share gains in
 

-
To
-
Eat Cereal and Snack Bars both in the quarter and year
-
to
-
date.
 
Our North American beverage business has strong innovation in both 
product and packaging. Over the past several years we have significantl
y 
increased the variety of primary and secondary package configurations. With 
greater packaging flexibility we now have more tools in our kit to drive price 
utilization and higher margins through the price back management. The case 
in point is our 12 ounce
 
glass bottle which sells at more than 100% premium 
with 12 ounce can. And our innovation has become increasingly more 
durable. For example, a number of 2012 and 2013 introductions Tostitos 
Cantina, Mountain Dew Kickstart, Lipton Pure Leaf have all achieve
d more 
than $100 million in retail sales in their launch year and have generated 
double
-
digit retail sales growth in their second year. Our beverage product 
and packaging innovation in the U.S. has led to improved sales, improved 
net price utilization and 
improved market share performance.
 
We held LRB value share in measured channels in the third quarter and 
year
-
to
-
date, held CSDs at retail in the third quarter led by trademark 
Mountain Dew and gained or held value share in a number of important sub
-
catego
ries including CSDs, sports drinks, ready
-
to
-
drink tea and unflavored 
water. And in our international markets we are both leveraging our global 
scale and capitalizing on local insights to fuel innovation. For example, within 
snacks since its initial U.S. i
ntroduction in 2012, Doritos Jacked has launched 
in 10 international markets. We also lifted and shifted a larger and thicker 
cut chip with deep ridges which originated from our Ruffles brand and 
lunched it into several key countries such as Russia, Brazil
, the Middle East 
and India under the Lays Max brand. And in the UK, we launched a new 
range of premium potato, tortilla and pita chips under the Market Deli brand. 
The Market Deli brand really caters to local taste preferences with flavors 
such as balsami
c vinegar of Modena and Wiltshire cured ham, mature 
cheddar and farmhouse chutney.
 
Within beverages, the SPIRE family of digital fountain dispensers continues 
to build momentum. Currently, SPIRE is in the United States, Canada, 
France, Turkey, Ireland and 
Switzerland. The equipment capabilities range 
from pouring 8 brands and 4 flavor shots to a maximum of 16 brands and 8 
flavor shots resulting in over 1,000 flavor combinations. And the global 
expansion of our highly successful Mountain Dew franchise contin
ues. The 
brand has expanded to two new markets in 2014 and it is now available in 
over 40 countries around the world. And we have built terrific brand 
recognition with the continued expansion of our DEWmocracy and Dew Tour 
support programs.
 
And finally, tu
rning to productivity, we achieved our targeted productivity 
savings for the third quarter and year
-
to
-
date and we are on track to 
achieve a full year target of $1 billion in savings. This year, we expect to 
successfully complete the 3
-
year $3 billion prod
uctivity program we 

-
year 
$5 billion productivity program announced earlier this year, which we expect 
will extend annual savings of $1 billion through 2019.
 
Our next generation productivity
 
will focus on four areas: first, embedding 
more automation in our operations to replace labor with capital and at the 
same time removing bottlenecks from our operations, which will increase 
capacity utilization; second, expanding shared services, includin
g global 
financial shared services for the handling of routine back office transaction 
processing; third, restructuring manufacturing to optimize our global 
manufacturing footprint; and fourth, restructuring our go
-
to
-
market systems 
to optimize our distrib
ution network. As a result of these initiatives, we 
expect to see continued improvement in net revenue and core earnings 
before interest and taxes per employee as well as margin expansions and 
increase returns in invested capital.
 
So, to conclude, we feel 
pretty good about our results for the quarter and 
year
-
to
-
date. We remain focused on generating cash and providing 
attractive cash returns to our shareholders and we are encouraged by the 
continued progress we have made to strengthen our business, which we
 
expect will make our performance all the more durable and reliable looking 
to the future.
 
With that, let me turn the call over to Hugh Johnston. Hugh?
 
Hugh Johnston
 
Great, thank you Indra and good morning, everyone. Let me spend a few 
minutes 
discussing the quarter and our upwardly revised core constant 
currency earnings per share outlook for 2014. For Q3, organic revenue grew 
3%. On a reported basis, net revenue was 2% versus year ago, reflecting 1 
point of unfavorable foreign exchange transla
tion. Commodity costs had low 
single
-
digit inflation. Our core gross margin and core operating margin each 
rose 45 basis points. Core constant currency operating profit grew 5.5%. 
Our core effective tax rate was 24.2%. Our diluted share count declined 2% 
r
eflecting the benefits of our ongoing share repurchase program and core 
constant currency EPS grew 11%.
 
On a rolling four quarter basis, our net capital spending is 4.1% of sales, 
which is well within our long
-
term target of less than or equal to 5% of net
 
revenue and our core net return on invested capital improved by 
approximately 40 basis points and now stands at 16.9%. And we returned 
$6 billion to shareholders in the first three quarters in the form of dividends 
and share repurchases, which is almost 3
0% above year ago levels and 
reflective of our commitment to return cash to shareholders.
 
Turning to guidance, as Indra mentioned, we have increased our full year 
core constant currency EPS growth target to 9%, up from 8% previously. In 
addition for the fu
ll year, we expect mid single
-
digit organic revenue growth, 
low single
-
digit commodity inflation and productivity savings of 
approximately $1 billion. Below the division operating profit line, we expect 
corporate cost efficiencies driven by productivity in
itiatives, a core effective 
tax rate of approximately 25% and a reduced share count from our share 
repurchase program. Foreign exchange is expected to negatively impact net 
revenue by 3 percentage points and core earnings per share by 4 percentage 
points f
or the full year 2014 based on current market consensus rates. 
Taking our 2013 core EPS of $4.37 and applying our guidance implies a 
2014 core EPS of approximately $4.57.
 
As you model out the fourth quarter, I would ask you to consider the 
following. We ex
pect advertising and marketing expense to grow at a rate 
ahead of net revenue growth. And below the operating profit line, net 
interest expense is expected to increase in the fourth quarter, primarily 
reflecting higher debt balances and higher rates. From 
a cash flow 
perspective, we continue to expect full year free cash flow excluding certain 
items of more than $7 billion. We will continue to drive cash flow through 
efficient working capital management and continued tight controls over 
capital spending. Ne
t capital spending is expected to be approximately $3 
billion, which is well within our long
-
term target of less than or equal to 5% 
of net revenue. And we expect to return approximately $8.7 billion to 
shareholders in 2014, a 35% increase over 2013 throug
h $3.7 billion in 
dividends and $5 billion in share repurchases.
 
So, to summarize, we have increased our core constant currency EPS growth 
outlook for the full year 2014 to 9% from 8% previously. We expect to drive 
improved full year margins and net ROIC a
nd disciplined capital allocation 
and returning cash to shareholders remain top priorities for the company.
 
With that, operator, we will take the first question.

A question just about the balance betwee
n reinvestment in the business and 
the focus on productivity and dropping it to the bottom line, if you look at 


 
good 
relative organic sales growth relative to lot of your competitors and peers 
with also driving some margin improvement? And I guess as you move into 
this next productivity program and also just some of the challenges you are 
facing I guess in some key
 
markets, developing markets at least in the next 
year, macro challenges. Can you just sort of give us a sense for how you feel 
about that current balance of investment in A&M, in R&D, in selling 
effectiveness or selling systems versus dropping some of tha
t to the bottom 
line? Do you feel like you have the right balance and especially as things 
maybe get a little bit more challenging in some of these markets, do you feel 
like you might have to tweak that balance into next year?
 
Indra Nooyi
 


balance. We increased A&M spending. We are running at about 5.9% of 
sales. We increased R&D spending significantly over the past 3 to 4 years, 
because we really believe that investing in R&D in
 
particular is critical to the 
future success of the company and we invested in that. We invested in 

very successful today. So, at this point, we feel good about the investments 
we are 
making in product line transformation, media spending, advertising 
spending against our brands, and most importantly, long
-
term investment in 
R&D platforms. I agree with you that there is volatility in the world. And as 
we sort of model out 2015 and beyond
, we will come back and talk about 
what the outlook is for the financials, but at this point, we feel comfortable 
with what we have articulated in terms of the long
-
term algorithm for the 
company and we feel comfortable about our productivity programs. So,
 
I 
think we have to watch and wait.

John Faucher

JPMorgan
 
Thanks. I wanted to follow
-
up on 

 
good morning Indra. I want to follow
-
up 
on some of the comments about raw materials
, but also sort of start off with 
pricing in that context which is getting a lot of pricing in Latin America which 
is helping the organic revenue number. And I guess can you talk a little bit 
about what you have seen from a real pricing standpoint in Latin
 
America 
not just related to the FX. And then as you look out over the next sort of 12 
to 18 months on raw materials, have you 

 
we have seen some favorable 
movements in things like corn or are you guys still sort of continuing that 
process of trying to ca
pture some of that benefits through the hedging, can 
you talk about how we should look at that going forward? Thanks.
 
Indra Nooyi
 
Go ahead Hugh.
 
Hugh Johnston
 

we are obviously as is
 
everyone else in this space benefiting from the 
relatively high overall inflationary environment there, what I can tell you is 
we are getting positive real pricing there and it is in line with what you 
would see the commodities basket cost growing in thos
e markets. So if you 
look at it more from a global perspective and think about commodities 
inflation from a global perspective, we are getting pricing in line with that on 
a more real basis. Regarding your broader question on commodities without 
a doubt th
e commodities numbers overall are coming down. The couple of 
facts I would remind you on that. Number one, we have a very, very broad 
basket not one commodity accounts for even 10% of our overall 
commodities basket. Number two we do continue to follow the 
forward 
buying strategy that we have had in the past, so we tend to be about six to 
nine months out. So as those prices come down we will tend to see them 
reflected in our basket over time. We do that again because we want to give 
the businesses and our cu

effective strategy for us over the last few years.
 
And number three, people tend to focus on a few market traded 
commodities, those market traded commodities represents somewhere 
between 30% or 40% of our
 
overall basket. So I am not sure often times 
that the market focused commodities give a full picture of it. In terms of 


 
guidance 

because it tends to create more confusion than benefit.

Our next question comes from the line of Ali Dibadj with Bernstein.

Hey guys.
 
Indra Nooyi
 
Good morning Ali.
 
Ali Dibadj

So your organic sales growth was about 3% which translated to the core 
constant currency operating profit of about 5.5% and an EPS growth of 
about 11% and if you look at the gaps between top line operati
ng profit and 
EPS growth rates seems to be widening more and more as the quarters 
progress here. So can you please give us a quantification of first how much 
of the operating profit to sales gap was negative commodities and negative 
mix versus cost cutting
 
positive and acquisition divesture is positive which 
for some reason you guys keep considering core. And second how 
sustainable is the operating profit to EPS growth gap driven by lower net 
interest expense even though there is a little bit of higher debt
 
it looks like 
the lower net interest expense and buyback and the spirit of the question to 
understand sustainability of these gaps? Thanks.
 
Indra Nooyi
 
Thanks Ali. I am going to have Hugh walk you through the details and I 
presume the first thing you are 

good results. So with that let me turn it to you Hugh.
 
Hugh Johnston
 
Yes, absolutely Indra. So if you look over the last three quarters we have 
seen operating profit growth on a core constant currency basis of
 
7%, 3% 
and 5.5%. We have seen EPS growth of 10%, 3% and 11%. So I think that 
gap has been actually relatively constant over the course of the timeframe. 
What are the drivers between operating profit growth and EPS you really 
have three things going on? In
terest cost without a doubt we are getting 
some leverage on that. The only thing that I would want to share on that 
front is we are operating right now in a zero net floating debt environment. 
We do have some floating debt but that is offset by floating ca
sh held 
outside the U.S.
 
So, I think from the standpoint of rising interest rates, we are relatively well 
protected compared to most of our peer companies in that regard. Obviously 
like everyone else, we would have some refinancing over time, but I think 
w
e have adopted a relatively conservative posture on the way that we are 
managing fixed float within the balance sheet. Number two, taxes are really 

for this year. And then numbe
r three, our share repurchase is obviously 


company we have a long history of share repurchase and I would certa
inly 
expect we would continue that going forward.
 
Indra Nooyi
 
In terms of sustainability, Hugh, I mean our long

term guidance has been 
mid single
-
digit operating profit and high single

the envelope in which we are operating.
 
Hu

Absolutely.

Good morning, Dara.
 
Dara Mohsenian

Morgan Stanley
 
Hey, good morning guys. So, Frito
-
Lay organic revenue growth improved a 
bit sequen
tially in the quarter, but the 3% result is still below the 4% to 5% 


 
do you think this level is kind of more like a new normal here in your mind 
given the difficult consumer envi
ronment or do you think you can accelerate 
that business going forward? And can you discuss Frito
-
Lay market share 
performance in North America, it looks like you are still losing slight share in 
track channels and your expectations going forward from a ma
rket share 
standpoint?
 
Indra Nooyi
 
Yes. Dara, I think overall in Q3, food industry sales in retail was challenging. 
And within that, Frito
-
Lay performed well, in fact, was the best performer in 
that group. And sequentially from the first quarter of the yea
r to the third 
quarter, the share loss has narrowed. Now, let me be clear, the share loss is 

come in and out of the market. And Frito has been very careful not to react 
to players 
who are not long
-
term players in the marketplace. So, Frito has 
been playing a very, very responsible game. What we have been trying to do 

expanding the shoulders of the busi
ness in a profitable way.
 
And I think Frito in this very difficult environment has done a very good job 

you have seen relatively steady performance from Frito in what I would 
consider 
is a very challenging overall retail environment for all kinds of food. 
I mean, center of the store is particularly challenged, but I would say 
overall, food industry sales are challenged, but Frito has been a shining star. 
So, I think overall whether this
 

depends on the overall environment, but within this environment, Frito has 
been performing quite well and the share losses have been coming down. 

 
but we have to 

been doing.
 
Hugh Johnston
 
And in terms of addressing those premium innovation opportunities, we have 

zel Crisps, 
you see products like Smartfood Selects, all of which are entering that 
premium space and to

date we have been quite successful with them. So, 
we would certainly expect to see that aspect improving over time.

Hey, the first one is just sort of like a curiosity question, because currencies 
obviously 
moved a ton over the last couple of months, but you kept your 
currency outlook on the EPS line. So, I am just trying to figure out if it was 

currency item? And then the second question is
 
just 

 

tough one to answer, but do you guys have a view on some of these 
contemplated consumption taxes in California? I mean, they sound pretty 
significant, some of them are couple of cents an ounce and it looks like there 
is a decent pr
obability they are going to go through, so how do you kind of 
operate the business in that kind of environment?
 
Indra Nooyi
 
I will speak to the second point and then Hugh will speak to the first one. I 
believe discriminatory taxes on certain categories are
 
just wrong. I think we 
have to understand what the issue is we are trying to address and address it 
in a holistic way. We will make our case and hope that the voters are 
sensible enough to look at the right answer to address whatever issue they 
are addres
sing. With that, let me turn it over to Hugh.
 
Hugh Johnston
 
Yes. Bill, happy to answer the currency question, we take a basket of market 
currency rates and we follow the same methodology every quarter. And we 
have been consistent in taking that approach fo
r quite a number of years. So 


the best way I know of to do it. In addition to that as you all li
kely know we 
do hedge some transactional effects of foreign exchange, we do not hedge

Nicolaus.
 
Mark Swartzberg

Stifel Nicolaus
 
Yes. Thanks. Good morning Indra. Good morning Hugh. A question on the 

 

ut with the core earnings you are including 
gains and they are not large this quarter but can you just speak to the 
principle behind including these gains on asset sales?
 
Hugh Johnston
 

heme 
of things there are three items. There is a small gain in the Quaker business 
related to the sale of a small cereal brand. There is a small gain from a 
bottling perspective in EMEA. And then there is the write
-
down of a small 
brand in Greece from an a
sset impairment perspective. If you net all of 
those three factors the grand total was a benefit to earnings of $11 million, 
so basically less than a penny of impact overall. More broadly, we do have a 
consistent set of principles we apply in terms of what
 
is core versus non
-
core 
in the overall scheme of things it really is not a substantive impact to 
earnings.
 
Mark Swartzberg 
-
 
Stifel Nicolaus
 

large in the quarter but it could bec
ome something we are all talking about if 
it 

 
because of the principle being there, if there is a large gain at some 
point in the future or for that matter a large loss?
 
Hugh Johnston
 
Yes.
 
Indra Nooyi
 
Mark, most importantly we publicly disclosed exactly w
hat the gains are and 
if there are any charges against it so you can model out the impact on 
earnings from our disclosures.
 
Hugh Johnston
 
Yes. So and Mark to your point that there is obviously in a company the size 
of PepsiCo with $66 billion in revenue, 2
75,000 employees and operating in 
almost 200 countries there are lots of things that you would consider to be 
perhaps one
-
time in nature. The approach that we have taken on this is we 
have said in terms of a test of core versus non
-
core is a transaction on
e
-
time and then is it of a certain size. If we called everything above $1 million 
one
-
time we would be excluding an enormous number of items. So we have 
drawn a line in terms of the specific number that it equates to core versus 
non
-
core that number has be
en the same for years and we applied 
consistently in all of these transactions to your point are small but we do 
disclose them to allow investors to model them anyway they choose.

So, I guess a lot of just volatility around Europe in terms of the macro and 
political standpoint, so wanted to just get a little bit more color from your 
perspective what you are seeing in terms of underlying consumer demand in 
your various categories in 
markets like Russia and Eastern Europe. And it 
looks like your market share in markets like UK despite tough competitive 
environments actually doing pretty well, so maybe just talk about Russia and 
Eastern Europe and then separately in the UK in the contex
t of the 
competitive and tough retail environments?
 
Indra Nooyi
 
Let me talk overall about Western Europe and then talk about Russia and 
Ukraine. I would say when you have poor weather or when you have some 
macro factor we have to worry about how we perform
 
in that environment. 
So for example Western Europe volumes in beverage decelerated a bit in Q3 
because the weather was poor, but otherwise I would say the overall 
Western European markets are doing quite well. Yes, we have a retail 

interesting in the UK, but our brands are strong and we 
are powering through that.
 
When it comes to Russia and Ukraine, again, we sell dairy products, juice as 
well as snacks and soft drinks. Dairy and juice tend to be much more stable 
kind of products for
 
Russian consumers. So, even though the Russian 
market is going through its challenges in terms of the devaluation of the 
ruble and the hryvnia in Ukraine and also inflation in raw materials for dairy 
in particular, our top line growth is still mid single
-
digit. So, we are holding 

line? A lot of the products we sell in Russia are made in Russia. We sourced 
a lot of our raw materials from local suppliers. So that part is okay, but 

and then any translation of Russian profit is impacted by the devaluation of 
the ruble. So, at this point, we are watching and waiting and to see how the 
Russian market evolves, b
ut our growth is still in the mid single
-
digits and 
we are doing okay.

Good morning. So, couple of questions from my end. I was just curious if 
maybe you can provide some context on PAB in terms of how the up and 
down the street channel did versus kind of the larger format? And if you 
could provide 
any perspective on foodservice since you have been investing 
there so heavily? And then the second question is Indra just curious on your 
view on execution at the company on bottling operations and if you think 
that, that is an area of improvement for Peps
iCo going forward within the 
U.S.?
 
Indra Nooyi
 
Yes. When it comes to the performance in convenience stores, the overall 

 

mentioned in my prepared remarks, what we feel good abou
t in Q3 is that 
we held LRB share in this highly competitive marketplace. I think since we 
bought back the bottlers, we have actually been able to do a few things. 
One, we have invested in foodservice, because we have put routes back into 
local foodservice
. We are able to go after national accounts without any 
discussion of bottlers versus the parent company. And as a consequence, we 
have been winning big accounts and we are beginning to actually increase 
our shares in colleges and universities and local fo
odservice accounts. So, I 
think our foodservice performance is improving. Again, as you know in 

got to build this business very, very steadily, so that you balance growth 
with profi
table growth. And so I think over the next few years, you start 
beginning to see meaningful contributions from our foodservice business, 
one because we are fixing the core beverage foodservice business, which is 
a critical driver of foodservice and then we
 
are able to leverage that 
beverage foodservice to sell more snacks. So, the better together really 
works with foodservice.
 
And overall execution, we have 

 
since we have bought back the bottlers we 
have invested so much in terms of improving our manufactu
ring lines to 
have more packaging flexibility. We have put more routes back in the 
marketplace. We have put in more tools 

 
given more tools to the frontlines, 
so that they can actually sell better at the point of sale. I think overall our 
execution has im

quarters now, where we are holding share in the LRB category and we are 
doing it in a very responsible way, because we are also able to get pricing. 
We are getting low single
-
digit pricing in the 
marketplace in North America 
and we are able to push through all our innovation. I mean, the market is 

completely aligned with the brand company, so that you can get all this 
inno
vation into the marketplace. And by removing any friction that exists in 
the system, we are actually able to get all of our products to the 
marketplace. So, overall, we feel pretty good about the progress we are 
making in North American beverages and how w
ell North American 
beverages and Frito
-
Lay are working together to really service both retail 
customers and foodservice customers to help us improve the performance of 
North American beverages substantially. And in terms of convenience store

Ladies and gentlemen, we have time for one additional question. Your final 
question comes from the line of Steve Powers with UBS.
 
Steve Powers 
-
 
UBS
 
Thanks. Good morning. I guess two more 
questions related to PAB if I could. 
First, we saw a noticeable operating margin expansion in that division this 
quarter building on some initial progress made last quarter. And I guess just 
want to get your sense for whether or not you feel this is the be
ginning of a 
trend that can continue to gain momentum and assuming so what the 
biggest drivers will be is kind of question number one. Question two, related 
to that is as you said Indra we saw again kind of 1% net realized pricing in 
the quarter which is i
n line with the year
-
to
-
date trend and I guess positive 
relative to muted commodities, but I was wondering whether you see further 
upsides of that number over time maybe if the individual categories are 
actually better than and we are seeing some negative 
category or 
geographic mix across the division I am not sure, but just further details 
there will be helpful as well? Thanks.
 
Indra Nooyi
 
Yes. I mean I think what the beverage business is doing is focusing on 
revenue management and productivity in addition
 
to innovation. Innovation 
is driving top line growth nicely and getting good price realization. And all of 
our revenue management initiatives backed up by more packing flexibility is 
actually helping this business. And remember all of our productivity 
ini
tiatives touch the North American beverage business too. So taken 
together the business is beginning to hit its stride and our net realized 
pricing in the quarter in North American beverages was in the low
-
single 
digits. We actually feel very good about th
e pricing that we have been able 
to get. Now you asked about the sustainability of this. We will continue to do 
the revenue management work, the productivity work, the innovation. We 

e to 
play a very responsible game in this marketplace. And then we will just see 
how the marketplace evolves. But at this point we are cautiously optimistic 
about the outlook for North American beverages.
 
So let me just close by reiterating that we are ple
ased with our results to
-
date. We are confident that our plans are working and we are on track to 
deliver our financial targets for 2014. I thank you for your time and 
questions this morning and for the confidence you have placed in us with 
your investment

Thanks, Jamie. I'm pleased to report that our businesses continued to 
perform well in the second quarter. We had more than 2% organic volume 
grow
th in both global snacks and global beverages. While foreign exchange 
translations continued to pressure our reported revenue results, we 
delivered more than 3% organic revenue growth led by Frito
-
Lay North 
America, AMENA, and Latin America.
 
ESSA delivered
 
operating margin expansion together with increased A&M 
investment. North American beverages delivered solid net price realization 
and margin expansion. And Quaker Foods North America had very strong net 
revenue and operating profit growth.
 
And positive ne
t pricing and continued execution of our productivity agenda, 
including the implementation of our smart spending program, drove 80 basis 
points of core operating margin expansion. At the same time, we continued 
to invest in advertising and marketing, which
 
increased 50 basis points as a 
percentage of sales in the second quarter.
 
And our performance was well balanced by market type. Our developing and 
emerging markets businesses grew organic revenue almost 7% for the 
quarter, with double
-
digit organic revenu
e growth in China, Mexico, 
[indiscernible], and Egypt.
 
And our developed markets growth was led by the United States where we 
grew revenue more than 2%. In fact, on a standalone basis, Frito
-
Lay was 
the largest contributor to growth at retail and gained va
lue share in both 
salty and macro snacks. North American beverages maintained its value 
share leadership and possesses five of the ten top beverage trademarks 
based on dollar sales 

 
Pepsi, Mountain Dew, Gatorade, Lipton, and 
Starbucks. And Quaker gained a
lmost 1.5 value share points in hot cereal, 
while accounting for 100% of category retail sales growth.

On the strength of our year

Let me touch on each briefly. F

are enabling us to provide consumers the delicious and convenient products 
they want and to satisfy their constantly

evolving demands across a broad 
spectrum of occasions in each stage. We have ramped up our in
novation 
engine.
 
And as a result, new products comprise approximately 9% of sales or over 

simultaneously tailoring products to appeal to local tastes, addressing 

nds for convenient taste and variety from the 
occasional treat to nutrition by transforming our product portfolio.
 
So, today, what we refer to as guilt

craft, niche, and premium products. So, for example, in beverages, Gatorade 
continues to innovate in the new areas of sports hydration with the

Mountain Dew Black Label, a deeper, darker dew, made with real sugar and 
crafted with dark berry flavor and herbal bitters. Mountai
n Dew Black Label 
is for those times the DEW Nation wants to live it up with a touch of class.
 
Dew Black Label is initially released exclusively at approximately 600 
colleges and universities, giving students the first taste of the unique 
beverage and dema
nd for the product built as word quickly spread across 
social media.
 
Along with the nationwide release of Mountain Dew Black Label, the brand is 
extending its boldly refined campaign. It started with activation during the 
South by Southwest Music Conferenc
e and festival in Austin, which included 
the Mountain Dew Black Label parlor, a South by Southwest takeover 
concept, and product seating at local bars and venues. The campaign 
continued with the release of a new digital spot called Gentlemen of the 
Jacket.
 
The content showcases different gentlemen skaters including Dew 
athlete and pro skateboarder, Theotis Beasley, mixologist and gamers, all 
crossing over to the classer side of Dew with the help of putting on a unique 
jacket, transforming world therein to b

itself, yet still getting at the heart of all things Dew.
 
In the second quarter, we also launched Aquafina Sparkling, a new line of

years of cola making expertise to present a great t

experience. 1893 is a blend of premium kola nut extract, real sugar, and 
sparkling water available in two delicious flavors, Original and Ginger Cola. 
1893 can be enjoyed as a delicious standalone beverage and is also the 
perfect 
complement for cocktails.
 
In the Quaker business, because consumers are increasingly seeking greater 
convenience, portability and nutrition in their breakfast, we've introduced 
Quaker breakfast Flats, crispy baked snack bars that contain delicious 
ingredie
nts that you can see, like oats, real pieces of food, crunchy nut, 
flakes and sunflower seeds. Each serving contains 18 grams of whole grains, 
with less than 200 calories and no artificial flavors or added colors. Quaker 
Breakfast Flats comes in three deli
cious flavors, including Cranberry Almond, 
Banana Honey Nut, and Golden Raisin Cinnamon.
 
Turning to Frito

Lay, we continue to expand our portfolio with a particular 
focus on premium offerings and healthy snacking options. So, for example,

Black Bean Chips made from real black beans. It's non

GMO project verified. 
And Simply TOSTITOS Black Bean Chips offer consumers an excellent source 
of fiber with 5 grams per 1 ounce serving.
 
And 
this Simply line has also introduced Simply TOSTITOS Organic Chunky 
Medium Salsa and Simply TOSTITOS Organic Black Bean and Corn Mild 
Salsa. And both salsa varieties are USDA

certified organic.
 
Sunchips has introduced Veggie Harvest Farmhouse Ranch Flavore
d Veggie 
and Wholegrain and Veggie Harvest Tomato, Basil and Cheese Flavored 
Veggie and Wholegrain. And both are made with real veggies and whole 
grains.
 
And Smartfood has introduced Smartfood Delight sea

salted caramel 
flavored popcorn which offers 50% le

leveraging automation and advanced technology, as well as the development 
and deployment of global best practices, all to make our supply chain more 
efficient.
 
Let me just give you a few examples from the hundreds of supply chain

packaging line speeds by up to 50%, while at the same time eliminating the 
bottleneck to total production lines and sign

To improve our water use efficiency, we have developed and are 
implementing technology and processes that capture sugar and starch from 
wastewater streams. The waste sugars and starches are then sold as 
byproduct. The result
ing water stream can then be repurposed for secondary 
manufacturing uses such as sanitation. This not only generates incremental 
cash flow and saves money, it also reduces our water usage to advance our 
sustainability agenda.
 
Our global operations group is
 
identifying and then lifting and shifting best 
practices developed by our manufacturing teams around the world. For 
example, our manufacturing team in Romania developed a refinement to our 
potato cutting process that can reduce raw potato waste by up to 2

a singular goal of generating sustainable shareholder value for the long

With that, let me turn the call over to Hugh Johnston. Hugh?
 
Hugh Johnston
 
Thank you, Indra. And good morning, everyone. As I

pleased with the financial results for the first half and we have a positive 
outlook for our performance for the balance of year. And so, as you saw in 
this morning's release, we raised our full
-
year core EPS target to $4.71, 
which in
corporates the following: Underlying core constant currency growth 
of 9% excluding the impact of de

consolidating Venezuela, a negative 2 
percentage point impact of the Venezuela deconsolidation, and a negative 4 
percentage point impact from foreign exchan

market consensus. Our outlooks on the other metrics we provide remain 
unchanged and are set out in this morning's release.
 
Our efforts to improve working capital continue to yield positive results. Over 
the past year, we've 
improved our working capital cash conversion cycle by 
more than 10 days.
 
For analysts on the call, as you update your models, I ask that you consider 
the following factors. Foreign exchange translation continues to be a 
headwind, more heavily skewed to Q3 
than Q4. We have more difficult core 
constant currency operating profit growth comparisons in the second half at 
Frito
-
Lay North America. North America Beverages has particularly difficult 
revenue and operating profit lapse in Q3. We expect low single

digi
t raw 
material inflation including the impacts of foreign exchange translation in the 
second half compared to modest deflation in the first half. We will continue 
to invest in our business to drive sustainable long
-
term growth, including an 
expected increa
se in advertising and marketing expense as a percentage of 
sales for the full year. And finally, we will be lapping Venezuela core 
earnings of approximately $0.06 per share in Q3.
 
Taken together, we expect the balance

Operator
 
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of 
Bill Schmitz of Deutsche Bank.
 
Bill Schmitz
 
Hi. Good
 
morning.
 
Indra Nooyi
 
Morning, Bill.
 
Bill Schmitz
 
Hey, can you guys just talk about the sustainability of the great organic 
growth at Frito and then also the margins which are pretty close to peak? 

roportionately 
benefited from GES. And I just wondered like kind of what inning we are in 

margins to go up there.
 
Indra Nooyi
 
Let's talk about the organic growth first, Bill, and th
en, Hugh, maybe you 
can chip in on the margin expansion. Look, the macro snack category is a 

into savory snacks. And our goal, if you go back maybe 15 years ago, and 
we've been cons


-
Lay has been doing, solidify our position in salty snacks and start to step out 
of the core into other savory snacks and
 
then start to take on other 


swing more and more towards a liking for savory products. So savory is in 
an
d we see amazing opportunities ahead for Frito
-
Lay to grow its business.
 
Secondly, Frito
-
Lay has been a mainstream competitor. We haven't played 
as much in the premium part of the portfolio. And now, we've gotten our 
game together in the premium side and w

in the script, the premium part of the portfolio grew four times faster and 

-
Lay 
to grow in the premium side.
 

before Hugh to talk about productivity. 
The great thing about Frito
-


customer and consumer. Our DSE system is a well
-
oiled machine and we c
an 

in terms of what products we can innovate with to put through that pipeline.
 
So with that, Hugh [indiscernible] talk about the margins at Frito.
 
Hugh Johnston
 
Yeah, happy to. G
ood morning, Bill. A couple of comments on margins. And 
the short answer is, I think Frito
-
Lay still has lots of margin expansion left in 
it and can do so in a very defendable, sustainable way.
 
Why do I say that? Number one, it's to build on the commentary
 
that Indra 
just made. While we are the market leaders in premium, we are relatively 
underpenetrated compared to where we are in mainstream, and premium 
does offer very, very attractive margins, particularly as you scale it over 
time. So I think there's a 
significant margin uplift there.
 
Number two is in the area of GES, the initiative that we've been working on 
for a number of years where we shorten the supply chain, deliver product to 
the customer and ultimately to the consumer much more quickly by 
going 
essentially direct from plant to store or going from plant to cross
-
dock to 
store. The benefit of that is we, obviously, eliminate a lot of excess cost in 
the system, and as we take that excess cost out, we are reinvesting some 
back in premium and we


or fifth inning on GES. GES has a number of years to run. And in fact, I think 
the GES impact on the financials are likely to 
be more profound in the future 
than they have in the past.
 
And then, the third element to this is this whole area of smart spending. 
Frito
-
Lay has absolutely taken the ball and run with smart spending as they 

oiting four out of what could 
potentially be about 30 categories in smart spending. So I think smart 
spending also offers us years of runway to deliver additional productivity.
 
So if you put all of that together, premium, plus GES plus smart spending 
and c
ombine that with the fact that Frito
-

it the ability to scale things in ways that none of its competitors can, I think 
we have many years of margin improvement to come and, frankly, 
significant margin improvement to come i
n Frito.
 
Indra Nooyi
 

sure that we create the breathing room, but reinvest back in capabilities to 

productivity prog
rams.
 
Operator
 
Your next question comes from the line of Dara Mohsenian of Morgan 
Stanley.
 
Indra Nooyi
 
Dara, good morning.
 
Dara Mohsenian
 
Hi. Good morning. So maybe building on that Frito
-
Lay margin commentary 
there, you've seen very strong SG&A leverage i
f you exclude the increases in 
A&M spending over the last couple of quarters here, Hugh. As we think 
about that going forward, is that sustainable going forward? And what's 
driving that because it is different than what we've generally seen over the 
past f
ew years?
 
Hugh Johnston
 
Yeah. Happy to answer that, Dara. To me, number one, it is absolutely 

continue to drive it? We have invested significantly in streamlining our 
supply chains. And 
remember, with PepsiCo, the supply chain doesn't just 
have cost in cost of goods. There's also a significant piece of it in the selling 


re really very much in the early 
innings on that.
 
Number two, we do continue to streamline the organization. And number 
three, smart spending is having a significant impact on our SG&A spending. 
So put together, the combination of making DSD more efficient
, making the 

improvements in the non
-
A&M portion of SG&A that are likely to continue to 
deliver for number of years.
 
Indra Nooyi
 
I want to add something to what Hugh said. Dara, we sp
end a lot of effort, 
time, and money on putting in an ERP system when we invested in SAP and 
we started that way back in 2000 and we've been doing that for the last 10 
or 15 years. And putting in an ERP system takes time, takes money, and 

ng to see some of the benefits from that ERP 

able to take out the costs from those implementations and start to realize 

zation, smart 
spending, and now the increased leverage from the SAP investment.

Your next question comes from the line of Ali Dibadj of Bernstein.
 
Indra Nooyi
 
Good morning, Ali.
 
Ali Dibadj
 
Hey, how are you?
 
Indra Nooyi
 
Good, thank you.
 
Ali Dibadj
 
Good. Hey, I have two questions. One is just trying to get a little bit of a 
better handle on your earnings guidance raise today. I know, last quarter, a 
lot of people were kind of thinking about it going up. But this quarter you 
raise it from 8% to 9%. Th
e top line isn't any different. Productivity is 
roughly the same. Commodity looks the same. Taxes look unchanged versus 
last guidance. So you are assuming an acceleration of about 2 points for the 
back half of the year. Just trying to get a better sense of
 
what gives you that 


one.
 
Question two, and, Indra, don't take this the wrong way at all. In fact, take 
it 
very positively. But there continues to be a real thoughtful set of questions 
from important investors about your future at Pepsi versus, for example, any 
future presidential administration. And these are real questions. People are 
really thinking about it
. So can you in any way give us some help in 

such an incredible job at Pepsi. People are really kind of asking themselves 
this question. So anyway you can help clarify that debate, 
whether you know 
it or not is out there, would be helpful. Thanks.
 
Indra Nooyi
 
So, Hugh, go ahead and answer the first question.
 
Hugh Johnston
 
Yeah, happy to, Ali. Thank you for the question. We always start the year 
with a perspective on the macros and 
on the world that tends to be 
conservative. When we give guidance, our intention is always to hit it and 

two things. One, the macros are operating in a consistent steady way, so 
t
here has not been a deterioration, which, obviously, is to our benefit 
relative to our expectations. And number two, we do see significant 


ore recently that Indra mentioned, 
whether it's Mountain Dew Black Label, Aquafina Sparkling, 1893, the 
Simply line at TOSTITOS down at Frito, or Quaker Breakfast Flats, which are 
doing terrifically well, and INIT coming out of Quaker as well, when you put
 
together all of that innovation, it will have a disproportionate impact in the 
back half of the year, which is really our cause for optimism in the balance of 
year. So that's the driver behind the raise at this point.
 
Indra Nooyi
 
Ali, on question number t
wo, in the foreseeable future, next several years, I 
see myself running PepsiCo.
 
Operator
 
Your next question comes from the line of Mark Swartzberg of Stifel.
 
Mark Swartzberg
 
Hello, thanks. Good morning, everyone. Two questions on Latin America, if I 
could
, Indra or Hugh. One is, in the quarter, advertising and marketing in 
the region was up. I believe for the half, it's flat or maybe even down a bit 
just by the omission of the reference to being up for the first half. So 
question one is, do you intend for 
it to be up for the full year?
 
And then question two is, if you take these two large markets of Brazil and 
Mexico, could you give us a bit of an update on your outlook for each of 
those two regions because, of course, the conditions and your performance 
th
ere are quite diverged. I'm just looking for how you are looking at your 
future performance in those two markets.
 
Indra Nooyi
 

Brazil, all of us have the read the news on Brazil. B
razil is going through a 
difficult time politically and socially. So they have to work through their 
issues. Mexico is actually doing well. The strength of the dollar, the 
increased remittances into Mexico doing well, the country actually is one of 
the bri
ghter stars in the whole Latin American economy. So we feel good 
about our business in Mexico. Our teams are performing very well in Brazil in 

stepped
-
up execution, making sure we
 
have the right value equation and 

focused on right now. So a tale of two cities.
 
Hugh Johnston
 

actually up 80 b
asis points on A&M year

date. So happy to close the loop 

the number is actually up 80 basis points year

to

get into A&M guidance for the full year. But gi

points year

that's a reasonable expectation for you and all the investors to run with as 
well.

Your next question comes from the line of Judy Hong of Go
ldman Sachs.
 
Judy Hong
 
Thank you. Good morning.
 
Indra Nooyi
 
Morning, Judy.
 
Judy Hong
 
So I have two questions. One is, obviously, you guys have been very 
disciplined on the capital allocation front and particularly on the M&A side. 
And I know that your busi
ness is, obviously, performing pretty well right 
now. But kind of how you are assessing that as it relates to maybe even kind 
of volatile macro
-
environment, change in consumer environment and given 
some of the robust multiples that some of these assets are
 
getting fetched 
for, do you have any views on looking at divesting some of your assets in 
this kind of environment?
 
And then completely unrelated, so you are bringing back Diet Pepsi with 
aspartame, so just wanted to get your perspective on kind of lesson
s learned 
and then as you think about your diet portfolio, the risk of maybe 
fragmenting the portfolio even further with different kind of offerings and 
how you manage that.
 
Indra Nooyi
 

first. 
But I'd like Hugh to talk about this because Hugh is my right hand and left 

about that.
 

and poll
 


are somehow worried about aspartame. And when we launched Diet Pepsi 
aspartame
-

 
a huge consumer need for that 
product. What we did not anticipate is that there is a group of consumers 
that absolutely loved the original Diet Pepsi. And in the cola category, in 
particular, because it's been optimized over years, people get incredibly 
f
astidious about their products and don't want to have any changes. So 
rather than remove the aspartame
-
free, which is still loved by a lot of people 

 

Diet Pepsi, the few people who th
ought aspartame
-
free was going away 
wrote me some pretty tough emails. And so, there is a very loyal group that 
is thrilled that we have an aspartame
-
free following. So we brought back the 
original Diet Pepsi in addition to keeping the aspartame
-
free produ
ct, so we 
could serve all consumers with the products that they love. I think that's 
going to be net positive for us.
 
Now, let me just say, the marketplace is fragmenting. Forget Pepsi or Diet 

s becoming 

distribution system because once you have control over the distribution 
system, you can pump a lot of niche products through it, all our craft 
products, all of those are l
ow
-
volume products. So we have to learn how to 
handle complexity, not walk away from it.
 
So, Hugh, talk about capital allocation and the portfolio.
 
Hugh Johnston
 
Yeah, sure. Happy to, Judy. Let me just start with a bit of historical 
perspective on this 
because, obviously, there's lots of activity in terms of 
people trying to reshape their portfolios right now. Again, as a reminder, we 
have about a little over a quarter of our portfolio in nutrition. And then if you 
add in the better
-
for
-
you products, it'
s really 

 
it gets upwards to almost half 

from a developing and emerging markets perspective, about a third exposed 
to developing and emerging markets. All of that as a result of 
transactions 
that we've executed really over the last decade or even more, whether it's 
Quaker, Gatorade, Tropicana, Naked Juice, Wimm
-
Bill
-
Dann, Izze, we've 
executed a variety of transactions over the last ten
-
plus years in order to get 
the portfolio into
 
a place where it could consistently deliver performance. 
And frankly, that's what you've seen, is this portfolio now, regardless of 
economic cycle, regardless of consumer sentiment, regardless of consumer 
trends in chips, seems to be capable and has been 
capable delivering good, 
strong performance throughout all of those shifts.
 

something on the order of $500 million a year in tuck
-
in acquisitions. As 
those good opportunities emerg
e, we look at them and we look at them 
through two lenses. One is a strategic lens around, does it make sense 
relative to where we think the consumer is going, and second is, obviously, a 
financial lens, is this good for our shareholders. And you can count
 
on us to 
continue to do that because we think that's the right way to think about M&A 
on a go
-
forward basis.
 

that has transacted and probably every company that hasn't transacted.
 
And 

assume it's because we didn't want to be.
 






 
Some investors talk about the notion of, sell when e
veryone's buying and 

follow that maxim fairly closely.

Your next question comes from the line of Caroline Levy of CLSA.
 
Indra Nooyi
 
Caroline, good morning.
 
Caroline Levy
 
Go
od morning, Indra and Hugh. Thank you. Actually just to follow up on 
what you said, Hugh, for clarification, I guess Judy's question had been 
around a willingness to sell anything and I think you said that when prices 
are high you are a potential seller. I
s that right?
 
Indra Nooyi
 
Only if it makes sense to the portfolio, Judy 

 

it makes sense to the portfolio.
 
Caroline Levy
 
Okay. So then my question was around Diet Pepsi and the Pepsi franchise 
overall because, Indra, you gav
e this stunning number that you drive more 
growth for retailers than the next five companies, large companies 
combined. In the case of Pepsi and Diet Pepsi, that has not been the case 
from what I can see. And so, how do you maintain your shelf space, how d
o 
you think about strategically moving those in a different direction? Is it 
through fragmentation or is there something else you need to do because 
that seems to be one area where you are really losing share?
 
Indra Nooyi
 
Okay. I think, Caroline, and we ta
lked about it in the Q1 earnings call, it is 
critically important that all of you change your frame of reference in the 
beverage market from cola to CSDs to LRBs. 30 years ago, it was colas. 25 
years ago, it was CSDs. 15 years ago, it was CSDs. It's been L
RB for the last 
decade or so. And I think the sooner we can shift our frame of reference, the 
better it is because just beating a category that is in secular decline, just 
beating that all the time is not a game to play, that's not a game that is 
going to 
guarantee good results. If we play this rich LRB game, multi
-
category, placing the bets where the growth is and where the consumer is 

tracking the company in this category, expand
 
your aperture. LRB is the

Your next question comes from the line of Rob Ottenstein of Evercore.
 
Indra Nooyi
 
Mornin
g, Rob.
 
Rob Ottenstein
 
Good morning. And thank you very much. Could you give us a little bit more 
sense on the North American beverage business? It looks like you've got 
about 2% price mix. Can you give us a little sense about how much of that is 
headline pricing, how much is channel mix, category mix just so we have a 
better idea of what's going on there?
 
Hugh Johnston
 
Yeah. A couple of things on that, Rob. This is Hugh. Number one, there was 
more pricing in CSDs than there was in non
-
carbs. Not a
 
surprise on that. 
Number two, about half
-
and
-
half split between rate and mix. So very 
comfortable from that perspective. Obviously, our single strategy has been 
working particularly well and it's giving us what we think is sustainable mix 
lift [ph] benefi
t, with lots of runway left to go on it. So, really, the pricing 
environment right now, is very good. It's very healthy. We feel terrific about 
where pricing is in North America.

an and CEO, Ramon 
Laguarta.
 
Ramon Laguarta
 
Thank you, Ravi, and good morning, everyone. I will spend some time today 
discussing the current environment, our business performance and then 
provide thoughts on our expectations going forward given the 
unpreced
ented level of volatility that we currently face. I will then turn it 
over to Hugh for additional color on the financial details.
 
Our second quarter began during the early stages of the COVID19 pandemic 
for most of our markets. As we started the quarter, w
e set clear, simple 
priorities to manage the business successfully through the enormous 
challenges that were happening with the consumer, customer, economy and 
operating environment. These priorities included: ensuring the protection 
and safety of all our 
associates, especially our critical frontline workers, by 
providing suitable personal protective equipment and sanitizers, conducting 
health screenings and implementing contact tracing and social distancing 
protocols; providing the best service possible to
 
our customers and 
competing to win in the marketplace; ensuring that we have adequate 
liquidity to run the business; continuing to invest in capabilities that will 
drive our long
-
term success; supporting the communities that we do 
business in and the peop
le who live in them; and, delivering strong financial 
results while executing against the above priorities.
 

performed relatively well through this unprecedented level of change. 
Spec
ifically: our organic revenue increased 3.3% for the first 
--
 
for the first 
half of this year, while second quarter organic revenue declined 0.3%.
 
During the second quarter, our portfolio worked well as our global snacks 
business remained very resilient wi
th 5% organic revenue growth, while 
global beverages declined minus 7% as increased take
-
home consumption 
was more than offset by a decline in the convenience and gas and away
-
from
-
home channels.
 
Our core operating margin declined by approximately 200 basi
s points in the 
second quarter which included nearly $400 million of incremental COVID
-
19 
related costs to keep our employees safe and ensure business continuity. 
Excluding these costs, our core operating margin would have increased in 
the quarter.
 
The mon
ths of March and April were particularly challenging as overall global 
economic growth was contracting and restrictions, closures and the resulting 
impact on consumer mobility had a significant effect on our performance. 
However, we saw an improvement in o
ur business performance and channel 
dynamics in May and June as population mobility increased after many 
economies gradually began to reopen both in developed and developing 
markets.
 
Now, turning to our business review for the quarter, I will start with No
rth 
America. Our snacks and food businesses performed very well, while our 
beverage business was challenged, but continued to improve its competitive 
positioning. Within snacks and food, we delivered strong organic revenue 
growth across both Frito
-
Lay and 
Quaker, driven by strong category growth 
and market share gains.
 
Consumer eating habits continued to evolve, with consumers spending more 
time at home, which benefits the at
-
home breakfast, snacking and dinner 
occasions. Organic revenue at Frito
-
Lay North 
America grew 6% and we 
gained share 
--
 
market share in salty, savory and macro
-
snacks in the 

-
based across all our major 
brands including double
-
digit growth in Tostitos, Fritos and Cheetos, high
-
single digit gr
owth in Ruffles and mid
-
single digit growth in Doritos.
 
Emerging brands such as Bare and Off The Eaten Path also delivered double
-
digit growth. Our larger pack sizes and multipacks performed very well as 


performance in large
-
format channels was strong, which more than offset 
the declines in the convenience and gas and away
-
from
-
home channels.
 

-
related 
costs, including front
line incentives and higher protective personal 
equipment and sanitation costs. Excluding these COVID
-

core operating margin would have increased by 185 basis points.
 
At Quaker Foods, organic revenue increased 23% in the quarter with s
trong 
share performance across multiple categories and most brands posting net 
revenue growth despite supply constraints across a range of our products. 
Many categories within the Quaker business delivered double
-
digit revenue 
growth driven by increased br
eakfast occasions, in
-
home dinners, and 
baking occasions.
 
Quaker was also able to increase household penetration during the quarter 

during the latter parts of the quarter with consumers 
purchasing and 
incorporating these products into their repertoire of food consumption. We 
also have strong plans in place to retain incremental households with 
marketing and activation plans across the Quaker portfolio during the 
balance of this year, incl


increased 55% in the quarter as strong operating leverage drove a 600 basis 
point improvement in its operating margin.
 
Now, I will turn 
to our North America Beverage business, which had a 
challenging quarter as we had expected. Organic revenue declined 7% due 
to declines in the convenience and gas and foodservice channels, which 
more than offset good growth in other channels such as grocer
y, mass and 
dollar stores. However, our revenue management initiatives enabled strong 
pricing gains across the business and within key categories such as 
carbonated soft drinks and sports drinks.
 
Both Pepsi Zero Sugar and Bubly continued to deliver strong 
double
-
digit net 
revenue growth, while our ready
-
to
-
drink coffee products delivered high
-
single digit net revenue growth in the quarter. In addition, we gained market 
share in ready
-
to
-
drink coffee, tea and enhanced waters during the quarter, 
while our mar
ket share trends improved in carbonated soft drinks, sports 
drinks, and juices as the quarter progressed.
 
Core operating profit declined due to higher COVID
-
19 related costs, 
including expenses for employee safety, sanitization and frontline incentives, 
lo
wer volume and unfavorable channel mix dynamics. Before I conclude on 
beverages, I am also pleased to note that our transition and integration 
process with ROCKSTAR and the distribution of Bang Energy is nearly 
complete. We have very strong growth and mark
et share ambitions with 
respect to this highly profitable category and intend to use the depth and 
breadth of our portfolio and distribution capabilities to improve our execution 
and store presence.
 
Our energy strategy will consist of three elements. Speci
fically: we will look 
to accelerate the performance of ROCKSTAR, which has further room for 
growth; we will expand the distribution of Bang and improve execution in 
the marketplace; and we will unlock the potential for Mountain Dew to 
expand in the energy 
category.
 
Now, as we look ahead for North America, we expect our overall business to 
perform well, assuming there is no large
-
scale disruption in economic 
activity or population mobility as a result of the recent surge in COVID
-
19 
infections in many market
s. With this in mind, we expect our snacks and 
foods businesses to remain resilient, albeit with some moderation in growth, 
while our beverages business should deliver better performance during the 
second half of this year.
 
From a channel perspective, we h
ave seen an improvement in the 
performance of the convenience and gas channels since the latter part of the 
second quarter. Foodservice trends have also improved, but this channel 
continues to be in decline and will likely take a bit more time to recover. 
Most of our remaining traditional channels have continued to perform well, 
while our ecommerce U.S. retail sales doubled in the quarter.
 
Now, moving on to our international businesses, our second quarter results, 
which incorporated the months of March, Apr
il and May were significantly 
impacted by the timing of COVID
-
19 restrictions and closures, which varied 
by country and by region. As we saw in North America, our international 
snacks and foods businesses proved to be more resilient than beverages, 
with an
 
increase in organic revenue growth of 2% in snacks, versus a decline 
of 5% in beverages.
 
Across our developed markets, organic revenue increased 18% in Germany, 
9% in Australia and 3% in the United Kingdom. And in developing and 
emerging markets, organic 
revenue increased 30% in China, 8% in South 
Africa, 7% in Brazil and 3% in Mexico. Our SodaStream business also posted 
another quarter of strong double
-
digit net revenue growth as consumers are 
increasingly enjoying this environmentally friendly, at

home p
latform.
 
With respect to our competitive position, we improved our year
-
to
-
date 
market share of snacks in Mexico, China, Brazil, U.K., France and Spain, 
while we held or improved our market share of beverages in the United 
Kingdom, Germany, Poland, Mexico,
 
Brazil and Thailand.
 
Much like in North America, our international business trends began to 
improve during the month of May as some businesses and economies 
reopened. In addition, our snacks business has remained very resilient. 
However, we do expect an u
neven recovery in international markets as a 
greater level of macroeconomic uncertainty will likely persist due to: varying 
responses and measures by country to address pandemic
-
related impacts 
and population mobility; greater volatility in travel and tour
ism trends; and, 
greater differences in disposable income and affordability. These are two 
metrics we will be keeping a very close eye on as and when we consider 
surgical adjustments to offer great value in lower income markets.
 
To summarize, we are please
d with our overall results in what was a very 
difficult environment. We remain committed to leveraging our strengths and 
principles, what we call The PepsiCo Way, to help guide our business leaders 
and associates in both good and difficult times. This incl
udes reinforcing our 
culture in a manner that encourages our associates to act like owners with 
integrity, and get things done quickly. We believe acting on these principles 
will enhance our standing with customers, with communities and employees.
 
We 
also continue to prioritize and invest behind our faster, stronger and 
better framework, which encompasses our brands, supply chain and go

to

market systems, manufacturing capacity, capabilities and culture, and our 
society by integrating purpose into ever
ything we do. To continue our 
journey in becoming faster, and best position ourselves to navigate in the 
current environment, we have instituted an even greater focus on: capturing 
more opportunities in the marketplace and improving value share; rethinking
 
what value and affordability means for our consumers and rapidly adjusting 
our offerings when necessary; simplifying our portfolio and commercial 
programs and making resource allocation adjustments to win with our 
customers and our consumers; and also, ma
king calculated growth 
investments in priority markets that can enable us to emerge even stronger 
after the crisis.
 
As it relates to becoming stronger, we are putting an even greater emphasis 
on our businesses to have a zero
-
based spending mindset in which
 
we must 
earn our budgets. In doing so, we continually identified savings and use 
them to fund new investments; prioritizing critical initiatives that will 
transform the operating capabilities of the company for the future, such as 
accelerating the digital
 
transformation of the company; and finally, 
reevaluating and stress testing other less critical investments, always 
seeking to optimize the investment portfolio for higher returns.
 
And then becoming better involves raising our ambitions to become Planet 
P
ositive; continuing to integrate purpose into our business strategy and 
brands; and, supporting and strengthening our local communities and 
promoting social justice 
-
 
two topics that I will briefly expand on today.
 
With respect to our communities, we have 
announced more than $60 million 
in investments to help communities around the world stay healthy and safe 
during COVID
-
19, which includes initiatives to help feed families and seniors, 
increase medical care and testing, expand access to government support,
 
and provide technology for remote education and work.
 
To promote social and economic progress, we have also announced more 
than $400 million set of initiatives over 5 years to support Black 
communities and increase Black representation at all levels of Pe
psiCo and 
amongst our partners and our suppliers. We believe these initiatives 
comprise a holistic effort for PepsiCo to walk the talk of a leading corporation 
and help address the need for meaningful, long
-
term change in our society.
 
To conclude, we belie
ve that PepsiCo is well

positioned to adapt and succeed 
over the long

term. We will continue to collaborate and leverage learnings 
across our entire organization to build on our strengths, many of which have 
been advantageous for us both pre
-
 
and post
-
pand
emic, including large, 
well

known brands that consumers love, and most importantly, that 
consumers trust; strong positions in growing categories with expandable 
consumption traits; an agile supply chain with strong local sourcing 
networks; a flexible and a
dvantaged direct store delivery go

to

market 
system; and a highly experienced set of global business leaders who have 
the empowerment, the knowledge and agility to make rapid, decentralized 
decisions to meet the needs of their local businesses.
 
Before I tu
rn it over to Hugh, I want to again acknowledge the hard work of 
all our employees throughout this year. They have worked tirelessly to 
satisfy our customers and consumers and I am extremely proud of the 
dedication and efforts.
 
With that, let me now turn i
t over to Hugh.
 
Hugh Johnston
 
Thank you, Ramon, and good morning, everyone. As Ramon mentioned 
earlier, our second quarter results were impacted by disruptions due to retail 
closures and other restrictions put in place as a result of COVID

19. In 
addition,
 
our business experienced higher labor, personal protective 
equipment, logistics and service costs associated with COVID
-
19. These 
costs coupled with an adverse channel mix shift in key markets impacted our 
operating margin in the second quarter. We expect
 
some of these costs to 
persist and remain committed to making the necessary, long

term 
investments to support our employees and customers, while also investing in 
capabilities that drive competitive advantages for our business.
 
To mitigate some of these c
hallenges, we have accelerated our efforts to 
control what we can. This includes tightly managing our discretionary 
expenses, reducing non

essential advertising and marketing spend to reflect 
the realities of the current environment and optimizing our pric
ing wherever 
possible. We have also reduced the complexity of our product offerings by 
prioritizing high

velocity SKUs to maximize production capacity.
 
However, it remains difficult to predict exactly how consumer habits and 
macroeconomic conditions will e
volve for the balance of this year. Based on 
what we can currently project for the full

 
year 2020, we continue to expect 
our annual core effective tax rate to be approximately 21%; total cash 
returns to shareholders of approximately $7.5 billion, comprise
d of dividends 
of $5.5 billion and share repurchases of $2 billion; and we now expect 
foreign exchange translation to negatively impact our reported revenue and 
core EPS by 3 percentage points based on current market consensus rates.
 
Our expected cash retu
rns reflect a 7% increase in the annualized dividend 

consecutive annual dividend per share increase. With respect to our liquidity 
and balance sheet, we believe that we have ample flexibilit
y to meet the 
investment needs of our business and return cash to shareholders.
 
Now, as we look ahead to our third quarter, we expect our organic revenue 
to increase within a low single
-
digit range, which incorporates the 
geographic perspectives and channe
l dynamics that Ramon referenced 
earlier. We expect our core operating margin to contract, albeit at a less 
severe rate than what we experienced during the second quarter, as greater 
costs associated with keeping our employees safe persist; and we expect 
f
oreign exchange translation headwinds to negatively impact our net 
revenue and core earnings per share performance by 3 percentage points.
 
With that, we conclude our prepared remarks for today. We thank you for 

 
us with your investment. I 
invite you to listen to our live question
-
and
-

today at 8:15 a.m. Eastern Time and will be available at pepsico.com. Thank

Operator
 
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of 
Dara Mohsenian of Morgan Stanley.
 
Dara Mohsenian
 
Hey, guys. First of all, the format is very helpful. So, kudos to your IR team 
for sort 
of pioneering this new format on the street. I was hoping for a bit 
more color on some of the more volatile areas of your business. You 
obviously mentioned improvements sequentially within the quarter and 
guided to the organic sales growth acceleration glo
bally in Q3. So, A, can 
you just give us a better sense of what specifically is driving that? And then, 
B, I was hoping you could spend some time within that just discussing what 

seein
g across snacks and beverages in some of your key emerging markets? 
Are you expecting pretty linear progress sequentially going forward in terms 
of improving sales growth or more volatility, particularly with some of the 
state restrictions cropping up in t
he U S and just given the developing 
market, country performance is pretty divergent in Q2? Thanks.
 
Ramon Laguarta
 
Okay. Good morning, Dara. I hope you're doing well. Listen, let me try and 
then, Hugh, will add some comments as well. Listen, as we look 
around the 
world, we see a couple of factors that are driving our business. Number one, 
as you can imagine is overall mobility in the country. And that is by far the 
number one factor and we're monitoring mobility through various means just 
to understand p
otential future performance of the business. That's number 
one.
 
Number two, and that impacts mostly developing markets, is the universe of 
stores are opened. What we're seeing in developing markets is that when 
situation 
--
 
when the infection goes up in th
e country, there's about 10% to 
15% of the stores that close and sometimes even higher, and that drives a 
lot of the performance. So that's number two.
 
Number three, obviously is where do people eat most of their meals and 
that's related to whether people 
are working from home or they're not 
working from home. And so that's a third factor that is impacted most of the 
food consumption. So, there could be mobility, but then people still have 
their meals at home. And so those three are the key factors. Obvious
ly, 
there's a fourth factor I think will be more important going forward, which is 
disposable income in the economy and that's related to unemployment and 
that's related to how much money that governments are putting back into 
the economy. And that is 
--
 
i
t hasn't impacted the U.S yet. It is impacting 

have the muscle to put so much money back into the economy. So those 
four are probably the most critical kind of factors that impact the b
usiness, 
and that's what we're modeling for various scenarios as we go forward. So 
that 
--
 
that's kind of from a very macro point of view.
 
Obviously, I said in the last conference call that we had in April that this was 
not going to be a linear recovery, r
ight? There's going to be a lot of ups and 
downs, and we're seeing these happening as we speak right in the business. 
You see countries that we thought the pandemic was behind, especially in 
far East, that the pandemic is going back in very local situation
s, but still 
impacting both the actual supply chain and also consumer perception, right? 
We're seeing this here in the U.S obviously, as you know we're all familiar 
with it. So first it was the Northeast.
 
Now it's other parts of the country that are being 
severely impacted by the 
infection. And that obviously impacts our organization, because we operate 
within a community, right? And obviously the number of impacted associates 
in our business it's a consequence of the community infection. So that puts a 
lot
 
of pressure on our supply chain as well. So, hopefully that gives you a 
sense of the different variables, and the fact that this is going to be a roller 
coaster, if you want going forward. I think we're getting much better at 
managing our supply chain wit
hin this complexity. We're hiring more people, 
we're training more people, we're making sure that we can maintain the 
supply chain in any circumstance, but it's still 
--
 
it's pretty complex as you 
can imagine.

Your next question comes from the lin
e of Bryan Spillane of Bank of 
America.
 
Bryan Spillane
 
Hey, good morning, everyone. And I hope everybody is doing well. So my 
question is just related to the COVID related expenses in the quarter, and 
you were at $378 million for the quarter. And I think i
f I've got it right in the 
10
-
Q about $224 million of that was employee compensation expense. So I 
guess as we're trying to frame the size of the expense in the back half of the 
year is $378 million a good run rate? And as we're looking at the 
components o
f this expense, maybe if you could help us just walk through 
what we should be looking at as recurring for the next 3 or 4 quarters and 
what might fall off?
 
Ramon Laguarta
 
Hugh, you want to try that 
--
 
this one?
 
Hugh Johnston
 
Yes, happy to. Okay, Bryan. No
, Bryan, that's not a good run rate going 
forward. The number going forward will be less than that. It will still be 
substantial, but nowhere near that number. If you break it into pieces things 
like personal protective equipment that that's obviously goin
g to continue. 
Things like sanitation that that's going to continue. The allowance for 
doubtful accounts on customers, obviously it's going to be variable 
depending on what we learn over time and how the customer base responds 
to the current environment. F
rontline and employee costs will still be there, 
but that number should be moderated pretty significantly going forward. So, 
we're not kind of getting into to piecemeal guidance, but that should give 
you a little of a sense as to the types of things that a
re going to be ongoing 
and the types of things that ought to diminish pretty significantly.
 
Ramon Laguarta
 
Yes, Bryan, the most important component, as you can imagine, or factor 
that impact is, is the number of infected employees that we have, right, and 
therefore the quarantine number. I mean, the biggest factor is when you 
have an employee that is 
--
 

virus, then we quarantine a lot of people, that's the number one driver of 
cost. And obviously that will depend
 
on the evolution of the pandemic in 
different parts of the world. So right now, Hugh, I think mentioned the 
different components and how we're thinking about it, but obviously if the 
pandemic goes up massively, then that cost will go up.

Your nex
t question comes from the line of Andrea Teixeira of JPMorgan
 
Andrea Teixeira
 
Thank you and morning. I hope you're doing well. And I understand that this 
is not a straight line and your comment that, obviously the emerging 
markets is the main question mark
, but could you help us understand how 
you left the second quarter in terms of cadence on the on
-
premises and 
convenience and gas? And so I'm trying 
--
 
just trying to bridge the low 
single digits in the three quarter that you guided for? Thank you.
 
Ramon L
aguarta
 
Hi, Andrea. Yes. Listen, just to give you a sense of how the different 
components I was referring to earlier impact the different channels. 
Obviously, mobility has a very direct correlation with smallest store sales, 
right? And in the U.S its conve
nience stores, around the world its other 
channels that play that same role, but we see a big correlation between 
mobility and convenience store or on
-
premise 
--
 
sorry, small channel 
performance. Obviously, as we went through the quarter, April was very lo
w 
consumption in that channel. Second half of May, June was an improvement, 
substantial improvement in that channel. The away from home channel is 
much more complex, right? There's a lot of different need states that 
consumers are going after there. And so
 
there was also an improvement 
overall throughout the quarter that is still substantially below last year. I 
mean, like a big number below last year and also different components of 
the channel with different levels of performance. So you see channels like
 
transportation still very low, hospitality is still very low, universities closed. 
You saw restaurants coming back, especially more informal type of 
restaurants coming back, and more formal restaurants less so.
 
So you see different performances, Andrea, a
cross the different channels. In 
terms of geography, China came back pretty quickly. I would say that 
almost in growth in the last part of the quarter. You saw Europe slower, the 
comeback of the 
--
 
both the kind of the small store channel and the away
-
from
-
home channel in Europe was a bit slower. We're seeing it better lately 
as people are starting to move around Europe and going on vacation to 
some areas in the South of Europe. So let's see how it evolves now. 
Obviously, there's less people moving around E
urope compared to other 
years, but its improved. In the U.S we saw an improvement as I said in May, 
June in specialty, everything that had to do with smaller channels. Now, let's 
see how this latest news in the evolution of the pandemic in the South and 
th
e West of the country impacts those channels, and the decisions that 
regulators take in terms of protecting the overall community, right? So that 
probably gives you a sense of how this is impacted. As we see the pandemic 
evolving now into Africa, South Ame
rica, parts of the Middle East, India, 
we're seeing obviously an impact in the traffic in stores and that drives the 
business. So it's still very fluid overall. It's an improvement versus the April 
timeframe, for sure. And that's why we're guiding to a sma
ll growth in the Q 
--
 
in the Q3.

Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Grundy of Jefferies.
 
Kevin Grundy
 
Hey, good morning, everyone. And I hope that you're doing well. Ramon, I 
had a strategy related question for you 
specifically around market share, 
because it certainly seems to be an area of greater emphasis on your 
leadership. And if I'm not mistaken also taking on a more prominent role in 
a management incentive structure as well. So with that as context, is that a 
fair characterization, number one. If so, how do you drive that behavior? 
How do you intend to prioritize innovation and premiumization and mix to 
support market share initiatives? And how do you balance that with the 
potential risk that this push on marke
t share does not devolve into more 
promotional pricing, like particularly North America carbonated soft drinks 
where the industry has gotten away from that behavior now for a number of 
years. Thank you.
 
Ramon Laguarta
 
Thank you, Kevin. And that's a 
good 
--
 
it's a very good question. Yes, listen, 
the share of market is 
--
 
it's being central to our strategy, and it will 
continue so, right? It has been during the pandemic, one of the key 
principles that we have set for ourselves that we're going to try 
to improve 
market share. Obviously, we are trying to develop our market share position 
in a sustainable way. So it's more related to the strength of our supply 
chain, the strength of our go
-
to
-
market execution, our ability to innovate 
faster into spaces th
at we see consumer value, our customer relationships. 
Those elements that we think are sustainable, the part of our brands, 
obviously. And you saw us making a lot of investments in '19, both in 
capacity and infrastructure in stronger brands.
 
We innovated i
nto new spaces, that's helping us navigate better the current 
situation and we're continuing to do so. There's some spaces in the market 
that are I think we will determine the share of market of the future. For 
example, I think e
-
commerce, if you see the g
rowth of e
-
commerce, it is 
going to be quite strategic. I think whoever wins in e
-
commerce now and is 
able to capture those families that are trying this e
-
grocery service for the 
first time I think is going to win those families in the future. So we're 
in
vesting heavily in trying to be the first in that channel and trying to 
--
 
and 
again, the investments that we made in the last few years, last year in 
particular, are helping us both from the data availability, the agility of our 
infrastructure to supply t
hose channels, etcetera.
 
So e
-
commerce is a key area where we think we can gain market share. 
Second is, the strength of our DSD system and our ability to service the 
stores directly, I think is a capability that is quite unique. And it gives us the 
advant
age to keep the supply chain going in spite of all the challenges we're 
all facing. So that's also an area where we plan to double down that 
improves our execution in store and the inventory in store. And that is also a 
sustainable advantage. The third one
 
is brands. I know we had 
--
 
we're 
seeing consumers going back to brands that they trust. And we have quite a 
lot in many markets that consumers trust.
 


to the consumer. And then we're seeing 
spaces, like healthier parts of the consumer demand where we have a lot of 
beautiful brands as well and we're reinvesting in those brands, either the 
zero prepositions in beverages, both Pepsi, Mountain Dew, Gatorade,
 
we're 
investing a lot in those parts of the portfolio and they keep growing. And 
also in snacks with brands like Off the Eaten Path or Smartfood or the all the 
Simply range or PopCorners or whatever. So there's a lot of spaces where 
we think that we inves
t in those spaces, we're going to capture market share 
for the future.
 
The other one we're investing very substantial amounts and it's working very 
well for us is SodaStream, right? SodaStream is a beautiful business for this 
situation we're living today. 
So we 
--
 
consumers don't have to leave their 
houses. They have perfect choices. We're putting our Pepsi brands in the 
SodaStream model in Europe, and it's working very well. We're investing in 
those. So it's sustainable long
-
term market share across multip
le parts of 
the value chain that I think is going to give us a stronger 
--
 
is going to make 
us a stronger company going forward. So that's how we're thinking about 
share of market and sustainable share of market.

Bonnie Herzog
 
Thank you. Good morning, everyone. I had a question on your price mix of 
1.5% in the quarter, which was better
-
than
-
expected, especially for PB&A, 
where your price mix was up 3%. So hoping you could dri
ll down on some of 
the key drivers of this. I guess, I'm trying to understand the strength in your 
price mix given the negative channel mix shift, and then I assume negative 
packaging mix. So, with the strong price mix in PB&A, a function of lower 
promos i
n the quarter? And then really how sustainable is this positive price 
mix going forward, especially in this environment? Thanks.
 
Ramon Laguarta
 
Hugh, do you want a go at this?
 
Hugh Johnston
 
Sure. Happy to, Ramon. Hi, Bonnie. Yes, price mix at 1.5% for the 
company, 
obviously that that's a complicated number because it's global and sort of 
incorporates almost everything. Going a little bit deeper on PB&A, I think the 
primary factors were around less promotional depth than what we had seen 
in the past. I think
 
frequency is pretty similar, but the depth wasn't quite 
there. Obviously, supply can 
--
 
supply chains were a bit constrained in that 
regard. So it didn't make sense to go as deep. So I think that that's the 
biggest factor.

Your next question come
s from the line of Vivian Acer of Cowan.
 
Vivien Azer
 
Hi. Thank you. Good morning. Ramon, I appreciate your commentary around 
investing behind emerging brands and relevant brands like SodaStream. Just 
hoping for either you or Hugh to comment on the reductio
n in nonessential 
advertising and really just reconciling that. It seems like perhaps, the COVID 
recovery is taking longer than perhaps we would have anticipated when you 
reported earnings a quarter ago. So just curious to hear how you're thinking 
about th
at line item. Thank you.
 
Ramon Laguarta
 
Advertising is a key component of our strategy, Vivien, and it will continue. 
We still think that it's critical that we continue to use that lever to drive 
penetration of the brands and trial and just the image of th
e brand. So that 
is 
--
 
hasn't changed at all. There has been a bit of an adjustment, especially 
in some markets early on in the quarter, because the truth is that the 
consumer habits change a lot and we modify some of the A&M decisions. We 
also have become
 
a bit more selective about the type of A&M that we're 
doing and some of the activities that had lower ROI where we're stopping 
them and we're putting more money against the initiatives that had more 
return on investment.
 
So I think we are 
--
 
we become bet
ter, and sometimes a crisis helps to be 
more selective and to be more impactful and to kind of generate internal 
momentum against simplification and against focus against fewer and 
bigger. And that's what we're trying to do. It's 
--
 
as you see from our res
ults 
it is working quite well. Obviously, balance of the year we continue to invest 
as we see the consumers moving around and demand for our products 
starting to be a bit higher, yes, we'll keep investing and 
--
 
again, not trying 
to lose that focus on fewe
r and bigger and trying to minimize the lower ROI 
initiatives that sometimes we have in what is a very large business. Yes, so 
that's how we're thinking about A&M. Hugh, I don't know if there's anything 
else from your side.
 
Hugh Johnston
 
Yes. The one thing
 
I wanted to add as well, Ramon is, Vivien, as we've 
talked about being stronger, part of that has been building some more 
capability to do A&M in
-
house. It's got a couple of benefits. One, it improves 
our speed; and number two, it has proven to be more ef
ficient over time. So 
we can actually get same or more value for less money, which is obviously a 
terrific outcome for the company.

Your next question comes from the line of Lauren Lieberman of Barclays.
 
Lauren Lieberman
 
Great. Thank you. I felt l
ike in the prepared remarks that the tone around 
kind of cost control and the investment was maybe a little bit different than 
it was 3 months ago. I would describe it maybe it's a little bit more 
measured where last quarter you were talking about staying 
on the attack. 
Of course, still a strong criteria for ROI. And this quarter we're talking about 
zero based mindset, earning your budget. So I guess by no stretch do I 
think that you didn't anticipate that the environment was going to be rough. 
I think that
 
was very clear 3 months ago and it's remained as such. But 
what is it that's really changed in your thinking in your approach then versus 
now. Yes, just it did feel a bit different, still very proactive, but sort of from 
a different step. Thanks.
 
Ramon La
guarta
 
Yes. Good, Lauren. The idea 
--
 
the concept of holistic cost management that 
we put early on, I mean, it was early last year as one of the principles of 

investing and focusing every
body around the company in this concept of 
holistic cost management, which basically it is the concept that you're 
referring to, which is you earn your budget every year. And we're trying to 
be much more granular around composition of the budget and what r
eally is 
required now going forward versus what it was required, let's say last year 
or two years ago, and going through that process of rethinking the budget 
every year, and reallocating costs against what's going to give us the best 
return in the year an
d going forward. So that capability is there.
 
We're emphasizing it more, because obviously what we're seeing is that 
there is a challenging time. We're having to put $500 million of costs in 
COVID related expenses. We will have to put some more going 
forward. So, 
we have to find ways to fund that, and we have to find ways to continue to 
invest in our brands and our commercial activities to keep growing and 
gaining market share. So we have to be super selective on where do we put 
the money in every sing
le line of the P&L. So we're emphasizing that from 
the position that every cent has to work for the growth drivers of the 

--
 
that is being adopted across 
the organization in every single market.
 
On the other sid
e, we are seeing that 
--
 
potentially as unemployment goes 
up in several parts of the world. I think companies will have to be much 
more cautious about obviously the resources that we use and how do we use 
those resources. So I think this capability is goin
g to come very helpful for 
us. And that's what we're talking about in the sense of, let's be very diligent 
in how we look at every single line of our budget and how we reallocate 
those monies into the highest return on investment growth drivers. And with 
t
hat, I think we'll be successful in gaining share of market and driving 
growth hopefully flowing that growth back into profits for the sustainability 
of the company.

Laurent 
Grandet
 
Hey, good morning, Ramon and Hugh. And first congratulation on different 
specific 
--
 
very specific initiatives you are taking to address Black Life 
Matters. I would like to focus my question on the energy category in the 
--
 
in your prior remark, yo
u mentioned the bank business was already almost 
fully transferred to your system as well as much quicker than most 
expected, so that's great. Could you please tell us what was the retailers' 

at they 
expect from PepsiCo and also regarding ROCKSTAR specifically how long do 
you think it would take to reenergize the brand? Thanks.
 
Ramon Laguarta
 
Yes. Hello, Laurent. Yes, good question. Listen, yes, we are almost 
completed with the integration of t
he Bang brand into our selling systems. 
It's been a complex process because Bang had between 250, 300 
distributors across the country. So as you can imagine the details of that 
transition has been quite exhausting for Kirk and the beverage team, but 
they'v
e done a great job of integrating that brand. And also the same with 

brand in the past. So that is, I would say, by the end of July, that will be 

y to go.
 
From the customer relationship point of view, I think the customers see us 
as a very good partner that can bring insight, that can bring activation to the 
brands, that can bring better store execution, a lot of drivers that we know 
-
-
 
we can deliv
er and will drive growth for the category. So I would say the 
reception from our retail partners has been very positive and early signals of 

--
 

quality. And it 
--
 
the fact that we 
have now a full portfolio that has Bang, 
ROCKSTAR and some of the Mountain Dew brands as energy offer, it is a 
positive development for us versus having smaller brands. So we're seeing 
positive signals.
 
And as we said last call in April, this is very strat
egic for us. We continue to 
focus on the three components of the strategy, driving revitalizing 
ROCKSTAR, and you will see some news coming out of ROCKSTAR soon, 
both on the advertising front and the packaging front, reformulation, 
integrating Bang into ou
r business and there's distribution opportunities and 
velocity opportunities in some parts of the country. And then moving Dew 
with more intentionality into spaces of energy that are not well covered we 
think today, and that we can do a better job. Obvious
ly, we continue to be 
very focused on Starbucks. Starbucks is a critical part of our energy strategy 
and Tripleshot, Doubleshot are 
--
 
is booming and even more now with 
people at home. So we're seeing all of those components working for us in 
the future. W
e're very optimistic about this part of the business and certainly 
there's a lot of energy in our teams to get it done. And the team is doing a 
fantastic job by the way.

Great. Thank you very much. So wondering if you could talk a little bit about 
how your dialogue with retailers has evolved from March through June, July, 
how that

how that's changed? Maybe also touch on the various things that 
you were doing to 
help retailers get through this and where things are in 
terms of shelf sets. A lot of the

happened, when do you expect that to happen and how you look positioned 
for those? Thank you.
 
Ramon Laguarta
 
Right. Good 
question, Robert. Listen, in our principles, and as we started the 
pandemic, taking care of our associates was priority number one, and taking 
care of our customers was priority number two, similar to number one. So I 
think that was the focus of the compan
y trying to even elevate even more 
the partnership with our 
--
 
with all our customers across any country around 

been closer to the 
--
 
to our partners.
 
We've been transparent with o
ur supply chain challenges in some cases. But 
I would say in general, we're getting very positive comments from our 
partners on how we are talking to them, helping them to stay in stock and 
on time, driving business for both and evolving for the future of 
demand 
especially around the space of e
-
commerce that I mentioned earlier, that it's 
clearly growing at a very fast pace, faster than we had all forecasted about 
half a year ago. So that's the dynamic.
 
We've made some choices in our supply chain to 
--
 
we'v
e reduced some of 

partners and we both agreed that it's probably the best thing to do to 
eliminate the less 
--
 
let's say, the smaller SKUs in the portfolio to maximize 
the best selli
ng SKUs and be in stock. As I said earlier, our DSD system, I 
think is a fundamental advantage in the way we're able to service our 
customers. And I think they appreciate that we've made the effort adjusting 
delivery schedules and increasing delivery sched
ules to make sure that we 
keep our brands in stock and we help obviously our partners. So that is the 
level of the commitment we have with our partners. And I think the dialogue 
is in a very good space and I think this situation will give us a strategic 
re
lationship with our partners that I think we had in the past, but it's 
probably at a higher level today.

Your next question comes from the line of Steve Powers of Deutsche Bank.
 
Steve Powers
 
Yes, great. Thanks. So I know you've sped up your R&D pr
ocesses 
considerably over the course of time. But as we think about today's 
consumer behavior relative to just a few months ago, and the difficulty of 
predicting where we'll be in the quarters ahead, how is that impacting, how 
your teams are thinking about
 
new plans and product introductions, even 
looking out to 2021? Because I think those plans might differ in a world 
where we're at home versus in a world where we're on the move. And I 
guess, is there a way to think about that, or is it that your cycle tim
es on 
new products at this point are such that you feel like you can keep pace with 
the change that we're all going through right now?
 
Ramon Laguarta
 
Listen, I think we have improved a lot, as you mentioned. We have 
segmented our innovation processes in di
fferent quick cycle innovations, 
more lift and shift, more strategic innovation that takes longer. So, we have 
a good segmentation of processes across the company and ways of investing 
and dealing with innovation through different stage, case, approvals an
d 
everything related to the size and the velocity that we want from each type 
of innovation. Yes, the truth is that we're never satisfied enough, right? I 
mean, so the sense of urgency in anything we do is going up and I think we 
have improving innovation 
and we want to improve even more. So from that 
point of view, we'll continue to make the adjustments to some of the process 
required. In terms of what you're saying, are consumers changing 
meaningfully some of their needs, and are we adopting quickly enoug
h?
 
I would say there are a few spaces where we're trying to move quickly. 
Immunity being one, and we're seeing that our consumers are looking for 
immunity more, our juice business is booming and we think that 
--
 
we can 
come up with other beverages and even
 
snacks that go against that need. 
Our snacks, business are being part of meals. We're seeing that more and 
more. Consumers are cooking more at home and that means that obviously 
brands like Quaker or some of our Quaker portfolio is being incorporated into
 
meals. But also some of our snacks, like Tostitos, obviously Sabra, and some 
other brands are being used for meals, right? A Lay's or Ruffles.
 
We are going to obviously move our advertising and our consumer support 
in terms of giving them recipes and help
ing them with solutions that, kind of 
go incentivize that habit. So, there's a marketing element to this. There's 
also an innovation element to these in terms of packaging or other solutions 
that we can help consumers moving to that space. So, yes, we're m
oving 
quickly. We are never satisfied with our speed of our capabilities. And if you 
hear the conversations with our internal teams, speed is a key word and 
we're trying to get better at that. We're trying to be the 
--
 
as close as we 
can to start up with a
 
scale of a large company. So that is one of our 
aspirations. And I think it's going to be a long journey of improvements, but 
we're in the right direction.

Your final question comes from the line of Sean King of UBS.
 
Sean King
 
Hey, good 
morning. Hugh, you mentioned a $3 billion in the full year e
-
com, 
or roughly 
--
 
probably 5% of sales, I guess, that doubled in North America in 
the quarter. How much of that is transitory due to the stay

at

home 
dynamics, or can some of that continue?
 
Hugh
 
Johnston
 
Yes. Hey, Sean, happy to get in on that one. A couple of things. One, just to 
be clear that $3 billion number is a retail sales number. It's not a net 
revenue number for PepsiCo, so you've got to discount it for that. Number 
two, that is the grea
t question. Not clear at this point. I think a lot of that 
will be dependent on how much consumers or shoppers find that the 
experiences is very good for them. Out of stocks, obviously, it's 
--
 
is always 
going to be a big question for them, because if you 
get a lot of out of stocks, 
you have to go to the store anyway, which sort of defeats the purpose. And

Thank you, Jamie. I'm pleased to report our businesses continued to perform 
well in the third quarter. Specifically, we had more than 3% o
rganic volume 
growth in global snacks and more than 2% organic volume growth in global 
beverages. While foreign
-
exchange translation continued to pressure our 
reported revenue results, we delivered more than 4% organic revenue 
growth, which represents an a
cceleration from the first half.
 
We generated positive net price realization in total. We stepped up 
investment in our brands, with A&M up 65 basis points as a percentage of 
net revenue and made incremental marketplace investments. We expanded 
gross and op
erating margins. We grew core constant currency operating 
profit 2% and up 6% excluding the impact of deconsolidating Venezuela. 
And core constant currency EPS grew 7% and up 11% excluding the 
Venezuela impact.
 
Our performance was well balanced by market t
ype. Our developing and 
emerging market businesses grew organic revenue 8% for the quarter, with 
double
-
digit organic revenue growth in a number of markets, including 
China, Mexico, Brazil and Egypt. And our developed markets grew organic 
revenue 3%, led b
y Frito
-
Lay North America and North American Beverages.
 
Year
-
to
-
date, our results are equally strong. Core constant currency 
operating profit grew 5% and up 8% excluding the impact of deconsolidating 
Venezuela. And core constant currency EPS grew 7% and up
 
11% excluding 
the Venezuela impact.
 
On the strength of our year
-
to
-
date results and our outlook for the fourth 
quarter, we have increased our full
-
year core EPS target to $4.78 from our 
previous target of $4.71, driven by the expectations and factors set 
out in 

 

performance metrics. Innovation ran at approximately 9% of net revenue in 
the quarter. Advertising and marketing is up another 60 basis points as 
a 
percent of net revenue year

date. And execution metrics are improving 
across the board, driving growth for us and our retail partners.
 
For example, the third quarter in the US, which is our largest market, we 
were once again the largest contributor to
 
retail food and beverage sales 
growth. We generated approximately 37% of all food and beverage retail 
sales growth, significantly higher than our food and beverage dollar share 
position of less than 10%. And we generated more retail sales growth than 
all 
other $5 billion class food and beverage manufacturers combined.
 

on track to deliver $7 billion in free cash flow, excluding certain items.
 
Our results reflect our commitment to
 

vision to deliver top gear financial performance over the long
-
term by 
integrating sustainability into our business strategy. When we launch 
Performance with Purpose in 2006, we opted not to view sustainability 
simply t
hrough the lens of corporate social responsibility. Instead, we 
charted a course rooted in the firm belief that in order to meet the changing 
needs of our consumers, exercise responsible stewardship for environment, 
and create an environment within our com
pany where each employee feels 
valued and can bring their whole selves to work, we had to transform the 
way we do business, weaving sustainability into the way we make money.
 
A decade into our journey, that belief is being validated and is preparing our 
co

 
On the purpose side of Performance with Purpose, our first commitment was 
human sustainability, transforming our product portfolio with a particular 
focus on reducing sodium, saturated fat and 
added sugars, while dialing up 

 
As compared to 2006, we have reduced the average sodium in our food 
products by 11% per serving and removed more than 2,300 metric tons of 
sodium from
 
key global food brands in key countries. We have reduced the 
average amount of saturated fat per serving by more than 15% in key global 
brands in a number of our major markets, including the United States, 

g strides to reduce 
added sugars in our beverages through reformulation.
 
Our transformation efforts to date have resulted in a portfolio where we 
derive approximately 45% of our net revenue from products that we refer to 
as guilt
-
free. Those products inclu
de diet and other beverages that are below 
70 calories per 12 ounces and snacks with low levels of sodium and 
saturated fat. And a full 27 points of the 45 points is made up of what we 
refer to as everyday nutrition, which are product with positive nutrien
ts like 
grains, fruits and vegetables, unsweetened tea and water.
 
And our innovation focus reflects our commitment to portfolio 
transformation. Just to give you a few examples. Recently, we launched 
Quaker Super Goodness porridge sachets in the UK, made wi
th whole
-
grain 
oats, quinoa, barley and flaxseed. And introduced carrot, pineapple, mango 
Tropicana Farmstand in the US made with 100% fruit and vegetable juices 
and no added sugar.
 
Sabra, built on the strength of our highly popular hummus, has established
 
a 
range of authentic products that include guacamole, salsa, baba ganoush 
and Greek yogurt dips and spreads. Sabra now generates approximately 
$800 million in estimated annual retail sales in the United States, well on its 
way to becoming $1 billion brand
.
 
Our Naked super premium fruit and vegetable juices and coconut waters are 
loved by consumers for their great flavor, all
-
natural ingredients and no 

the last six years and grown estim
ated annual retail sales to over $1 billion. 
We recently extended the Naked lineup with the introduction of Naked cold
-
pressed juices.
 
Propel Water, by the makers of Gatorade, zero calorie sports hydration 
beverage enriched with electrolytes and minerals, 
is enjoying renewed 
success in North America with year

lineup. Pure Leaf Tea is an example, a premium line of ready
-
to
-
drink teas, 
brewed and steeped simply a
nd authentically from leaves picked at their 
freshest.
 
Since its launch in 2012, Pure Leaf has grown to more than $650 million in 

-
premium line under the Tea House collection.
 
Our Bak
ed! lineup is another example of how we're transforming our 

our baked lineup to include Baked! Doritos, Baked! Tostitos and Baked! 
Cheetos and have expanded the lineup to nine interna
tional markets where 
there is a lot of opportunity for further growth and market expansion.
 
And we recently launched, STUBBORN SODA, a new generation premium 
crafted, sparkling beverage that is just 9,200 calories per 12 ounces and is 
made with Fair 
Trade certified cane sugar and Stevia, with no high fructose 
corn syrup.
 
So it's the breath of our evolving product portfolio and our ability to innovate 
against it that enables us to generate consistent organic revenue growth.
 
Likewise, under Performance 
with Purpose, our environmental sustainability 
agendas had positive impacts, both on our business results and, more 
broadly, on the planetary share. By using fewer resources, water, packaging 
and energy, we are simultaneously shrinking our environment foot
print and 

adopting new technologies and processes, which have steadily reduced use 

management in water stressed and wate
r scarce areas.
 

production than we did when we embarked on Performance with Purpose. In 
addition, we have supported growers in our value chain in their pursuits of 
better water use ma
nagement. And through the PepsiCo Foundation, we 
have successfully partnered to provide access to safe water for more than 9 
million people globally.
 

successfully reduced packaging, wei
ght and size and increased 
postconsumer recycled content in our packaging. While reducing packaging 
weight and size, we removed almost 100 million pounds of packaging 
materials from the market in 2015 alone.
 
We have worked to increase the recycling rates o
f beverage containers 
among consumers and we have significantly reduced the amount of solid 
waste generated by our operations that are sent to landfills, achieving a rate 
of over 90% solid waste diversion away from landfills in 2015.
 

nhouse gas emissions by focusing on energy use and 
renewable energy and by modernizing our fleet with more fuel

Taken together, our environmental sustainability initiatives have not only

initiatives have gener

simply using fewer resources in our businesses.
 
Combining our environmental sustainability savings with those of our other 
productivity initiatives, we're generating more than $1 billion in annual 
produc
tivity savings. These savings are both providing fuel for reinvestment 
of the business and contributing to consistent margin improvement.
 

support the safety, health, professional devel
opment and human rights for 
our global workforce. This includes promoting women's equal advancement 
and fostering a diverse and engaging culture that attracts the talent base

We view our sustained top

tier resul
ts as a validation of our Performance 

-
term results with 
ensuring PepsiCo remains successful for the long
-
term.
 
In the coming weeks, we will issue our annual sustainability report where we 
will share with y
ou in much more detail our progress and accomplishments 
under Performance with Purpose
 
Just as important, we will lay out our sustainability vision and goals for the 
coming decade and our pledge to make our products more nutritious, our 
food system more su
stainable, and our communities more prosperous. In 

 
So with that, let me turn it over to Hugh Johnston. Hugh?
 
Thank you, Indra. And good morning, everyone. As Indra mentioned, we're 
very pleased
 
with our year
-
to
-

revenue and productivity within the P&L, driving the top line and margin 
results mentioned earlier, and we continue to exercise strong cash flow 
management and capital allocation discipline.
 
As
 
a result, in the third quarter, we once again shortened our cash 
conversion cycle; in this case, by almost 10 days compared to Q3 of 2015. 
And we maintained our net capital spending on a rolling four
-
quarter basis, 
well within our target of 5% of net reve
nue.
 
I'm also pleased to report that we remain on track to return approximately 
$7 billion to shareholders in 2016, through a combination of $3 billion in 
share repurchases and $4 billion of dividends. During Q3, with the June 
payment, we increased our ann
ualized dividends per share by 7%, which 
marks our 44th consecutive annualized increase.
 
Looking to the balance of year, as we mentioned, we increased our full
-
year 
core EPS target to $4.78, which incorporates the following: underlying core 
constant curren
cy EPS growth of 10%, excluding the impact of Venezuela; 
an approximate 2 percentage point negative impact from the 2015 
Venezuela deconsolidation; and an approximate 3 percentage point negative 
impact from foreign exchange translation based on current mar
ket 
consensus, which is an improvement of approximately one percentage point 
versus our July update.
 
Our outlook on the other metrics we provide remain unchanged from July 
and are set out in this morning's release.
 
For the analysts on the call, as you upda
te your Q4 models, you should 
consider the following factors: the inclusion of the 53rd week in this fiscal 
year will benefit our full
-
year revenue results by approximately one 
percentage point, but is not expected to result in any impact to our core 
earni
ngs per share as we intend to reinvest the benefits back into our 
business; our Q4 foreign exchange outlook implies a moderation of the 
headwind as compared to what we have experienced year
-
to
-
date, but this 
assumption is obviously subject to macro and geo
political conditions, which 
remain quite volatile.
 
Given the timing of our commodity hedges, we face a difficult year
-
over
-
year gross margin expansion comparison in Q4. While we're lapping a large 
increase in A&M spending as a percentage of net revenue in 
the fourth 
quarter, we expect to continue to invest in A&M. And finally, while our full
-
year tax rate guidance remains unchanged, we will be lapping an unusually 
low core effective tax rate from Q4 2015.
 
So to summarize, our core constant currency earnings
 
per share outlook 
2016 has improved from our last call and we continue our focus on 
disciplined capital allocation and cash returns to shareholders.

Operator
 
Thank you. [Opera
tor Instructions] Our first question is coming from Dara 
Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley.
 
Indra Nooyi
 
Good morning, Dara.
 
Dara Mohsenian
 
Hey, good morning. So 10% full
-
year core EPS growth guidance for this year 
is really pretty impressive, given the 


looks like much greater SG&A leverage is driving this year, in particular, 
when compared to the prior few year. So albeit with one quarter left t
o go, I 
guess can you talk about what's driving that greater SG&A leverage, 
particularly given it looks like A&M will be up again solidly this year. And I'm 
assuming the answer is productivity, perhaps a bit less onerous FX. But on 
the productivity side, i
s the ramp up kind of sustainable versus the past 
years and how should we think about it going forward?
 
And then, on the other hand on the gross margin side, obviously, very 
strong expansion in the last few years, it did slow a bit sequentially this 
quarte
r, I'm assuming with less favorable commodities. But as we look out 
to Q4 and 2017, perhaps you can give us some guidance around 
commodities and how that impacts gross margins.
 
Indra Nooyi
 

e a shot 
at the first question you asked. And then, Hugh, you might want to add 
whatever you want to. On the SG&A leverage, it all starts first with topline 
growth. The minute you get good top line growth, you get leverage on all of 
the other SG&A costs th
at we have in the P&L. And so, this quarter was a 
very, very good top line growth at 4.2%. That's pretty significant. And that 
gives us leverage to start with. Couple that with the fact that many of our 
productivity programs, which we put in place very del
iberately 

 

productivity program where we just cut the cost for the sake of cutting the 
costs. We actually built the underlying capabilities. So when we take out the 
costs, they come out for good. So putting in the ERP systems, putting the 
righ
t tools to ensure visibility across the company, all of that took some 
money. We invested, so that we could take out the costs permanently. And 
slowly, step
-
by
-
step, all of these costs are coming out in a very deliberate 
and a disciplined way. And so, a co
mbination of the two gives us the SG&A 
leverage. The key thing to remember is that over a year or two years, the 
overall P&L works very well. Quarter
-
to
-
quarter, you might have different 
aspects of the P&L delivering differently. One quarter, it might be g
ross 
margin. Another quarter, it might be SG&A leverage. But I think over a long 
period of time, the P&L seems to be working quite well.
 
Hugh, do you want to add anything to that?
 
Hugh Johnston
 
I think you covered most of it, Indra. Two small items that I 
would add that 
I think are worth mentioning. Number one, the investments we've made in 
technology are not just making our selling system more productive by 
putting not just handhelds in the hands of our route salesmen, but actually 
putting iPads in the han
ds of our district managers, enabling them to be 
more effective and to manage more basically with the same or less 
resources. And the same is true of management more broadly in the G&A 
bucket. By virtue of leveraging the technology advancements that are ou
t 

enabled us to do more with less.
 
The other item that I would point to is we implemented support spending 
really late last year and into this year and we are seeing the benefits of tha
t. 
Whether it's across travel or consultants or facilities, we have gotten smarter 
with our spending. And as a result, you are seeing flow
-
through of that 
productivity into margin improvement.
 
Indra Nooyi
 
And I think the part that we all feel good about is
 
that the Smart Spending 
program, the emphasis was on smart. We wanted to make sure that we 
never cut into topline driving initiatives. And I think we are succeeding doing 
that.

Our next question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane with Bank of 
America.
 
Bryan Spillane
 


 
if you can talk a little bit and give us some color on how especially 
developing and emerging markets sort of performed in the quarter and 
maybe whether or
 
not you've got 

 

recovery or some stabilization in some markets. With oil prices up in Russia, 
it seems like we've heard the consumer a little bit better there. And just 
given the 5% organic sales growth you had in Europ
e and Sub
-
Saharan 
Africa and AMENA and 10% in Latin America, just can you give a little bit 
more color in terms of some of the performance there and whether you think 
maybe things will maybe stabilize or begun to bottom out there would be 
helpful. Thank yo
u.
 
Indra Nooyi
 

say, a lot of the emerging, developing markets in Q3 showed some signs of 
improvement. Now, whether they last or not, we don't know. But at this 

g pretty good. Russia, we did see some improvement. 
The Pacific Rim, good economies, all from 

 
the entire ASEAN was, if you 
want to put it that way. India is looking good. Even China is looking much 
than it did in the early part of the year. I'm just talk
ing overall economic, not 
just our business. Then if you come over to Europe, Russia, clearly, we are 
seeing signs of improvement. And this is even before the oil prices started to 
stabilize and improve. East Europe still looks all right. Western Europe is
 
not 
getting worse, so that's a good sign. And when you come to Latin America, 
look, we have good businesses there. And there's no question, Argentina 
had a troubled year. Brazil is having its share of troubles. But I'd say that, 
overall, the economy seeme
d to be holding up. But, more importantly, our 
businesses seemed to be performing quite well because retailers turn to us 
to deliver more of the growth because we have high velocity categories and 
we take labor off the store through our DSD systems. So I t
hink retailers are 

cautiously optimistic about emerging and developing markets.
 
Operator
 
Our next questions comes from the line of Ali Dibadj with Bernstein.
 
Ali Dibadj
 
Hey, guys.
 
So I have a set of questions about the balance between price and 
mix and volume and then just a question about bottling. First, on the price 
mix part, would love to get your sense around North America and AMENA 
specifically. So NAB volumes up which is gre
at, but assuming kind of 
innovation, there is a lot of premium innovation, it sounded like, and that 
was good, channel shift, but better weather would have suggested to me at 
least a little bit of a more positive price mix kind of tailwind as well. But the
 
price mix was only up 1%. So I want to get a sense there. Negative price 
mix in AMENA continues, arguably getting a little bit worse given the easier 
compares. So just on those two, would love to get a sense of that.
 
And then separately on bottling 

 
I gu
ess it is sort of related, I guess. But on 
bottling, would love to get a sense of how you are thinking about the right 
structure from a bottling perspective, given ABI/SAB got approved. Do you 
care about blue and red under one roof? Do you even mind?
 
And t
hen if you go to North America specifically, have you seen any kind of 
competitive disruptions, positive or negative, in the Coca
-
Cola re
-
franchise 
move to the bottling? Sorry for a lot there, but thank you.
 
Indra Nooyi
 
I'm just going to answer this last q
uestion and toss it to Hugh to talk about 

closing with SAB Miller and the consequences for overall partnership. But let 

ng 

portion of our bottling system, we leverage Power of One. Our retailers seem 

lot of growth for them becau
se we are able to service them exceedingly well. 

Let me turn it to Hugh to talk about price mix and volume. Hugh?
 
Hugh Johnston
 
Yeah, happy to. Good morning, Ali. Regarding North Am
erica, price mix was 
one, but it was actually a strong one. I think the number was exactly 1.3. 
And that is, as you said, a combination of price mix. We are continuing to 
get good pricing in carbonated soft drinks. The couple of factors I would 
remind you 

seeing a little bit less of that pricing flow through into retailers as we have 
deflationary commodities. The other is, we do have a negative water mix 
going on. So on the one hand, non
-
carbs w
ere quite positive. But a portion 
of that was water which is, obviously, from a price mix perspective, 
negative. So, in total, with the 1.30 of price mix that we got, along with 

g
ot a very healthy mix of pricing and productivity in that market right now. 
And frankly, we see nothing but rational pricing going on in the marketplace.
 
Regarding AMENA, a couple of factors there. Number one, we did see some 
bottlers reducing their concen
trate inventories. So the volume number that 
you see relative to the revenue number is in part driven by the fact that 
volume is driven by bottle and case sales and revenue was driven by 
concentrate shipments. So the numbers aren't quite as negative as the
y look 
in terms of what flows through the balance of the P&L. In addition to that, 
the pricing was not particularly in India, both in the snacks and in the 
beverage businesses. And those were both factors in the numbers for the 
quarter.

Our

Bill Schmitz
 
Hi. Good morning.
 
Indra Nooyi
 
Good morning, Bill.
 
Bill Schmitz
 
Can you just talk a little bit more about the sources and sustainability of NAB 
growth? You, obviously, are do
ing a great job with Gatorade. It looks like 
the whole category is lifting quite a bit. So I'm just curious how much you 
think that is really good marketing and good activation versus maybe some 
favorable weather? And then, perhaps September trend since th
e quarter 
ended so early this year?
 
Indra Nooyi
 
I think NAB has been doing a great job in terms of innovation, very sensible 
marketing programs and then execution has improved quarter by quarter. 
And so, I'm very proud of this NAB team.
 
Clearly, Gatorade h
as done very well. Marketing programs are good. 

did drive the growth of all beverages and definitely Gatorade.
 

. We 
want to play the total beverage portfolio because we want to make sure that 
we go where the consumer is going. So teas are up, coffee is doing well, 
hydration is doing well, products like Kickstart which are sort of soft energy 

doing well. I think, overall, the category is doing 

 
our 
business is doing quite well and we are gaining LRB share, which is really 
our focus.
 

many years ago with the bottlers comi

productivity. All three are delivering good results in NAB.

Indra, the only thing I would add t

Our next question comes 
from the line of Stephen Powers with UBS.
 
Stephen Powers
 
Great, thanks. I was hoping you could help us bridge the margins, 
particularly in your North American businesses, which is where we saw the 
particular strength. Obviously, you cited revenue managemen
t 
[indiscernible] benefits as key drivers overall. And I am assuming that that 
applies in Frito
-
Lay and NAB as well, offset by those A&P investments. But 
harkening back maybe to Dara's original question, could you size for us also 
the commodity tailwinds, 
specifically in North American segments? 
Obviously, overall, they were inflationary, but there they seem to have 
helped. I am just curious as to how much?
 
Hugh Johnston
 
Yes. Steve, good morning. This is Hugh. As we disclosed in the release this 
morning, No
rth America had slightly deflationary commodities. So from that 
perspective, it was undoubtedly a tailwind, but not a huge tailwind. The 
bigger drivers were number one, pricing. As you saw and as I mentioned 
earlier, we have 1.3 in North America beverages;
 
in snacks, we had about 
1.5 to 2 points of pricing. And then the balance of it was really productivity, 
whether it was continuing to expand our automation programs, continuing to 
leverage technology and SG&A, continuing to leverage Smart Spending to 
manag
e our non
-
labor costs and operating expense down. The big drivers 
were just flow
-
through off of that productivity to deliver the positive margin 
result, while at the same time investing significantly more money in 
advertising and marketing to drive all of 
the product innovation that's 
enabling the top line. So in some, we really do have this virtuous cycle going

that is Monster's launch of Mutant, which 
will be targeting Mountain Dew. So 
to the extent you can, expectations there and any specific spending or 
programs you may have in place behind the Mountain Dew brand.
 

a tremendous
 
job there. So we are a couple of years into the $5 billion 
program that you announced. Is it still your expectation that the remaining 
$3 billion will be realized fairly ratably through 2019? I know that a 
tremendous amount of uncertainty with respect to 
commodities and FX, etc., 
but how are you thinking today with respect to the flow
-
through to earnings 
relative to advertising and marketing levels?
 
And then as productivity has become a bigger part of the company's culture, 
how are you thinking about poten
tially exceeding that target? Thank you.

Indra Nooyi
 
Thank you, Jamie and good morning everyone. We are very pleased with our 
results for the quarter and for the full year, espe
cially in light of the 
significant macroeconomic volatility being experienced in so many markets 
around the world. We've performed well in this challenging environment, 
largely in the strength of our brand and product portfolios and diversity of 
our geogra
phic footprint. So while certain markets were hit with political 
disruptions, economic downturns or significant currency devaluation, other 
markets in our portfolio not experiencing these issues were able to offset 
their impact to deliver overall strong re
sults.
 

achievements, starting with our financial performance. I am pleased to 
report that we met or exceeded each of the targets we communicated at the 
beginning of the year. Organic re
venue grew 4% for the full year and 5% in 
the fourth quarter. Core gross and operating margins expanded for the 
quarter and the full year. We delivered our productivity target for the year. 
Free cash flow exceeded $8 billion. Our focus on capital allocatio
n discipline 
resulted in another year of significant core net ROIC improvements. We 
increased our annual dividend for the 42nd consecutive year and we 
returned $8.7 billion in total to shareholders in the form of dividends and 
share repurchases, which is a
 
36% increase over 2013.
 
Just as importantly, we strengthened the foundations of our Company. First, 
we continue to invest in our portfolio of iconic global brands. In 2014, we 
sustained our increased A&M investment and focused our spending on our 
biggest 
brands. Additionally, we increased the impact of our investment by 
directing of the spending to consumer facing activity. We launched our 
largest ever global campaign for our two biggest brands, Pepsi and Lays with 
coordinated package graphics, use of spor
ts and entertainment properties, 
point of sale material, ad copy and promotions.
 
We expanded our engagement in social and digital marketing. For example, 
Doritos CrashTheSuperBowl received nearly 5,000 consumer submissions 
from 29 countries around the worl
d. And our Lays Do Us A Flavor campaign 
garnered more than 14 million submissions. Programs like these drive 
phenomenal consumer engagement, are highly complementary to our 
broader marketing efforts and are extremely financially efficient. Our 
investments 
are translating to tangible results with solid improvement in 
brand equity scores and market share performance in our priority markets 
for our global brands.
 
Second, we continue to strengthen our innovation engine. We have built a 
robust and sustainable in
novation pipeline, perhaps the strongest in our 
history. Over the past two years, innovation as a percentage of total net 
revenue has climbed by 150 basis points and now stands at 9%. And we're 
innovating across our portfolio. For example, to meet the grow
ing demand 
for nutritious products we introduced Naked Juice's Kale Blazer and 

with the introduction of Pepsi Spire fountain equipment in over 30 markets, 
giving our customers a choic
e of flexible and cost effective equipment and 
allowing our consumers to create more than 100,000 customized beverages 
with just the touch of a screen.
 
In snacks, we leveraged our global scale by lifting and shifting successful 
new products like Doritos Ja
cked and Deep Ridged chips from the United 
States into a number of international markets. And as a testament to the 
durability of our innovation, a number of our recent product introductions 
like Tostitos Cantina, Mountain Dew Kickstart and Pure Leaf gener
ated 
double
-
digit estimated annual retail sales growth in 2014 after achieving 

 
Third, we stepped up our marketplace execution. As evidenced, in 2014 we 
were the largest contributor to U.S. ret
ail sales growth among all food and 
beverage manufacturers. Based on IRR data in all measured channels, we 
contributed nearly $1 billion of retail sales growth, more than the combined 
sales growth of the next 27 largest manufacturers. In food service, we 
e
xecuted customized Better Together programs like the pairing of Doritos 
Loaded and Mountain Dew Solar Flare, and we secured attractive new 
businesses, such as a Disney Park in Shanghai leveraging the strength of our 
combined beverage and snack portfolio.
 
F
ourth, we have taken productivity to a new level. We successfully 
completed our three year $3 billion productivity program launched in 2012 

-
year $5 
billion program, and we have a robust pipe
line of productivity projects 
focused on increasing efficiency through automation, optimizing our global 
manufacturing footprint, advancing the competitiveness of our go
-
to
-
market 
models and utilizing shared services. These programs collectively are geared
 
to deliver our targeted savings of approximately $1 billion per year through 
2019.
 
At the same time, we have significantly evolved our organization structure 
and operating model to enable us to more fully capitalize on our scale, global 
presence and deep 
capabilities. And lastly, we have driven increased capital 
allocation discipline throughout the organization to drive higher returns of 
investment and increase cash returns to our shareholders.
 
So that's a summary at a high level of our accomplishments. So
 
let me 
comment briefly on the performance highlights by business sector, starting 
with the Americas. PepsiCo Americas beverages had a terrific fourth quarter, 
3% organic revenue growth translated to 11% core constant currency 
operating profit growth. The 
profit growth is especially notable given the fact 
we also increased A&M in the quarter by high single
-
digits. We have seen 

marketing, innovation and execution. And this has resulted in not
 
only 
improved financial results, but better marketplace performance too, 
especially in our largest market, the United States.
 
Clearly our Latin American beverage business has had its challenges with the 
Mexico tax and deteriorating macros in Venezuela. De
spite these challenges, 
our Latin American beverage business was a positive contributor to PAB's 
overall organic top
-
line and core constant currency bottom
-
line results.
 
Frito
-
Lay in North America delivered strong performance. Frito delivered 3% 
organic re
venue growth for the full year and 3.5% in the fourth quarter and 
6% core constant currency operating profit growth both for the quarter and 
the full year. Market share results have shown steady improvement and we 
gained savory snack value share in the fou
rth quarter.
 
Latin America foods performance, both for the quarter and full year was 
solid. For the full year Latin American food delivered 10% organic revenue 
growth and 9% core constant currency operating profit growth. Quaker Food 
North America performe
d well with some challenge categories. Despite the 
category challenges core constant currency operating profit was up 8% in 
the quarter and we gained value share for the full year in the each of our 
core categories, Hot Cereal, Ready
-
To
-
Eat Cereal and Snac
k Bars.
 
So very strong performance by our businesses based in the Americas and 
the U.S. in particular. As I mentioned earlier, our portfolio collectively was a 
largest contributor to retail food and beverage growth in the United States, 
both in the quarter
 
and for the full year and this is a distinction we are very 
proud of.
 
Moving across to Europe, as you know, the majority of our European 
business is located in Eastern Europe and Russia in particular. Clearly the 
currency picture and macros in Russia have
 
made operations more 
challenging. While the Russian consumer has been quite resilient at least for 
our business, the currency situations led to significant inflation because of 
the transaction ForEx on the materials we source from outside of Russia, 
resul
ting in significant input cost inflation. Despite these significant 
headwinds, Europe generated full year gains in volume, organic revenue and 
core constant currency operating profit. All things considered, solid 
performance for Europe.
 
And lastly EMEA, ag
ain good results despite some political macro volatility in 
many parts of the region. For both the quarter and the year, we had solid 
volume and organic revenue gains while full year operating profit 
performance was impacted by efficiency investments made 
in 2014 and by 
lapping the Vietnam refranchising gain we had in 2013.
 
Most of the global volatility has been concentrated in the developing and 
emerging markets. However as a group, even our developing and emerging 
markets grew organic revenue 10% in the q
uarter and 9% for the full year. 
So they continue to be major contributors to our growth. As I mentioned 
earlier, we have a terrific geographic portfolio and this allows us to balance 
challenges and opportunities in a way that tends to produce consistently
 
good results overall, and we believe the fourth quarter and full year 2014 
result are a reflection of this.
 
Now Hugh will take you the financial guidance in some detail in just a 
minute, but I want to highlight just a few key points. As an operating 
compa
ny we absolutely manage the things that are within our control, 
marketing, innovation, marketplace execution and productivity and we 
expect to continue to perform well in these areas. However we expect to 
face continued headwind related to macros, in parti
cular weak currencies in 
a number of our key market and the impact of lower oil prices in countries 
whose economies are highly dependent on energy.
 
Obviously these are outside our control but we adjust the businesses to 
whether through the challenges as be
st as we can by controlling costs, 
adjusting our raw material sourcing and executing balanced pricing actions. 
As we balance all these factors, we have concluded that our outlook for 2014 
will be within our long term financial goals.
 

turn the call over to Hugh. Hugh?
 
Hugh Johnston
 
Thanks Indra, and good morning everyone. I'll start with the recap of the 
financial scorecard for 2014 and then move on to 2015 guidance. We're 
pleased to report that we met or exceeded each of our financial 
goals for the 
year. We targeted mid
-
single digit organic revenue growth and we delivered 
4%. We targeted core operating margin improvement and it increased by 30 
basis points. We targeted $1 billion in productivity savings and we delivered 
it. We targeted 
7% core constant currency EPS growth with our initial 
guidance and delivered 9%, which is right in line with the increased target 
we communicated to you in October.
 
We targeted core net ROIC improvement and delivered 110 basis points. Our 
core net ROIC now
 
stands at 17.5%. We targeted free cash flow of more 
than $7 billion and delivered $8.3 billion, and we committed to return $8.7 
billion of cash to shareholders which is what we did. So overall good 
performance meeting or exceeding each of the targets we c
ommunicated at 
the beginning of 2014. We're particularly pleased with our cash flow 
management. Our free cash flow as a percent of our core net income 
exceeded 100% for the year and over the past three years. So we are 
converting earnings to free cash flow
 
very efficiently.
 
Two big contributors to this performance are first the discipline and 

CapEx to less than 5% of net revenue since 2012. And second the 
improvement we've driven in work
ing capital where we've shortened the 
cash conversion cycle by 50% over the past four years and have generated 
cash from working capital of over $2 billion in aggregate over the past three 
years. And it's this strong cash generation that is enabling us to 
provide 
attractive shareholder cash returns.
 
Let me spend a few minutes discussing our outlook for 2015 which is in line 
with our long term objectives. We expect another year of mid
-
single digit 
organic revenue growth. We expect core operating margin expan
sion as 
organic top line growth and productivity should offset negative geographic 
mix and cost inflation. Below the division operating profit line, we expect 
cooperate cost to be down and approximately 25% core tax rate and a 
reduced share account. All in
, we expect core constant currency EPS growth 
of 7%.
 
Foreign exchange is expected to negatively impact revenue and core 
earnings per share by approximately 7 percentage points each based on 
current market consensus rates. As you saw in the release during t
he fourth 
quarter of 2014 we adopted the SICAD 1 rate of 12 bolivars per U.S. dollar 
and we assumed this same exchange rate for 2015. The currency exchange 
picture in Venezuela continues to be quite volatile. So I wanted to be 
absolutely transparent about 
what we have assumed in our 2015 guidance.
 
Putting it all together, taking our core 2014 EPS of $4.63 and applying our 
guidance implies 2015 core EPS of approximately $4.63 as well. Our outlook 
appropriately factors in both tailwinds and headwinds. To the 
positive, we 
expect to generate approximately $1 billion of productivity savings in 2015, 
which will offset operating cost inflation. We feel very good about our 
innovation agenda, which should enable to sustain our organic revenue 
growth rate. Our share a
ccount will benefit from continued share 
repurchases, although we won't recognize the full benefit of 2015 
repurchases within 2015 as they'll be made throughout the year with some 
of the impact of the share account reduction falling into 2016. Our core tax
 
rate is estimated to come in for the full year at approximately 25%, even 
with 2014 and we expect to be able to sustain this rate for the foreseeable 
future.
 
In terms of headwinds, we anticipate commodity cost inflation in the low 
single digits. Keep in m
ind that because of our forward buying strategies, 
our commodity cost changes will lag what you see in the spot market. I 
believe our expected inflation rate is a bit higher than what a number of you 
have modeled and this is because we are seeing more pron
ounced inflation 
in our non
-
market traded commodities, including certain packaging and 
agricultural raw materials. In addition, we will see an inflation impact from 
transaction ForEx in many of the markets whose currencies have weakened 
against the dollar.
 
And foreign exchange translation will be a significant drag 
on our U.S. dollar earnings.
 
Finally, as you model out the quarters for 2015, please note that a number 

half of 2014, s
o the currency lapse are most difficult in the first two 
quarters. Our long term goals remain intact, mid
-
single digit organic revenue 
growth, core operating margins expanding 30 to 50 basis points per year, 
high single digit core constant currency EPS gro
wth, free cash flow growing 
roughly in line with earnings and core net ROIC improving 50 basis points 
per year.
 
We intend to responsibly manage the business for top line growth, drive 
productivity and reinvest appropriately to position PepsiCo for sustaina
ble 
growth for the long term and we plan to remain highly disciplined toward 
capital allocation with the vast majority of free cash flow after capital 
spending being returned to shareholders in the form of dividends and 
buybacks.
 

r dividends per share by 7%, beginning with our 
June 2015 payment to $2.81 on an annualized basis. This represents the 
43rd consecutive year of annual dividend increase, and an approximately 

ng stock 
price, it represents 2.9% yield and will bring our 10 year annualized dividend 
per share compound annual growth rate to 10%, and we expect to return an 
additional $4.5 billion and $5 billion in cash to shareholders through share 
repurchases. While
 
doing so, we expect to maintain tier one commercial 
paper access, enabling us to retain low cost highly accessible financing.
 
So combined, these actions will result in cash returns to shareholders of $8.5 
billion to $9 billion and will bring our cumulativ
e 10 year cash returns to 
shareholders to $65 billion. As many of you know, we have stated disciplined 
capital allocation as a top priority for our management and our Board, and 
we trust these actions will again be seen by our shareholders as tangible 
evid
ence of this commitment.
 
Indra Nooyi
 
Thank you, Hugh. Before we open it up to questions, I want to take this 
opportunity to share with you how excited we are to be entering 2015 
despite the challenges that we face, because this year marks the 50th 
annivers
ary of the coming together of PepsiCo and Frito
-
Lay in 1965. We set 

successful companies. This year we celebrate five decades of growing our 
business and creating substantial value for our
 
shareholders, customers, 
consumers and communities.
 
It was a phenomenal vision of Don Kendall and Herman Lay, the architects 
of this combination, which set the stage to grow from $510 million in 
revenue in 1965 to almost $67 billion today. Of the companie
s in the 

generated extraordinary shareholder returns. In fact, $100 investment in 
PepsiCo in 1965 with dividends reinvested would be worth over $42,000 

ver the past 50 years has not happened by 
chance. It happened because throughout our history PepsiCo has repeatedly 
adapted and retooled all with an eye to the future. More importantly we kept 
integrity at the heart of all we do, running the Company respon
sibly to 
generate sustainable long term value, and this is a formula for success that 
our current team will continue to apply.

Our first question is coming from the line of Brya
n Spillane of Bank of 
America Merrill Lynch.
 
Bryan Spillane
 

you really balanced a pretty good [indiscernible] you generate a 4% organic 
sales growth rate in this environment is a pr
etty big achievement. And my 
sense is at least partially related to just your choice; choices you are making 
in terms of reinvestment dropping the bottom line. When you look at 2015, 
is there anything you're thinking differently about how much you want to 

you have in developing and emerging markets. And I guess related to that, 
given kind of the wide range of outcomes that could happen just because of 
the macros, are you looking f

in terms of reinvestment rate? So just trying to get your sense for the 

 
Indra Nooyi
 
Bryan, 2014 was a tough year too. The market wa
s quite volatile and as the 
year went on, we got to the second half of the year, we started to look 
--
 
really experience all the volatility. So I think between geopolitical issues, the 
oil price impact, other macroeconomic factors, we have actually had a 
v
olatility and I think we now have a playbook where we appropriately 
balance top
-
line growth, share and profit performance, because the 
challenge in these sorts of volatile environment is not to over invest and not 
to get the return or to under invest and l
ose too much share. So we are 
constantly balancing top
-
line growth, market
-
share and profit performance 
and I think over the year, we have developed a fairly good playbook which 

add 
something on this issue?
 
Hugh Johnston
 
Yes, I completely agree, Indra. And Bryan I guess I'd approach it from two 


in


through the P&L into the business. Then from a capital perspective, each of 

h a budget of somewhere between 

The reason for that is we really do apply quite a bit of rigor to the 

-
term 
growth, qui
te the opposite. I would argue both in R&D and in capital we 
have been investing in long
-
term growth. The focus here is sustainable value 
creation, and I think with the reinvestment rates we have right now, we will 
be able to deliver that sustainably.
 
Indr
a Nooyi
 
And Bryan if I can add to what Hugh said, in things like R&D spending, we 

what the volatility in the market is, these are long
-
term projects and we 
have to make sure we ke
ep investing to get this innovation engine moving. 
In terms of A&M again, we want to make sure we put the appropriate A&M in 

investment on A&M in volatile environments. But our goal 
is to hold those 
relatively sacred and then work the other levels in the P&L.

Your next question comes from the line of Amit Sharma of BMO Capital 
Markets.
 
Amit Sharma
 
Indra, just given the recent resolution of really a very public 
disagreement 
with a shareholder, should we expect that the Company will probably focus a 
little bit more on some of the strategic other initiatives which might have 
been, not neglected, but probably not in front focus? So in terms of perhaps 
M&A into marke
t or looking at your emerging market portfolio, where some 
of the things can be realigned?
 
Indra Nooyi
 
Amit, I'll tell you something. There was never a time that we did not focus 
on running the Company for all shareholders. I think between the senior 
manag
ement and the Board, we have constructive conversations with all our 
shareholders as we did with certain particularly outspoken shareholders. But 

our eye off long

term investments
 
to make our portfolio stronger. And if we

Operator
 
Your next question comes from the line of Caroline Lev
y of CLSA.
 
Caroline Levy
 
Just a couple of questions. I noticed there is news out of Venezuela and how 
do you assess the risk of having to go to the 52 exchange rate? That would 
be the first one. And the second one is in Europe you had spectacular 
volume gr
owth in both snack and beverage in the fourth quarter, considering 
the environment. I am trying to understand if that is sustainable, if you think 


?
 
Indra Nooyi
 

about this. The Europe team is executing well. There is good innovation. Our 
portfolio is a bit more skewed towards products that the consumers want. 
For example a lot 
of what we sell in beverages in Europe is lower zero calorie 
beverages. We have a lot of baked product offerings in Europe, and even the 
Tropicana line
-
up we sell in France and the UK is a very different line
-
up 
than we sell here in the U.S. because the ju
ice business evolved very, very 
differently there. On top of that, in a country like Russia, because our 
categories are in juice and dairy, stuff that the Russian consumer really 
needs, the businesses have been quite resilient. Now we have to wait and 
see 

products that we offer them the portfolio has remained quite resilient even 
going into 2015. But let's watch and see what happens.
 
The other thing too is in Western Europe the countri

--
 
I 
think we have a slightly better skew to countries that are not in deep, deep 

--
 
and the team is 
very good, lot of depth of talent there and Europe is a good performer for 
us, esp
ecially given the incredibly difficult environment they're all operating 
under. Hugh, what about Venezuela?
 
Hugh Johnston
 
Yes. Regarding Venezuela Caroline, just a couple of comments. First, as you 
know, we spend the better part of the year at 6.3 last yea
r and then moved 
to 12 in November. So the average for the year was 6.84. Our planning 
assumption right now is to be at SICAD 1, which is 12. Obviously there was 
news based on yesterday press conference out of Venezuela from the 
government talking about ex
change rates. There was a lot of information 

published as to what it all means yet. In general the fact that they seem to 
be going to a more market based supply and demand curren
cy environment, 
those suggest I think long term positives for us.
 
In terms of the implications in the short term, we did hear that SICAD 1 
would continue to exist. We will wait till we see more details on that and 
then we'll come back to investors with det
ails as they emerge. But in the 
long run it seems to me it is probably encouraging based on what we heard 
yesterday in terms of being able to move currency and cash around more 
freely.
 
Operator
 
Your next question comes from the line of Judy Hong of Goldman
 
Sachs.
 
Judy Hong
 
I guess maybe just a little bit of color, just in terms of how you're thinking 
about your ability to price, particularly in markets like Russia or Latin 
America, where it is hyper inflationary. Indra, you've talked about Russia 
being resi
lient. But as you think about 2015 how much pricing have you 
taken already? Hugh, you've talked about some other commodity 
headwinds. Can you just talk about how you're looking for sort of the profit 
impact as the inflation comes up in those markets in the
 
context of your 
ability and your flexibility to take price?
 
Indra Nooyi
 
Both Russia and Venezuela, oil dependent countries. Russia has its own set 
of additional issues. I think what the local teams do, they look to take as 
much pricing as they can to cove
r inflation, really assess the consumer 
demand and then they judiciously balance pricing and demand to make sure 

share or trying to gain too much share and destroy the P&L.
 
On top of t

its business to make sure they tighten the belt, restructure our footprint 
there so that we can become more productive in the middle of the P&L so 
that we can actually deliver profit in this 
difficult environment. And the 
Venezuela team has been doing this now for five or six years. And in a way 
you can take the playbook from Venezuela. In fact the playbook moved from 
Mexico from a few years ago to Venezuela today or Brazil from a few years 
ag
o to Venezuela, now to Russia. So this playbook is now becoming quite 
important as we navigate through currency volatility and economic volatility. 
So each country, it's the team that has to balance pricing, the elasticity in 
that marketplace, and how much
 
cost controls they can put in place so that 
taken together you deliver whatever we have agreed with them is the right 
financial profile for that market. Anything else you wanted to add, Hugh?
 
Hugh Johnston
 

 
I would add as a rule of 
thumb is in most markets when we run into these issues, we've sort of been 
able to price through somewhere between two thirds and three quarters of 
the inflation impact, and as Indra said, the rest of it we tend to handle 
through 
restructuring and productivity initiatives and things like that. 
Russia's obviously a more profound example of that but I think the rules of 
thumb will generally apply in that regard. But what it leads you to more 
broadly is the power of the PepsiCo integr
ated food and beverage portfolio 
and the size of geographic portfolio. As a few developing and emerging 
markets run into challenges, such as Russia, such as Venezuela, we also 
have markets like India, markets like Turkey that are performing very well. 
And 
as a result, the PepsiCo portfolio and the scale that food and beverage 
brings in each of those countries actually works quite well.
 
Operator
 
Your next question comes from the line of John Faucher of JPMorgan.
 
John Faucher
 
Sort of a follow up 
question on that, we've seen a lot of Latin American 
pricing across the consumer stable complex over the past couple of quarters. 
It's mostly FX driven. So as you look out to 2015, the mid
-
single digit 
organic revenue growth targets, can you talk about sor
t of what you built in 
there for Latin American pricing and in sort of kind of talked about this to 
Caroline's question, but that sort of what's your view of the efficacy of that 
as sort of true organic revenue growth. And then a second question would 
be o
n the COGS guidance. Can you talk a little bit about sort of including 
transactional 
--
 
ex
-
transactional in terms of what you're seeing on a general 
raw material basis? Thanks.
 
Indra Nooyi
 
Hugh will take this.
 
Hugh Johnston
 
Yes, sure. John, in terms of bot
h of those questions, regarding Latin 
America, you'll see us take a fairly significant pricing again. Inflation is 
obviously running in the high single to low double digits down there. And as 
I mentioned earlier we'll probably wind up pricing through somew
here in the 
neighborhood of three quarters of that. The rest we'll drive through 
restructuring and productivity. Regarding the transaction impact on 
commodities inflation, we talked about the fact that we're at low single digits 
for commodities inflation. 
About 40% to 50% of that is driven by transaction 
FX.
 
Indra Nooyi
 
I think the other thing that helps too, if I may add, across Latin America 
many of our businesses have a wide range of the portfolio from value to 
premium products. So you can actually price
 
the portfolio differently. And 
that helps too because sometimes in the premium products you can take 
more pricing and it can stick while the value products you want to make sure 

teams 
have gotten pretty good at playing this revenue management game in 
a very careful way as they navigate through Brazil or Argentina or Venezuela 
or Mexico.

Your next question comes from the line of Ali Dibadj of Bernstein.
 
Ali Dibadj
 
A couple of qu
estions. One is around marketing spend and where you are on 
that. I only seen the quarter it listed up for LAF and PAB. So I just wanted to 
get a sense of where you are overall as a percentage for the year and how 
do we think about that going forward. As w
ell as how we should think about 
the shift you mentioned from kind of pure marketing spend to gross to net I 


 
Indra Nooyi
 
Ali just one second, may I stop you. What is the first
 

the word you used?
 
Ali Dibadj
 
The marketing spend.
 
Indra Nooyi
 
No, the previous one, you said on LAF and PAB. What did you ask me 
specifically?
 
Ali Dibadj
 
So LAF and PAB are the only places in the report in the release where we see 
marketing spend as mentioned as going higher. So overall wanted to get a 
sense of marketing spend on the quarter and for the year. And then the 
other question is actually around currencies. You guys have always had a 
very much more aligned impact of curren
cies on your top line and your 
bottom line. So sort of no multiplier for you guys. And I want to better 
understand the mechanics there. A lot of your peers have a bigger impact on 
the bottom line and the top line. And trying to understand where there are 
h
edges? Are there natural hedges? How that flows through? So thanks very 
much on both of those, if that's clear.
 
Indra Nooyi
 

spend, overall if you look at our A&M as a percentage 


happens is that in certain regions of the world, we shift the A&M depending 

we've
 
been focused a lot Ali on working versus non
-


were talking about because we believe that the more we focus on shifting 
the spending to working A&M away from s
ort of G&A type A&M, the more 


facing. So overall for the Company again, as we have said many times, we 
are
 
holding to the A&M as a percentage of sales. But where we see an 
opportunity to increase it, we look for ways to reallocate it and at every 
moment we measure the return on investment on our marketing spend. 
With that, let me turn to Hugh to talk about the
 
currencies in the top and the 
bottom line.
 
Hugh Johnston
 
Absolutely and Indra, just to add one more point around marketing spend to 

sales growth. So we held as committed to at the be
ginning of the year. For 
the quarter A&M grew faster than sales. So A&M as a percent of sales went 
up in the quarter and obviously that was a bit of a margin drag in the 
quarter. Regarding your question comparing us to other companies in terms 
of our abili
ty to equalize revenue and 
--
 
revenue and earnings FX impacts, I 

is, number one, we do hedge transaction out several months. It varies from 

omic. As you know in developing 
and emerging markets the hedges tend to get expensive when you go out 
more than a couple of months. So make good economic decisions in that 
regard.
 
Number two, I suspect the difference between us and most of our peer set is 
more of our costs are likely localized, because we do produce in so many 



r cost structures that closely.
 
Indra Nooyi
 
I think it is also where we have our revenues and our margins. Latin America 
higher margins and Russia for example a lower margin. So the revenues 
gets hit more. So overall I think we have an aligned top and bott
om line 
impact.

Your next question comes from the line of Bill Schmitz of Deutsche Bank.
 
Bill Schmitz
 
I'm going to try to pull a fast one, sneak two or three questions in here if I 
could. Could you say what Russia was up in the quarter and I 
was wondering 
if there was any sort of pre
-
buy ahead of like big looming price increases 
which are probably coming this year or early this year? And then just on the 
Frito front I think it was an outcome this quarter. This is the first quarter in 
the last 
12 where you've actually seen share gain. So do you think this is an 
inflection for Frito in terms of market share? And then maybe are you 

with gas prices at the pump and obviously
 
a much better employment 
outlook and maybe even some nascent wage growth in the U.S.?
 
Indra Nooyi
 
Hugh, on pre
-
buys.
 
Hugh Johnston
 
Yes, pre
-

obviously work in our favor in that regard. One is 
just the fact that our 


to pre
-
buy very far in advance for a lot of our products. That combined with 
the DSP s

a big impact from that perspective.
 
Frito
-
Lay, obviously we did see good performance in the quarter. We expect 
continued momentum out of Frito
-
Lay. In terms of the impact of gas prices, 
I th

past which is 
--
 
it takes a number of months before the consumer fully 
spends back the so called benefit from lower gas prices. I think you're going 
to see that over the course of six mont
hs to eight months rather than an 
immediate change in consumer behavior. It just sort of assimilates over 
time. I am optimistic from the perspective that consumers right now, their 
personal balance sheets are pretty healthy. Most consumers have de
-
levered 
pretty well. So as a result of that I do think that money will make its way 
back into the marketplace, and as a Company that sells of more than a small 

it.
 
Indra Nooyi
 
And if the c
ategory keeps growing at this current rate, it's pretty good for 
us. Let me close by reiterating that we are pleased with our results for the 
quarter and for the full year. We are confident that our plans are working 
and as a result our outlook for 2015 is
 
within our long
-
term financial goals. 
We want to thank you all for your time and questions this morning, and 

investments. Have a wonderful day.

And now it's my pleasure to introduce Ramon Laguarta.
 
Ramon Laguarta
 
Thank you, Jamie, and good morning, everyone. We'll begin this morning's 
call with a brief recap of 2018 performance, and then move on to a 
discus
sion at 
--
 
of go
-
forward priorities, long
-
term targets and the financial 
outlook for 2019. So let's begin with 2018, which was a very successful year.
 
We met or exceeded each of the financial targets we outlined at the 
beginning of the year. Organic revenu
e grew 3.7%, which was a meaningful 
sequential acceleration from 2017. And within the year, we saw the rate of 
growth accelerate from 2.5% in the first half to 4.7% in the second half. 
Purely North America and each one of the international divisions perfor
med 
very well, and NAV made progress throughout the year with a return to 
organic revenue growth and improved pricing. At the same time, we 
continued to make investments in the business, and the solid momentum we 
have as we enter 2019 is a good indication 
that those investments are 
working.
 
Now on to priorities. As most of you know, I assumed the role of CEO in 
early October, and I'm pleased to report that the transition has gone very 
well. And I'm fortunate step into the role at such a well positioned comp
any. 
PepsiCo competes in attractive, large and growing categories. We've been 
leading 
--
 
we have leading brands and a broad portfolio capable of evolving 
into new growth spaces. We have a very well
-
developed geographic 
footprint, with a stronghold position
s in our largest markets and very 
competitive positions in a number of other rapidly growing markets. We 
have a suite of strong and very relevant capabilities across the value chain 
that we've been 
--
 
that have been built and strengthened over the years.
 
W
e have scale that allows us to run our operations very efficiently and to 
leverage our capability investments across a large and global business. We 
have highly engaged associates, a strong cohesive management team and 
deep talent bench. And we have a dist
inct winning culture that has its 
--
 
at 
its foundation, well embodied values and a strong sense of purpose.
 
These traits have enabled us to perform well in an environment 
characterized by highly
-
dynamic retail and competitive landscapes, shifting 
consumer 
habits and preferences, and volatile currencies, commodities and 
geopolitics. Over the past six years, organic revenue growth has averaged 
3.8%. Core operating margin has expanded by 1.6 percentage points. Core 
constant currency earnings per share growth h
as averaged 9%. Core ROIC 
has expanded by 9.5 percentage points to 24.8%. Dividends per share have 
grown 9% on a compound basis. And we're returning $45 billion to 
shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases.
 
I've spended the past
 
four months deeply engaged in the business, 
connecting with our consumers, our customers and associates, as well as 
spending considerable time together as a senior leadership team, having no 
holds barred debates with a goal of focusing on what the opportu
nities are to 
make our company even faster, stronger and better. We looked for 
opportunities to improve our strategies, our portfolio of businesses, the 
strength and breadth of our capabilities, how we organize and get work 
done, how we can take our execut
ion to new heights and how we can 
elevate our sense of purpose.
 
And from this review and assessment, we emerged with a set of what I'll call 
observation and a very clear set of go
-
forward priorities. Let me begin with 
the observations. Fundamentally, we're
 
a highly
-
focused convenient food 
and beverage company. We compete in very attractive, large, growing and 
highly complementary categories that share many common characteristics, 
including consumers, customers, shoppers and occasions. Our ability to 
leverag
e the scale of our business to invest in and deploy new capabilities 
and technologies is a competitive advantage. Furthermore, we have 
tremendous potential to expand consumption across multiple dimensions. 
We believe we can capture a greater share of consu
mption occasions by 
considering to broaden our portfolio to provide greater choice to satisfy 
consumers evolving taste, whether they are seeking for an indulgent treat or 
a more nutritious snack, hydration or a functional drink, on
-
the
-
go 
convenience or ta
ke
-
home value. And we also see the opportunity to 
continue to increase consumers perceived visibility of our products as an 
additional growth avenue.
 
Relatedly, we believe our product and geographic portfolios make sense. And 
we do not currently see the ne
ed to shed or acquire businesses in any 
significant way. Those businesses are not squarely on strategy, are relatively 
small and generate very healthy cash flows. And there is no apparent value
-
creating path to divest them because of tax consequences and/o
r 
transaction complexity. Let me go now into our individual businesses.
 
Frito
-
Lay in North America, our largest sector by profit, is an extremely 
strong businesses 
--
 
strong business that generates consistently attractive 
top line growth and has industry
-
l
eading margins and returns on invested 
capital. The core of Fritos business remains very strong and growing. Over 
the years, Frito has successfully adopted its portfolio to address new 
demand spaces, mainly in more permissible and premium snacking. We've 
a
dded new brands and product lines to capitalize on those opportunities, 
with products like simply, SunChips, Smartfood, Off the Eaten Path and 
Imagine. And we expect this approach will enable Frito to continue to 
compete very effectively across the spectru
m of the snacks category.
 
Furthermore, we see more runway to continue to source volume from other 
micro snacks occasions in what that played to Fritos strengths 
--
 
in ways 
that play to Frito's strength. Operationally, Frito runs extremely efficient and 
hig
hly optimized supply chain and go
-
to
-
market systems. However, capacity 
utilization is very high on average and there are pockets where capacity is 
overstretched. We believe with added capacity, Frito will be even better 
positioned to capture new growth opp
ortunities.
 
Let me move now to North America Beverages. NAB, our largest sector by 
revenue, is an attractive business. It has many leading brands in growing 
beverage categories and operates a differentiated integrated business 
model. We believe our operati
ng model is a competitive advantage that 
provides superior customer and system alignment, speed to market and 
systemwide efficiency.
 
With that said, in a dynamic market, NAB has faced a number of challenges 
over the past 18 months. New entrants have come t
o market in some of our 
stronghold categories. There are opportunities to improve some of our brand 
marketing and consumer engagement. And there are areas where we can 
step up our local marketplace execution. We have good plans in place to 
address these op
portunities. We've increased both the quality and level of 
A&M on key core brands, including Pepsi and Mountain Dew. We've 
increased our innovation to address new category entrants and to drive 
success in higher growth segments, with innovations like LIFEW
TR, bubly, 
Gatorade Zero, new variants of Propel and extensions within our successful 
Starbucks and pure life 
--
 
Pure Leaf Tea guidance.
 
At the same time, we're having good success with Pepsi Zero Sugar, and this 
has been a key element in stabilizing the p
erformance of our trademark 
Pepsi business. And we're making changes to our NAB organization structure 
and adding frontline resources to make us a more agile and respondent to 
local commercial opportunities and local competitive actions.
 
While there is mor
e work to do, we're very encouraged by this steady 
sequential improvement we've seen in the business. We are confident that 
with more well
-
placed investments, we'll see continued improvement in any 
of these performance.
 
Let me talk a bit about internationa
l now. We have a very well developed 
international footprint, and our international businesses are performing very 
well. We have strong market positions in snacks globally and within most of 
our key markets. And in beverages, we have very competitive marke
t 
positions, either outright or in combination with our bottling partners who 
provide scale and round out our beverage product portfolio.
 
In most of our key markets, we're the number one or number two overall 
food and beverage supplier. Our categories trav
el well. And we had success 
innovating and marketing in ways that make our products highly relevant at 
a local level. We have a very well qualified playbook to expand our business 
in developing and emerging markets by exploiting our global capabilities to 
grow penetration and frequency. A key element of the playbook is lifting and 
shifting our ideas from market to market, still that we continue to hold. We 
believe with greater focus on capability deployments, increasing the local 
relevance of our products a
nd achieving greater scale, our international 
business, especially in D&E markets, can be a source of even greater growth 
and higher profitability.
 
Underpinning all we do is our commitment to a strong environmental, social 
and governance agenda. Our sense 
of purpose is a great inspiration to our 
associates and makes us a very attractive place to build a career. 
Furthermore, we understand that we're an integral member of the 
communities we operate in. We embrace the notion that we can and should 
make big pos
itive impacts in our communities by leveraging our scale and 
deploying our capabilities to help our communities strive. We believe a 
strong ESG agenda is fundamental to long
-
term value creation. Our 
dedication to environmental, social and governance leader
ship will not 
waver.
 
So with these observations in mind, let me move on to our priorities. Our 
first set of priorities relates to becoming faster, specifically, accelerating our 
rate of organic revenue growth. And if there's one thing I'd like you to take 
from our discussion today is that, we view topline acceleration as the single 
biggest opportunity to create more shareholder value. To achieve 
accelerated topline growth, we intend to strengthen and broaden our 
product portfolio packaging formats to win lo
cally in convenient foods and 
beverages. And this means growing our core businesses as we continue to 
evolve our product portfolio and sharpening our focus on key geographies.
 
Across snacks and beverages, we'll invest to capture a greater share of 
consumpt
ion occasions, from indulgent to functional, social to individual, 
value to premium, and across dayparts from morning to night. We plan to do 
this by continuing to grow our core brands, which include $22 billion brands, 
and building and/or acquiring new br
ands to cover new demand spaces, as 
we have recently done with bubly, LIFEWTR, update in Path or Bare.
 
Within snacks, we intend to further capitalize on the consumer trends of 
convenience and on
-
the
-
go in locally relevant ways. Here, we see themes of 
conve
nient mini meals, local street foods and local recipes, just a few 
inspirations to evolve our portfolio in very locally relevant ways. We intend 
to rapidly scale our beyond the bottle initiative, building on the foundations 
of our recent acquisition of Sod
aStream and our internally developed Spire, 
Drinkfinity and Aquafina water station platforms to offer consumers even 
greater variety and choice in beverage formats. From a geographic 
perspective, our priorities are clear: #1, invest to sustain Frito
-
Lay No
rth 
America's growth and leadership; #2, strengthen North America Beverages 
to grow sustainably with the market; and third, accelerate our international 
expansion with a disciplined focus on right to win markets.
 
Across each of these initiatives, we'll dep
loy a simple, clear and very 
effective growth model that's highly focused on the consumer. That is 
providing the consumer 4 key benefits: variety, that is what I want; 
ubiquity, where I want it; desirability, from a brand I trust; and value, with 
the benef
its or affordability that appeals to me. Our entire commercial 
agenda is centered on delivering these four benefits to the consumer. Our 
second set of priorities relates to becoming stronger. This involves becoming 
more capable, leaner, more agile and less
 
bureaucratic. In doing so, we will 
drive down cost and that enables us to plow the savings back into the 
business to develop scale and sharpen core capabilities that drive even 
greater efficiency and effectiveness creating a virtuous cycle.
 
Our 
productivity programs will be guided by a set of universally applied 
principles, namely: achieving local affordability; simplifying and 
standardizing processes; collaborating across functions rather than 
optimizing within functions to achieve lowest cost e
nd
-
to
-
end processes; 
relentlessly automating and merging the best of our optimized business 
models with the best new thinking and technologies. Just as importantly, 
we're also adopting a philosophy that recognizes that not all the capabilities 
or costs are
 
equal, so we'll be very discriminating in where we need to pay 
for best
-
in
-
class or we should pay for just good enough. These principles will 
be applied across the entire cost structure, from labor to discretionary costs, 
and advertising and marketing, to
 
fixed assets.
 
The savings from our productivity programs will be substantially reinvested 
to develop and scale a set of core capabilities that we believe are necessary 
to deliver the consumer benefits I mentioned earlier. These capabilities are: 
indispens
able brand building; science and design
-
led innovation; point of 
choice excellence across all channels, whether traditional or emerging; 
consumer intimacy, that is leveraging technology and connecting data to 
deepen our relationships with consumers, moving
 
from relationships with 
groups of consumers to relationships with individual consumers. This enables 
a number of benefits, from individually based media and marketing 
engagement to personalized pricing; and finally, supply chain agility, where 
we deploy i
ntegrated and more robust data to improve demand forecasting 
and automation, advance robotics and other technology to make our 
manufacturing assets and go
-
to
-
market systems much more flexible to 
satisfy that demand with greater speed, precision and efficie
ncy.
 
And of course, executing this aggressive agenda of top line acceleration 
productivity and capability building will require fostering a high
-
performance 
culture, one that is aligned on a common set of leadership behaviors and is 
supported by the right 
incentive systems. Among the values we are 
emphasizing throughout the organization are being more center on the 
consumer, acting like owners, and moving with focus and speed. And finally, 
we're examining ways to refine our incentive and pay systems to enco
urage 
local empowerment and accountability, as well as even greater alignment 
between management, our shareholders.
 
And our third and final objective relates to being a better company, with 
--
 
by being purpose
-
led. Performance with Purpose has been a corne
rstone of 
PepsiCo for 12 years. Its guided our strategy and has been a point of 
differentiation. We're very proud of the progress we've made to date and 
equally excited about the continued evolution of our purpose agenda. With 
this in mind, our organizatio
n is committing to winning with purpose, which 
marks a new chapter in our purpose agenda. It acknowledges PepsiCo's 
leadership in integrating sustainability with a strive for more than a decade 
and conveys our belief that sustainability can be an even grea
ter contributor 
to our success in the marketplace.
 
Essential to our winning with purpose agenda will be a sharpened focus on 
advancing sustainability 
--
 
advance in sustainable agricultural practices, a 
holistic strategy to support the creation of a circle 
or plastic economy, a 
striving for positive water impact and continuing to make our products more 
permissible to consumers. As we work to execute each one of these 
priorities, our overarching goal is to accelerate the rate of topline growth to 
enable us to
 
deliver balanced, sustainable financial performance that creates 
greater long
-
term sharehold value.
 
With that, now let me hand it over to Hugh to cover the financial goals in 
more detail.
 
Hugh Johnston
 
Great. Thank you, Ramon, and good morning, everyone. 
The plans Ramon 
just laid out are intended to create durable, attractive long
-
term financial 
performance and total shareholder returns, driven by organic revenue 
growth of 4% to 6%, 20 to 30 basis points of average annual core operating 
margin expansion, h
igh single
-
digit core constant currency EPS growth, 
growing core net returns on invested capital, and attractive free cash flow 
and cash returns to shareholders.
 
To support our free cash flow and core net ROIC goals, we remain 
committed to disciplined capi
tal allocation with our existing priorities intact, 
namely: number one, investing in the business, number two, paying a 
dividend; number three, tuck
-
in acquisitions; and number four, returning 
residual cash to shareholders through share repurchases. Produc
tivity is a 
key component of our go
-
forward plans, providing both fuel for reinvestment 
and improving our operating margins. We're extending our productivity 
savings target of more than $1 billion annually through 2023. Contributing 
to this goal are saving
s we expect from restructuring actions we announced 
in this morning's release.
 
We intend to make substantial investments in the business in 2019 in A&M, 
manufacturing and go
-
to
-
market capacity, end
-
to
-
end supply chain 
transformation, and global systems har
monization and standardization. 
While there are investments in each category in each operating sector, in 
terms of emphasis, in Frito
-
Lay North America and our international sectors, 
there is relatively greater emphasis on adding manufacturing and go
-
to
-
ma
rket capacity and supply chain transformation. In the case of North 
America Beverages, there is relatively greater emphasis on investing to 
support the core brands, ramped up innovation, and adding and redirecting 
resources to drive enhanced local marketpl
ace execution.
 
And across all the sectors, as well as at the corporate center, we're investing 
to drive global systems harmonization and standardization. These 
investments are being made with the aim of building the capabilities and 
implementing the proces
ses that will support the achievement of the 
strategic priorities Ramon just reviewed, especially the achievement of 
sustained accelerated topline performance. We deeply analyze and assess 
each of the planned investments. We've established detailed guidepo
st to 
measure our progress and success against each one. And we're confident 
that the investments will return meaningful value to investors over time.
 
Beyond the stepped
-
up investments, our 2019 core earnings performance 
will be impacted by three other fac
tors: first, we're lapping a number of 
strategic asset sale and refranchising gains and insurance recoveries net of a 
frontline bonus that contributed approximately $0.17 to earnings in 2018; 
second, we expect the core tax rate to increase to approximately
 
21% in 
2019 from a rate of 18.8% in 2018; and third, we expect foreign exchange 
translation to be an approximate 2 percentage point headwind to both 
revenue and EPS performance in 2019.
 
Taking all of this together, for 2019, we expect organic revenue grow
th of 
4% and core EPS of approximately $5.50. Importantly, we expect to see a 
return to high single
-
digit core constant currency EPS growth in 2020. For 
2019, we also expect free cash flow of approximately $5 billion, reflecting a 
step
-
up in CapEx to appro
ximately $4.5 billion. Most of the increased capital 
spending is associated with accelerating progress on our strategic priorities. 
Following 2019, we expect our capital spending to moderate and to return to 
approximately 5% of revenue by 2022. We expect t
otal cash returns to 
shareholders of approximately $8 billion in 2019, comprised with dividends 
of approximately $5 billion and share repurchases of approximately $3 
billion.
 
With that, we'll now open it up to your questions. Operator, we'll take the 
first
 
question.

Answer Session
 
Operator
 
[Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Dara 
Mohsenian of Morgan Stanley.
 
Dara Mohsenian
 
So Ramon and Hugh, your 2019 guidance clearly implies some substantial 
reinvestment, both fr
om a P&L standpoint and on the CapEx line. Just at a 
high level, how did the organization come to that decision under new 
leadership? Is this more sort of underutilized opportunities under new CEO, 
you're looking at, as you highlighted maybe on the Frito c
apacity side? Or is 
it more a need to reboost coffers after a tough external environment the last 
few years that may have pressured spend a bit? Because you do appear to 
be leaving 2018 with some nice momentum from a topline perspective. So 
just trying to 
better understand the decision at a high level. And then also it 
would be helpful if you could give us some more granular detail on which 
product categories or geographies that incremental spend is particularly 
focused on, both from P&L and CapEx standpoin
t. And what gives you 
confidence around the ROI behind that spend as you look out getting it back 
to that high single
-
digit algorithm beyond 2019?
 
Ramon Laguarta
 
Okay. Let me start. I mean the process was a, say a four month process that 
we've 
--
 
you know 
we've been together as a management team over a 
series of meetings, trying to define what would be the next chapter of 
PepsiCo. And we came to the realization that we have a good company, we 
can be a great company. And there is a, say an aligned vision to 
be a much 
faster growing company, because we see that our categories are very 
healthy in large, growing across the world. And we have been performing 
okay against the category, but there is further growth and further 
opportunities for us to grow share in t
hose categories. And the process 
started with, let's see how we can refocus the discretionary funds that we 
have in each one of our business against the growth opportunities. So we're 
doing that as part of the AOP for '19. And then we came to the realizati
on, 
there is even further opportunities for us to invest and grow our top line in a 
very competitive way and profitable way. So that's what we are. In terms of 
the areas of spend, you should think about we're investing across all the 
businesses, from our N
orth America business to our international 
businesses. And we're investing in brand building, selling capacity and 
supply chain capacity. Those are the big areas. And also, we've been in 
building capabilities for the last few years, and we are going to con
tinue to 
do in areas like away from home, e
-
commerce, some of the large channels 
that are driving a lot of growth for the categories.
 
Operator
 
Your next question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane of Bank of 
America.
 
Bryan Spillane
 
So just two questions
 
related to the investments this year. One, is there 
incremental 
--
 
is it $1 billion of incremental productivity also in 2019? And 
then second, I guess, as we look at 
--
 
there were some investments that 
went into the business in '18 and then some increment
al investments that 
goes into the business in '19. So in trying to understand like how much of 
that goes in and stays in the business? Kind of the relative size of that? I 
mean back of the envelope, I was set of getting to about $500 million. So if 
you can
 
give us any sense as to whether that's close to the ballpark in terms 
of the size of the reinvestment?
 
Hugh Johnston
 
Yes. Bryan, it's Hugh. So in terms of the size of the reinvestment, we 
haven't got overly specific with the numbers. But if you think abou
t what our 
normal EPS is versus what we're doing this year, I would think about 
somewhere between 40% and 50% of it being reinvestment and then the 
other factors. We've mentioned the tax rate and the one
-
timer lapping being 
the other parts of it. As to the
 
other part of your question, as you know even 
in late 2017 and into 2018, we did start making some reinvestments back 
into the business because with the tax cut and other things, we had the 
opportunity to do that in '18. The thing that gives us a lot of c
onfidence and 
gives us a belief that the ROIs are going to be good is the money that we've 
invested so far, we have actually seen good payback. The reason for that is, 
obviously, we participate in 2 great categories, convenient foods and 
beverages. And whe
n we invest money in those businesses, there's good 
consumer and customer response to it. So the fact that we put money into 
the businesses and we've seen such good response is what gives us 
confidence, like going forward, we should continue to do that int
o 2019. The 
one thing I do want to stress in all of this is, we started with making the 
internal cost structure of the company more efficient and have done 
everything we can do with that, and the restructuring is part of doing that. 
The incremental portion
 
of it obviously is what we're talking to you about its 
investors, but I want to assure you while that we've worked hard to make 
sure PepsiCo is as efficient as it can possibly be, and we'll continue to strive 
to do that as well.
 
Operator
 
Your next 
question comes from the line of Lauren Lieberman of Barclays.
 
Lauren Lieberman
 
I know that you very specifically talked about 2020 earnings growth coming 
back to kind of the high single
-
digit range. But in the long
-
term guidance, 
you did lower the long
-
ter
m operating margin target to like 20 to 30 basis 
points, something more like 30 to 50. So can you just talk a little bit about 
what's driving that view of the long
-
term margin in the business? Is it a 
change in the what's passes from a gross margin perspec
tive? It sounds like 
a lot of the productivity and restructuring that you're doing should be 
yielding a more efficient cost structure for the long term? So I was curious 
why there's sort of less operating leverage in the long
-
term model.
 
Ramon Laguarta
 
Yes
. Let me start and then Hugh can give you a few more details. If you 
think about the three things we're trying to do, which is become faster, 
stronger and better. We want to first, invest in the business and 
opportunities that we see ahead of us, and that'
s going to make us faster, 
and that's 
--
 
they're investments we put in the business last year. As Hugh 
said, we've optimized, we've seen the ROIs, and we're deploying again this 
year with some incremental investments. The second concept of being 
stronger g
oes to the question that you're posing here which is we're trying 
to look at adapting technology and data much more in our business, in the 
way we do business. That will drive a lot of savings that we'll be reinvesting 
in the new capabilities we've been ta
lking about. We believe that will give us 
a competitive 
--
 
sustained competitive advantage over the long term. These 
are capabilities in the areas of basically consumer customer and supply chain 
agility. So yes, you will see a, I think, a virtuous cycle of
 
additional savings, 
being both brought to the bottom line and what we think is a 0.2, 0.3 
margin expansion every year, but very importantly, we want to make sure 
that the business gets the reinvestment required to become 
--
 
to stay as a 
very competitive b
usiness long
-
term.
 
Operator
 
Your next question comes from the line of Ali Dibadj of Bernstein.
 
Ali Dibadj
 
So I have actually three questions and all under the umbrella of your 
philosophy, Ramon. One is that you mentioned you met with clients and 
consumers 
and employees. But it doesn't seem like you'd done a lot of 
meetings with shareholders in forming your observations and priorities. And 
just wanted to understand why. Clearly, the lot of folks on this call are your 
owners. Secondly, your philosophy on rein
vestments, how does that apply to 
your philosophy on price/mix rationality, for a lack of a better term, i.e. kind 
of measured increases and pricing over the past few years, and beverages 
has taken that industry out of the penalty box for investors, so I'd
 
love to 
hear your philosophy there. And lastly, your level of confidence that one 
year of reinvestments is enough to get back to your accelerated long
-
term 
growth algorithm 2020 and beyond.
 
Ramon Laguarta
 
Thank you, Ali. Let me start from the last one, I 
think it's a core, the 
essence of what we're trying to do. As Hugh said, we started investing in '18 
back in the business. I mean the tax reduction helped us there and we saw 
areas where we had very high ROIs, which some area where we didn't have 
so much h
igh ROIs. So we, at the beginning of this year, we went through a 
what I think is a pretty rigorous process of filtering investments and saying, 
""okay, these are areas where we need to double down."" And we're adding 
some more resources to those areas. And 
it's across, what I said, branding, 
selling capacity, manufacturing capacity, supply chain capacity and some of 
the new capabilities.
 
But again, the essence of the model is not this one
-
year effort that we're 
trying to make with additional resources. The e
ssence is how we're 
transforming the machine, the operating machine of PepsiCo with technology 
and data, and really looking very hard our cost structures to drive sustained 
savings that we'll reinvest in these new capabilities that we need for the 
future. 
That is really the essence of the model. But don't think of a one
-
year 
investment which would be a 2
-
year investment because '18, we already 
started investing. But think of this as an acceleration and then a very clear 
transformation of capabilities that w
ill make the acceleration sustainable. 
And it's a virtuous cycle of adapting technologies, driving savings and 
reinvesting those savings into what we think are the things that will make us 
best
-
in
-
class in our industry, and it's doubling down on consumer i
ntimacies, 
doubling down on innovation, doubling down in brand
-
building, it's 
multichannel go
-
to
-
market capabilities and then flexible supply chain. That's 
how we are 
--
 
how we see the long
-
term momentum.
 
Hugh Johnston
 
And Ali, the follow
-
up on your questi
on on price rationality, we do think 
there's price rationality in the market right now. And a part of our long
-
term 
algorithm is continued price rationality in the marketplace.
 
Ramon Laguarta
 
Yes.
 
Operator
 
Your next question comes from the line of Judy Hon
g of Goldman Sachs.
 
Judy Hong
 
So I guess I wanted to actually ask about Frito
-
Lay North America, Ramon. 
So clearly, that business has been on a pretty solid footing. You talked about 
the potential opportunities to grow that business further. A lot of the g
rowth 
in the last few years has come from price/mix. So I'm just wondering if you 
can elaborate on more specific programs to really drive consumption and 
volume increases in Frito
-
Lay. And then separately, Ramon, I think you 
talked about being happy with t
he portfolio, and not really making a big 
changes to your portfolio, either acquisition or divestiture. I know you guys 
been looking at North America beverage business from a refranchising 
perspective. Is that now off the table as you kind of went through 
the review 
in the last 4 months?
 
Ramon Laguarta
 
Okay. Let me start with Frito. Listen, Frito is probably one of the I would 
say, best consumer companies in the world, I would say, and we continue to 
find ways to transform ourselves, both on the portfolio a
nd on the 
capabilities and infrastructure of the business. So the way we're thinking 
about Frito is you think our share of market is about 65% of salty, about 
39% of what we call savory and only 19% of micro snacks. We see great 
opportunities for Frito to 
grow into new dayparts, into new channels, into 
even grow within existing channels and within existing consumer occasions. 
So the growth opportunities for Frito are multiple. I think the team has done 
a great job in keeping a very healthy core, our Doritos
, Cheetos, Lay's, 
Raffles, Tostitos brands are growing very healthy, and build additional 
brands that cover new spaces, either cohorts or dayparts. So we see a very 
strong growth model from the brand perspective, from the channel 
perspective. And what we'r
e trying to do is make sure Frito gets 
--
 
is well
-
funded to go after all these opportunities both from the P&L and from the 
CapEx point of view, because the ROIC on those investments is unbeatable. 
And I believe we have an amazing team that is extremely ca
pable, proves it 
every day in the marketplace and is very rigorous in how they manage 
investments. So empowering that team with the right resources and giving 
them the higher vision of grow even faster and gain more share in the U.S. 
snack business I think
 
is the right thing to do for the 
--
 
for PepsiCo.
 
Operator
 
Your next question comes from the line of Andrea Teixeira of JPMorgan.
 
Andrea Teixeira
 
So Ramon, best of luck as the CEO. And I just wanted to ask you about the 
company's long
-
term organic revenue 
growth, the target of 4% to 6%. So 
could you maybe help us decompose this target between your expectations 
for snacks and beverages globally, as well as in developed and developing 
markets? And just a clarification on Judy's second question I think about 
r
efranchising. Should we 
--
 
have you decide not to refranchise NAB at this 
time, or is it still on the table?
 
Ramon Laguarta
 
Okay. Let me address both. I mean the way you should think and there 
about our 4% to 6% is we have a great portfolio of geographies 
and 
categories around the world, and we see this more side of opportunities 
where we're investing to drive growth and be more competitive short
-
term 
and long
-
term and should be thinking about the overall portfolio delivering 
this number of between 4% to 6%
. So I won't go into the details of how are 
going to grow in each one of these categories. You will see us as we unfold 
the results going forward. With regards to NAB, yes, I think, sorry I forgot to 
answer the question before, yes, we spent a lot of time 
as a management 
team, obviously studying NAB and the different options we have there. We 
love NAB business. We think it's a great business that will play a very 
important role in the future of PepsiCo, and we're convinced it will drive very 
good results fo
r us. And we believe that the key areas of success I think for 
NAB going forward will be around having the very strong brands in the 
different spaces and cohorts.
 
And we think we have the brands. And we've may be may have to 
strengthen some of the brands or we have those brands and we'll be able to 
create new brands with 
--
 
as we've proven with bubly or LIFEWTR or some 
of our new innovations. Second will be, our abi
lity to execute in the 
marketplace, both with the very large customers and also in the local up and 
down the street. And I think we can do that, and we are a great operating 
company, and we know we can do this without refranchising. Third point will 
be hav
ing a very flexible and cost competitive supply chain. And the third 
will be having the right high
-
performance culture in the business. All of 
those 4 success factors to me are not related to refranchising, plus 
refranchising per se will be a very complex 
and disruptive event for us as a 
company. So yes, you should assume that we're going to compete very hard 
in this business. We're going to invest sustainably and rationally. And we'll 
keep building a very strong company that I'm convinced will do great for
 
us 
in the near future.
 
Operator
 
Your next question comes from the line of Steve Powers of Deutsche Bank.
 
Stephen Powers
 
And I was hoping we could just dig a little bit further into your strategic 
outlook. If we think about PepsiCo in 2025, what does being
 
the great 
company that you mentioned at the outset really look like? How would you 
describe it? And how important is it to you that you can arrive at that 
destination without the need for another sidestep or effective algorithm reset 
somewhere between? An
d maybe as you just talked about that future vision, 
just going to the prior conversation, just love some color on what you 
--
 
what role you think, the long
-
standing better together Power Of One 
strategy plays within that? It sounds like something you rema
in committed 
to. So do you think maybe can be strengthened further? But I'll just love if 
you could expand on that as well.
 
Ramon Laguarta
 
You should think of PepsiCo as a, I said, a company that plays in two huge 
large categories that globally, have a lot
 
of tailwind. And our ability to 
perform on a very high competitive level in those two categories globally 
gives us the ability to be a top
-
performing investment for you guys in the 
consumer goods space. So I think you should be thinking about a company 
th
at has a long
-
term value creation model, center around accelerated growth 
and sustained growth, and gaining share consistently in our two large 
categories. That's how I would ambition. How we do it. I think we painted a 
picture on how we're thinking about 
our portfolio and how we're going to be 
look very holistically at the opportunities in each of our categories. And 
there's multiple demands, spaces, there's a lot of coffers, there's a lot of 
different dayparts in those categories that provide for immense 
opportunities 
for us to innovate and build brands and continue to grow.
 
Geographically, you should be thinking about a company that is, I would 
say, skewed to developed markets, Western Europe and the U.S., And 
obviously, long
-
term, we would like to be str
onger in some of our developing 
markets, while we have strong positions to build on top, so we have strong 
talent, we have strong market position in some of those markets. And you 
should think about us growing very fast in those geographies and adding to 
o
ur 
--
 
how we reach consumers around the world. Think of us, we sell 1.5 
billion servings a day, so we touch conceptually 1.5 billion people around the 
world every day, so our ambition is to become at least a 2 
--
 
touch at least 2 
billion people every day, 
that's some of the aspiration we have as a 
management team. So you should be thinking around the vectors of how 
many people we serve every day and around what do we offer that people in 
terms of the both the convenient foods and the beverage categories.

Your next question comes from the line of Caroline Levy of Macquarie.
 
Caroline Levy
 
My question is around 
--
 
I'm just hoping you can actually elaborate on what 
you can do in the route to market field, just a little more detail, because if I 
think ab
out the beverage business, it feels like you have some catch
-
up, 
particularly in North America. In snacks, you're already really, really good. 
So taking the 2 different sides, are you going to focus more on the small 
channels where brands are often built a
nd nurtured? And how do you 
manage an online business when you're shipping heavy beverages? So just 
touching on that range of opportunity.
 
Ramon Laguarta
 
Yes. Listen, thanks for the question. The 
--
 
you know the value creation of a 
category is proportionat
e in the impulse part of our business. So obviously, 
we want to maximize our go to market where we can generate impulse 
occasions, we capture much more value for our 
--
 
I think we provide more 
value to the consumer and we capture more profit as a company. 
So 
obviously, as you think about the areas where we'll be investing money to 
become much more of a great 
--
 
a customer service company, we will invest 
against the large customers and they are critical for us to serve a lot of 
households. And there, I think
, the opportunity to put all our categories 
together to serve customers like Walmart, Amazon, et cetera, is a big idea. 
Then in terms of the capillarity and the ubiquity of distribution of our 
categories, I don't think we're satisfied with NAB or we're sat
isfied with Frito 
or we're satisfied with any of our companies. There are almost unlimited 
numbers of point of sale for our categories. And our strategic intent is to be 
everywhere where there could be a location to serve a consumer to buy a 
snack or a bev
erage. And it's not only the conventional points of sale that 
you're thinking about. It could be endless numbers. So how do we become 
-
-
 
how do we make money in servicing those stores is the biggest strategic 
idea. We have a lot of technology to unlock thi
s. I mean we're playing 
obviously across nonconventional ways to get to those points of sale, and 
that's core capability of the company.

Your next question comes from the line of Nick Modi [ph] of RBC.
 
Unidentified Analyst
 
Ramon, you talked about 
the reinvestment and you talked about frontline, 
putting more investment in frontline. Can you maybe help us understand in 
terms of kind of the percentages you're allocating or you're thinking about in 
terms of increases in advertising and then also the in
-
store execution portion 
in NAB? And then the second question is you also talked about perhaps 
adding more capacity in the Frito business. So does that mean you're going 
to reduce your alliance on copackers?
 
Ramon Laguarta
 
I'll just start with Frito. Yes, 
we 
--
 
with the growth of the business, we're 
stretched on some of our technologies, which impacts the service, the 
demand on some of our products, so we'll be investing in additional capacity 
in Fritos. We're actually investing, and you should see it in 
--
 
I would 
assume, an additional share of market gain from us in the coming years. 
With regards to NAB investments, obviously, I cannot give you detail. This is 
a very sensitive information of where we're going to invest in our SMP 
money, but you should thin
k about us adding selling capacity across the U.S. 
for both our food service and our small format outlets.

Your next question comes from the line of Bonnie Herzog of Wells Fargo.
 
Bonnie Herzog
 
All right. I certainly sensed an overall level of urge
ncy from you based on 
your competition. And specifically, on NAB, you mentioned you're stepping 
up innovation investment to reignite growth. So I guess I've got a couple of 
questions. First, how much of a lag do you anticipate before you anticipate 
seeing 
improvements on your top line? And then, in general, how do you 
think about balancing this higher level of spending with your ability to drive 
profitability growth, and then more importantly, your ability to expand 
margins in NAB specifically, again, over 
the long term?
 
Ramon Laguarta
 
Yes. We've been investing in NAB now for a year or so in 
--
 
especially in our 
brands, but also in some of our execution capabilities. And we're seen good 
returns on some of those investments and not so good returns from some 
o
thers. So what we're doing is, clearly, optimizing our investments against 
the areas where we see we're getting more overall return. The performance 
of the company, as you saw in our Q4 numbers, is improving, right? So 
we're doing 
--
 
we had a good 2.5% in 
Q3, we grew 2% in Q4. So we'll keep 
investing in the business to get to a 
--
 
to stay positive. And our ultimate 
ambition is to grow with the market, and the timeline we're aspiring to do 
that is by the end of this year. It might take us a bit longer. The w
ay I see 
this is 
--
 
and this is my experience with businesses, large business that need 
to turn around is, you need to agree on a long
-
term objectives. In our case, 
is growing with the market and eventually growing share. And then give 
--
 
empower the team 
with the right resources, make them feel that you 
support them and give them very clear milestones to go after those 
--
 
that 
turnaround. That's what we're doing with NAB. The team is responding. 
We're having very clear process internally to monitor progres
s. And we feel 
good. We feel good and we feel fortunate to have the rest of the company 
portfolio to 
--
 
that we can still deliver a very good performance to the 
company and invest in what is going to be a very powerful business for us in 
the future.

Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Grundy of Jefferies.
 
Kevin Grundy
 
So I wanted to come back to portfolio considerations with beverages and 
snacks. So particularly, Ramon, the ability to drive more consumption 
occasions, so under sort of 
the thinking of the two or Better Together. And it 
sounds like you too are of the view that the beverage and snacks do belong 
together. But I think there have been some questions on how successful the 
company has been in that pursuit of cross
-
selling over 
the years, particularly 
given some of the notable challenges in beverages. So do you see it that 
way? Is that an unfair assessment that the company has not done as well as 
it could possibly could in terms of cross
-
selling and utilizing the strength of 
both
 
of these businesses. And as you're thinking about the priorities of how 
to reaccelerate growth in NAB, is there a greater cohesiveness with Frito that 
could be part of that strategy? So any comments there will be helpful.
 
Ramon Laguarta
 
Yes. Listen, I've 
been 
--
 
as you guys know, I've been in Europe for a few 
years. And there, we have this kind of what we call Power of One model in 
some countries, I don't know, in a lot of countries actually. And so I 
understand the value of where the scale makes sense and
 
where the focus 
makes sense. And more or less, I mean it's not a science. It's almost an art 
on where does the scale give you a competitive advantage and where the 
scale defocuses you. And so, listen, I don't know if you guys walk around the 
stores for th
e Super Bowl. But if you see the displays we're able to build 
together as an organization, the amount of traffic we build for our customers 
because of those displays, and the combined consumption that was between 
our 2 categories because of those display, 
you would see that there is a very 
clear opportunity for us to dial up if that is an opportunity. Also, on the cost 
side, we're doing a lot of things together, right? So if you think about 
freight, for example, it's a great area where we're in a lot of pro
ductivity 
because of combined freight. And as you think about future capabilities, 
we're trying to build them as a combined company.
 
Our e
-
commerce capability, some of the ones I referred to this morning, the 
consumer intimacy, so our ability to attract ta
lent, special talent, retain 
talent and challenge talent is much, much 
--
 
we have a much higher 
likelihood to succeed if we do it as a full PepsiCo. So we see many areas of 
value for Power of One, but we also see areas where Power of One could 
derail the p
erformance of each one of the businesses. So you will see, yes, 
there are opportunities, but we have to address them very carefully and with 
--
 
and we'll try to narrow. We'll make mistakes in some areas. We'll get 
better in others. So that's how you should
 
think, but yes, of course, France 
is a competitive advantage, and we would not be doing the best for our 
shareholders if we don't explore this area to the maximum.

Your next question comes from the line of Laurent Grandet of Guggenheim.

Lots of question about NAB and Frito
-
Lay. I like to 
--
 
would be interesting to 
having your perspective on the Quaker business and the role of Quaker in 
PepsiCo's portfolio in the near or long
-
term future. Is its margin now is at a 
relatively high le
vel, especially in comparison to other sales, I mean, 
businesses? Now it has not been growing for one and it seems like it's not 
really at the center of the impulse occasion, you said was the strength of 
PepsiCo. So really, would like to have your perspect
ive on the Quaker 
business going forward.
 
Ramon Laguarta
 
Okay. Thank you, Laurent. Listen, we love our Quaker business. I think it's a 
--
 
it compliments our portfolio, and it makes us strong in a daypart that in 
where we're weaker otherwise. Now we need to
 
be better at exploiting some 
of the opportunities of that brand internationally. So we have a very strong 
business in Europe and it's doing very well. Here domestically, you could 
think of the more we see clearly breakfast becoming an on
-
the
-
go occasion. 
It is 
--
 
people are rushing for to get to work early in the morning. There is a 
huge opportunity for us to play with Quaker in that, I would say, higher 
value, new consumer demand moment of breakfast on the go. You're going 
to see us innovating in that spa
ce. And you might 
--
 
you will see, again, 
another vector of Power of One as we leverage some of our go
-
to
-
market 
strength to deliver on the convenience on the go forward for Quaker. So I 
think it plays a role in our portfolio, apart from the, obviously, th
e cash flow 
it generates and the great returns we get from that business, but I would 
see it as part of our broader strategic opportunity of capturing demand 
moments where we're not very strong in right now.
 
Okay. I think we run out of time. So thank you a
ll of your time and 
participation in this morning's call. To conclude, I'd like to leave you with 
just 3 key thoughts: first, our overarching objective, as you saw, is to 
accelerate in a sustainable way, our top line growth; secondly, we're 
investing to li
ft performance across the business, making our best 
businesses better and our productivity lower performing businesses 
stronger; and third, we expect that investments we're making would not 
only benefit 2019 with accelerated top line growth, but will provi
de a solid 
foundation for sustainable, attractive market place and financial performance 
for the years to come.
 
We look forward to updating you on the progress throughout the year, and 
we thank you for the confidence you've placed in us with your investmen
ts. 
Thank you.

Senior Vice President Investor Relations
 
Thank you, operator. With me today are Indra 
Nooyi, PepsiCo's Chairman 
and CEO, and Hugh Johnston, PepsiCo's CFO. We'll lead off today's call with 
a review of our first quarter 2016 performance and full year outlook, and 
then we'll move on to Q&A. We've kept comments brief this morning and 
intend to 
conclude the call by 8:45.
 
Before we begin, please take note of our cautionary statement. This 
conference call includes forward
-

regarding 2016 guidance based on currently available information. Forward
-
looking statem
ents inherently involve risks and uncertainties that could 
cause our actual results to differ materially from those predicted in such 
forward
-
looking statements. Statements made on this conference call should 
be considered together with cautionary statemen
ts and other information 
contained in today's earnings release and in our most recent periodic reports 
filed with the SEC.
 
Unless otherwise indicated, all references to EPS and operating profit growth 
are on a core constant
-

As w
e discuss today's results keep in mind that our first quarter comprises 
the 12 weeks ended March 19, our North American operations and it is a 
short quarter for international businesses, reflecting the two months of 
January and February for most of our ope
rations outside of North America.
 
Also, please take note that we've reclassified certain functional support costs 
from SG&A to cost of sales, prior period amounts have also been reclassified 
and the details are footnoted on Pages A1 of the Q1 earnings rele
ase. These 
changes do not impact PepsiCo's overall revenue, operating profit, net 
income or earnings per share.
 
Now it's my pleasure to introduce Indra Nooyi.

Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
Thank you, Jamie.
 
I'm pleased to report that 
2016 is off to a good start with very strong 
operating results in the first quarter. Global Snacks organic volume 
increased by 1.5%; and Global Beverage organic volume increased 3%, the 
highest rate of quarterly beverage volume growth in three years.
 
We de
livered 3.5% organic revenue growth, led by high
-
single digit growth 
in Latin America and AMENA and 4% growth at Frito
-
Lay North America. Our 
five largest segments, Frito
-
Lay North America, North American Beverages, 
Latin America, ESSA and AMENA, each had 
both positive organic volume 
growth and positive net pricing.
 
Core gross margins expanded by 130 basis points and core operating 
margins expanded by 165 basis points, driven by the positive net pricing and 
continued execution of our productivity agenda, in
cluding the 
implementation of our Smart Spending program. Core constant currency 
operating profit grew 12% and core constant currency EPS grew 11%.
 
It is noteworthy that we delivered these results in a volatile and uncertain 
macroeconomic environment. Most
 
of the developed world outside the 
United States is grappling with slow growth. GDP growth in developing and 
emerging markets is also challenged with many D&E markets experiencing 
significant political unrest and high unemployment.
 
Key energy
-
producing co
untries are dealing with significant budgetary gaps; 
and high levels of local inflation in many of these markets are eroding 
disposable income and dampening consumer spending. It's a difficult 
environment indeed. Despite these macro challenges, we performe
d well. 
Our developing and emerging markets businesses grew organic revenue 7%, 
with double
-
digit growth in China, Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Turkey.
 
In the developed markets, we grew organic revenue by 2%, led by 
performance in the United States where we gre
w revenue 2.5%. In fact, in 
the first quarter, PepsiCo was once again the largest contributor to food and 
beverage retail growth in the United States, accounting for more growth 
than the next 17 largest manufacturers combined.
 
We've performed well because 
our approach to operating in this environment 
is and has been to execute well against what we can control and to retool 
our business models and operating system to cope with what we believe 
could be sustained volatility and uncertainty; and this is really 
what we're 
doing.
 
First, we've accelerated our innovation agenda, utilizing our proprietary 
Demand spaces framework. This has led to our new products being more 
incremental and has contributed significantly to our overall organic revenue 
growth. We've incr
eased the efficiency and effectiveness of new product 
launches by leveraging our global scale. We're more quickly and effectively 
lifting and adapting successful product launches from one market to another, 
driving more rapid expansion of our largest brand
s, as well as our future 
billion
-
dollar brands.
 
For example, in the first quarter outside of North America, Lipton Ready to 
Drink tea grew 10%, Mountain Dew grew volume 9%, Gatorade grew 9%, 
Naked Juice grew 60%, Sunbites grew 42% and Cheetos grew 9%. We'v
e 
continued to generate strong net price realization even in a sluggish 
consumer environment through enhanced revenue management capabilities 
and data analytics.
 
We've introduced new price pack combinations tailored to much more 
targeted shopper and consum
er occasions. For example, in North America 
over the past five years, we've shifted approximately 6% of our carbonated 
soft drink volume mix from traditional two
-
liter and 12
-
ounce multi
-
pack 
packages to higher margin, more profitable single
-
serve and alte
rnative 
multi
-
serve packages. These efforts have been driving higher net price 
realization for us and our retail partners.
 
We've also been future
-
proofing our product portfolio, reshaping it to 
capitalize on consumers' increasing interest in health and wel
lness. Just to 
give you an idea, we track two sets of numbers. First, what we view as 
everyday nutrition, which includes products that provide positive nutrients, 
like grains, fruit and vegetables, and protein, plus those products that are 
naturally nutrit
ious, like water and unsweetened tea. Now these products 
account for almost 25% of our portfolio by revenue.
 
Second, what we view as guilt
-
free products, these include the everyday 
nutrition products plus diet beverages and other beverages that are below 
7
0 calories per 12 ounces, and snacks with low levels of sodium and 
saturated fat. Guilt
-
free products account for approximately 45% of our 
portfolio by revenue. The growth of our everyday nutrition products, which 
accounts for a quarter of our global net r
evenue, is outpacing the growth of 
the balance of the portfolio. And we've had a significant amount of activity 
underway to transform our portfolio.
 
Just to give you a few examples, we've broadened our beverage portfolio to 
lessen our reliance on colas, an
d today we have the leading non
-
carbonated 
beverage portfolio in the United States. In fact, globally, just 12% of our 
revenues come from trademark Pepsi and less than 25% comes from 
carbonated soft drinks on a global basis.
 
We've invested in R&D to create
 
advantaged sweetener solutions and lower
-
calorie products, and we're aggressively moving our portfolio to package and 
product combinations with fewer calories. Mountain Dew Kickstart, with just 
40 calories per eight ounces, is a great example of our execu
tion in this 
area. Now in its third year, Kickstart generated more than $300 million in 
estimated retail sales in 2015 and posted 34% volume growth in the first 
quarter of 2016.
 
We've also been shifting more of our beverage A&M to lower
-
calorie 
products in
 
order to accelerate growth in strategically advantaged 
subcategories. And we are increasing the nutritional profile of our snacks 
and foods through the introduction of products like: Smartfood Delight, 
which grew volume over 75% in the first quarter; redu
ced fat Doritos, the 
top
-
selling Frito
-
Lay snack brand in schools, which grew volume 30% in the 
first quarter; and gluten
-
free Quaker Oats, just to name a few. Net
-
net, we 
feel pretty good about our portfolio transformation efforts.
 
Next, we are building a
nd investing in new capabilities to win in high
-
growth 
channels. To capitalize on increased out
-
of
-
home food and beverage 
consumption, we have consolidated our food service resources into one 
team, enabling us to creatively leverage the breadth of our prod
uct portfolio 
with our customers and consumers.
 
In the United States, foodservice now represents approximately 14% of our 
total revenue, and the first quarter outpaced the growth of the balance of 
other channels combined.
 
This year, we will be 
increasing the out
-
of
-
home availability of our everyday 
nutrition products, both snacks and beverages, through the targeted 
placement of approximately 20,000 Hello Goodness vending machines 
across North America.
 
Our advertising and marketing has also becom
e more impactful. First, we 
have stepped up our level of investment from 5.2% of sales in 2011 to 6.3% 
of sales in 2015. In the first quarter of 2016, our A&M expense increased by 
a further 65 basis points as a percentage of sales versus the prior
-
year 
qua
rter. At the same time, we've increased the effectiveness of our A&M 
investment by shifting more dollars into consumer
-
facing working A&M and 
by more effectively integrating social and digital media in our marketing 
campaigns.
 
We've also accelerated our pr
oductivity programs, contributing to consistent 
core margin expansion and providing investment funding for growth 
initiatives. Since 2012, we have generated $1 billion of annual productivity 
savings, and we are on pace to do so again this year.
 
In addition
, we have fully implemented our zero
-
based Smart Spending 
program across the enterprise. We're already seeing significant expense 
reductions in the areas targeted. And our organization is fully mobilized to 
identify opportunities to drive even greater leve
ls of productivity.
 
And then we have stepped up our market
-
based execution by working in 
creative new ways with our retail partners, like: unique joint execution of 
sports and entertainment properties; development of new and innovative 
merchandising and fo
untain equipment; execution of coordinated consumer 
promotions; and leveraging the combined power of the PepsiCo product 
portfolio.
 
For example, with 7
-
Eleven, Doritos and Super Bowl all turning 50 this year, 
in the first quarter we teamed up to offer cons
umers NFL experiences and 
prizes, including a trip to Super Bowl 50. When consumers purchase a 
golden combo of any size Doritos, Pepsi, Slurpee or grill item, they could 
scan their 7
-
Eleven app to receive a code to unlock prices from 
teamupforgold.com.
 
And
 
at Albertsons, we executed a joint promotion across PepsiCo's entire 
product portfolio in the All for Super Bowl sweepstake. It was a massive blitz 
of in
-
store displays in secular advertising and online promotions. When 
consumers purchase two or more part
icipating products in one transaction, 
they qualify to enter to win $50,000; one of 50 NFLShop.com gift cards 
every week during the promotion period.
 
These examples are by no means exception to the rule. They're just a couple 
of demonstrations of how we're
 
working creatively and collaboratively to 
deliver value to the consumer and be an indispensable growth partner for 
our retailers.
 
The actions we've taken and the investments we've made to strengthen our 
capabilities, our innovation, revenue management, po
rtfolio transformation, 
customer service initiatives in particular, is what helped us deliver 
impressive operating results in the first quarter. We continue to achieve 
healthy net revenue realization and new products continue to be an 
important contributor
 
to our sales growth.
 
Next, in the context of an interesting macro backdrop, we feel good about 
the state of our business and we're off to a good start in 2016. We believe 
we have the right plans in place. We have great people. We're executing 
well, we're 
investing in capabilities that will propel our future growth. We will 
continue to leverage our considerable advantages, our scale, geographic 
presence, product portfolio and Power of One synergies to succeed in this 
environment. And we're well
-
positioned t
o achieve our 2016 financial 
targets.
 
Many of our investors have commented me that they value PepsiCo because 
of our sustained reliable performance. As the stewards of this remarkable 50 
plus year
-
old enterprise, we're managing and investing in the busines
s to 
extend the duration of performance while achieving returns above our cost 
of capital; and we're committed to ensuring that our best years are ahead of 
us.
 
With that, let me turn the call over to Hugh Johnston. Hugh?
 
Hugh F. Johnston

Vice Chairman, C
hief Financial Officer & EVP
 
Thank you, Indra, and good morning everyone. As Indra mentioned, we're 
pleased with the financial results for the first quarter; and having a good 
start to the year with one quarter behind us gives us added confidence in 
achiev
ing the financial targets we shared with you in February.
 
And so, as you saw in this morning's release, we reaffirm those targets. 
Specifically, we expect approximately 4% organic revenue growth, excluding 
the impact of the 53rd week. And we expect 8% core
 
constant currency EPS 
growth, excluding the impact of deconsolidating our Venezuela operations; 
and 6% when including the Venezuela impact.
 
Notwithstanding our strong Q1 results, the macro outlook remains highly 
volatile and uncertain; and for this reason
, we are maintaining a cautious 
stance on the external factors that influence our business. So balancing a 
positive view of our execution against a more negative view of the macros, 
we arrive at the conclusion to keep our revenue and earnings guidance 
unch
anged.
 
We expect foreign exchange translation to negatively impact both revenue 
and EPS by approximately 4 percentage points, which is also unchanged 
from the full
-
year estimate we provided to you last quarter. As a reminder, 
we base our foreign exchange t
ranslation forecast on consensus rates. I 
know a number of you use spot rates, which currently leads you to a less 
significant impact. Clearly, as the year progresses, this gap will resolve 
itself, but we're holding to our outlook at a negative impact of 4
% for the 
year for both revenue and EPS. As a result, we continue to expect 2016 core 
EPS of $4.66.
 
Our outlooks on the other metrics we provide remain unchanged and are set 
out in this morning's release. For the analysts on the call, as you update 
your mo
dels, I'd ask that you consider the following factors. We have a more 
difficult core constant currency operating profit growth comparisons in the 
upcoming quarters at both Frito
-
Lay North America and North America 
Beverages. We anticipate a slower rate of 
gross margin expansion versus Q1 
as we expect raw material inflation, which includes the impact of transaction 
related foreign exchange for the balance of the year compared to modest 
deflation in Q1.
 
We will continue to invest in our business to drive sust
ainable long
-
term 
growth, including a planned increase in advertising and marketing expense 
as a percentage of sales for the full year. While we expect lower corporate 
expenses for the full year, primarily driven by lower pension cost, there will 
be quarte
rly volatility in this line item due to timing; and you should not 
expect to see the rate of decline that we had in Q1 for the full year.
 
The reinvestment of the 53rd week benefit will occur over the balance of the 
year. And, finally, we will be lapping Ve
nezuela earnings of approximately 
$0.03 per share in Q2 and $0.06 per share in Q3. Taken together, we expect 
balance of year EPS growth to be disproportionately weighted toward the 
fourth quarter.
 
With that, operator we'll take the first question.
 
Question

Operator
 
Our first question comes from the line of Dara Mohsenian of Morgan Stanley.
 
Indra K. Nooyi

Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
Good morning, Dara.
 
Dara W. Mohsenian

Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
 
Hi, good morning. So obviously a tough macro environment, as you 
mentioned, Indra, and org sales in the quarter were slightly below your full
-
year guidance. So I was just hoping for an update on your level of visibility 
you can hit 4% organic sales growth 
for the year, particularly as pricing 
moderates internationally with less FX pressure and you lap over some of 
the pricing changes in potato chips and A
-
beverages theoretically moderates 
a bit.
 
And then also, if you could, just comment specifically on the 
North American 
carbonated soft drink pricing environment, the 1% NAB result is below what 
we saw last year. So has anything changed from a competitive standpoint? 
Thanks.
 
Indra K. Nooyi 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
Okay. In terms of visibility for 
balance of the year, again, Dara, we can talk 
about what we control. Our innovation pipeline is looking good. Remember, 
the first quarter is not really the season for international, because it's only 
two months; and so we're really entering the season now.
 
And based on the 
innovation pipeline, based on the execution capability of our businesses, and 
knowing what we've sold into customers around the world both on retail and 
foodservice, at this point we feel optimistic about our revenue guidance for 
the year
. Again, this is based on everything that we can control and based 
on our assessment of the tough macroeconomic environment as we see it 
today. So I'd say, as the year progresses, we'll know more, but we feel 
reasonably optimistic about our 4% earnings gui
dance for the year.

Revenue.
 
Indra K. Nooyi

Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
Revenue 

 
sorry, revenue. Pardon me. Let me now turn to North American 
pricing. Again, when we look at 1% prici
ng here, it's really rounded down. It 
was closer to 1.5%. And again, we're just now entering the season. So 
based on what we've seen in the marketplace, we actually see quite a lot of 
discipline in pricing. And our hope is that given the dynamics of the CS
D 
category in particular that there will be continued discipline based mostly on 
revenue management and careful mix management. And that's what really 
what we're focused on. And our goal is to make sure that we don't do 
anything crazy on pricing, because p
ricing actions don't really drive volume 
growth. So we're just making sure that we focus on mix management and 
revenue management to keep getting the positive price utilization going 
through the year.
 
Hugh F. Johnston

Vice Chairman, Chief Financial Offic
er & EVP
 
Dara, to be also specific on CSD pricing, IRI showed 2.5% CSD pricing for 
the quarter. LRB was about 1.8%, which is consistent with what we've been 
seeing. So I think we continue to view the pricing environment as quite 
rational.

Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Good morning, Indra. It was 
interesting. I real
ize that corporate expense was a little more favorable, 
which you mentioned in the call, but you guys 

 
we saw a little bit less of an 
investment in SG&A this quarter versus what we've been seeing, let's say, 
over the past year and a half and really since 
the rebates back in 2012. So 
can you talk a little bit about where you think your investment levels are 
versus where you need to be and the balance between reinvestment and 
margin expansion as we look out over the next couple of years? Thanks.

Hey, John. This is Hugh. I'm not sure exactly how you're measuring less 
investment in SG&A, so it's probably worth a conversation offline on that. 
What I can say is, number one, A&M was up 65 basis points
 
year over year, 
so we continue to see a strong push into A&M. Number two, we do continue 
to invest in capabilities that enable globalization of best practices. And that's 
having a profoundly positive effect on both the innovation as well as the 
productivi
ty of the company.
 
What I suspect you may be seeing is the impacts of Smart Spending, which 
is off to a very successful start as of late last year and into this year. Certain 
of the big buckets that we're focused on in Smart Spending, whether it be 
travel 
or facilities, are actually down by meaningful percentages. So I think 
what you may be seeing is the net of that reflects less margin invested in 
SG&A than you've perhaps seen in previous quarters. But I don't want you 
to think that we're not investing in 
the brands and we're not investing in 
capabilities that drive performance. We absolutely are.

Hi, so just a question about I guess the mix in organic sales growth between 
volume and 
price/mix, and really just in North America and more a question 
going forward. Right now, we're seeing more of a contribution through 
revenue management I guess of price/mix, and you've supported that with 
product, with advertising. Just how sustainable do
 
you think that is going 
forward over the next couple years? And I guess my question is just at some 
point will we need to begin to see maybe more volume growth in order to 
sustain that kind of organic sales growth, or are we comfortable that we can 
contin
ue to have mix be a big component of the organic growth? Thanks.
 
Indra K. Nooyi 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
Brian, I don't think there's a clear answer to that because it's like an 
accordion, we go back and forth. A couple of years you get volume 
growth 
and then a couple of years you get more revenue growth because you have 
more opportunity to do mix management. When we premiumize the 
portfolio, for example, we get more revenue than we do volume because you 
get very good price realization on premiu
m products. And right now with the 
launch of lots of premium beverages and launch of premium products 
coming out of Frito
-
Lay, we're getting good price realization on that score.
 
And clearly when you do revenue management, even shifting to smaller 
packages
, mini
-
cans, you don't get much volume lift but you get revenue 
lift. And I think as I look into the future, I think you're going to see some 
volume growth. You're going to see effective mix management, both from a 
revenue management perspective and the pr
oduct portfolio itself, giving us 
robust revenue growth. A couple of years from now let's come back and 
revisit it, but right now that's the strategy going forward. And then we are 
very judicious in where we add capacity to make sure that we look at the 
re
alities of the volume growth in the marketplace.

Brazil is a tough, tough, tough market. It's fundamentally a good market. 
The population 

 
the demographics are pretty good. And when the country 
performs well, things are good. But recently in the last I'd say 12 to
 
18 
months, there have been a lot of self
-
induced problems in Brazil. And then 
the slowdown in China clearly has had an impact on Brazil because Brazil 
was the commodities supplier to the robust growth in China. And so it's 
going to take some time for Braz
il to get through its issues, its own political 
problems, and then of course, the global commodity price slump right now. 
So we are cautious in our approach to Brazil, focused more on value 
products. And where we can get some premium pricing in, we try to 
get it in. 
But Brazil has been 

 
I'd say globally, Brazil is one of the toughest economic 
situations today.
 
In the case of Russia, our core business is doing quite well because it's one 
of those markets where we have a spectacular portfolio, very balanced 
between all day parts, between good
-
for
-
you products, fun
-
for
-
you, better
-
for
-
you. It's a wonderful balance of products we have in Russia. And the 
Russian consumer is a good consumer, and we have a scaled business 
covering all of Russia.
 
I think two issues
 
are impacting Russia. One is the ruble and where it stands 
because when you have dollar
-
denominated costs coming into Russia, clearly 
it squeezes the middle of the P&L. and you can't price enough to cover all of 
it because the Russian consumer, which brin
gs me to the second point, 
Russian consumer wages are not going up as much as the cost of living 
bucket suggests it should go up. So there's a bit of a squeeze going on.
 
But all things considered, our team in Russia is mostly Russian, doing a 
very, very go
od job navigating through these issues in Russia. And I must 
say, but for these global macro conditions, especially the strength of the 
dollar squeezing the cost structure, we have a good business in Russia; and 
the team is doing a good job running it righ
t now.

Good morning, Indra and Hugh. A question on the charge you too
k in China. 
If you could, just elaborate what's going on with Tingyi
-
Asahi Beverages and 
what you think for the outlook. So what drove the charge? What's the 
environment like in China, and what do you think the outlook is for your 
business there?
 
Indra K. 
Nooyi 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
So let me start off by saying, Caroline, that Tingyi is still the leader in the 
beverage market in China; still has the most phenomenal infrastructure; 
widely covers China with all manufacturing technologies, cold
 
fill, hot fill, 
aseptic, water lines, you name it. They are an amazing scale player and they 
remain a valuable partner to PepsiCo. I think Tingyi has been impacted by a 
couple or three issues. They're a public company. You've seen all their 
disclosures an
d announcements. I'm not going to share with you anything 
that you don't know.
 
But basically the slowdown in the Chinese market for beverages overall 
driven by the macros; and some of the operational issues that Tingyi has 
had to cope with because of the c
hanges they were making to make their 
system more efficient has taken a short
-
term hit in performance. And I think 
the read
-
through has been that we too took a bit of a marginal hit in 
beverages in our performance as we've talked about openly in our earnin
gs 
calls.
 
But having said that, within China we have a very good business in foods 
and nutrition and our beverage business sequentially is beginning to do 
better. So we remain cautiously optimistic. As far as our partnership with 
Tingyi is concerned, look,
 
our ownership was based on a price that we 
recorded when we first did the transaction. Since that time the overall 
Chinese market has come down a lot.
 
And secondly because of Tingyi's own performance, their stock has come 
down quite a bit. And so we felt 
it was prudent to mark down the value of 
our investments. Having said that, we remain very committed to the Tingyi 
partnership. And once they get through their issues, which they have to get 
through, we can help them, but they're a public company, we'll be
 
back to a 
partnership that continues to sing.

Good morning. Is it safe to assume that the pricing in emerging markets is 
going to lap in the back half of the year? And just curious for you and the 
industry kind of what happens when those laps take place? And then maybe 
if you could ju
st sort of disaggregate the mix benefit versus the price 
benefit?
 
Hugh F. Johnston 
-
 
Vice Chairman, Chief Financial Officer & EVP
 
Bill, this is Hugh. I think it's safe to assume that we'll continue to get good 
solid pricing in those markets. I understand w
hat you're pointing out is as 
dollar
-
based commodities become less inflationary in local terms, will we 
continue to get the same level of commodity
-
driven pricing. It remains to be 
seen. Part of our pricing is obviously driven by commodities, part of it is
 
driven by what else is happening in the local economy. To the degree that 
pricing is less, I do expect that we'll see some volume bounce back. Because 
in those markets when you have emerging consumers that are entering the 
categories, obviously as we take
 
less price we tend to increase adoption 
more rapidly.
 
So I think we probably will see a bit more volume and a bit less price in 
developing and emerging markets in the back half of the year, but that 
remains to be seen. The outlook, as we've talked about e
arlier, is not just 
overly positive; it's also quite uncertain.
 
Regarding mix versus rate, I assume that's a North America beverage 
question because that's a tough one to answer globally. About two
-
thirds of 
the pricing benefit that we saw in the first qua
rter was rate, and about a 
third was mix. So we continue to see good balance. In fact, if anything, 
we've probably got a little bit more rate than we have been getting in the 
previous quarters.

Good morning, Judy.
 
Judy E. Hong

Thank you. Good morning. So I guess on margin, if I look at the Q1 
performance and then the outlook for the balance of the year, it 
seems like 
Q1 certainly benefited from very strong margin performance and then 
maybe the balance of the year you're really looking for very little margin 
expansion. So, Hugh, I know you went through some of the drivers, but if 
you could elaborate a little 
bit more just in terms of the Q1 bead. And 
particularly I think Frito had very strong margins and then how sort of that 
phasing works out for the balance of the year?
 
Hugh F. Johnston 
-
 
Vice Chairman, Chief Financial Officer & EVP
 
Judy, happy to try to add
 
a bit more on that. As I mentioned during the 
prepared remarks portion of the script, commodities were a little bit 
deflationary in Q1 because of the overlaps, particularly overlaps around the 
energy prices. Commodities will turn to a bit inflationary in 
the balance of 
the year. So obviously that's a drag on margins.
 
Number two, there were certainly some timing of expenses, particularly as it 
related to corporate expenses as I've mentioned. That gave us a big 
tailwind. Corporate expenses overall will be do
wn in 2016, but they won't be 
down at the same rate that you saw in Q1. So for the balance of the year, it 
will spread itself out a bit more evenly. The net of all of that is I would 
expect less margin improvement in Q2 and Q3; and then you'll see stronger
 
margin improvement again in Q4.

Good morning, thanks. I guess two, if 
I could. Hugh, you mentioned the 
worsening macro assumptions in your outlook versus a few months ago. 
Could you just talk maybe about where those incremental concerns are most 
focused? And then, Indra, picking up on your comments on new product 
innovations
, could you update us on how much of your revenue is driven by 
new product innovation and whether that differs materially across divisions? 
And I guess also if there's a measure you look at to assess the longevity of 
new product contributions; in other wor
ds, differentiating between sort of 
short
-
term flavor extensions and more lasting successes like Kickstart has 
come to represent. Thanks.
 
Indra K. Nooyi

Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
Go ahead, Hugh.
 
Hugh F. Johnston

Vice Chairman, Chief Financial 
Officer & EVP
 
So I think the two places where we're probably incrementally less optimistic, 
number one is South America, not Mexico. Mexico, I think, we're quite 
positive on, but the balance of South America obviously is a challenge. And 
then number two 
is Eastern Europe. Eastern Europe is obviously continuing 
to be challenged from a GDP perspective and that flows through to 
disposable income and therefore to consumer spending on our products. The 
balance I think were probably roughly in line with where w
e've been.
 
Indra K. Nooyi 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
And in terms of new products, Steve, typically what we look for is 9% of our 
revenue growth to come from new products and innovation. That's really 
what we targeted for ourselves this year, and
 
we're running close to that 
number. Again, one quarter in innovation for the year does not make. So 
what I'm going to give you is what we expect the year to come in at. And 
last year, we came very close to that 9% number. And typically, what we 
look for w
ithin that is a 75% line extensions, what we call, refresh 
innovation, because news drives growth in this category. And then 25% we'd 
like it to be reframe and breakthrough, which is new platforms or 
substantially new packaging that can take the business t
o a whole new level. 
And again, across the world this number varies, but roughly speaking that's 
what we shoot for.
 
And the thing to be careful was about Kickstart was a new platform, but 
after a couple of years it becomes part of the base of the company, 
and then 
we have to rely on flavor extensions to continue to drive it. And so 
something that's reframe or breakthrough the first year after a couple or 
three years starts to go back into the base and starts getting counted in 
refresh. So really how we coun
t innovation is really stuff that's been 
launched and is in the market for at least two years. And we look at the 
performance of that business on a rolling basis. So right now we're running 
at about 9%; and it's 75:25 refresh versus reframe and breakthroug
h.

Hey, guys, so three quick things, if I may. One is, if you cou
ld, just tell us 
about the impact of the deconsolidation of Venezuela on your organic top 
line growth and maybe even on your margins, if any. So as you're pulling it 
out, what was the impact on the organics?
 
Two is, if you could, give us some more 

 
partic
ularly for investors who 
remain concerned about price irrationality coming back in the U.S. Clearly 
it's just a little bit of Nielsen data, one quarter of what you said rounded 
down. But can you give us more to those investors about why you think you 
need 
to continue being price rational in the North American market? I field 
those questions all day, so I'd love to hear from you.
 
And then third is just Tingyi as a jumping off point. If you can, characterize 
the problems there that you described earlier. How 
much of it was macro 
stock market broad issues versus the PepsiCo
-
Tingyi partnership, that 3P, 
third
-
party type partnership, and if that means anything differently in the 
way you guys view the way you want to distribute on a global basis with 
third parties

SAB obviously coming together, but just broadly

impact on Venezuela or Venezuela?

I'm happy to. Ali, revenue on Venezuela was a point, not meaningful on 
margins.
 
Indra K. Nooyi 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
Let me talk about pricing.
 
Ali, I can only talk about what we're going to do. 
Our belief is that it's very important that you really execute price rationally 
in the market because when you drop the price too much, it doesn't drive 
that much consumption growth, volume growth. I thin
k we're at a point in 
the market in many of our categories where you can grow the business 
through premiumization, real innovation. But just playing a price game does 
not drive volume growth and it actually destroys value. So that's our 
strategy and that's
 
the playbook that we're going to execute.
 
Let me turn to Tingyi. I think I gave you a pretty complete answer when 
Caroline asked the question, but let me just add to it. You've seen the Tingyi 
results, you've heard their call, you've heard all of the news
 
that comes out 
of Tingyi, so I'm not going to talk about a public company that announces its 
results on its own. I'll just tell you that from my perspective or our 
perspective, clearly macroeconomics has played a role. I think Tingyi itself is 
trying to r
etool itself to become more efficient. And whenever you're going 
to do a transformation or retooling, there is going to be disruption in the 
business.
 
And finally, the PepsiCo
-
Tingyi partnership started off very well and I think it 
will come right back to 
where it was intended to be. The transition where we 
consolidate distribution systems, where we sort our products between 
PepsiCo
-
oriented distribution system or premium products oriented 
distribution system versus a value
-
oriented product distribution sys
tem, that 
transition is taking a little bit longer and it's a little bit more painful. I wish it 
could happen faster, but that's the reality of what we're living with because 
the slowdown in the macros has not helped either. So from a Tingyi 
perspective, a
s I said, we remain optimistic, and we just need to power 
through this and provide the help in terms of capabilities and knowledge 
transfer to them so they can get through the difficult period.
 
And I don't think Tingyi is indicative of any problems on a gl
obal basis. I'll 
tell you something. We have hundreds of partners globally in the beverage 
business. At any point, some percentage of those bottlers go through issues. 
That's the same for any company in this beverage business. And the 
strength of the franc
hise company is how do you help that bottling entity 
recover from its issues given that we operate COBOs [Company Operated 
Beverage Operations] and we have a reservoir of capabilities. That's really 
what we're doing it, taking people from our established C
OBOs, sending 
them into these bottler businesses to help them improve their performance. 
So I don't see any major red flags here, Ali.

The biggest factor in that is wage inflation. Recall, when we've talked about

A question for Hugh on North American profitability and margins there in 
your line of sight for improvement. So this is kind of a broader q
uestion for 
you, but I was hoping you could kind of briefly touch on what's the margin 
ambition in Frito? Can that be a 35% operating margin business over time? 
Quaker would seem like there's a significant opportunity there now without 
the Muller JV weighi
ng on it. Can that return to a 30% operating margin 
business? And that would seem like that could happen over a much quicker 
period of time without that weighing it down. And then if you could briefly 
touch on NAB as well, which is a bit more difficult giv
en the vertical 
integration there with bottler ownership. So any commentary there? I'm 
sorry that's a bit broad
-
based, but would be helpful. Thank you.
 
Hugh F. Johnston 
-
 
Vice Chairman, Chief Financial Officer & EVP
 
I'm happy to do that. As you all know, w
e don't give division
-
specific margin 
guidance. It just gets into a level of granularity and detail that's probably 
more confusing than helpful. That said, I would broadly say all of our North 
American businesses have the potential to continue to see impro
ved 
margins. How are they going to do that? Number one, it will be through our 
broad
-
based supply chain productivity programs. We continue to take cost 
out. Particularly moving from the plant to the store, we're getting more and 
more efficient at operating
 
that distribution network.
 
Number two, Smart Spending continues to present an opportunity to 
enhance margins; and again that occurs across all of our businesses. And 
number three, as Indra pointed out earlier, we continue to see a lot of 
opportunities to 
premiumize our products. With those premium products 
come good price points. And once the products are in the marketplace and 
the A&M has normalized on those new products, you can expect to see those 
earn premium margins over time.
 
So, again, I don't want 
to get into specific division level margin guidance, 
but I do believe that all of our North American businesses will continue to 
see margin improvement over time.

Question

and

Answer Session
 
Operator
 
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of 
Dara Mohsenian of Mor
gan Stanley.
 
Dara Mohsenian
 
Hi, gentlemen, hope you're well in this environment. So Ramon I just 
wanted to touch on the market share opportunity in snacks and beverages 
going forward. It sounded like the momentum was pretty strong through 
February pre
-
COVI
D and in the COVID environment.
 
But I was hoping you could discuss if there's opportunity for improved share 
structurally longer term as you look coming out of the COVID crisis. 
Theoretically in snacks there's a shift to larger trusted brands, which is in 
your wheelhouse and you've got the DSD distribution advantage. So from a 
retailer and consumer standpoint there could potentially be a shift there.
 
And then in beverages, theoretically less exposure to the away
-
from
-
home 
channel than some of your competito
rs should enable you to invest behind 
the business. So just, sort of, curious if you could run through how you're 
positioning yourselves for market share advantages coming out of this 
COVID crisis and if you think there could be some structural improvement
 
longer term beyond what you've already seen over the last year or so.
 
Ramon Laguarta
 
Yeah, good morning, Dara. Yeah, it's a good question. Obviously in a 
moment when it's hard to predict where the category will go right in the 
coming months then share of 
market becomes clearly the number one 
priority for the organization. And as you were saying the investments we 
made in the business last year both in our structural capabilities but also the 
strength of our brands and in particular markets gave us a lot of
 
momentum. And as you saw in Q1, it was our fastest growing quarter in a 
long time even if you deduct the last couple of weeks where we had a 
positive impact from the stockpiling in the U.S.
 
So you would 
--
 
even though 
--
 
if you were to ask our people on t
he ground 
share of market is the key variable. We see ourselves as you were saying, 
it's a moment where large brands that people trust, strong supply chains 
and go
-
to
-
markets like we have. Very importantly the talented people that 
we have in the marketplac
e, experienced and very talented I think superior 
teams probably in the marketplace should give us an edge in terms of 
competing in these few months ahead of us where there's going to be a lot 
of volatility and being agile and strong. I think it's going to
 
be a very positive 
opportunity for ourselves.
 
Operator
 
Your next question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane of Bank of America 
Merrill Lynch.
 
Bryan Spillane
 
Hey, good morning, everyone. And maybe just a follow
-
up on Dara's 
question. As I was listening
 
to the recorded message, I guess what I took 
away from it was there is going to be still some investment in SG&A this 
year some of it in response to the environment, some of it maybe be 
opportunistic in terms of market share gains. So I guess is that a co
rrect 
characterization of it as we're thinking about as the year unfolds and the 
pressure points or the stresses in the P&L? You're looking to spend in SG&A 
this year because you want the business to exit stronger and also there's 
going to be some investme
nts to adapt to the environment?
 
Ramon Laguarta
 
Hi, Bryan. Good morning. Yes. Of course, I mean, we were in an investment 
position, and we were very selective, obviously, where we're putting the 
investments and trying to look for the highest ROI investment
s everywhere 
around the world in the different categories. We're not planning to change 
that position even we might have opportunities ahead of us that tell us that 
probably the best decision would be to even double down on some of those 
market opportuniti
es where we can take maybe a short
-
term advantage 
now, which will be structural gains for long term. On the other hand, we're 
looking at all our discretionary costs with a lot of intensity.
 
And as we said in the note, we're looking holistically and very in
tentionally at 
unnecessary costs in our P&L at this point both, obviously, to things that are 
unnecessary, we're going to stop them, but also to have the flexibility to 
reallocate into areas of the business where we see acceleration. For 
example, we're see
ing, obviously, as you're hearing from everybody else e
-
commerce being a high
-
growth channel at this point. So we're reallocating 
resources from other parts of the P&L into e
-
commerce and capturing 
consumers in that particular channel, and then obviously, 
we'll be 
--
 
keep 
investing to retain those consumers as they probably stay in the e
-
commerce. There are some brands that are benefiting from this more 
consumption at home like Quaker.
 
Well, I think we want to invest in some of those brands that are getting
 
consumer tailwinds now because we want to retain those consumers with 
the brands as we exit the crisis situation. So, yes, our mentality was 
--
 
going 
into the crisis was a mentality of attack. I think we continue to be on the 
attack, same mentality, obvio
usly put in some strong criteria of ROI to those 
investments and being very, very kind of tough with every single line of our 
P&L to make sure that whatever is unnecessary is not there anymore.

Your next question comes from the line of Bonnie Herz
og of Goldman Sachs.
 
Bonnie Herzog
 
Thank you. Good morning. I have few questions for you guys on energy 
drinks. You're certainly stepping up your game here with the announcement 
you made this morning to distribute Bang. So hoping you could give us a 
little more color on how you're going to 
manage the energy category with 
the different brands. Now you've got Rockstar and now distributing Bang and 
eventually Mountain Dew. So curious to hear how you're going to prioritize 
these different brands and how you see the different positioning of them.
 
And then could you guys give us a sense as to how you're going to hit the 
ground running now that the Rockstar deal is closed? I'm just curious if your 
plans have changed given everything going on with COVID also as it relates 
to Mountain Dew. Thank you.
 
Ramon Laguarta
 
Good morning. Yes, let me give you a 
--
 
I mean, this is consistent with what 
we have been saying in the past that we see the energy need state as a very 
large need state that will stay for many years. I think consumers will need 
energy durin
g the day in developing markets, developed markets all over 
the world and that we're going after that consumer occasion with multiple 
vectors. We're playing with the coffee category, and we continue to think 
that the coffee category is a great opportunity 
to capture a lot of occasions 
there. So with our partnership with Starbucks and some of the innovation we 
had there, we've been very successful to play in energy need state. 
Obviously, we have our own innovation with GameFuel and some other 
innovations we 
had in the past. The Rockstar deal gives us the opportunity 
to play with more of these spaces in 
--
 
that energy provides.
 
So yes, we'll have the Rockstar portfolio, which I think has been 
underinvested in the past. So now there are more incentives for our 
people 
to drive that business, and we're going to invest in Rockstar. So that's going 
to be a good segment for us. Obviously, Bang has been a beautiful addition 
to our portfolio in terms of a differentiated brand that has a lot of 
momentum in the US in par
ticular channels.
 
A lot of opportunities still in terms of additional distribution and some 
channels that are not available. So I think our distribution muscle will give 
Bang an additional push, and there's clearly a lot of consumer positive 
reception to t
hat brand, so we'll benefit from that. And then as we said in 
the past, we have a brand in our portfolio, Mountain Dew, that I think has a 
lot of opportunities in that space as well, and it's kind of natural for Mountain 
Dew to play in the energy boost cat
egory. So you will see some more 
innovation of our Mountain Dew brand to play more intentionally in that 
space. And that's how we think about the multiple tools that we can use to 
play into what is a huge need state. And I think we'll continue with people 
moving to mega cities and people having very hectic lifestyles.

Your next question comes from the line of Nik Modi of RBC Capital Markets.
 
Nik Modi
 
Hi, good morning, everyone. Ramon I was hoping you can talk about go
-
to
-
market and I'm thinking mor
e on the Gatorade side. I mean clearly having 
availability in a time like this has been critical. And so when you think about 
warehouse versus DSD of Gatorade between the channels small format, 
large format and some of the tests that you're running in the 
Midwest, then I 
was hoping you could just kind of opine on how you think this should evolve 
in the future given that this could potentially happen again at some point in 
the future?
 
Ramon Laguarta
 
Yes, that's a great question. I think probably the difficul
t logistic situation 
that we've seen in the marketplace in the last few weeks in the U.S. but 
across the world has probably brought more light to the opportunity that we 
have in finding better ways to move our Gatorade products into the stores.
 
And althoug
h, we have been with great collaboration with all our customers 
and our partners to find solutions to get that brand quickly into the store 
because there is a lot of demand for it we've seen some bottlenecks.
 
So as you say we're considering multiple option
s. Obviously the final 
decision is always a combination of top line growth and additional cost and 
complexity to the organization. So it's a complex decision given the size of 
the brand and the complexities from the logistics point of view. It's a very 
sea
sonal brand that has a lot of volume between say May to September, 
right? So it's a huge spike to our logistics system.
 
So it is a big strategic decision. It's one that we're as you say we're testing 
different options. We're giving it a lot of thinking tim
e. And the decision will 
be made together with our partners in the retail space and obviously 
internally looking at all the different variables. It's a potentially big outlook 
for Gatorade but also a difficult decision from many points of view.

with all of you. So I was hoping if you can talk about the strength in at
-
home consumption. So I'
m assuming your shipping is still below your 
demand and you are not worried about any stock destocking in the second 
quarter.
 
So I was just thinking in your outlook of the low single
-
digit decline for the 
second quarter. Are you just assuming as we cycle t
hrough the immediate 
consumption channels, they're still going to be very much impaired through 
most of the second quarter? And if you can give us an idea what happened 
in some of the places where the restrictions were lifted. Thank you.
 
Ramon Laguarta
 
And
rea, good morning. Listen we're seeing a lot of uncertainties on how the 
economies will go back to normal, right? And we have 

 
obviously, as you 
can imagine, we have multiple scenarios in what could happen.
 
There are a lot of scenarios that say that it's 
not going to be so linear as you 

 
well you're saying that economies will go back to opening right away and 
that's going to be it, right? I think there might be some scenarios where 
there will be ups and downs in the way the virus spreads and there will be
 
some particular local areas that could be more exposed in particular 
moments of time and so on.
 
It might require some additional lockdown decisions or other sort of 
decisions by the government. So our 

 
the fact that we're saying that we see 
uncertainties
 
on geography channels and categories is because we're 

 
many of our scenarios done are not as linear as you're saying.
 
You're right in pointing out that most of the impact in our categories, 
especially beverages is related to lack of mobility of people an
d then there 
are particular channels that are very linked to mobility and transportation 
and obviously, some of the out
-
of
-
home food.
 
Obviously, if consumers are moving around, there will be more consumption, 
especially in convenience and gas channel and a
 
bit more on workplaces 
where we have a good business as well. So that should improve assuming 
that the consumer will stay 

 
will be able to continue to move around for the 
foreseeable months.
 
Now 

 
but the reason why we're seeing more uncertainty is becau
se we 
don't think it's going to be a straight line once people go back to moving 
around. It's going to be a restricted mobility I think and with potential 
second waves in some particular markets. That's why we're staying cautious 
and we prefer to have that
 
kind of flexibility in our guidance at this point.

Your next question comes from the line of Kaumil Gajrawala of Credit Suisse.
 
Kaumil Gajrawala
 
Everybody, good morning. Can you talk a bit more about the Bang deal? It 
obviously makes sense and 
congratulations on becoming a lot more 
meaningful in the energy space in what seems like a fairly short period of 
time. But maybe just some more specifics. It looks like it's a distribution 
deal and historically distribution deals have favored the founder 
or supplier a 
bit more than they favored the distributor. Is there a path to ownership? I 
think, there's been some deals in the past where a lack of a path to 
ownership has been detrimental. And maybe just some other basics as in 
time horizon how long is t
his deal. Is it perpetual? Things like that. Thanks.
 
Ramon Laguarta
 
Hugh, you want to give it your perspective?
 
Hugh Johnston
 
Yes. Yes, happy, to do that Ramon. Good morning, Kaumil. A couple of 
things on it. Obviously, we're not going to disclose all of t
he details of the 
deal. The way I'd characterize it is, I think, it presents great upside for the 
Bang people. It gives them broader and deeper distribution than what 
they've had to date. It also 
--
 
it represents a nice win for us and it really 
helps us fi
ll out the energy portfolio as we move to a more assertive posture 
on this category.
 
In terms of any forward deals or sort of M&A contemplated, none of that is 
in there. So we expect this to sustain for a good period of time. And the last 
comment I'd make 
is, unlike the Rockstar deal, we really don't have 
meaningful restrictions in terms of the way that we manage our portfolio. So 
we certainly feel, as we take a more assertive posture, we have the freedom 
to operate in the energy space a great deal.

Your next question comes from the line of Lauren Lieberman of Barclays.
 
Lauren Lieberman
 
Great. Thanks. Good morning.
 
Ramon Laguarta
 
Good morning.
 
Lauren Lieberman
 
In the prepared remarks, you guys have talked about developing in 
emerging markets, feelin
g pressure and that that was sort of thing you were 
thinking about, discretionary coming under pressure and how the 
macroeconomic could hurt categories. So I just wanted to get a little bit 
more on that your thoughts around, because I think category develo
pment 
of packaged snacks is a big part of the kind of long
-
term plan in 
international markets and the investments that you've been making, 
particularly, to promote and support some of your bigger brands, make 
them a bigger global footprint. So I know it's 
still pretty early days in all of 
this, but if you could just talk about D&E market development for snacks as 
you think about how this crisis unfolds.
 
Ramon Laguarta
 
Yes, yes. Hi, Lauren. And just a bit of 
--
 
as you say, it's still very early, right, 
in 
--
 
if you think about Latin America or Middle East, Africa. Eastern Europe 
has been in the crisis for a bit longer parts of Asia.
 
What we're seeing in short term is two
-
fold. One is, there's a good part of 
the universe of outlets that we service that are shu
t down or partially shut 
down during the lockdown. And that impacts a numerical distribution, but 
also the initial channel sell
-
in and that impacts our sales.
 
Then the 
--
 
if you think about the consumer occasions in those markets, 
developing markets, there
's a lot of on
-
the
-
go occasions in those markets, 
especially 
--
 
it tends to be a younger population that buys our products, 
snacks especially. And a lot of the occasion had to do with moving around or 
either from school to home or hanging out with friends 
on the streets. I 
mean, those kind of occasions are big. And those are somehow limited, 
right, in the current realities. So that is being impacted.
 
Structurally we don't see any challenge to date, right? What we see is 
actually probably the opposite. I thi
nk, we have, as I was saying at the 
beginning, very strong supply chains in most of these markets and the 
brands are quite established. And we're very good at managing the 
affordability levels in those markets. So where price points or pack price is 
very i
mportant, we have a lot of flexibility in our snack business to adapt the 
price points in the packs to whatever the currency impacts are in the cost 
and the price points.
 
So I think there is a lot of know
-
how. I think we see this as an opportunity 
for us t
o even go deeper in our distribution eventually and to double down to 
accelerate share of market in those 
--
 
in a lot of the geographies where we 
participate. So we see some short
-
term impact because of the distribution 
challenges that I told you at the be
ginning. As soon as the retailers are back 
to business and we see that happening in many markets after a couple of 
weeks, obviously, they cannot be opened from the family income point of 
view, they go back to opening their stores and then life goes back to
 
normal.
 
So we think that this could be actually a boost to our acceleration of the per 
cap development, our market share presence in a lot of the international 
markets. The relative size of our business versus competitors tends to be 
quite large in a lot 
of our snack businesses globally and we see that as an 
opportunity today.

Your next question comes from the line of Rob Ottenstein of Evercore.
 
Rob Ottenstein
 
Great. Thank you very much. Guys, at a time when a lot of companies are 
suspending or cu
tting their dividend, cutting or stopping share buybacks you 
guys have basically committed to your initial guidance on those $2 billion of 
share buybacks, which is just a tremendous financial strength. My question 
is, is given how the world has changed, ho
w you're thinking about capital 
allocation now and priorities. Does opportunistic M&A make more sense? 
How are you weighing all these things in terms of priority also including 
perhaps even stepping up marketing which was increased a lot last year? 
And in 
Q4 you said, it may or may not be increased ahead of sales this year. 
That was something you were considering, so, just kind of big picture how 
you're reevaluating capital allocation. Thank you.
 
Ramon Laguarta
 
Hugh, do you want to take that one?
 
Hugh 
Johnston
 
Yeah. Happy to. Rob, a lot of ways there really isn't much change in the way 
that we think about capital allocation relative to what we've talked about in 
the past. You're right we do have terrific financial strength. We've actually 
been in the de
bt markets both short term and long term and are able to get 
money at extended maturities at quite attractive rates. So we do have the 
financial flexibility to continue with the share repurchase as well as obviously 
pay the dividend.
 
In terms of the capita
l allocation priorities, it's really number one invest in 
the business and we'll do that as we see opportunity to do that. Number 
two, we'll pay the dividend. Number three, we'll continue to look at M&A, but 
as always we're very selective in the past and a
s in very selective as in the 
past and for the number of things that we look at we execute against very, 
very few.
 
And then last share repurchase, so no real change in that regard. And 
thankfully, because of the way that we've put together the balance shee
t, 
and because of the strength of the cash flows of the company, we're in a 
position to continue to execute cash return to shareholders.

Your next question comes from the line of Vivien Azer of Cowen.
 
Vivien Azer
 
Hi. Good morning. Thank you for th
e question. I was hoping to dive a little 
bit deeper on your commentary around increased at
-
home per capital 
consumption during your prepared remarks around consumers eating more 
breakfast and snacking more at home. That seems to be apparent in the 
Nielsen
 
data that's come out today, where salty snacks continues to grow 
though it did decelerate. But I think, it does kind of raise the bigger question 
that it seems like some categories are seeing a pantry load and a de
-
load 
like with sports drinks down in the
 
current four
-
week period and some still 
stronger. So as you're thinking about the second quarter, which categories 
do you think can sustain higher levels of per capita consumption in the at
-
home occasion? And where do you expect to see some pantry destock
ing? 
Thank you.
 
Ramon Laguarta
 
Good. Yeah, let me try that. We're seeing, yeah, as you're saying both 
obviously our Quaker range increasing penetration massively. So the 
number of families that have bought Quaker in the last six weeks has gone 
up a lot.
 
An
d we're seeing obviously, I mean there's one clear reason, right? People 
are cooking at home and therefore they're using the product more. And 
we're seeing the cycle of repurchase also good. So I don't think there's much 
stocking in the house as long as pe
ople continue to have breakfast or 
continue to cook at home. And we're emphasizing in our marketing not only 
the breakfast opportunity, but also the cooking and the recipes where our 
oats can be part of that cooking opportunity. And this is here in the U.S
., but 
it's also in Latin America where we've moved 100% to recipes on oats and 
some of our Quaker products.
 
The good news for us is, we've made a lot of positive changes to Quaker 
products, right? We reduced sugar. We reduced artificials. We improved the 
formulas. I think we have better
-
tasting products as well. So hopefully, this 
is an opportunity for the consumers to reassess the brand and to give it a 
structural boost. So we're dedicating our market investments to that 
particular trial and repurchase of
 
the Quaker range of product, which I think 
are extremely good and great tasting.
 
Then, when you see the snack product, obviously, I mean there's many 
more occasions in the family now with the kids at home, and with 

 
we're all 
taking breaks during the day
 
between our busy days and then occasions 
watching TV together as a family or whatever. So, there are a lot of 
occasions at home now that they were not there six or seven weeks ago. So 
we're also emphasizing the 

 
in our advertising the opportunities that 
the 
snacks category give consumers to have moments of enjoyment during this 
confinement. We're seeing our multipacks, our variety packs increasing 
massively. We're seeing our Tostitos brand, our dips going up a lot. I mean, 
obviously, every single brand, b
ut those are where we're seeing the highest 
growth.
 
And the beauty to your point on stocking, the beauty of our snacks is that, it 
can only last for a certain period of time and they have expiry dates. So 
consumers will eat them. They will not stock them f
orever. So we see the 
cycles of repurchase also very clear on the snack business and those are 
products that people buy put in their pantry and they get consumed by the 
whole family.

Your next question comes from the line of Steve Powers of Deutsc
he Bank.
 
Steve Powers
 
Hey good morning guys. Hope you're well. Ramon looking out over the 
horizon and I guess building on some of the comments you made in 
response to Andrea's question. I was hoping you could elaborate a bit 
further on your early thoughts 
around an exit strategy from current 
lockdown conditions specifically in North America and Western Europe, 
maybe building on any lessons learned from China and commenting on 
whether that strategy and its timing is likely to vary at all snacks versus 
bevera
ges in your view.
 
And I guess, I'd also love any thoughts you have as 
--
 
or expectations 
around how your approach and the timing may differ across markets 
whether based on consumer 
--
 
customer mentalities, your competitive 
standing or just governmental pol
icy. Just what does the exit strategy look 
like?
 
Ramon Laguarta
 
Yes. No I was 
--
 
my point was more about the fact that will it be very linear 
or not. And I think as we're obviously looking at all the different scenarios 
and as we imagine managing the compa
ny now is 
--
 
there's a lot of scenario 
planning and a lot of options and staying super agile. That's kind of the way, 
we're empowering the front line being super agile and just playing scenarios. 
I mean that's the way we're managing the company today.
 
So i
n our scenario planning, I mean the chances of every country opening up 
and every state opening up and not having second waves, I think are low. 
right? I mean you've seen the virus. The virus is still around. We don't have 
treatments and we don't have vacc
ines.
 
So until we have good treatments and good vaccine, we should be very 
cautious, right? And therefore it's going to be down to a lot of 
--
 
billion of 
people, individual behaviors whether we get contaminated or not. So that's 
what I meant, right, when I
 
said we need to be careful that we don't project 
straight lines, the moment the state opens we're all free and that business 
will come back. I think there's going to be a lot of iterations.
 
Our approach to this is, I would say extremely aggressive on the 
commercial 
side in the sense that we want to be the first knocking at the door or every 
single store that opens with our mechanics and our salesmen trying to fix 
the equipment and refill the coolers and putting our racks in the first position 
and making su
re that every consumer that walks into that store buys our 
products. So that's 
--
 
from the commercial mentality that's how we're 
approaching this opportunity of restarting a lot of points of sale.
 
From the safety of our employees, obviously we're being ext
remely cautious 
and want to make sure that our people are extremely well protected and 
that are 
--
 
we care for them in a way that is better than anybody else.
 
So, those are the tensions in the business: on the one hand protecting our 
people 100%; on the ot
her hand being the most aggressive commercially, so 
that when a store opens in any state in any country around the world, we're 
the first company that knocks on the door to place our equipment. And 
that's the balance that we're trying to be the best at.
 
An
d that's why I was referring earlier at the beginning that having very good 
people on the ground extremely talented very experienced with a lot of 
--
 
having been through a lot of ups and downs in the marketplace, gives me a 
lot of confidence that we can de
liver in an advantage way. And that's how 
we're thinking about all this complexity ahead of us.

Your next question comes from the line of Laurent Grandet of Guggenheim.
 
Laurent Grandet
 
Hey good morning Ramon and Hugh, innovative format to read 
your results 
this morning. I like that. I have a follow
-
up question on energy actually. On 
Bang how much will you be able to distribute immediately? And how fast are 
you planning to exit from existing distribution agreements?
 
And then clearly upside in ene
rgy is primarily affecting the U.S., could you 
help us understand how internationally 
--
 
international could benefit from 
the Rockstar acquisition as in some countries like in the U.K., I mean the 
current distributor has been communicating that there was n
o change to its 
distribution agreement. And also why Bang distribution did it just for the 
U.S.? So what's the plan basically for international in energy?
 
Ramon Laguarta
 
Yes. Hey, Laurent, good morning. Listen, I won't give you a lot of details on 
the deta
ils of the movement from the existing distribution network of Bang 
to our network. But it will be progressive. It will start in some channels as 
early as, early May. And I would assume that by the beginning of Q4, it 
should pretty much be in our tracks. I 
mean that's how we're thinking about 
it. There will be exceptions but that should be 
--
 
that's our ongoing 
assumptions.
 
Internationally, we have very strong energy businesses in many countries 
with our own brands Sting or Ad Rush in Russia and all of Easte
rn Europe. 
Pretty strong brands.
 
Now, the Rockstar brand and formulations give us another tool to penetrate 
that market. It's going to be elevated as one of the priorities of the company 
internationally in our beverage business. And obviously, we will be a
pplying 
the framework that we applied to any opportunity in our beverage market 
which is stronghold, battleground, or challenge your markets and make sure 
that we segment the way we operate our priorities commercially in those 
markets based on that framewo
rk. So, we'll do the same with Rockstar. But 
you should 
--
 
obviously, long
-
term you'll see more markets carrying our 
Rockstar brands internationally and being a bit more of an active player in 
the energy category.

Your next question comes from the
 
line of Sean King of UBS.
 
Sean King
 
Thanks for the question. Mountain Dew I guess returned to growth. Is this 
the sustainable inflection we were looking for or is there an aspect of the 
pre
-
COVID pantry loading to help drive that?
 
Ramon Laguarta
 
Listen we
've been investing a lot in Mountain Dew. And obviously, there's a 
return on that investment, right? The growth in Q1 there's been a very good 
innovation for us that has been Zero Mountain Dew and that seems to be 
getting a lot of good reception by consume
rs.
 
And we knew that we were losing some segment of consumers to other non
-
sugar brands. So, the fact of having a zero proposition in Mountain Dew I 
think it's getting some of those consumers back into the franchise.
 
Our marketing is also obviously helping
 
us to get consumers into higher 
frequency levels. I think the fact that we now have more freedom to 
innovate in Mountain Dew and be a bit more intentional about energy would 
also give us another vector of opportunity for Mountain Dew.
 
So, I wouldn't say t
hat we're 100% out of the woods in Mountain Dew, but I 
see a lot of bright spots in how the brand is performing in particular 
channels. It is now impacted a little bit more than others in convenience 
stores. I mean that brand has particular higher penetrat
ion in impulse 
channel and convenience stores.
 
So, the fact that convenience stores are down in traffic and obviously, given 
the current transportation limitations that impacts Mountain Dew a bit more 
than other brands.
 
But obviously as soon as people are 
driving around and moving around, we'll 
see that brand coming back and we'll be ready with our commercial 
programs when that circumstance occur.

Our final question today will come from the line of Bill Chappell of SunTrust.
 
Bill Chappell
 
Thanks for taking my question. Just a quick question on kind of commodity 
outlook and any changes you're doing or thinking about in terms of near or 
long
-
term hedges and how we should look at it in terms of is it largely 
--
 
the 
benefit largely offset by cu
rrency in terms of kind of your outlook. I realize 
you're not giving guidance, but just kind of how we should think about it. Or 
is there more we just have yet to see as it kind of flows through the supply 
chain over the next two three quarters? So, any co
lor there would be great.
 
Ramon Laguarta
 
Hugh do you want to take that please?
 
Hugh Johnston
 
Yes. Yes, I've got it. Hey Bill. As you know we've been sort of systematically 
buying for a number of years now. We tend to be six to 18 months out. 
Right now we e
xpect low single
-
digit commodity inflation both for Q2 and for 
the balance of the year and that includes transaction FX.
 
At this point, we're about 80% covered on market
-
traded commodities and 
about two
-
thirds over the entire basket. We haven't made any hu
ge material 
changes. We did go a little bit longer on oil as the market went so far down 
as to be in in a lot of cases below the cost of production.
 
But other than that, I would expect us to continue to run our systematic 
forward
-
buying program 
because it has set us up well for predictability in 
cost as well as predictability in pricing in the marketplace. So, I think that 
strategy continues to serve us well.
 
Ramon Laguarta
 
Very good. So, thank you all for joining us today and for the confidence 
that 
you've placed in us with your investments. We hope that you all stay safe 
and healthy and we look forward to updating you on

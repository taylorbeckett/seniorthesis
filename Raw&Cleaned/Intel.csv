Thanks, Trey. We exceeded our expectations for Q4 2019, capping off a 
four
th consecutive record year. In Q4, we generated $20.2 billion in revenue 
and $1.52 in earnings per share, exceeding our guidance by $1 billion and 
$0.28, respectively. For the full year, we delivered $72 billion in revenue and 
$4.87 in EPS. The PC, data ce
nter, IoT, memory and Mobileye businesses 
each set all time annual revenue records.
 
Several years ago, we began a transformation to reposition the company to 
take advantage of the data revolution that is reshaping computing. Exiting 
this quarter, we now ha
ve greater than 50% of our revenue coming from our 
data centric collection of businesses. But our journey is just beginning.
 
To reach our multiyear goals, we will continuously focus on three key 
priorities, accelerating growth, improving execution and depl
oying our 
capital for attractive returns. I would like to share our progress against these 
priorities over the last 90 days.
 
We are accelerating growth by expanding the capabilities of our workload 
optimized platforms and playing a larger role in our custo
mers' success. 
Demand for our Intel Xeon scalable processors is very strong as customers 
continue to make Xeon the foundation for their AI infused data center 
workloads. One of the reasons Cascade Lake is our fastest ramping Xeon 
CPU is its unrivaled AI pe
rformance.
 
Xeon's AI performance will take another step in the first half of 2020 when 
our third
-
generation Xeon scalable processor Cooper Lake debuts. Cooper 
Lake features new Intel DL boost extensions for built
-
in AI training 
acceleration providing up to
 
a 60% increase in training performance over the 
previous family. Additionally, we have expanded beyond the CPU in the data 
center with products such as Optane persistent memory, custom ASICs, 
Ethernet and silicon photonics. In Q4, data center adjacent pro
ducts grew 
more than 30% year
-
over
-
year.
 
In client computing, we are seeing excellent momentum for our first 10 
nanometer mobile CPU, Ice Lake, with 44 system designs already shipping. 
In addition to our CPU capabilities, we continue to deliver leadership 
PC 
platform connectivity. With Wi
-
Fi 6, were delivering gig
-
plus speeds and for 
wired connectivity we just announced Thunderbolt 4 for platforms in 2020.
 
At CES, we also showed customer momentum for our Project Athena 
innovation program, including the firs
t Project Athena verified Chromebooks. 
Project Athena verified laptops have been tuned, tested and verified to 
deliver fantastic system
-
level innovation and benefits spanning battery life, 
consistent responsiveness, instant wake, application compatibility 
and more. 
We have verified 26 Project Athena design to
-
date and expect 50 more 
devices across Windows and Chrome to be verified this year.
 
In addition to strengthening our largest businesses, we are investing to win 
key data
-
driven technology inflections. 
These inflections include the rise of 
artificial intelligence, the transformation of networks and emergence of the 
intelligence and autonomous edge. The market for AI
-
based silicon is 
growing and evolving quickly. New workloads are emerging and existing 
wo
rkloads like high performance computing are converging with AI.
 
In 2019, we generated $3.8 billion in AI
-
based revenue. The AI market 
opportunity is expected to be $25 billion by 2024 and we are investing to 
lead with a strong portfolio of products. In add
ition to integrating AI into all 
our leading products, we have introduced and acquired new capabilities that 
deepen an already unparalleled portfolio of AI assets. We announced the 
acquisition of Habana Labs, a leading developer of programmable deep 
learni
ng accelerators for the data center. Habana, combined with Intel's 
existing AI ASICs and software expertise, will advance our AI offerings for 
the data center with high performance training and inference processors and 
a standards
-
based programming environ
ment to address evolving AI 
workloads.
 
Delivering the optimal AI silicon architecture is critical but not sufficient to 
solve customers' problems. That's why we launched the oneAPI industry 
initiative to deliver a unified and simplified programming model f
or 
application development across heterogeneous processing architectures. 
OneAPI marks a game changing evolution from today's limiting proprietary 
program approaches to an open standards
-
based model for cross 
architecture developer engagement and innovatio
n.
 
As expected, our networking business reached $5 billion in revenue in 2019. 
We have grown our business by helping our customers transform their 
networks by consolidating and virtualizing workloads on Intel architecture 
based servers. Now, as we advance 
into the 5G era, we see our momentum 
in design win pipeline accelerating as we are positioned to win significant 
share in base stations.
 
This quarter, we announced a strategic agreement with Alibaba to support 
both the Tokyo and Beijing Olympics building o
ut 5G infrastructure utilizing 
Xeon scalable Optane persistent memory and Intel software. These data 
optimized 5G networks will support amazing experiences such as immersive 
8K VR, cloud 3
-
D stadium simulations and cloud broadcasting.
 
We also delivered alm
ost $5 billion in annual revenue from our IoT/edge 
portfolio of products. In November, we disclosed our next
-
gen Movidius 
vision processing unit Keem Bay. Keem Bay is highly optimized for edge 
inference with groundbreaking leaps forward in power efficient 
performance 
delivering up to 4X the performance or 6X the performance per watt over 
comparable competitive solutions.
 
It's been over two years since the acquisition of Mobileye and we couldn't be 
more excited about the team's progress. This quarter we anno
unced several 
exciting new engagements. We established an agreement for REM data 
harvesting with SAIC Motor and embarked on a strategic partnership with 
NIO to deploy Mobileye's self
-
driving systems as the full stack solution for 
NIO's consumer AV. We also
 
continue to accelerate the commercialization of 
driverless Mobility
-
as
-
a
-
Service with two new partnerships, RATP in Paris 
and Daegu City in South Korea.
 
In Q4, we were also excited to host analysts and investors at Mobileye's 
headquarters to discuss our s
trategy to win the more than $70 billion 
opportunity for ADAS, AV and data and to expand our aspirations to an even 
larger role in the $160 billion opportunity for Mobility
-
as
-
a
-
Service. Our 
guests had the chance to test drive our technology on the demandi
ng road 
to Jerusalem as we demonstrated industry's leading AV solution stack 
navigating a wide variety of driving complexities and delivering unmatched 
agility and safety.
 
We have significant opportunities but realizing them requires improved 
execution, st
arting with delivering more supply for our customers. In 
response to continued strong demand, we invested record levels of CapEx in 
2018 and 2019. That added capacity allowed us to increase our second half 
2019 PC CPU supply by double digits relative to th
e first half. However, 
demand has continued to outpace PC supply and supply remains tight in our 
PC business. We are continuing to add capacity so are not constraining our 
customers' growth. Across our 14 and 10 nanometer nodes, we are adding 
25% wafer cap
acity this year to deliver a high single digit increase in PC unit 
volume. This will enable us to meet market demand, deliver our 2020 
financial plan and increase inventory to more normalized levels. Our near 
term challenge is working with our customers to
 
support their desired 
product mix.
 
Our process technology execution continues to improve. In Q4, we ramped 
our 10 nanometer production and continue to see yields improve. We are 
planning nine new product releases on 10 nanometer this year, including our 
n
ext
-
gen mobile CPU, a 5G base station SOC, an AI inference accelerator, 
our first discrete GPU and Xeon for server, storage and networking.
 
We are also on track to deliver 10 nanometer
-
plus this year, our first 
performance upgrade on 10 nanometer. Our 7 na
nometer process remains 
on track to deliver our lead 7 nanometer product, Ponte Vecchio, at the end 
of 2021 with CPU products following shortly after in 2022. We are also 
driving innovation in the next generation of computing.
 
At CES, we provided a first look at our next
-
gen Intel Core mobile processor 
codenamed Tiger Lake, which is designed to offer groundbreaking 
advancements when it ships later this year. Tiger Lake, built on Intel's 10 
nanometer
-
plus process, will deliver si
gnificant gains in computes, AI, 
graphics and interconnect over the prior generation. We will also deliver 
initial production shipments on our first 10 nanometer
-
based Xeon scalable 
product, Ice Lake in the latter part of 2020.
 
We are also investing to lea
d the next wave of technology breakthroughs 
such as quantum computing. Our investment in quantum computing covers 
the full hardware and software stack in pursuit of a practical commercially 
viable quantum system. For example, last month we unveiled a first
 
of its 
kind cryogenic control chip, Horse Ridge, that will speed up development of 
full stack quantum computing systems.
 
We made good progress this quarter but we will continue to be laser focused 
on improving our execution. That means delivering the supp
ly, leadership 
process technology and product innovations that allow us to play a larger 
role in our customers' success.
 
Our third priority is to thoughtfully deploy your capital to deliver attractive 
returns. That means, first investing in the R&D and Cap
Ex necessary to drive 
our long
-
term business plan. Since 2015, we have grown revenue by more 
than $16 billion while reducing spending by $500 million. Spending as a 
percentage of revenue was down nine points while over the same period we 
have increased R&D
 
spending by $1.2 billion.
 
We acquired Habana Labs, a fantastic company that will accelerate our AI 
plans while also making thoughtful disinvestments. We closed both the 5G 
smartphone modem exit and the sale of IMFT in the quarter. We are 
confident in our 
future and consistent with that our Board has approved a 
5% increase in our dividend to $1.32 per share. Last quarter, we announced 
a commitment to execute $20 billion in share repurchases over the next 15 
to 18 months and three months into that window we 
have already 
repurchased $3.5 billion in shares.
 
Finally, our role goes beyond delivering strong results to being a great 
corporate citizen that has real impact on the world around us and in the 
communities where we work. I am proud of the many outside rec
ognitions 
we have received for our responsible business practices. This reflects our 
culture and the efforts of our 100,000
-
plus employees around the world. 
Also, we continue to believe that a diverse workforce and inclusive culture 
are essential for execu
ting our growth strategy, which is why we released 
detailed workforce representation data that raises the bar on ourselves and 
others for continued improvement.
 
And it's important to us to be a leader in environmental sustainability and 
we are investing to
 
continue to increase the energy efficiency of our 
operations and our products. And we are also making significant progress on 
our goal of restoring 100% of our global water use by 2025.
 
Back at our May Analyst Day, we told you that the industry was at an 
inflection point where the exponential growth of data is fueling massive 
expansion in multi
-
cloud environments, transforming networks and 
catalyzing the intelligent edge. We believe we are well positioned to lead this 
data revolution and we expect to gener
ate $85 billion in revenue and $6 in 
earnings per share in the next three to four years.
 
One year into that plan, we are tracking well ahead of our commitment. We 
have $3 billion more revenue and we have earned an additional $0.52 in 
earnings versus our Ma
y expectations. Our expectation is to continue to 
make deposits towards our multiyear goal every 90 days.
 
In summary, our priorities are to accelerate growth, improve execution and 
thoughtfully deploy our capital on behalf of our owners like you. I am exci
ted 
about the opportunities in front of us and appreciate your continued support.
 
I will now hand the call over to George for details on our Q4 results and 
business outlook. George?
 
George Davis
 
Thanks Bob and good afternoon everyone. Q4 marked an outstand
ing finish 
to another record year with $20.2 billion in revenue, up 8% year
-
on
-
year 
and $1 billion higher than guide. We saw record data centric revenue of 
$10.2 billion, representing over 50% of our total revenue, an all
-
time high. 
DCG and Mobileye both a
chieved record revenue in the quarter. Q4 PC 
centric revenue was $10 billion, up 2% year
-
on
-
year capping CCG's fourth 
consecutive year of revenue growth. Q4 operating margin was 
approximately 36%, two points ahead of our guide on higher gross margin 
and sp
ending leverage.
 
Gross margin for the quarter was 60.1%, beating expectations due to strong 
flow
-
through of higher DCG revenue. Q4 EPS was $1.52, $0.28 above our 
guide, primarily due to strong operational performance and further boosted 
by gains from our I
CAP portfolio. These results demonstrate the strong 
demand for our leadership products and solid execution to achieve a record
-
breaking year. As a result, full year EPS of $4.87 was up 6% year
-
on
-
year. 
We generated $16.9 billion of free cash flow, up 19% a
nd returned $19.2 
billion to shareholders. We anticipate another record year in 2020 and are 
raising the dividend by 5%.
 
Moving to more details on Q4 performance. Operating margin of 36% in the 
quarter was up over half a point versus last year as higher vo
lume and ASP 
strength in our data centric portfolio and lower spending were partly offset 
by the ramp of our 10 nanometer process and NAND pricing degradation. 
EPS was up 19% or $0.24 year
-
over
-
year on higher operating margin, 
equity gains driven by our IC
AP portfolio and a lower share count, partially 
offset by a higher tax rate. Our non
-
GAAP tax rate in Q4 was 13.6%, in line 
with expectations and up five points year
-
over
-
year due to tax benefits from 
tax reform and discrete items in Q4 2018.
 
Let's move to
 
segment performance. Our data center group had record 
revenue at $7.2 billion, up 19% from the prior year. These results beat our 
expectations with platform volumes up 12% and platform ASPs up 5% year
-
over
-
year on strong cloud demand and continued adoptio
n of our highest 
performance second Gen Xeon scalable products. In Q4, cloud revenue was 
up 48% year
-
over
-
year as cloud service providers continue building capacity 
to serve customer demand. Enterprise and government revenue was down 
7% while communication
 
and service providers' revenue grew 14% as 
customers continue to adopt IA
-
based solutions to transform their networks 
and transition to the 5G era. All three segments exceeded our expectations 
for the quarter.
 
Our other data centric businesses were up 6% 
year
-
over
-
year in Q4. IOTG 
achieved another double digit growth quarter with revenue up 13% and 
operating income up 29% year
-
over
-
year as customers increasingly adopt 
Intel AI infused products to power the growing intelligent edge. And 
Mobileye revenue and
 
operating income were up 31% and 54%, 
respectively, driven by the industry
-
leading EyeQ products, which offer 
unmatched computer vision and mapping capabilities and continue to win in 
a fast
-
growing ADAS market. EyeQ revenue was up 41% year
-
over
-
year.
 
NSG
 
revenue grew 10% on continued bit growth, partially offset by year
-
over
-
year pricing declines. NSG reported an operating loss of $96 million as 
NAND cost improvements were more than offset by pricing declines.
 
PSG revenue declined 17% year
-
over
-
year on so
ftness in the embedded 
segment primarily driven by lower last time buys versus Q4 2018, partially 
offset by strength in wireless. Operating income was down 48% on lower 
revenue and segment product mix.
 
DCG revenue was $10 billion in the fourth quarter, up 
2% year
-
over
-
year 
driven by higher PC and modem volumes. PC unit volumes were up 1% on 
continued market strength and increased capacity. Adjacencies, which 
include modems and wireless and wired connectivity solutions, grew 13% 
year
-
over
-
year driven by stro
ng demand for modems and a better mix of 
connectivity solutions. Operating margin was 41%, up four points year
-
on
-
year on higher revenue and lower spending driven by the 5G smartphone 
modem exit. As a result, CCG achieved record operating income in 2019.
 
I
n 2019, we generated $33.1 billion in operating cash flow and invested 
$16.2 billion in CapEx. We also returned 113% of free cash flow to 
shareholders through dividends and buybacks. During the quarter, we 
purchased 63 million shares at an average price of
 
$55.32 per share. Total 
2019 share repurchases were 272 million and in 2020, we expect return in 
excess of 100% of free cash flow to shareholders under the $20 billion 
buyback program announced last quarter and the increased dividend 
announced today.
 
Let'
s move to outlook. 2020 is expected to be another record year for the 
company. We are forecasting revenue of $73.5 billion and EPS of 
approximately $5. We expect our PC centric business to be down low single 
digits year
-
over
-
year on a slightly down PC TAM.
 
Within 2020, we expect to 
see a strong first half and a moderating second half dynamic due to lower 
modem revenue and expected lower PC TAM in the second half of 2020 as 
the Windows 10 commercial refresh matures.
 
We expect revenue from our data centric bu
sinesses to be up high single 
digits for the full year as we capitalize on the secular trends that Bob 
outlined. We are expecting an exceptionally strong Q1 as cloud customers 
continue to build capacity and adopt our highest performing products. This 
will 
mark three quarters of strong cloud buildout and we expect more 
modest capacity expansion for the remainder of the year as CSPs move to a 
digestion phase. We are also planning for an increasingly competitive 
environment as we move through the year.
 
As a re
sult of these dynamics, we expect total revenue to be more front
-
end 
loaded in the first half than we have seen historically. Gross margin is 
expected to be 59% for the year, down a point versus 2019 on both mix of 
products and the impact of 10 nanometer c
ost. Spending for the year is 
expected to be approximately $19 billion or 26% of revenue, down one point 
resulting in a flat operating margin of approximately 33%. We expect 2020 
CapEx of approximately $17 billion, more than half of which is comprised of 
i
nvestments in fab space and 7 and 5 nanometer equipment. Free cash flow 
is expected to be approximately $16.5 billion as the flow
-
through from 
revenue growth and higher depreciation is offset by higher CapEx and 
rebuilding of critical product inventory bac
k to more normal operating levels.
 
Let's turn to Q1. We anticipate a particularly strong start to another record 
year with Q1 revenue of $19 billion, up 18% year
-
over
-
year and well above 
normal seasonal patterns. This is being driven in particular by data 
centric 
revenue growth, expected to be above 25% year
-
over
-
year on continued 
cloud buildout and NAND bit growth. Our PC centric business is also 
contributing and is expected to be up more than 10% year
-
over
-
year on 
continued PC market strength, additional 
supply and higher modem revenue.
 
With strong top line growth and mix, we expect Q1 gross margin of 
approximately 61%, up three points year
-
over
-
year. Q1 operating margin is 
expected to be approximately 35%, up seven points versus last year on 
higher gross 
margin and spending leverage on higher revenue. Tax rate is 
expected to be 13% and EPS is expected to be $1.30, up 46% year
-
over
-
year. In summary, 2019 was Intel's best year ever and we expect a strong 
start to 2020 on the way to another record year.
 
With 
that, let me turn it back over to Trey.
 
Trey Campbell
 
All right. Thank you George. Moving on now to the Q&A. As is our normal 
practice, we would ask each participant to ask just one question. Operator, 
please go ahead and introduce our first caller.
 
Question
-
and
-
Answer Session
 
Operator
 
Certainly. Our first question comes from the line of Ross Seymore from 
Deutsche Bank. Your question, please.
 
Ross Seymore
 
Hi guys. Thanks for letting me ask a question and congrats on the strong 
end of last year and sta
rt to this year. George or Bob, whichever of you want 
to answer this, I want to go little bit into the trajectory of revenues. George, 
you gave some great color there on the two different segments, PC centric 
and data centric. But it appears, by the end of
 
this year you could even be 
going negative in both of those segments year
-
over
-
year. So it seems like 
it's a pretty significant drop. I appreciate conservatism in the end
-
of
-
life on 
the Windows side of things. But how do you factor in the increased 
compet
ition that you mentioned and the fact that shortages should go away 
so you could actually have some market share gains?
 
Bob Swan
 
Yes. Thanks Ross. Let me start, George. And you can chime in. First, thank 
you for the compliment on our fourth quarter results
. When we look at 2020 
demand cycles, we kind have three things going on that impact the first half 
to second half outlook. And George touched on a few of these.
 
But first, at the macro level, this insatiable appetite for data and the 
processing resources 
that need to go to make that data relevant, those 
trends continue. And we feel very good about how we are positioned to 
capitalize on this increased demand.
 
Second, as you know from a cloud perspective, which now is bigger and 
bigger part of our overall DC
G revenue, we expect them to continue to 
benefit from the trajectories that that I mentioned initially. At the same 
time, you will remember from last year, our ability to protect the CSPs 
purchasing and then kind of digestion patterns is relatively hard.
 
S
o we look at first half to second half, Q1 will be in essence the third quarter 
in a row of real strong consumption patterns from the cloud folks. So we 
know from history that at some point they go into digestion mode and the 
buying patterns begin to slow 
down. And it doesn't impact medium or long 
term trends but it does impact cyclical trends during the course of the year. 
And we have tried to, based on our past learnings, take that into account as 
much as we can. So hopefully we are wrong. Hopefully, we a
re conservative. 
But at this stage of the game, that's kind of how we looked at cloud 
purchases first half to the second half.
 
The second thing, PC TAM, we think is going to be flat to down a little bit this 
year. And the expectation is the first half will
 
continue to be Windows 10 
refresh that George flagged. And we expect that to slowdown in the second 
half.
 
And then the third item is modem. As we go into the second half of the year, 
we expect modem volume to be lower as we phase out of that business as 
s
martphone modem moves to the 5G world.
 
So those three things have us looking at the full year of kind of 2% growth 
and inherent in that is we know we have got a much more competitive 
environment. And our intentions during the course of year is to compete 
v
igorously to protect our position while continue to expand as compute 
moves further and further away from the cloud out to the network and to 
the edge.
 
George Davis
 
Yes. And I guess I would just add that we feel really good about the year 
overall. It's jus
t going to be a little flatter in terms of the pattern and 
certainly than we saw last year and certainly different than our normal 
seasonal pattern. But good strength growth in all of the businesses really 
outside the PC, which is coming across some headwi
nds from TAM. But we 
still expect it to work on gaining back share in some areas where it's had 
difficulties in the past as we can start to provide more units.
 
Bob Swan
 
And one last comment, I apologize. But I think just on a year
-
over
-
year 
basis, the comp
s in the first half of 2020 are going to be easier. And then 
after a very strong second half of 2019, comps will get tougher in the second 
half of the year. But, net net, as George shaped it up, we are looking for 
another record year in 2020.
 
Thanks Ross.
 
Ross Seymore
 
Thank you.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya from Bank 
of America. Your question, please.
 
Vivek Arya
 
Thanks for taking my question and congratulations on strong results and 
especially the buybacks, the nea
rly 10% of shares retired in the last two 
years. Question. Bob, on 10 nanometer. I was in the slide, you mentioned 
10 nanometer yields ahead right off expectations and you mentioned nine 
product releases on 10. Can you help put that in context? What does i
t imply 
in terms of the range of desktop and server SKUs? I think there is some 
speculation that maybe 10 nanometer might be a small node rather than a 
regular node? Or I guess, asked in a different way, what percent data of 
your sale do you expect to be o
n 10 nanometer this year and maybe even 
next year? Thank you.
 
Bob Swan
 
Yes. Well, first, we continue to make real good progress on yields on 10 
nanometer. And that's been, after all the challenges we have had, that's 
been kind of a consistent theme over la
st the four to six quarter just on 
yields for 10. So we feel very good exiting the year and coming into this 
year on where we are on yields.
 
Second, in terms of the product roadmap, we launched Ice Lake for client in 
the fourth quarter. We launched FPGAs, 
Agilex products on 10 nanometer in 
the fourth quarter. And then through the course of this year, we are going to 
have successive of products of AI inference accelerator, 5G SOC that we are 
really excited about for the 5G network, GPUs launched and then las
t but 
certainly not least, bringing out Ice Lake server product in the back end of 
the year. So we have launched. The yields are good.
 
Designs across our portfolio of products are good. And we will ramp them up 
during the course of the year. But 
primarily in terms of volume, we will still 
be, the client business is the one we are going to ramp the fastest. It will the 
ramp during the course of the year. It will be on our second Gen of 10 
nanometer or what will call 10+ in the second half of the ye
ar, which 
introduces a whole new level of performance for that product.
 
But in the aggregate, we won't have a huge percentage of our overall 
company volume in the second half of the year. It will grow as we exit the 
year and become a much bigger part of ou
r overall volume in 2021.
 
And then last, I would just say that our intention back in May and we 
reiterated again today is that we want to get back to a two to tow
-
and
-
a
-
half 
year cadence. And shortly after launching 10, our expectations is we will 
have our
 
first 7 nanometer product launch in the latter part about 2021 with 
CPUs to closely follow. So 10 is ramping. We will go to 10+ for clients and 
we will 7 on a two year cadence in 2021.
 
Vivek Arya
 
Thank you.
 
Bob Swan
 
Thanks a lot.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our n
ext question comes in line of Blayne Curtis from Barclays. 
Your question, please.
 
Blayne Curtis
 
Hi guys. Thanks for taking my question and I would like to give congrats on 
the great results. Bob, maybe just following on that, because I remember 
two quarter
s ago you talked about Ice Lake taping out for servers in the first 
half. And there is a lot of different milestones, it gets confusing. When you 
say second half, do you actually, is that a volume ramp? Or is that when you 
actually expect the 10 nanometer 
servers to be out?
 
Bob Swan
 
Yes. It's a good question. And just a few things. I think first, in terms of how 
we deploy the technology. Today, our ecosystem partners have already 
received Ice Lake server samples. So that's kind the first step for us. And 
th
en what we indicated is, we will start production wafers in the first half of 
this year and that that will translate into production of shipments in the 
latter part of 2020. So that's a sequence of events. So production, we load 
wafers, we deliver samples,
 
check. We load wafers first half. We deliver 
production output latter part of the year. So that's been pretty consistent 
with how we have been trying to ramp this over last the several quarters.
 
Blayne Curtis
 
Thanks for that. And then just a clarity on th
e client side. I am surprised by 
the seasonality but I guess I understand with Win 10, with that growth or 
the strong year
-
over
-
year you are seeing in Q1, are you still shorting the 
market, I guess?
 
Bob Swan
 
Yes. First, we came into 2019 looking at kind of
 
a flat PC TAM and when all 
is said and done, we end the year with about 3% growth overall and even 
stronger in the fourth quarter. So it's had a real strong, the market has had 
a real strong year in 2019. At the end of the year, as we indicated, we were 
s
till constraining our PC customers. And I would say, we left some backlog 
on the table that we are quickly trying to fill as we come in to the first 
quarter. So that obviously a disappointment in terms of our serving 
customers at the end of the year but ad
ds to volume in the first quarter, first 
half.
 
As we go through the course of the year, just from the macro level, we 
spent record capital in 2018, again record capital in 2019, as George laid out 
in his prepared remarks. We have record capital in 2020. An
d it's really 
geared to ensure that we never constrain our customers' growth. And our 
expectations in 2020 is it will have high single digit PC unit volume and 
against a market that we expect to be flat to down slightly. So we are going 
to be in good posit
ion and meet the market demand in 2020. We look to 
deliver on our full year outlook and to begin to build the inventory levels to 
more natural position so that the mix dynamics of what product we sell and 
when, we can manage the volatility in that much bet
ter than we have been 
able to in the fourth quarter. So supply constraints, we are maniacal about 
eliminating those so that we can meet customer demand and never have to 
worry about it.
 
George Davis
 
And we will expect to see more small core in the second h
alf which may be 
part of the dynamic. We haven't really been in the serve that end of the 
market in the way that we would like to. So that maybe part of what you are 
looking at.
 
Blayne Curtis
 
Thanks.
 
Bob Swan
 
Thank you.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. [Operator Instru
ctions]. Our next question comes from the line 
of John Pitzer from Credit Suisse. Your question, please.
 
John Pitzer
 
Yes. Good afternoon, Bob and George. Let me add my congratulations to the 
solid results. I guess I have got a similar question to Ross' fir
st question on 
revenue but mine is going to be on gross margin. If you could just sort of 
look at the Q1 guide of 61% versus the full year of 59%, I am just trying to 
understand the puts and take that brings gross margin down throughout the 
year and exclus
ively how much of this is kind of you guys baking in some 
increased competition? Or how much of this is a pull
-
forward of 7 
nanometer? Because 59% is pretty close to what you talked about at the 
Analyst Day, kind of flattish year
-
on
-
year but it is slightly
 
lower and you 
were pretty explicit about gross margins going down in calendar year 2021. 
I am just kind of curious is to whether we are getting a pull
-
forward of the 7 
here or what are the puts and takes as you think about gross margin 
throughout the year
?
 
George Davis
 
So
 
let me just start with the full year because I think that will be helpful. At 
the highest level, what you are really seeing is an impact largely related to 
10 nanometer cost that are coming into the system during this year and 
increasing as we go into the
 
second half for all the reasons that Bob laid out. 
We are actually getting some help that is moderating the impact of that from 
improving NAND pricing year
-
over
-
year, that's actually going to help us on 
gross margin and lower modem mix particularly in the
 
second half of the 
year, but in the year overall. So those are the big drivers of modems and 
that nets out to about a 1% reduction. And in Q1, what you really seeing is 
lower modem and lower variable comp being the reason that we are moving 
up a point, sa
y, from Q4. And so nothing unusual other than normally you 
would have expected to see a much bigger drop in Q1 gross margin because 
of the mix of products as it's obviously the seasonally down quarter for 
many of our businesses.
 
Bob Swan
 
George, the only t
hing that I would add is, inherent in our guide is our 
expectations for lower ASPs and it's a function of two things. One that 
George mentioned, which is we will eliminate the supply constraints and 
begin to get more volume on small core which, as you know
, has lower ASPs 
and secondly we are anticipating a more competitive environment as we go 
to the course of the year. So to kind of bring it back, we are ramping 10 is 
great and we are ramping 10 in the second half of the year. And in parallel 
with that, we
 
are investing in 7 in 2020 and in 2021. And those are the 
things that we flagged back in May at the Analyst Day. And I would say the 
one thing that's really changed since then, is that our yields on 10 are just a 
little bit better and they are contributor
 
to slightly better gross margin in the 
second half of 2019 and we expect that to continue to be a contributor this 
year as [indiscernible].
 
John Pitzer
 
Perfect. Thanks guys.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur from 
JPMo
rgan. Your question, please.
 
Harlan Sur
 
Good afternoon and good job on the quarterly execution. On the full year 
guide for data centric up high single digits, I appreciate the first half, second 
half profile on DCG. But how are you guys thinking about grow
th of DCG 
within that framework for the full year? Is it in line with the sort of high 
single digits growth for data centric? And then, within that framework, how 
do you see the growth trends in other DCG segments, i.e., enterprise and 
comms service provid
er? Thank you.
 
George Davis
 
Yes. So the way we would look at DCG, I would say the growth rate will be 
modestly lower than the overall growth rate. You got some very high 
growers contributing to pulling that up a little bit. So a little below the 
average bu
t still attractive growth in the year.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon from 
Bernstein Research. Your question please.
 
Stacy Rasgon
 
Hi guys. Thanks for taking my I question. I wanted to ask a bit about the 
capacity 
additions. So I kind of get that adding 25% wafer capacity to 
support your own volumes going up high single digits in a market that you 
think is down. Does that imply that you are actually going to be overshipping 
the market this year as you sort of rebuil
t those channel inventories? What 
does that imply if you are going forward into 2021, where the PC market 
itself may still be in decline and you will have higher capacity and ideally like 
die shrink at that point? Like how do we think about that?
 
George Da
vis
 
Yes. I hear your point. One of the things that we mentioned is, we are going 
to be producing in order to build inventory levels back up in the year. And so 
in the second half of the year, we would expect to be able to bring both our 
server products and
 
most importantly, our PC products back to a more 
normalized inventory level. So we are being up in the high single digits is 
meant to allow us to not only satisfy our customers but also rebuild 
inventory. So your math is correct.
 
Stacy Rasgon
 
So that's yo
ur own inventory? Or inventory in the channel? You are going to 
be selling that to the customers or keeping it on your books?
 
George Davis
 
It will be our own inventory. And then will have to see, if you look at some 
of the channel information, you might th
e customers trying to build some 
inventory as well. But when we are talking about building inventory, it's our 
inventory levels.
 
Bob Swan
 
I would also say, the channel inventories exiting the year for PC, I would 
say, are relatively low. And that's on us. So I do expect during the course of 
the year, we will build our inventory levels to more deal with spikes in 
demand. But at the same time,
 
we expect the channel to be at more healthy 
levels as we exit 2020 and then through 2021.
 
And then just the one other thing I would mention, as we think about the 
business overall and kind of the demand signals, we continue to make really 
good progress on
 
the comms sector, particularly with the growth in the 
network and the role that we play and the transition to 5G. And we 
characterize as the intelligent edge, we delivered double digit growth with 
IoT for the last several years. And network and IoT are bi
gger and bigger 
parts of our business.
 
So we think we are very well positioned. So when you think about PC 
volume, up or down over time, we got this bigger growing aspect of our 
business that places demand on our manufacturing footprint. So that's the 
only
 
other thing I would add, Stacy. Thanks.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joe Moore from Morgan 
Stanley. Your question please.
 
Joe Moore
 
Yes. Thank you. I guess going back to the PC constraints that you are 
seeing. So you would like to build your inventory back up in, I think you 
said, early in year. But it seems like we are just a few weeks from you going 
out to customers and telling them 
that you would be short. So at what point 
can they start to add inventory? Are you forecasting that would happen in 
the second half, in the first half? And then do you feel like when those 
constraints are eased, that you will be able to take back unit shar
e on the 
client side?
 
Bob Swan
 
Yes. I think first, it was middle of November, I should say, that we went out 
and we want to be able to provide as much advance notice to our customer 
base as possible if supply is going to constrain their ability to grow to 
give 
them time to deal with it. And in November, with strong data center growth, 
PC demand continuing to grow and a factory excursion, combination of those 
things we felt it was very important to get out to our customers as soon as 
possible. I think as we 
close the year, one of the favorable things was we 
got more output from our factories and because of the capacity we put in 
place in 2018, 2019 and going into 2020, we are really beginning to build 
back the capacity to meet the demand. So our expectations 
are, we will 
have sufficient supply in the first quarter or I should say sufficient supply 
throughout the year. I think our challenge is really going to be on two 
things, particularly on Q2 with PCs and that is linearity, not just the supply 
in the quarter
, but week
-
on
-
week supply as our customers are hoping for. 
And then second, particular SKUs or mix, making sure that we have the right 
product mix. So we will have enough capacity. I think Q2 will be a little 
challenging as we try to deal with product mix 
and linearity but overall we 
really plan to be out of the supply constrained environment in 2020.
 
Joe Moore
 
Okay. And then are the shortages anywhere other than client? Is it entirely 
client? Or are there anything in server or any other products?
 
Bob Swan
 
No, we are in pretty good shape on server. And I think that going with 19% 
growth in fourth quarter depleted our inventory levels. So when you have 
that kind of spike in demand, we are not perfect across all products or all 
SKUs. But server CPUs, we really
 
prioritize that and try to put ourselves in a 
position where we are not constrained and we are in pretty good pretty good 
shape. Pretty great shape macro. Micro, a few challenges here and there. 
But server CPU supply is pretty good.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Ou
r next question comes from the line of Christopher Rolland 
from Susquehanna. Your question please.
 
Christopher Rolland
 
Hi guys. Thanks for the question. On CapEx, specifically $17 billion, you 
mentioned some of the parts there. But how do we divide that up
 
between 7 
and 5 versus you know what you are doing with 10? And I don't know if you 
are still adding some 14 even. And as we think about CapEx moving forward 
and capacity here, how do you guys feel about outsourcing non
-
CPU 
products like for example, PSG?
 
Could you outsource that to foundries? How 
are you thinking about CapEx going forward? Thanks guys.
 
George Davis
 
Sure, why not. Maybe I will take CapEx and Bob you can cover the 
outsourcing piece. So on CapEx, part of the reason we are expecting $17 
billi
on this year is we are building more space. Some of the longer lead time 
items, one of things that's really impacted us in terms of closing the gap on 
customer demand and our ability to support it has been not enough space 
available to fill with equipment 
which you can do in a much shorter time 
frame if you already have a space in place.
 
So as we said, over half is going to be for space and then for 7 and 5 
nanometer equipment. As you know, we have got all three nodes right on 
top of each other. And so we a
re going to be perhaps a little less capital 
efficient, when you combine that with the fact that we are trying to close the 
gap on meeting our customers' requirements. And I think all of those things 
add to the 417 billion. But also we are building for the
 
future to make sure 
we have the kind of capacity shelf space in place where we can quickly add 
capacity to meet demand if necessary.
 
Bob Swan
 
Yes. And the one other thing is maybe with the exception of litho, the reuse 
from one node to the next is still r
elatively high. So what we put in place for 
a 10 or a 7, for the most part, we can continue to reuse those tools for next 
generation.
 
And the second part of your question, we have historically leveraged third
-
party foundries for a long time. And it's alway
s been in the probably 20% to 
25% of our overall supply we get from third
-
party foundries. And we 
continue to look at, particularly in the non
-
IA, non
-
CPU products, we 
continue to evaluate, in a capital
-
intense business, where is the best place to 
have the
se things manufactured. That's an ongoing process.
 
And I would say, all else equal, the breadth of our portfolio as we play a 
larger and larger role in our customers' success, we build more products. 
And with that, the evaluation of what we do inside and w
hat we do outside is 
a full
-
time effort at our end. So we will continue to do it. We will continue to 
prioritize where we can get the best, the most efficient output and make 
those decisions over time.
 
Christopher Rolland
 
Great. Thanks guys.
 
Trey Campbell
 
Jonathan, I think we have time for one more question and then we will turn 
the call back over to Bob to wrap things up.
 
Operator
 
Certainly. Our final question then for the day, comes from the line of 
Timothy Arcuri from UBS. Your question please.
 
Timothy A
rcuri
 
Thanks a lot. George, I wanted to go back to gross margin. I think last 
quarter, we were talking about 60% for this year and we are now 59% for 
the year on a little bit better revenue. And yes, it's only 100 basis points less 
but obviously people are
 
concerned about the competitive environment. So 
can you just talk specifically to what changed? And maybe as you exit the 
year, it looks like that number has to be in the 57%, 57.5% range, which is 
about where you said next year would be, 2021. So is that
 
still a number for 
next year too? Thanks.
 
George Davis
 
Tim, let me just kind of correct the history just a little bit. What we said over 
the last couple quarters was, when the question was, A, when we look at 
58%, which is what we quoted for Q4, does that mean is that the number 
that we should be expecting for
 
2020? And also with 57% on the table for 
2021, is that where we are? And I said, we will be closer to 60% than we will 
be to either of those numbers. And so 59% is very much in line with what 
we believe we were guiding.
 
So I don't really feel like we were
 
down a point. But clearly the fact is that 
we talked about everything from product mix to 10 nanometer mix. Those 
are all things that are having an effect, particularly as the year plays out and 
also the shape of the year. BOB talked about some of things 
where we will 
be in, the mix in the first half is going be much richer than we would 
normally have seen and we may see a little less rich mix in the second half. 
So I think really nothing more than those type of movements which are very 
much in line with w
hat we were thinking we would see this year.
 
Timothy Arcuri
 
Awesome George. Thanks very much.
 
George Davis
 
Yes. Thanks Tim.
 
Bob Swan
 
Trey, maybe just to wrap. First, thanks for joining us. We feel great about 
how we wrapped up the year. Our best quarter in
 
the company's history, 
2019 the best year in our company's history and our outlook for 2020 is, we 
will do it again. We expect it to be another record year. And you know, our 
ambitions have just never been greater. As you know, we are going after a 
larger
 
TAM. We are expanding the role that we play in our customer's 
success. We are leveraging our CPU architecture but also evolving beyond 
the CPU to GPUs and visual processing units as workloads continue to 
evolve. And given the overall dynamics of the indus
try, we feel very good 
about where we stand and we realize it's an increasingly competitive world. 
We feel like we are well
-
positioned to deal with it. So thanks again for 
joining us. Our focus is on obsessing about how we serve our customers best 
and we e
xpect to do that better and better and that will be what really 
drives the growth of the company. So thanks and we look forward to another 
deposit 90 days from now.
 
Trey Campbell
 
Thanks Bob and George and thank you all for joining us today. Operator, can 
y
ou please go ahead and wrap up the call.

Good day ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Intel Corporation Q1 
2017 Earnings Conference Call. As a reminder this conference call is being 
recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Mr. 
Mark 
Henninger, Head of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.

Thank you, Crystal, and welcome, everyone, to Intel's first quarter 2017 
earnings conference call. By now you should have received a copy of our 
earnings release and
 
the CFO commentary that goes along with it. If you've 
not received both documents, they are available on our Investor Website 
intc.com. I'm joined today by Brian Krzanich, our CEO and Bob Swan, our 
Chief Financial Officer. In a moment we'll hear brief rem
arks from both of 
them followed by Q&A.
 
Before we begin, let me remind everyone that today's discussion contains 
forward
-
looking statements based on the environment as we currently see 
it, and as such, does include risks and uncertainties. Please refer to 
our 
press release for more information on the specific risk factors that could 
cause actual results to differ materially.
 
A brief reminder that this quarter we have provided both GAAP and non
-
GAAP financial measures. Today we'll be speaking to the non
-
GAAP
 
financial 
measures when describing our consolidated results. The CFO commentary 
and earnings release available on intc.com include the full GAAP and non
-
GAAP reconciliations.
 
And finally, I'd like to draw your attention to a change we've made to our 
guida
nce practices for the current quarter and full year. Beginning with 
today's earnings release for the first quarter of 2017, our business outlook 
will speak only as of the date of our quarterly earnings releases, bringing our 
practices in line with virtuall
y all of our peers.
 
With that, let me hand it over to Brian.

Intel Corp.
 
Thanks, Mark. The first quarter marked a great start to the year coming off 
both Q4 and full
-
year records in 2016. Q1 revenue was up 7% over the first 
quarter of l
ast year, a record Q1. And operating margin was up 20%. It was 
another milestone in our transformation from a PC
-
centered company to one 
that powers the cloud and billions of smart and connected devices. Average 
selling prices, or ASPs, grew meaningfully a
cross our PC, data center and IoT 
business, reflecting the market's demand for performance and our 
segmentation strategy, and our memory business set an all
-
time record 
revenue.
 
At our investor meeting in February, I outlined our strategy to make Intel 
the
 
driving force of the data revolution across technologies and industries. I 
also detailed our top four priorities for the year: growing the data center and 
adjacencies, ensuring a strong and healthy PC business, growing IoT and 
devices, and executing flawl
essly in memory and FPGAs. That's the 
framework we're using to measure our success throughout the year, and I'd 
like to take a few minutes to assess our progress so far.
 
First the data center and its adjacencies. DCG grew 6% year over year 
despite a headwi
nd resulting from a 14
-
week first quarter last year. The 
cloud service provider revenue was up 18%. The comms service provider 
segment was up 12%. And enterprise was down 3%, while non
-
CPU 
adjacencies grew more than 20% across all of the segments. Data cen
ter 
microprocessor ASPs were up in total across every product line, 
underscoring the market's demand for performance to transmit, aggregate 
and analyze data. We're also on track for mid
-
summer launch of our next
-
generation Skylake microprocessor. Skylake d
elivers significant performance 
gains across a wide range of workloads.
 
For example, Skylake will include AVX
-
512 extensions that will deliver a 2x 
improvement in floating
-
point operations per clock over the current 
generation, a gain that will have an esp
ecially high impact on HPC and 
artificial intelligence workloads. And last month we announced the formation 
of the Artificial Intelligence Product Group, bringing together all of our AI 
hardware and software assets and all of our AI engineering expertise a
cross 
the company into a single group to accelerate our development of a full 
stack of AI solutions, and explore novel approaches that will shape the next 
generation of AI products.
 
Second, a strong and healthy Client business. Our annual cadence of produc
t 
innovation, combined with a thoughtful segmentation strategy, continued to 
produce strong mix, which drove higher ASPs. This trend, along with our 
ramping modem business, drove revenue up 6% and operating margin up 
60% over last year. Our expectations fo
r the PC unit TAM haven't changed 
since we last talked with you. We're expecting a mid
-
single digit percentage 
decline in the unit TAM. Our ASPs, however, are trending ahead of 
expectations and are contributing to our slightly higher revenue expectations 
f
or the full year.
 
Third, we highlighted the importance of growing the IoT business as we 
drive, and benefit from the rise of billions of smart and connected devices. 
IoTG revenue was up 11% year over year, where we saw strength in our 
industrial, video and
 
automotive segments. We also announced our intention 
to acquire Mobileye, a highly profitable, fast
-
growing leader in computer 
vision for advanced driver assistance systems and autonomous driving. The 
transaction will combine Mobileye's expertise in compu
ter vision with Intel's 
expertise in high
-
performance computing, artificial intelligence and 
connectivity. Together we expect to be the global leader in the $70 billion 
autonomous driving systems, data and services opportunity by accelerating 
auto industry
 
innovation and delivering cloud
-
to
-
car solutions faster and at a 
lower cost.
 
And, finally, we emphasized the execution in memory and FPGAs. Our 
memory business grew 55% year over year in a tight supply environment, 
while Fab 68, our Dalian factory, contin
ues to ramp 3D NAND production and 
is delivering outstanding product yields. We also shipped our first Optane 
SSDs for the data center and our Optane memory solution, which is 
available online now and in PC OEM systems later this quarter.
 
In our Programmab
le Solutions Group, revenue declined 7% over the last 
year after adjusting for acquisition
-
related accounting charges in the first 
quarter of 2016. The year
-
over
-
year decline was due to weakness in the 
data center and comm segment, partially offset by grow
th in industrial and 
auto and consumer. We also announced an important pilot program with 
Alibaba Cloud, the cloud computing arm of Alibaba Group, for our cloud
-
based FPGA acceleration service.
 
We're making good progress against our four top priorities for
 
the year and 
our transformation goals. We're improving the profitability and health of our 
PC business. At the same time, our investments in the data center, IoT, 
memory and FPGAs are paying off with significant combined revenue growth. 
These are purposef
ul investments that will position Intel for years to come. 
At the same time, we recognize that there is an opportunity and a 
responsibility to be more focused and efficient as a company, a goal we can 
achieve without compromising our most important investm
ents, our 
transformation or our future.
 
Focus was one of our objectives in establishing McAfee as an independent 
cyber
-
security company just weeks ago. And it is with efficiency in mind that 
we're making an important commitment to our owners today. We are 
establishing a spending target of approximately 30% of revenue, which we 
expect to reach no later than 2020. Following a 1 percentage point 
improvement from 2015 to 2016, we forecasted additional 1 percentage 
point improvement in spending in 2017 and we're
 
now expecting to do a 
little better than that. While we expect revenue growth to a play role in 
achieving these targets, hitting this goal will require spending discipline and 
an intense focus on our strategic priorities.
 
To sum up the quarter, we're off 
to a good start and executing well against 
our priorities. We're delivering a steady cadence of leading products, a 
powerful segmentation strategy and growing profitability in our Client 
business. We're growing our Data Center, IoT, and Memory businesses a
s 
customers see data as a competitive advantage and look to Intel as a 
partner that can help them create, analyze and unlock the value of massive 
and growing flood of data. And finally, we are committing ourselves to a set 
of important new productivity goa
ls intended to create value for our owners.
 
With that I'll hand it over to Bob.

Thanks, Brian. 2016 was a record year for Intel and 2017 is off to a strong 
start. We executed on several important milestones in the quarter. We 
d
elivered on innovative product and technology roadmaps across the 
business, Fab 68 in Dalian continued its impressive ramp, and Intel's 
transformation continued with the planned acquisition of Mobileye for 
autonomous driving and the sale of the Intel Secur
ity Group.
 
Revenue was $14.8 billion, up 7% year over year. Operating income was 
$3.9 billion, up 20% year over year, and earnings per share of $0.66 was up 
22% year over year. Our EPS performance was a result of strong top line 
growth and significant marg
in expansion. First quarter operating margin was 
27%, up 3 points year over year, and gross margin came in at 63% up 0.5 
points year over year. Direct spending came in at $5.4 billion, flat year over 
year and down 2 points as a percent of revenue from 2016
 
as we continued 
to execute on our restructuring program.
 
Let me touch briefly on our segment performance. The Client Computing 
Group had revenue of $8 billion, up 6% year over year. We continue to see 
the worldwide PC supply chain operate at healthy level
s. Client ASPs were up 
7% year over year as our segmentation strategies are paying off and core 
mix continues to be strong. This segment had yet another quarter of 
significant profit growth with operating profit growing over 60% from a year 
ago as the busi
ness continues to execute and benefit from continued 
improvements in 14
-
nanometer unit cost, richer product mix and lower 
spending, primarily from the Client business having a decreased share of 
technology development and SG&A allocations.
 
The Data Center 
Group had revenue of $4.2 billion, up 6% year over year. 
The Data Center Group had operating profit of $1.5 billion, down 16% year 
over year. Operating margin percent was impacted by increased allocation of 
technology development and SG&A costs, higher pro
duct costs as we 
transition to 14
-
nanometer and the ramp of adjacency products.
 
Our Internet of Things business achieved revenue of $721 million, growing 
11% year over year driven by strength in the industrial and video segments 
and continued momentum in o
ur automotive business. Operating profit for 
the business was $105 million, down 15% year over year from increased 
investments in autonomous driving and increased allocation of SG&A and 
technology development spending.
 
Our Memory business had record revenu
e of $866 million, up 55% year over 
year with strong demand for data center SSD solutions and demand signals 
outpacing supply. We continue to make outstanding progress ramping Fab 
68 with yields and unit costs well ahead of expectations. This segment had 
a
n operating loss of $129 million, largely driven by costs associated with 3D 
XPoint and startup costs for our memory capacity.
 
The Programmable Solutions Group had revenue of $425 million. Operating 
profit was $92 million, flat year over year after 
adjusting for acquisition 
related impacts.
 
Our Intel Security Group business had revenue of $534 million and operating 
profit was $95 million. Consistent with our prior guidance the Intel Security 
transaction closed at the beginning of the second quarter.
 
Let me remind you of our capital allocation priorities and our progress. First, 
invest in our business, second, strategic acquisitions and third, return cash 
to shareholders through dividends and buybacks. In the quarter we 
generated $3.9 billion of cash f
rom operations. We repurchased $2 billion in 
capital assets, paid $1.2 billion in dividends, increased the dividend by 5% 
and repurchased about $1.2 billion of stock.
 
In addition, we generated approximately $400 million from the sale of some 
of our interes
ts in ASML, which generated $235 million of pre
-
tax gains. At 
quarter end, cash other long
-
term investments was $23.7 billion, up $600 
million. Total debt was $25.8 billion.
 
Today we announced an increase in our share buyback authorization by $10 
billion. 
Currently, we have approximately $15 billion authorization. We 
expect to continue to offset dilution from our stock
-
based programs and 
opportunistically reduce our outstanding share count over time.
 
Now let me turn to guidance. First, some context. First, 
while we see strong 
momentum and Client ASPs contributing to slightly higher expectations of 
revenue for the year, we continue to take a more cautious view of PC 
consumption versus third party analysts. We feel great about our annual 
cadence of product inn
ovations with new product launches planned this year 
including Skylake for data center, eighth generation core, 64
-
tier 3D NAND 
SSDs and further extensions to our Optane product line.
 
Second, we continued to see strong demand signals in our memory business
 
through the year and our Fab 68 in Dalian ramping to be able to supply 
higher demand levels. Third, the Data Center business has solid momentum 
with the mid
-
summer launch of our next
-
generation Skylake processor. And 
forth, as I indicated earlier, we comp
leted the sale of the Intel Security 
Group. We expect to realize a pre
-
tax gain of approximately $375 million 
and a tax liability of approximately $850 million. This results in a GAAP tax 
rate of 39% and a non
-
GAAP tax rate of 21% in the second quarter.
 
An
d last, as Brian talked about earlier, we are committed to increasing 
efficiency as a company and we are making an important commitment to our 
owners today. We expect to reduce our spending as a percent of revenue by 
2 points from 2015 to 2017 and our plan
s are to continue to drive 
efficiencies in how we operate the business over time. We are establishing a 
spending target of approximately 30% of revenue which we expect to reach 
no later than 2020.
 
As a result, we are raising our full
-
year revenue guidance 
by $500 million to 
approximately $60 billion and our EPS guidance by $0.05 to approximately 
$2.85 per share. As we look to the second quarter of 2017, we are 
forecasting the midpoint of the revenue range of $14.4 billion, up 11% year 
over year excluding In
tel Security and up 6% including Intel Security.
 
We expect operating margins to increase by 3 points year over year, gross 
margins to be up 1 point at approximately 63% and spending to be 
approximately $5.2 billion, flat year over year. We expect our spend
ing as a 
percent of revenue to be down 2 points in the first half of the year versus 
last year, as we make solid progress in increasing efficiency in the company. 
We expect EPS to be approximately $0.68, up 15% year over year.
 
We feel pretty good about whe
re we are 90 days into our three
-
year 
journey. We exceeded our expectations for Q1 and increased our profit 
expectations for the full year. At the same time, we are investing in the 
future by expanding our TAM from $45 billion to $220 billion. We are alrea
dy 
seeing an impact, with our growth
-
oriented businesses up double digits 
collectively as we continue to transform the company from a PC
-
centric 
company to a company of smart and connected devices that power the 
cloud.
 
With that, let me turn it over to Mar
k.

All right, think you, Brian and Bob. Moving on now to the Q&A. As is our

Thank you. Our first questioner comes from Vivek Arya from Bank of

Thank you for taking my question. Brian, I'm cur
ious on the Data Center 
growth. The growth rate is now below 6% in Q1. Are you still committed to 
the high single digit growth rate for this year? What will drive it? Is it just 
some pause ahead of the broader launch of the Skylake servers? If you 
could ju
st give us some more color about why the growth rate is below trend 
right now and what will help it get back to trend later in the year and over 
the next few years.
 
Brian M. Krzanich 
-
 
Intel Corp.
 
Sure, Vivek. So the simple answer is absolutely, we're stil
l committed to the 
high single digit growth for the year. If you take a look at it, as Bob and I 
both mentioned in the call, when you take a look at Q1 comparatives, one, 
Q1 of last year was 14 weeks. This year it's a normal 13 weeks. So you add 
that one e
xtra week; that's a couple of percent that you're competing 
against in a year
-
over
-
year basis.
 
Secondly, Q1 tends to be our lowest quarter in general if you just look at our 
seasonality in the year for overall revenue and output and growth in the 
Data Cent
er business. And so as we look out and we see, as you said, the 
ramp of Skylake in the second half, as we see the normal seasonality, we 
are absolutely committed to that high single digit growth rate for the rest of 
the year.
 
Vivek Arya

Bank of America M
errill Lynch
 
Okay. Thanks. That's helpful. And as my follow
-
up, the very rich mix in PCs, 
ASPs were up very strongly. How sustainable is that? And are you seeing 
any effect of competition from AMD's product launches?
 
Brian M. Krzanich 
-
 
Intel Corp.
 
Sure, I
'll start. Bob, you may want to jump in. Each quarter we come in here 
and say we're a little concerned about the sustainability of those high ASPs, 
and we continue to have that, so we always forecast. If you take a look at 
what we've forecasted for the rem
ainder of the year, we've forecasted a 
slight decline in ASPs as we move through the year. Now, that said, we're 
continuing to improve our road map. We're continuing to pull in products, 
and the demand for those high
-
end, high
-
performance products, from 2
-
in
-
1s, gaming, high
-
end workstations, continues to grow faster than we are 
even able to project.
 
So right now we've forecasted a slight decline through the rest of the year, 
but we had strong demand for it in Q1. And we really believe that's a 
function of 
our products and our roadmap. From a competition standpoint, 
we're not seeing anything unusual right now as far as 

 
there's always some 
level of competition in this market, and I'd tell you for Q1 and our forecast 
for Q2, we're not seeing anything out of 
the ordinary from what we normally 
see.
 
Robert H. Swan 
-
 
Intel Corp.
 
Yeah, the only thing I would add, Brian, is with the ASPs being a little bit 
stronger than we expected in the first quarter, as we mentioned, we expect 
full
-
year revenue to be up $0.5 
billion, versus where we were 90 days ago, 
and I would say one of the contributors to that is how we saw ASP trend in 
the first quarter of the year.

Thank you. And our next question comes from 
C.J. Muse from Evercore. 
Your line is open.
 
C.J. Muse 
-
 
Evercore Group LLC
 
Yeah, good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. I guess first 
question, in terms of your targeted 30% OpEx ratio by 2020, would love to 
hear what kind of revenue assumptions
 
you're making as part of hitting that.
 
Brian M. Krzanich 
-
 
Intel Corp.
 
Sure. So I'll start. First I thought it would be good to give you a little 
background, right, why do we come out and commit this now, and what's 
our thinking behind this? And part of i
t is we had good progress, brought 
down spending as a percent of revenue about 1% for 2016. We're a quarter 
in, and we're seeing good progress in our efforts along 2017 of taking it 
down another slightly more than 1% as we look at this year.
 
And so we just
 
really took a look at, do we think we can maintain that 
progress and continue to drive efficiencies while driving growth. The growth 
we've expected is what we talked about in the analyst meeting back in 
February, which is that mid
-
single digit type of gro
wth for the overall 
company, and that's kind of where we're at from a growth perspective. And 
then the cost reduction and efficiencies are driving the rest of it.
 
Robert H. Swan 
-
 
Intel Corp.
 
Yes. And I would just say that our focus is on growing the earni
ngs 
performance for the company in the short, medium and long term. And what 
we laid out at Analyst Day, as Brian indicated, was over the next three 
years, low single digit growth, operating income growing faster than revenue 
and EPS growing faster than op
erating income. Against that, we're trying to 
obviously make revenue grow faster, continue to manage the efficiency in 
which we operate the company and drive strong earnings growth 
performance over the short, medium and long term. So the 30% target is 
cons
istent with kind of the three
-
year plan, and we know that there's 
opportunities for us to be more efficient as we go forward.
 
C.J. Muse 
-
 
Evercore Group LLC
 
That's very helpful. I guess as my follow
-
up, was hoping to take a look at 
Memory. And here would l
ove to hear from you as to how we should think 
about layering in depreciation from Dalian this year next, and when you 
would expect to turn a profit on the operating margin line.
 
Brian M. Krzanich 
-
 
Intel Corp.
 
Yeah, on the depreciation, we kind of implied
 
in our guidance really no 
change on our depreciation through the course of the year, and what that 
assumes is roughly $2.5 billion additional CapEx from Memory in the year. 
In terms of profitability for this year, when we talked to you at Analyst Day, 
Rob
 
kind of laid out a plan where the core 3D NAND would be profitable in 
the second half of the year, but our losses for the business would still be 
roughly in line with where we were in 2016. And that was a function of really 
three things, good performance 
on 3D NAND, continuing to ramp Dalian and 
continuing to invest in our Optane product or 3D XPoint. So those dynamics 
have us breaking even for the core business in the second half of the year. 
We said that near the end of 2018 as a whole, the Memory busine
ss would 
be profitable. And to the first quarter, growth was stronger than we 
expected and performance out of our fab was even better than we expected.

Thank yo
u. Our next question comes from Blayne Curtis from Barclays. Your 
line is open.
 
Blayne Curtis

Barclays Capital, Inc.
 
Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to go back to the 
DCG growth and into your outlook in June, flat or slight growth
 
overall. Is 
your expectations of the DCG would be similar to that? And then as you look 
out the whole year, you talked about cloud growth. I know tough compares, 
but 18%. Just curious, since you've been shipping early to these customers, 
what would be the
 
timeframe that you would actually see some benefit from 
Skylake?
 
Brian M. Krzanich 
-
 
Intel Corp.
 
Sure, so I'm not exactly sure I completely understood your slight growth. 
What we said is for DCG as a business, we're in the high single digits growth 
rate, 
so we're absolutely committing to that. We talked about the 6% in Q1 
and how, as we go through the year, we'll continue to grow.
 
From the standpoint we've been sampling Skylake to the cloud guys now for 
some period of time. In fact, back into the latter ha
lf of last year. But you 
really don't see the ramp of Skylake in volume at any of the customers, 
whether it be the cloud guys or the rest of the enterprise and networking 
and all until the second half. That's really when the volume kicks in on the 
server s
ide, and that's absolutely what we had forecasted and there's no 
change in that forecast whatsoever.
 
Blayne Curtis 
-
 
Barclays Capital, Inc.
 
Thanks. And then maybe if I could just ask, and I know you don't break it 
out any more, but just your view on 
your modem product this year and next, 
and if you could also maybe opine about your foundry strategy and 
opportunities there.
 
Brian M. Krzanich 
-
 
Intel Corp.
 
Sure, I can start with the modem and Bob can talk about 

 
I'm not going to 
break it out financiall
y. Bob can talk about, jump on top of this. But for us on 
our modem, it continues to gain momentum. We've talked about our one 
large customer, but we continue to get other interest in it. We are on 
schedule to bring our next generation modem into productio
n in customer 
qualifications this year and really looking out over time. We have the next 
several series of modems over the next few years from an LTE perspective.
 
And then we're already working on and believe we're leading, if you looked 
at our output for
 
the MWC back in February as well, on the 5G side which is 
both at the modem and back through the base station. And that, we believe, 
is really the differential that we're able to provide in the communication 
space is in a space like 5G where the modem and
 
the base station and 
backhaul is so integrated and so important, we're able to provide that end
-
to
-
end solution.
 
From a foundry perspective, we continue to talk to several large customers 
and as we're able to, we'll talk about volumes and launching of new
 
products. But for right now we're just saying we're continuing to invest and 
grow that business.
 
Robert H. Swan 
-
 
Intel Corp.
 
Yeah, and the only thing that I would add is the strong CCG revenue growth 
of 6% in the quarter. As you'll remember, because our 
first launch client 
really didn't ramp until the second half of last year, the first half revenue 
growth for CCG will, particularly because the modem will have a relatively 
easy comp. So that's a contributor to growth in the first half, and as Brian 
said, 
the comps get much tougher in the second half because our one client 
launched in the second half last year, but given the product we have, we feel 
relatively good about where we are.

Thank you. Our ne
xt question comes from Stacy Rasgon from Bernstein. 
Your line is open.
 
Stacy Aaron Rasgon 
-
 
Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC
 
Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. First, I wanted to ask again about 
this 30% spending target. You guys just had an Analyst D
ay like two months 
ago. It seems like something that probably should have been talked about 
then. So what's changed in the last two months that means you need to roll 
the target out on today's call? And how should I try to reconcile that target 
with some o
f your other commentary at the Analyst Day where you were 
fairly gung ho about the need to invest to find growth?
 
Brian M. Krzanich 
-
 
Intel Corp.
 
So I'll start, Stacy. I think you have to take a look at where we're at. You're 
kind of asking a couple of que
stions. So first, from the growth standpoint, 
our position about investing and continuing to really drive growth is 
absolutely still just as strong as it was back in February at the Analyst Day. 
And I'd tell you Q1 is a great example of that, with year ove
r year growth, 
another record quarter, coming off a record year and raising the year and 
forecasting another record year. So I feel very good about the investments 
we've made, both short term, medium term and long term to drive that 
growth.
 
That said, Bob 
and I have both been looking at, now how do we do that and 
also at the same time become more and more efficient. And what we've 
looked at now is that our performance and becoming more efficient in 2016 
and taking about 1% out of our spending as a percent o
f revenue was very 
successful. We understand how we did that. As we looked at our first quarter 
performance and what we believe we can take out for the rest of 2017 is 
another percent of spending as a percent of revenue, slightly more actually.
 
And then I 
think one of the things that Bob's really brought in as the CFO is 
new ways of thinking and new looks at how to continue that trend. And so 
taking a percent a year or so out of our spending as a percent of revenue is 
something we think we can go and accomp
lish while driving that growth. 
And that is effort that we've spent over the last couple months, really 
digging into those details. And that's why we felt like it was important we 
came out now and really said, yes, we are committing to that. We 
understand 
the details behind it and we've got a history now that tells us we 
can say it with confidence.
 
Stacy Aaron Rasgon 
-
 
Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC
 
Got it. For my follow up, I'd like to ask about DCG margins. So they were 
35% this quarter. It doesn't sound 
like there was anything structural like the 
warranty charge that hit last quarter. This sounds like the drivers around 
allocation and everything else that you've discussed. But it's still quite a bit 
lower than I think most would have expected. How should 
we think about 
that margin profile trending through the year as the Skylake parts ramp? 
And do you think for the full year, you'll actually be within the Data Center 
margin targets that you provided at the Analyst Day?
 
Robert H. Swan 
-
 
Intel Corp.
 
Yes, I w
ould, Stacy, we kind of provided a long
-
term outlook of 40% to 45% 
operating margin for DCG.
 
Stacy Aaron Rasgon 
-
 
Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC
 
Long term.
 
Robert H. Swan 
-
 
Intel Corp.
 
Our expectations for this year were for growth, as Brian indicated earl
ier, 
high single digit and at the lower end of that range of the 40% to 45%. In 
the first quarter, just to be clear, the 9 point drop in margins, 7 points of 
that is attributed to the fact that DCG is a bigger business, and we've 
indicated it'll be the fir
st on 7
-
nanometer and a fast follow on 10
-
nanometer. 
As a result, it gets a bigger share of our technology development and our 
SG&A allocation. So 7 points of the 9% decline are simply a result of how we 
allocate cost to the business segments.
 
I think in t
erms of going through the course of the year, the things that are 
going to change, as Brian indicated, we got strong product offering coming 
out in the second half of the year. We expect ASPs to improve as we go 
throughout the year. As you know, the first 
quarter is always the lower end 
of margins from a seasonal perspective. And we expect product costs to 
improve as we continue the transition from 22 to 14 nanometer.
 
So it's in line with our long
-
term expectations. No change. Our outlook for 
2017, no chang
e. The biggest fundamental driver to margin performance is 
simply the success of the Data Center business in terms of growing, in terms 
of being a bigger chunk of the overall business, in terms of being a 
beneficiary of leading
-
edge technology. It bears 7 
points impact because of 
the higher burden of our allocations on the business. So we feel good on 
where we are for the quarter and where we're positioned for the full year.
 
Stacy Aaron Rasgon 
-
 
Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC
 
But those allocation 
charges aren't going to go away anytime soon. It 
sounds like they're going to hang around for a while, if you're talking about 
10 and then 7 nanometer.
 
Robert H. Swan 
-
 
Intel Corp.
 
Yeah, that's true, and that's reflected in our 40% to 45% and our 
improveme
nt throughout the course of the year.

Your line is 
open.
 
John William Pitzer 
-
 
Credit Suisse Securities (
USA

Yeah, good afternoon, guys. Thanks for letting me ask the question. Bob, 
maybe just to follow on to Stacy's question, just some clarification
 
around 
the allocation charges. The 7 points in March, does that represent a peak? 
Or do we run into a situation where as absolute costs for 7 and 10 go up 
throughout the year, you could see op margins in DCG continue to be down 
just because the percent do
esn't change but the dollars are going up?
 
Robert H. Swan 
-
 
Intel Corp.
 
Yeah, our expectation is the operating margins for DCG will improve by 
quarter throughout the year. Again, it will be a function of the normal 
seasonality of the profitability of the b
usiness. It will still bear a significant 
chunk of our tech development and SG&A costs, but you may remember 
that our development costs during the course of the year, as we indicated I 
think maybe last couple quarters, that comes down from first half to se
cond 
half. So as that cost comes down, all of our businesses will benefit from 
lower costs.
 
And then the third thing, the real fundamentals of the business are higher 
ASPs with good product with outstanding performance and getting better 
and better yields 
on our 14
-
nanometer product going through the fab will be 
benefits to the profitability of the business. The lowest point Q1 expectations 
will grow each quarter throughout the year, and we would expect full
-
year 
operating margins despite higher absorption,
 
higher burden from our indirect 
costs at roughly 40% for the year.
 
John William Pitzer 
-
 
Credit Suisse Securities (
USA
) LLC
 
That clarification's helpful. And then, Brian, as my follow
-
up, one of the 
stre
ngths of your model is just the free cash flow that you can generate, 
which enables you to reinvest organically back in the business. And you're 
clearly doing it this year on the CapEx front with CapEx up over 20% year 
over year. I guess what I'm trying to
 
understand is, should we be thinking of 
CapEx this year as sort of the new norm with rising capital intensity, 
investments in the Memory business, maybe optionality around foundry? Or 
is the $12 billion this year sort of something that we should think abo
ut as 
being an above trend or particularly high spending year? Any color on that 
would be helpful.
 
Brian M. Krzanich 
-
 
Intel Corp.
 
Sure, John. I'd tell you that the increase in CapEx that you're seeing this 
year is something that we see as unique, but my g
uess is that we'll have to 
continue it for maybe one year more or so as we continue to build out that 
memory factory. But if you take a long
-
term view, I don't expect us to run 
these kinds of CapEx levels. We'll always make good investments, so in a 
place 
like this where we think we have differential technology like 3D NAND 
and our Optane/3D XPoint, I'm going to look for ways to invest that have a 
positive NPV. But from this current view, we probably have another year, 
and then probably go back down to what
 
we'd consider a more normal rate.

Your line is
 
open.
 
David M. Wong

Wells Fargo Securities LLC
 
Thanks very much. Can you give us some idea within Data Center of what 
revenues you're currently seeing from Xeon Phi? And also you mentioned 
acceleration services at Alibaba. Can you fill us in on any othe
r key 
customers adopting Xeon Phi, FPGAs or any of your other accelerators?
 
Brian M. Krzanich 
-
 
Intel Corp.
 
Sure. So we don't break out revenue on specific products like Phi, but Xeon 
Phi does continue to ramp and grow from a product standpoint. We have 
so
me additional products that will launch in the second half of this year 
around Xeon Phi from Knights Mill. And from an FPGA or other accelerators, 
we continue to get several of the large cloud providers, networking providers 
who are continuing to use our F
PGAs.
 
But again, we don't break out on a by
-
customer standpoint, but we still are 
committed to our 6% roughly growth on the PSG business this year. Q1 was 
down just because of some unique 

 
there was some extra buying in the 
latter half of last year around
 
some cloud, and the networking guys are 
typically down in the first quarter. So it hit its forecast, but it's down year 
over year. We think we'll recover that as we go through the rest of the year 
from an FPGA.
 
And then as we go out through the second hal
f of this year, the first of the 
products comes out in silicon from our Nervana acquisition which is another 
form of AI acceleration. We'll get that first silicon. We'll start to work with 
customers and you'll see that come in 2018 as an additional acceler
ator 
adding to our full AI portfolio.

Timothy Arcuri 
-
 
Cowen & Co. LLC
 
Thank you. I 
just wanted to clarify your answer to John's question. So in 
terms of the $300 million year over year burden on DCG operating margin 
that's due to the cost allocation, is that sort of a fixed number going 
forward? Or does that absolute number get better th
rough the year?
 
Robert H. Swan 
-
 
Intel Corp.
 
There's two dynamics on our total pool of indirect costs that are going on for 
the company. One is our SG&A indirect costs are coming down. Brian 
referred to that earlier about the progress we've made on direct 
spending 
overall coming down another 1 point plus during the course of the year. And 
second, our R&D cost particularly as it relates to Moore's Law for 10
-
nanometer and 7
-
nanometer goes up little bit. So during the course of the 
year, our overall cost will
 
be roughly flat that we'll be allocating to the 
businesses. And DCG will get a larger portion of that than it has historically, 
roughly impacting the business by 7 points because of its bigger size and 
because of the decision to have it be a beneficiary o
f Moore's Law sooner 
than it has historically.

Thank you. And then as a follow
-
up, so I just wanted to clarify, so the NSG, 
so you're expecting to still lose money into the first half of next year and is 
that what you're sa
ying? Or you're saying that for the entirety of the year 
next year you'll be profitable. Thanks.

So separate out again and remember we're making the large investments in 
Dalian, so from a pure 3D NAND perspective, we said it
 
goes breakeven and 
beyond in the latter half of this year. So for next year, our standard NAND 
business will be profitable. 3D XPoint plus the Optane product is additional 
investments we're making. We said that that's in the second half of next 
year it go
es to breakeven and the overall business does as well. We haven't 
gotten any more granular than that for right now.

Operator, we have time for two more questions.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. And our next question will come from Ross Seymore from 
Deutsche Bank. Your line is open

Hi, guys. Thanks for letting me ask a question. Wanted to ask the first one 
on the OpEx side of things, and
 
I applaud the 30% target. It's good to see 
that commitment, but I wanted to focus a little bit more on the near term. In 
the first quarter it was about $100 million above what you had guided and 
the second quarter is a bit above what I expected too, espec
ially given 
McAfee. So could you give us a little color on why it was a little bit higher in 
the first quarter? And where we are in the restructuring benefits and the 
McAfee benefits, if you can do anything to size either of those in the near 
term, that wo
uld be helpful.
 
Brian M. Krzanich 
-
 
Intel Corp.
 
Yes, I think first quarter, a little bit over. I'd characterize it primarily in the 
round. I think for first half, we're basically implying $10.6 billion of OpEx and 
we're committed to our $20.5 billion for t
he full year. So $10.6 billion in first 
half drops to $9.9 billion in the second half and there's really two primary 
drivers to that. One is, as you alluded, the exit of McAfee will be roughly 
$300 million out from the first half run rate. And then secondl
y, just the 
completion of our previously announced restructuring programs will continue 
to bear fruit on lower OpEx in the second half of the year. So first half $10.6 
billion, second half, $9.9 billion. McAfee exit, continued execution, and feel 
good abou
t full year $20.5 billion.
 
Robert H. Swan

And just a reminder, that $20.5 billion takes another roughly 1%, slightly 
more, out of our spending as a percent of revenue. So that's all baked in.
 
Ross C. Seymore

Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
 
G
reat. Thanks for that detail. I guess my follow
-
up then switches to the 
gross margin side of things. It's staying solid, and I might be at the risk of a 
rounding error in this question as well. But considering that you raised your 
revenues and ASPs were a 
big portion of that, usually that's a pretty good 
follow through. So the fact that you're keeping the gross margin guide for 
the year flat at 63%, are there any incremental offsets to the goodness that 
the revenue and the ASPs would generate? Or is it, in 
fact, just rounding?
 
Robert H. Swan 
-
 
Intel Corp.
 
I don't know if it's rounding or not. I'd say $0.5 billion of revenue upside at 
kind of roughly gross margin dynamics of the business will fall through at an 
additional $0.05 of EPS, so we feel great about 
that. I think the dynamics of 
more the business is in the second half. ASPs will improve for Data Center. 
As Brian alluded earlier, we've assumed that ASPs will decline a little for the 
Client business. And the fast growth of Memory and modem will have a 
n
egative mix impact on gross margins. So I think when we take that 
altogether through the year, we felt a fairly consistent 63% with all those 
puts and takes throughout to the course of the year. And Q1 was where we 
expected, Q2 consistent with Q1 and full 
year.

Mark H. Henninger

Intel Corp.
 
Thanks, Ross. Operator, can you please go ahead and introduce our last 
question?
 
Operator
 
Thank you. And our final question comes from Kevin 
Cassidy from Stifel. 
Your line is open.
 
Kevin E. Cassidy 
-
 
Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.
 
Thank you for taking my question. Just on the capacity that you're building 
in Dalian, can you say what percentage increase you're getting? Or is it 
directly correlated
 
to the revenue growth that you see in the Memory Group?
 
Brian M. Krzanich 
-
 
Intel Corp.
 
Percentage. So, A, yes. The growth in the Memory business that goes 
through the rest of this year is largely driven by the ramp of the Dalian 
factory, along with some 
assumptions around strong ASPs as demand 
continues to outpace supply in the market in general. And so if you take a 
look from here on, in fact 2017, but then as we go out into 2018 beyond, 
Dalian will continue to be the driver of growth of that business.
 
K
evin E. Cassidy 
-
 
Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.
 
I guess another way to phrase the question is, what's the bit growth? Most 
other memory companies give a projection of what their bit growth is.
 
Brian M. Krzanich 
-
 
Intel Corp.
 
Yes. I don't think we've actuall
y ever given a bit growth, so that's not a 
public number. We can take a look at that for next quarter as to whether we 
want to start adding that to our normal distribution. But what we've always 
talked about is growth of the business from a profit or reven
ue standpoint 
and overall growth.
 
Kevin E. Cassidy 
-
 
Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.
 
Okay. Thank you.
 
Brian M. Krzanich 
-
 
Intel Corp.
 
Partly because remember, more and more of that business will become 
things like 3D XPoint slash Optane. And bits will be a li
ttle bit different there, 
right, not all bits are going to be created equal. That's a very differentiating 
technology. It's really got performance of DRAM
-
like devices with NAND non
-
volatility and pricing in between. And so those bits are a bit different t
han, 
say, typical NAND bits, and I wouldn't want to just lump those all into a 
standard number. So we need to think about how we'd really go and present 
this to you if you want to think about it from a bit standpoint. And that, it's 
around 5% of the busine
ss this year. But as you go out into next year and 
beyond, it becomes a larger and larger percentage as we see more and more 
products, especially in the data centers, use the Optane technology.
 
Kevin E. Cassidy 
-
 
Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.
 
Right. And may
be if I could ask that question too of Optane. When would it 
transfer to China?
 
Brian M. Krzanich 
-
 
Intel Corp.
 
We haven't talked about a transfer date to China yet.
 
Kevin E. Cassidy 
-
 
Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.
 
Okay.
 
Brian M. Krzanich 
-
 
Intel Corp.
 
So t
hat hasn't been made public right now. Right now, Dalian is 3D NAND.
 
Kevin E. Cassidy

Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.
 
Okay. Great. Thank you.

earnings release and the CFO commentary that goes along with it. If you 
have not received both documents, they are available on our Investor 
website, intc.com.
 
I am joined today by Bria
n Krzanich, our CEO, and Stacy Smith, our Chief 
Financial Officer. In a moment, we will hear brief remarks from both of 
them, followed by the Q&A.
 
Before we begin, let me remind everyone that today's discussion contains 
forward
-
looking statements based on 
the environment as we currently see 
it, and as such, does include risk and uncertainties. Please refer to our press 
release for more information on the specific risk factors that could cause 
actual results to differ materially.
 
Also during this call, we wi
ll be using non
-
GAAP financial measures and 
references. GAAP financial reconciliations are available in earnings material, 
which was posted on our website, intc.com in advance of this call. The 
forecast Stacy speaks to today will be on a non
-
GAAP basis.
 
Wi
th that, let me hand it over to Brian.
 
Brian Krzanich
 
Thanks Mark. Our results for the fourth quarter were consistent with 
expectations. We marked a strong finished to the year. Taken as a whole, 
2015 demonstrated the benefits of our strategy, which is des
igned to 
capitalize on the growing need for the infrastructure powering the smart and 
connected world. That strategy is also resulting and the evolution of our 
business model to focus on three keys areas of growth, the Data Center, the 
Internet of Things a
nd Memory. Our results reflect that evolution.
 
Revenue for the year was nearly flat, despite a significant decline in PC 
demand. 2015 was also a year of revenue record and important milestones 
and I would like to take a minute to review some of them with y
ou.
 
Even though the Client Computing Group ended the full year down 8%, we 
were excited to see that we were able to grow sequentially in the second 
and third and fourth quarters. As of November, 14 nanometer products 
made up more than 50% of the Client Com
puting volume. For the year, 
high
-
end Core i7 microprocessors and our K SKUs for gaming, both set all
-
time volume records, leading to our rich product mix.
 
In our Security business, we have refocused the organization on endpoint 
technology, where we enjoy 
a solid leadership position and we have driven 
material efficiencies as we fully integrated the McAfee organization into Intel. 
The results of these changes had been dramatic.
 
On a constant currency basis, Security revenue rose 6% for the year while 
the or
ganization's tighter focus drove a remarkable 44% improvement in 
operating income. The IoT Group grew revenues 7% in 2015 to $2.3 billion, 
an all
-
time record as the retail transportation and video segments also 
strong double
-
digit year
-
over
-
year growth.
 
In
 
our NAND Solutions group, we introduced a revolutionary new class of 
memory call 3D XPoint, the industry's first new memory technology in more 
than two decades. 3D XPoint is a great example of our growth strategy at 
work, using our technology expertise to
 
innovate and expand into profitably 
adjacent markets. We think it is a game
-
changing technology moving 
forward.
 
Our confidence in the technology led us to announce in the fourth quarter 
that we were upgrading our Dalian, China fab to manufacture both 3D N
AND 
and 3D XPoint, with production beginning later this year. For the full
-
year, 
our memory business grew more than 20% to $2.6 billion, another all
-
time 
record.
 
At the same time, the Data Center Group grew 11% over last year to an all
-
time record of $16 b
illion in revenue. Macro weakness weighed on enterprise 
demand and resulted in slower growth than we expected at the beginning of 
the year. However DCG's overall performance highlighted the underlying 
trends driving data center demand as cloud and communic
ation service 
providers' revenue, both, grew more than 20% for the year.
 
Within the Cloud segment, 40% of our volume was custom SKUs as we left 
the year, demonstrating the ongoing value of working directly with the 
customers to tailor solutions to their ne
eds.
 
Finally, just after our fiscal year ended, we closed our acquisition of Altera. 
We are thrilled to welcome the talented Altera team to Intel. Combined, our 
two companies will deliver powerful synergies based on Intel's process 
technology leadership an
d the integration of Altera's FPGAs.
 
Wrapping up, our results over the last year leave me increasingly confident 
in our strategy. While our outlook for the first quarter reflects some caution 
about overall demand, particularly in China, we continue to expe
ct solid 
growth in the business in 2016.
 
Because it provides tremendous return to our shareholders, we will continue 
to drive innovation and differentiation in our core PC business. This business 
provides a foundation of IP and a source of cash flow, but i
t is not the sole 
driver of our growth.
 
Our future as a company will increasingly be a product of the virtuous cycle 
of opportunities in the data center, memory and IoT market segments. In 
fact, you can see the impact of that virtuous cycle in our 2015 res
ults. DCG, 
IoTG and Memory, delivered nearly 40% of Intel's revenue and more than 
60% of Intel's operating margin in 2015. Additionally, these three adjacent 
markets delivered $2.2 billion in profitable revenue growth in 2015 alone. As 
we look ahead to 201
6, we will continue to build on that strategy.
 
With that, let me turn it over Stacy.
 
Stacy Smith
 
Thanks, Brian. The fourth quarter was a strong finish to the year, with 
record revenue a $14.9 billion. We had record revenues in the Data Center 
and Internet 
of Things businesses. Gross margin of 64% was up two points 
to outlook. Net income was $3.6 million, down 1% year
-
over
-
year and 
earnings per share was $0.74, flat over the same horizon.
 
I would like to provide context behind our full year 2015 financials a
s it 
provides insight into how we are executing to our strategy. Growth in the 
Data Center, Memory and Internet of Things businesses, partially offset a 
weaker than expected macroeconomic environment and weak PC client 
market.
 
Overall, revenue for the year
 
was $55.4 billion, which was down 1% from 
the prior year. The Client Computing Group achieved $32 billion in revenue 
and was down 8% for the year. Within the Client Computing Group, we 
achieved almost $1 billion in mobile profitability improvements over t
he 
course of the year, exceeding our goal.
 
The Data Center business at about $16 billion in revenue grew 11%. The 
Memory business at over $2.5 billion in revenue grew over 20% and the 
Internet of Things business at about $2.3 billion, grew 7%.
 
Gross 
margin for 2015 was approximately 63%, down about a point from 
2014. Higher unit costs as we ramp 40
-
nanometer were offset by an 
increase in ASPs, driven by strong results in the data center business and a 
rich mix in the Client Computing business. Operati
ng profit for the year was 
$14 billion, down 9% year
-
on
-
year, earnings per share for the year was 
$2.33, up 1% from the prior year.
 
In 2015, the business continued to generate significant cash with $19 billion 
of cash from operations. We purchased $7.3 bil
lion in capital assets. We paid 
$4.6 billion in dividends and repurchased about $3 billion of stock.
 
Total cash balance was $25.3 billion, up over $11 billion year
-
over
-
year. Our 
net cash balance, total cash less debt, and inclusive of our other longer
-
ter
m 
investments was approximately $6.6 billion. We issued about $9.5 billion 
dollars of new long
-
term debt to finance our acquisition of Altera.
 
In November, we announced an $0.08 dividend increase to $1.04 per share 
on an annual basis effective in the first
 
quarter of 2016. The acquisition of 
Altera was completed in early fiscal 2016, which means that the 2016 
guidance includes the expected results for the FPGA business.
 
As I talked to our guidance for 2016, it is important to note that we have 
excluded non
-
cash and one
-
time acquisition
-
related charges for Altera. The 
CFO commentary pre
-
released before this call and available on intc.com 
includes the full GAAP and non
-
GAAP reconciliations.
 
For the first quarter of 2016, the mid
-
point of the revenue range is e
xpected 
to be $14.1 billion. This forecast, which includes an extra work week and the 
newly acquired FPGA business, is on the low
-
end of the average seasonal 
range. This outlook represents a soft start to the year as we remain cautious 
on the level of econ
omic growth, particularly in China.
 
We continue to believe the worldwide PC supply chain is healthy with 
appropriate levels of inventory. Gross margin for the first quarter is expected 
to be approximately 62% and spending is expected to be $5.5 billion.
 
Tu
rning to the full year 2016, we are expecting revenue growth in the mid
-
to
-
high single digits relative to 2015. This outlook is higher than our 
previous guidance provided in November investor meeting. This higher range 
of driven by the addition of the FPGA
 
business, partially offset by some 
caution as a result of uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment.
 
Gross margin for the year is expected to be 63% and spending is expected 
at $21.3 billion. The capital spending forecast for 2016 is $9.5 billion, up 
f
rom 2015. As the economic useful life of our manufacturing equipment 
lengthens, we are extending the depreciable life of equipment in our 
factories from four to five years. This change in depreciable life drives 
approximately $1.5 billion and lower depreci
ation expense for the year. 
Inclusive of this change, we are forecasting depreciation expense to be $6.5 
billion this year, down $1.3 billion from 2015.
 
Our results demonstrate that we are transforming the company. We are 
pivoting towards the cloud with a 
diversified portfolio of businesses. Client is 
still the largest segment, but the other businesses now make up about 40% 
of our total revenue and 2015 marked the first year where these businesses 
made up the majority of our operating profit.
 
The Data Cente
r business is growing fast and is now a $16 billion business. 
That growth is being driven by growth rates in cloud computing that were 
over 40% year
-
on
-
year.
 
Our Memory business grew over 20% year
-
over
-
year and is as well 
positioned to disrupt the industry
 
with the launch of 3D XPoint technology.
 
Internet of Things business grew in 2015, and is expected to contribute 
more growth this year. With the Altera acquisition, we expect to broaden our 
product portfolio in the Data Center and Internet of Things busin
esses and 
enable even more innovation.
 
Most importantly, we are pivoting towards the cloud, diversifying our client 
business and building a strong foundation for long
-
term growth for the 
company.
 
With that, I will turn it back over to Mark.
 
Mark Henninger
 
Alright, thank you Brian and Stacy. Moving on now to the Q&A, as is a 
normal practice, we would ask each participant ask one question and just 
one follow
-
up if you have one. Sabrina, please go ahead and introduce our 
first questioner.
 
Question
-
and
-
Answer S
ession
 
Operator
 
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of 
Joe Moore of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.
 
Joe Moore
 
Great, Thank you so much. The Client average selling prices went up again 
for the second quarter is t
hat the same trend you saw in Q3 as stronger high 
end and what is your assumption for the ASP trajectory going forward?
 
Brian Krzanich
 
Sure. I will start, Joe. This is Brian. It is same type of trend we saw 
throughout 2015, with client buy up the stack and
 
you saw that our record 
revenue in Core i7 and K SKUs, which are really our top
-
end SKUs. Forecast 
for '16 has us relatively flat in this space, so we do not know if it will 
continue, but right now we forecast flat the ASPs for '16.
 
Stacy Smith
 
Just to ad
d, Joe, so there was a client coming. In total we see ASPs up a 
little bit in '16. You can see it in the gross margin reckon. As Brian said, we 
are maintaining client ASP, but we are expecting that server becomes a 
larger percentage of the mix, so we get s
ome mix impact based on what is 
going on in server.
 
Joe Moore
 
Okay. That makes sense. Thanks. My follow
-
up, the depreciation change, 
was that something you had known about when you had talked about the 
full
-
year guidance at the Analyst Day? What was it 
that prompted you to 
make that change now?
 
Brian Krzanich
 
Yes. The depreciation change was not included in my forecast that I provided 
back in November. We were in the middle of the analysis. What prompted it 
was, we did an in
-
depth analysis based on the c
adence of moving from one 
process technology node to the next. We talked about that at the beginning 
of 2015, and the third wave of products and we kind of completed our long 
range planning in the fourth quarter and that has what triggered the change 
in th
e depreciation cadence.
 
I will also say, just to tie this out for you. In November, I was forecasting a 
62% gross margin for the year. I am now projecting a 63% gross margin for 
the year and the difference there is this change in depreciation, so you can 
k
ind of see it in our gross margin reckon.
 
Joe Moore
 
Great. Thank you very much.
 
Brian Krzanich
 
You are welcome.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya of Bank of 
America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.
 
Vivek Arya
 
Than
ks for taking my question. First, Brian, you mentioned that there is 
some uncertainty near
-
term in the broader environment. I was hoping you 
could provide us some more color around that if possible by your different 
segments and perhaps by geography.
 
Brian
 
Krzanich
 
Sure, Vivek. It is the same type of trend we saw in 2015, emerging markets 
slower than the mature markets, U.S., Western Europe looking okay. China 
and the rest of Asia, slow. It was both, consumer and enterprise. I would 
say it is a little bit h
eavier on the client
-
side, so the PC side than the data 
center side, but we are seeing some of it on the data center side as well and 
those are the two big drivers and it is all the same geography.
 
Vivek Arya
 
I see. My follow
-
up maybe for Stacy, can you ta
lk about the leverage in the 
model? Because, if I take your full year sales growth number, OpEx is 
roughly about 35
-
ish percent or so of sales, which is in line with what you 
had given at Analyst Day, but I am wondering what steps can you take to 
drive mor
e leverage in the model. As an IDM, shouldn't the goal be to get to 
at least 30%
-
plus operating margins, so what steps can you take this year 
to help drive more leverage in the model? Thank you.
 
Stacy Smith
 
Sure. First let me just take a second to detangle
 
the 2016 numbers, because 
with the extra workweek, the Altera acquisition, which includes some one
-
time costs and the change in depreciation, it becomes a little hard to, I 
think, get to the bottom of what's actually happening operationally in the 
busines
s.
 
If you recall, in the investor meeting in November, Brian and I talked about 
the fact that we were looking to reduce spending as a percent of revenue by 
half
-
a
-
point. If you just take all of the adjustments out, so you don't adjust 
for the change in dep
reciation we do not adjust for Altera anything like that. 
We are getting that to half
-
a
-
point.
 
When we add all of that in, we are getting a bit more than the half
-
a
-
point 
improvement from 2015 to 2016 in terms of our projections, so we feel we 
are deliveri
ng what we committed to, and when you put some of these 
adjustments on top of it, we will deliver a little bit more.
 
In terms of the opportunities there, we articulated and I will let Brian 
comment over the top, but we articulated in the investor meeting w
e are still 
committed to drive spending as a percent of revenue down. We are in the 
midst of transformation right now, so we are going through a period where 
we are reading and feeding our portfolio, we are making some 
disinvestments, but very importantly 
we are investing in areas that we think 
are critical for long
-
term growth and health of the company and where we 
get lots of return i.e., the Data Center, the Internet of Things or process 
technology leadership, the Memory business, so we knew going into t
his 
year it would be a time of elevated investment, we are delivering what we 
committed, but there is more to come in future years. Thanks, Vivek.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question comes from line of C.J. Muse of Evercore. Your 
line is now open.
 
C.J. M
use
 
Yes. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. I guess now with 
the Altera deal closed, I was curious if you could provide an update on your 
server chip roadmap and strategy as we look into 2016 and beyond.
 
Brian Krzanich
 
Sure, C.J. This is Bri
an. Let me just kind of give you a broad picture of Altera 
and where we are at. As you said, we just closed. We have just gotten 
through employee integration, everybody has got a badge, if you just go by 
the sign is out in front Intel now, we are really ex
cited, we are starting to dig 
into some of the product roadmaps.
 
The good news is, we had been working as separate companies on the first 
of the server chips, which is a multi
-
chip package, so FPGA and our Xeon in 
the same package. That will actually start
 
sampling to select customers in 
the first quarter of this year and it will continue to select 
-
 
in limited 
quantities 
-
 
it will continue to sample throughout this year, with production 
in '17.
 
Our roadmap will then 
-
 
we are still working on our 
roadmap beyond that of 
when do we integrate the full IP into our silicon, so basically monolithic die 
and we are now actually spending an equal amount of time on that same 
kind of a roadmap in MCP or multi
-
chip package filed by monolithic die in the 
IoT sp
ace, so we feel pretty good about the progress and we are already in 
the first quarter going to be set going to the kind of leading edge [ph] if you 
think about.
 
C.J. Muse
 
Very helpful, and I guess as my follow
-
up, you provided a $10 billion CapEx 
budget a
nd now it looks like it is about $500 million lower at the mid
-
point. I 
was curious what has changed there. Is that principally capacity on the logic 
side as opposed to memory given what we are seeing in the macro 
environment? Thank you.
 
Brian Krzanich
 
Yes
. It is all logic for the most part and it is not as much a macro versus 
testing capacity or anything. That is just the ins and outs. As we went from 
the investor meeting into the actual firm forecast for 2016, the team has 
just sharpened down all the numb
ers and went through it in more detail.
 
I do not think there is anything more to it. I will let Stacy comment if he 
wants to give you any other light on this one.
 
Stacy Smith
 
No.
 
C.J. Muse
 
Great. Thanks so much.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question comes 
from the line of Harlan Sur of 
JPMorgan. Your line is now open.
 
Harlan Sur
 
Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. On the Data Center 
business, it decelerated as the team has expected, but 5% year
-
over
-
year 
growth in Q4 was a bit more deceleration t
han what we were anticipating, so 
I guess two questions. Was it all enterprise that drove the weakness and do 
you expect to get back to a double
-
digits growth trajectory in the March 
quarter and is the team still confident about driving mid
-
teens growth fo
r 
DCG in 2016?
 
Brian Krzanich
 
Yes. There are a couple of things I want to talk about on the Data Center. 
First, when you compare Q4 to Q4, we you are looking at comparative where 
Q4 '14 was one of our strongest quarters, you know, as long as I can 
remember
 
very strong 
-
 
greater than 20% growth for the quarter, so that 
quarter was a little bit of unique so the quarter
-
to
-
quarter comparative is a 
bit tough.
 
If you take a look at how the second half it is really Q3 and Q4 kind of 
looked similar. Enterprise act
ually stabilized from the first half, so enterprise 
was weak in the first half and it has got a little bit more stable in the second 
half. What we saw was the normal, the cloud guys turned the slowdown in 
the fourth quarter, because that is when a lot of t
hat cloud, you know, they 
do not want to be upsetting the cloud infrastructure while the holiday 
seasons are on people are buying things then we continued to see strong 
growth and strong share gain in the networking in Telco side.
 
Absolutely, we continue t
o look out. Again, we are very careful to not look at 
is this on a quarter
-
by
-
quarter basis. We are looking at the long view and we 
are very confident that yes we will continue into this double
-
digit growth in 
the Data Center. It will continue to be fueled
 
by the cloud in the first side 
and then secondly by our growth in Telco and networking as our share grows 
there. Remember, we entered the year less than 10% share of that space 
and there is a lot of space there for us to grow in the networking and Telco 
s
pace.
 
Stacy Smith
 
Let me just add one thing to the premise of your question. I think we were 
not surprised by where we ended up in the Data Center. If you recall back in 
November, we talked about Data Center growth rate for the year being in 
the low double
 
digits. That is exactly where we came in.
 
Based on what Brian was just talking about in terms of the strength of Q4 
'14, we were expecting this to be a tough compare that we would have 
growth rates in the single digits.
 
Harlan Sur
 
Great. Thanks for the in
sights there. Then for my follow
-
up, you know, the 
team is going to be launching its 6
th
 
generation V Core product line for 
enterprise desktop PCs, I think, next week. There also has not been a 
refresh of desktop for two years, so I guess the question is w
hat are you 
hearing from your corporate and enterprise customers as to the potential 
uptake of these new platforms relative to the very muted enterprise demand 
profile that we had last year?
 
Brian Krzanich
 
As you said, we kind of went roughly a year or so 
without a desktop 
enterprise upgrade, and especially when you combine coming back now with 
the refresh, that refresh being Skylake, the combination of Skylake's great 
performance and great graphics. We are past the Windows 10 launch, which 
is another posit
ive in this space.
 
We are hearing very good response as far as people's interest, the form 
factors you are seeing, right? You are seeing All
-
in
-
Ones, you are seeing 
classic desktop platforms, you are seeing great graphics, you are seeing 
OLED displays. Ove
rall, it is just another segment, where we think the best 
computing device really is the computing industry has every built are going 
to be showcased.
 
The excitement there and we just got to get past the macroeconomics of 
enterprises saying we are going to
 
go do the upgrade.
 
Harlan Sur
 
Thank you.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon of 
Bernstein Research. Your line is now open.
 
Stacy Rasgon
 
Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. First, I wanted to go to the 
equipment life extension. I know you were hopeful that eventually you would 
be able to get your node migration trajectory back from three years to two, 
so this sounds like a fairly permanent change in terms of extending your 
equipment life time, so what sh
ould we take from this action in terms of how 
you view the potential improvement ability of your node migration trajectory 
going forward?
 
Brian Krzanich
 
It is not an impact at all, Stacy. This is whether we are at two years or two
-
and
-
a
-
half or three, it w
as not going to dramatically shift that life 
expectancy like this. This is more about the amount of reuse and the 
efficiency and speed at which we can do the conversion, so both of those 
numbers have improved.
 
Now the cycle, clearly it does not hurt to hav
e from this perspective, the 
longer node cycle, but independent of that, this is a change that was 
fundamental to the shift and reuse and rate at which we are able to move 
tool from being able to run, say, 14 nanometers to 10 nanometers.
 
Stacy Smith
 
I woul
d also just add. That is exactly right. The reuse is something that has 
been shifting over time and it gives us a lot of economic benefit. I will give 
you the accounting answer here too, which is if we got to 7 nanometer or 5 
nanometer and there was someth
ing that caused us to look at the 
depreciable life, the economic usefulness of the equipment, we would 
change it, but we are certainly not expecting anything like that, but as we go 
through this analysis every year.
 
Brian Krzanich
 
Only thing I would add to
 
finish is, within the manufacturing side, one of our 
objectives is to continue to improve on those vectors that I talked about, 
reuse and speed at which we are able to do these transitions, so we will be 
constantly trying to get this to be a longer and lo
nger number if possible, 
independent of the nodes, because it just shows we are becoming more 
efficient.
 
Stacy Smith
 
Right.
 
Stacy Rasgon
 
Got it. Thank you, guys. For my follow
-
up, I just wanted to take a look at 
the extra week that is in Q4. How much of yo
ur guidance is actually coming 
from that extra week. Is it sort of the full, I guess the 7.5% of whatever it is 
or is less, because that week is happening at the end of '15 and beginning of 
'16? How should we think about how that may influence normal seaso
nality 
into Q2?
 
Brian Krzanich
 
Yes. Sorry. Maybe I did not hear you, and just I want to clarify that the 
extra work week is in Q1 of 2016, not Q4 2015.
 
Stacy Rasgon
 
Yes, but I think it is like December 28
th
 
through January 4
th
 
or something, so 
how did that
.
 
Brian Krzanich
 

years to seven years, because we are on a work week calendar over five
-
year to seven
-
year period. We get out of sync with the actual calendar and 
then we add in a
 
workweek in order to get back on sync.
 
It is easy actually to quantify the spending associated with that extra 
workweek, because, you know, we have got lights on and factories running 
and we are paying people, so revenue associated with it is a little har
der to 
calculate.
 
When you look at where the week actually falls, it is that week between 
Christmas and New Year's. Our fiscal year ended, I think, the day after 
Christmas, so it is that week between Christmas and New Year's that tends 
to be a billings wee
k that is dramatically lower than any other week we see 
during the year, so some revenue impact kind of hard to quantify it.
 
The way I would look at it though, you know, when you look at our guide 
and you take out Altera and you take into account any impac
t for the extra 
workweek, what you would see is that the guide for the first quarter is, you 
know, kind of at the low
-
end of what we normally see from a Q4 to Q1, is 
how I think of it and then you add Altera back on top of that and you get to 
the revenue n
umber that we provided.
 
Just to be totally transparent, the revenue number for Altera in Q1 is on the 
order of $400 million, so you can kind of do the math from there. Thanks 
Stacy.
 
Stacy Rasgon
 
Got it. Thank you, guys.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next 
question comes from the line of John Pitzer of Credit 
Suisse. Your line is now open.
 
John Pitzer
 
Yes. Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for letting me ask the question. Brian, 
the first question I have is on the DCG business. This quarter, the December 
quarter,
 
you saw a modest drop in ASPs both, sequentially and year
-
over
-
year, which is somewhat of anomaly for that business. I guess I understand 
the mix shift as cloud grows faster than enterprise. I am kind of curious; do 
you think this was a one
-
quarter anomal
y? Is this something we should 
expect more of as networking grows faster in '16? Within the individual 
segments, are you still seeing customers buy up the stack?
 
Brian Krzanich
 
Okay. That is actually a great question, John. For Q4, the decline or the 
decre
ase in ASP was mostly driven by the much higher growth rate in the 
networking as you mentioned and the fact that the percentage of out add
-
on 
[ph] in networking tends to be a bit higher, so if you look at networking as a 
whole, the ASPs in networking tend 
to be lower than, say, cloud or 
enterprise.
 
However, if you look at Q4's networking ASP, so if you took out just that 
ASP and you compared that ASP relative to prior quarters, it was actually up 
as an average, selling at a lower average selling price, but 
that average 
selling price is increasing as more people buy 
-
 
and as NFV and SDNs 
takeoff, more people tend to buy up to core, because they are really 
searching for that performance.
 
We do hope and expect this trend to continue into '16 as we gain share in
 
networking, the relative strength. Then if you take a look at the cloud space 
and the enterprise space, we expect those to continue on the trends you 
have seen over the last few years. We do not expect any major shift there, 
but we have very strategic pla
ns to continue to grow in the networking, 
storage and especially around the Telco and networking space as SDN and 
NFV really take hold.
 
You will see a slightly lower ASP from there, but we expect the ASP to 
continue to increase in that space as we bring mo
re functionality. Does that 
answer your question?
 
John Pitzer
 
Yes. It does. Very helpful, then Stacy, as my follow
-
on, you raised sort of 
the full
-
year gross margin by about 100 basis points, but if I kind of do the 
math $1.5 billion decrease in depreciati
on on a $60 billion revenue stream is 
more than 100 basis points. In addition, the Altera gross margin was higher 
than your core, so I guess I am trying to understand what are the offsets? Is 
10 nanometer cost kind of coming in higher than expected and if 
you could 
help us understand sort of the progression of 10 nanometer cost throughout 
the year? That would be helpful.
 
Stacy Smith
 
Sure, and a great question. I know there is a lot of moving parts here. Let 
me just focus in on the depreciation change for se
cond. I actually try to be 
very transparent. In the CFO commentary that was released, you will see 
some of this written out, so you can always refer back to it.
 
The change in depreciation, you are right. In total, it was about $1.5 billion, 
but only about 
half of that is flowing through COGs impacting gross margins 
in 2016 and that is why you get to the kind of one
-
point shift, and that really 
is the primary difference, so there is a few other moving parts, but nothing 
that is material. That is the thing th
at changed from 62% gross margin 
forecast that we had in November to 63% gross margin forecast that we 
have today.
 
The rest of the change in depreciation, about a quarter that will flow through 
OpEx, because remember all of the spending we do for research 
and 
development facilities actually flows through our research and development 
lines, so you see a little bit of a benefit there. Then you have some of it that 
goes into inventory and then ships out over time.
 
John Pitzer
 
Thank you.
 
Brian Krzanich
 
You are 
welcome.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Danely of 
Citigroup. Your line is now open.
 
Chris Danely
 
Thanks, guys. Just another question on the weakness you are seeing. Can 
you just maybe going into some detail on, when it s
tarted, have you seen 
any stability? Is this just CPUs in your full
-
year forecast you are implying 
that we get back to normal seasonality in Q2 through Q4?
 
Stacy Smith
 
Yes. I would articulate, we have a cautious stance as we start the year. 
There were a co
uple of things that feed into that. Units were a little weaker 
for us in the Client segment and Q4. As we worked our way through the 
Christmas selling season, what we saw was the sell
-
through all the way to 
the end customer was a less than we thought. We m
ade up for that with a 
rich mix, so that is why we ended up with a pretty good result, but a little 
-
 
we are watching that carefully.
 
Then our team on the ground in China has gotten fairly cautious about what 
is going on in China right now. As you know, th
at is the largest PC market, 
so we are just little cautious on the growth rates there.
 
In terms of from here, I think Brian said it well, we are expecting this is the 
environment as we work our way through 2016, against the a backdrop of 
somewhat weak macr
oeconomic environment we kind of expect the year to 
play out kind of normally from here.
 
Chris Danely
 
Okay. Thanks. Then as far as the Altera revenue, I think you said $400 
million. I think that is down like somewhere in the mid
-
teens or something 
like 
that, sequentially. Why the conservative forecast. Then do you have any 
forecast for the year for Altera business?
 
Brian Krzanich
 
Yes. I am not going to speak. They did not release results for 2015, so I am 
really not able to talk about their results for 2
015. I can tell you from our 
perspective, we did not see anything that was surprising in terms of what we 
have seen about their business levels. We actually expect some revenue 
growth as we go from '15 to '16.
 
I will give you kind of in total what we expec
t for Altera. It is a little north of 
$1.6 billion in terms of revenue. Gross margin that as John was saying is a 
little higher than the corporate average, so it gives us a slight mix, but 
because it is a relatively small business against the backdrop of I
ntel, it is 
not a big shift in our gross margin and then we were expecting spending 
that is at run rate of a of $200 million a quarter.
 
In addition to all of that, there will be a bunch of kind of one
-
time acquisition 
deal related, there is amortization ac
quisition related intangibles, we see all 
those in the GAAP number. I have excluded them from the non
-
GAAP 
numbers I just gave you.
 
Chris Danely
 
Great. Thanks, guys.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ross Seymore of 
Deutsche Bank
. Your line is now open.
 
Ross Seymore
 
Hi, guys. Thanks for letting me ask you questions. Stacy, one question on 
the OpEx side, back to that leverage question, you had a very useful slide at 
the Analyst Meeting about how you disinvest in some areas and incr
ease 
investments in another.
 
I guess my next question is, given that ability to do a substitution in the 
past, is there any limitation on that going forward or if you going to keep 
spending more on some of the growth initiatives. Is that actually going to 
be 
all incremental to the level we have now?
 
Stacy Smith
 
No. I think that is actually part of our DNA. As we are pretty rigorous about 
trying to weed and feed where we invest and where we disinvest. As you 
referred to in the Investor Meeting, I showed up a
nd down arrow chart and 
the magnitude of those shifts was on the order of a $1 billion for some of the 
big movers as we added investments in some areas and subtracted 
investments in others and I will also say there is a point at which we expect 
that we get
 
more and more leverage in businesses like the Data Centers as 
well, so I think there is a lot of opportunities for us to bring down spending 
as a percent of revenues as we go forward.
 
Ross Seymore
 

 
Stacy Smith
 
Add anything to that.
 
Brian 
Krzanich
 
No. Go ahead.
 
Ross Seymore
 
I guess as my follow
-
up question is, just any more color you can provide on 
the channel inventory? You mentioned that the unit demand was a little 
weaker than you had expected. How is the channel looking right now and 
wh
at sort of expectation should we have for your internal inventory looking 
into this year? Thanks.
 
Brian Krzanich
 
Sure. We believe that 2015 ended with I would just call it very healthy 
inventories. In fact, one of the things we saw was a slight decrease in
 
the 
inventory levels as we exited the fourth quarter. If you take a look at what 
we had originally projected and what would have been more an industry 
norm would have been a slight increase in inventory. We expect those kind 
of healthy inventory levels to
 
extend through '16. There is no sign that 
anybody is adding inventory or not moving of a cautious position on 
inventory and that is what has been built into our forecast as well.
 
Stacy Smith
 
Yes. To the question on internal inventory levels, I would just 
say, we ended 
Q4 with a little more inventory than I was expecting and a little higher than I 
would like. Two drivers there, we saw as I said a little bit weaker units, so 
we made up for us in rich mix, a little bit weaker unit and we saw yields get 
better
 
on 14 nanometer and the combination of that 
-
 
little more inventory 
leaving Q4 than I would like.
 
You will see it, on a dollar basis, will go up in Q1 as a result of Altera, so 
Altera will cause the inventory levels to go up some, but when you look at it 
from a business standpoint, I think we will work through the inventory we 
have, and when we get into the back half of the year, we will bring inventory 
levels down.
 
Ross Seymore
 
Great. Thank you.
 
Stacy Smith
 
Welcome.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next 
question comes from the line of Blayne Curtis of 
Barclays. Your line is now open.
 
Blayne Curtis
 
Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Stacy, the roughly $400 million of 
Altera, I do not expect you to report it going forward. Just curious how does 
that 
fit into reportable buckets just kind of levels that if the first quarter out.
 
Then secondly, could you just talk about how you are integrating or not 
integrating Altera. I think I have kind of heard both. It sounds like you 
wanted to keep the sales force 
separate, but just curious, kind of, where 
does that report under and how much integration are you going to do?
 
Stacy Smith
 
Sure. I will take the accounting question. Then I will ask Brian to give his 
insight and philosophy on the whole integration.
 
On the
 
reportable segment, so actually I do plan to give you full visibility 
into Altera. It is a relatively small business for us. It does not hit the SEC 
reporting requirement, so it does not come across that threshold, but we 
just feel strongly that based on 
transparency and the size of the acquisition, 
we want to give you transparency, so you will see that in our financials going 
forward.
 
I will let Brian answer the integration question.
 
Brian Krzanich
 
Yes. From an integration standpoint, I think what you hav
e seen we have 
done with McAfee as we have integrated it into Intel Security and you saw 
the great results that we have shown in the fourth quarter, those are 
somewhat an example of what happens as you integrate and you really get 
to focus on the business 
at a much higher level.
 
Same thing for Altera, we plan to fully integrate it. It is going to look like a 
business group, no different than say CCG that has PCs and modems, 
phones or DCG that has Data Center. It is called PSG, Programmable 
Solutions Group. 
It reports directly to me and it will be fully integrated.
 
The sales force at the beginning, because the sales tend to be a bit more 
technical and a bit more a field sales engineering
-
type role, we are keeping 
it separate, but that is something we are goin
g to continue to evaluate, but 
the organization, the engineering, already were in the first two weeks. We 
had 
-
 
really for me, I am really pleased with the level of integration and help 
that we have done to get products and the roadmaps focused and integra
ted 
into our internal systems, so you should expect it to be fully integrated.
 
Stacy Smith
 
Thanks, Blayne. Operator, I think we have time for two more questions.
 
Operator
 
Perfect. Our next question comes from the line of David Wong of Wells 
Fargo. Your lin
e is now open.
 
David Wong
 
Thanks very much. What might we expect in the way or new 14 nanometer 
Data Center processors family in 2016?
 
Brian Krzanich
 
Let see. I think, we have got Broadwells, Xeon. It is going to launch in the 
first half here of '16, so th
at will be the first of the 14 nanometer or the next 
14 nanometer into 2016, is that E5 on Broadwell. The rest of them, we have 
not put any other dates out there yet, so Skylake SKUs and so forth.
 
David Wong
 
Okay. Great. My follow
-
up, with startup and othe
r charges, do you expect 
memory output in China in 2016 will be a positive or negative contribution to 
EPS and should we expect a positive contribution in 2017 from the China 
fab?
 
Stacy Smith
 
Let me think. There will be some pretty significant costs and th
at is in the 
gross margin reckon associated with the startup of the factory in China. We 
will be in production in the back half of the year, but we are just ramping 
production. I think if you were just looking at the six
-
month time period, you 
would say it
 
is kind of negative and you can see it in the gross margin it is a 
slight negative on the gross margin.
 
It does not change the fact that we make these investments and then we 
get this, what I would say tremendous long
-
term benefit out of making that 
investments, so that does not 
-
 
I do not want you to take from that that we 
are somehow less bullish on the transformational capabilities of what the 
team has managed to pull off for 3D XPoint, because we are actually quite 
bullish on that.
 
David Wong
 
Grea
t. Thanks.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our final question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri of 
Cowen & Company. Your line is now open.
 
Timothy Arcuri
 
Thanks a lot. I just had a question again on the depreciation change. I know, 
Stacy, you talked about it being
 
due to reuse, but I guess relative to just the 
fundamental cadence of the migrations, your intent has been to get sort of 
back on a normal Morris low cadence. I just want to make sure that is still 
the case?
 
Brian Krzanich
 
Yes. We have said that 
-
 
This is
 
Brian, by the way, not Stacy. 10 nanometers 
would be closer to that two
-
and
-
a
-
half years than two years that we would 
continue to strive to get back on two years. Some of that was as we go to 
the fine 7 nanometers, what the complexity technology looks lik
e, whether 
UV is ready or not, but absolutely we are pushing to get back on that two
-
year cadence.
 
Stacy Smith
 
Yes. I would just add, please do not take the accounting of the depreciable 
life to be somehow signal that we are letting our foot off the gas on
 
process 
technology cadence and process technology leadership. That is the heartbeat 
of the company and we are driving it hard. The accounting just as looking at 
how long that equipment is economically viable in our factories and it is 
pretty clearly five 
years as we go forward.
 
Timothy Arcuri
 
Right. Okay. Got it. Then just last question, so on the mobile group, at the 
Investor Day you talked about another $800 million improvement this year 
in the losses. Is this still the target and maybe talk about the pr
ogress there 
and whether we could see any momentum for smartphone this year with 
7360? Thanks a lot.
 
Brian Krzanich
 
It is absolutely still the target. That has not changed one bit. It is a little 
early in the year to talk about progress. I would tell you t
hat we have a 
large percentage of $800 million, already I will call it planned out.
 
In other words, we have projects. We know what we need to do, introduce 
products, align which SKUs are coming and move products on to that, so I 
would say a large percentag
e of that is well
-
planned through the year, but it 
is throughout the year, so I cannot tell I have already get $200 million of it 
or something like that, not here in the second, third week of the year.
 
7360, it is out. It is sampling, the customers are goi
ng through their 
validations now at the systems, where they are building up systems and out 
testing them on networks and so forth. As far as the launches of those 
systems and the announcements, those are always up to our customers and 
we do not make sure t
hat we are the ones announcing that.
 
Then what we have told you is that, what is even as important is that we are 
on a yearly cadence now of our modem technology and we are very 
confident on that as well for the next set of modems that comes out after 
the 
7360.
 
Stacy Smith
 
Thanks, Tim. All right, thank you all for joining us today. Sabrina, you can 
please go ahead and wrap up the call.

documents, they're available on our investor website, intc.com. The CFO 
earnings presentation is also available in the webcast window for those 
joining us online.
 
I'm joined today by Brian Krzanich, our CEO, and Bob Swan, our Ch
ief 
Financial Officer. In a moment, we'll hear brief remarks from both of them, 
followed by the Q&A.
 
Before we begin, let me remind everyone that today's discussion contains 
forward
-
looking statements based on the environment as we currently see 
it, and as
 
such, does include risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our 
press release for more information on the specific risk factors that could 
cause actual results to differ materially.
 
A brief reminder that this quarter we have provided both GAAP and non
-
GAA
P financial measures. Today, we will be speaking to the non
-
GAAP 
financial measures when describing our consolidated results. The CFO 
commentary and earnings release, available on intc.com, include the full 
GAAP and non
-

Thanks, Mark.
 
The third quarter exceeded our expectations with revenue $16.1 billion, 
which is $400 million better than our outlook. Operating income of $5.6 
billion was more than $700 million bett
er than our outlook.
 
Our data
-
centric businesses grew 15% year over year, reaching 45% of our 
revenue, proving that Intel is becoming a data
-
centric company. The fiscal 
discipline that Bob and I have talked about is delivering results even faster 
than we h
ad forecasted while simultaneously allowing us to focus more on 
innovation in our key growth segments.
 
Revenue grew 2% or 6% after adjusting for the McAfee transaction. 
Operating income grew 8% and earnings per share grew 26%, both reaching 
all
-
time record
s. Add it all together, and this was a remarkable quarter in 
what is shaping up to be a remarkable year.
 
Our strategy is to be the driving force of the data revolution across 
technologies and industries. Our data
-
centric businesses are the company's 
growth
 
engine. Individually, these businesses provide great value to our 
customers. Collectively, they're solving our customers' problems in a way 
that no individual business or product could. We've built a collection of 
capabilities that is unmatched. At the sa
me time, our PC business remains 
central to our success. It's a source of great profit, cash flow, scale, and 
intellectual property.
 
We've made great progress in both our data
-
centric and PC
-
centric 
businesses over the last few months, and I'll share a few
 
important 
milestones that illustrate that progress.
 
We're going to start with CCG [Client Computing Group], which produced 
exceptional results despite a declining PC TAM. PC market conditions 
continued to improve, and we achieved record Core i5 plus Core 
i7 client 
mix. Our focus on an annual beat rate of innovation and thoughtful 
segmentation combined with an investment strategy designed to produce 
results, even in a declining market, is paying off.
 
We're especially excited about the launch of our latest 8
th Generation Core 
processor, code named Coffee Lake. The Coffee Lake family includes our first 
six
-
core desktop CPU. And it's our best gaming processor to date, with up to 
50% better performance than the competition on top game titles. We're on 
track to s
hip our first low
-
volume 10
-
nanometer part by the end of the year. 
That will be followed by the initial ramp in the first half of 2018, with both 
high volume and system availability in the second half of 2018. We shipped 
our first modem into the auto indus
try, and our modem revenue was up 
37% in total over last year.
 
Moving on to our data
-
centric businesses, DCG [Data Center Group] revenue 
grew 7% in Q3 and remains on track for high single
-
digit growth for the 
year. We saw strong cloud growth, outgrew the c
omm service provider end 
market and, while the enterprise decline moderated sequentially, we still see 
workloads moving to the cloud.
 
Cloud and comm service provider revenue combined is nearly 60% of DCG 
revenue now. In less than three months, we've had mo
re than 200 Xeon 
scalable OEM systems begin production shipments, and our customers 
across all of our segments are beginning deployments that will continue to 
ramp in Q4 and through 2018.
 
In our Internet of Things business, revenue was up 23%, with strengt
h 
across the retail, industrial, and video segments. We also continue to build 
momentum in the vehicle infotainment market, winning designs from our 
competitors at leading automakers.
 
Early in the quarter, we closed the Mobileye transaction a full four mon
ths 
ahead of schedule. So far this year, Mobileye has won 14 ADAS [Advanced 
Driver Assistance Systems] designs across 14 automakers, a pace well 
ahead of the 12 wins they recorded all of last year. These designs provide 
for typical features like automated 
emergency braking, lane keeping, and 
adaptive cruise control. But several also include next
-
step functionality like 
highway autonomous driving. We're also winning marquee designs for Level 
3 and higher levels of autonomy, including our strategic partnershi
p with 
BMW and Fiat Chrysler.
 
Most recently, we announced that Waymo's newest vehicles, the self
-
driving 
Chrysler Pacifica Hybrid minivans, feature Intel
-
based technologies for 
sensor processing, general compute, and connectivity. With 3 million miles 
of r
eal
-
world driving, Waymo cars with Intel technology inside have already 
processed more self
-
driving car miles than any other autonomous fleet on 
the U.S. roads.
 
Intel and Mobileye provide the auto industry with unmatched product 
breadth, the architectural 
flexibility to support open and closed 
implementations, and technology leadership. Our progress in just a few 
short months illustrates the benefits of our combination. And together, we 
can deliver the promise of autonomous driving in a safer, collision
-
fre
e 
future.
 
Let's move on now to memory and FPGAs. Our memory business grew 37% 
over last year and operating margin improved significantly, as Fab 68, our 
Dalian factory, continued to beat both its ramp rate and yield goal. Fab 68 
accounted for more than hal
f of our supply in a quarter where more than 
70% of the total bits were 3D NAND.
 
Our memory innovation and technology leadership is having an impact. We 
shipped the industry's first 64
-
layer data center SSDs and have a strong 
Optane design win pipeline. Th
at leadership technology has also resulted in 
strong customer interest in long
-
term supply agreements, and we've already 
signed two such agreements. Bob will share more about our approach, but 
this is an important step that will mitigate the short
-
term cas
h flow impact of 
ramping our memory capacity.
 
And finally, in our FPGA business, revenue was up 10% over last year, with 
growth in the data center, embedded, and automotive segments, where 
we're ramping designs like the Level 3 autonomous 2018 Audi A8 and 
DENSO's stereo vision system. Strength in these segments was partially 
offset by continued weakness in comms infrastructure. Our design win 
revenue value was up more than 10% in the third quarter, the highest level 
in more than three years.
 
This business i
s central to our success in artificial intelligence. In Q3, 
Microsoft announced that it would use our 14
-
nanometer Stratix 10 FPGAs 
for its accelerated deep learning platform that's code named Project 
Brainwave. And as part of a broadening engagement betwe
en our 
companies, Alibaba is using Intel FPGAs to power the acceleration of the 
service of Alibaba Cloud.
 
We've made tremendous progress in AI and advanced computing 
technologies over the last few months. In addition to our FPGAs and 
autonomous 
driving wins, we launched the Movidius Myriad X, the world's 
first vision processing unit with a dedicated neural compute engine to deliver 
artificial intelligence capabilities to the edge in a low
-
power, high
-
performance package.
 
We also achieved new rese
arch milestones, as Intel scientists pursue 
exciting emerging forms of compute. We delivered a 17
-
qubit 
superconducting test chip for quantum computing to our research partner, 
QuTech. And we'll follow that up with a 49
-
qubit test chip by the end of the 
ye
ar. We also unveiled the Loihi, a self
-
learning test chip that mimics the 
brain's basic mechanics and makes machine learning faster and more 
efficient.
 
Later this quarter, we'll ship the Nervana neural network processor, the 
industry's first commercially a
vailable processor of its kind. I also announced 
last week that Facebook is working in close collaboration with us, sharing 
their technical insights as we bring this new generation of AI hardware to 
market.
 
Together, these accomplishments reinforce several
 
things for me. First, Intel 
is the leader in AI inference from the core of the data center to autonomous 
vehicles out to the edge devices where low power is especially critical. 
Second, artificial intelligence takes many forms and will require computing 
s
olutions that are tailored for the workload, the environment, and the user, 
rather than a one
-
size
-
fits
-
all. And third, our investments and pipeline of 
innovation position us to lead for years to come.
 
We had a quarter any CEO would be proud of. And I'd li
ke to take a moment 
to remember our former CEO and my friend, Paul Otellini. Paul had an 
enormous impact on the industry and this company, and his Intel family will 
miss him. He would be proud of our growing momentum, and it's an 
important part of his lega
cy.
 
Wrapping things up, I'm excited about both our progress and our prospects. 
And we're competing aggressively for our $260 billion TAM, the largest 
opportunity in our history, with lots of room to grow market segment share. 
In some of our segments, we're
 
facing new or resurgent competitors. In 
other segments, we are the new competitor. But in all cases, competition 
brings out the very best in our company, as our third quarter results 
demonstrate.
 
We're now well ahead of our commitments we made to you in J
anuary. Our 
transformation is accelerating. And we're raising our full
-
year expectations 
for revenue by $700 million and for operating profit by $900 million, our 
third consecutive increase this year. This puts us solidly on track to deliver 
the best year 
in the company's history for the second year in a row.
 
And with that great news, I'd like to hand it over to Bob.

Intel Corp.
 
Thanks, Brian, and good afternoon.
 
This was an excellent quarter for Intel. Versus the expectations we set out at
 
the beginning of the quarter, our revenue is better, our gross margins were 
stronger, and our spending was lower. As Brian said, we're on track for 
another record in 2017.
 
Revenue in the quarter was $16.1 billion, up 6% year over year excluding 
McAfee, an
d we achieved record earnings. Operating income was $5.6 
billion, up 8% year over year, and EPS was $1.01, up 26% year over year.
 
From a capital allocation perspective, we closed the Mobileye transaction and 
funded a significant portion of the purchase pri
ce through the sale of non
-
core assets, including reducing our position in ASML and proceeds from the 
partial exit of McAfee.
 
Additionally, we signed long
-
term NAND supply agreements, providing more 
than $2 billion in prepayments through 2018, significantl
y improving free 
cash flow for our memory business. We generated $6.3 billion in cash flow 
from operations, and we returned $2.4 billion to shareholders.
 
At our Analyst Day in February, we talked about our strategy to transform 
from a PC
-
centric company to
 
a data
-
centric company. Our Q3 results 
demonstrated continued momentum in our transformation. Intel's data
-
centric businesses, those outside of the PC segment, grew 15% year over 
year and now represent 45% of our revenue, up from approximately 30% in 
2012
. This collection of businesses is well positioned to capitalize on industry 
trends, create great value for our customers, and represents the company's 
growth engine going forward.
 
Our PC
-
centric businesses generated flat revenue in the quarter and 
improve
d operating margin by over 3 points. The CCG team continues to 
execute extremely well in a declining PC TAM environment. Our focus on 
performance
-
leading products and a smart segmentation strategy is 
working. This business provides scale, funds IP, and gen
erates a significant 
portion of the company's profits and cash flows.
 
Moving to earnings, we generated significant EPS expansion in the quarter, 
up 26% year on year. Our EPS improvement was driven by solid platform 
execution, strong growth from our adjacen
t products and businesses, and 
lower spending, resulting in $408 million growth in operating income. 
Additionally, we continued to monetize some of our ICAP [Intel Channel 
Alliance Program] portfolio positions, resulting in a gain of $0.13 per share.
 
We ma
de a commitment at the beginning of the year to reduce spending to 
30% of revenue by 2020 at the latest while continuing to invest in key 
growth areas and capabilities. We are making great progress. Total spending 
was down 6% year over year in the third qu
arter, with continued 
investments in our key priorities, including driving Moore's Law forward, 
artificial intelligence, and autonomous driving.
 
At the same time, we're executing with operational discipline and generating 
significant leverage from higher r
evenue growth. Our R&D spending as a 
percent of revenue was flat and our SG&A costs were down 3 points as we 
rationalize our marketing and sales programs and generate significant 
leverage in our G&A functions.
 
In addition, we've made changes to our co
-
mark
eting programs to provide 
more flexibility and efficiency to our customers. These changes resulted in a 
reduction in revenue of approximately $200 million during the quarter, 
reducing year
-
over
-
year growth in CCG by approximately 2 points and DCG 
by just o
ver 0.5 point, with a corresponding reduction in spending. These 
changes collectively have no impact on operating income. The impact of 
these changes will continue into Q4 at a slightly increased level.
 
On a full
-
year basis, we expect direct spending to be
 
approximately 33%, 
one point better than our prior guidance and down over two full points from 
last year.
 
Let me touch briefly on our segment performance on slide 5. The Client 
Computing Group had another outstanding quarter. Revenue of $8.9 billion 
was f
lat year over year, and operating margins grew by 3 points. Flat 
revenue was driven by client ASPs up 7%, unit volume down 7%, and our 
adjacency business up 15%, partially offset by the changes to our co
-
marketing programs. We saw typical Q3 inventory buil
d ahead of the holiday 
season, and we believe the worldwide PC supply chain is operating at 
healthy levels.
 
This segment had another quarter of significant profit growth, with operating 
income growing 8% from strong Core mix, continued improvement in 14
-
na
nometer unit costs, and lower spending.
 
The Data Center Group had revenue of $4.9 billion, up 7% year over year, 
and operating income of $2.3 billion grew 7%. Q3 operating margin was 
46%. As Brian mentioned earlier, we had strong growth in both the comms 
a
nd cloud service provider segments, which are nearly 60% of our DCG 
revenue. Overall unit volume was up 4%, ASPs were up 2%, and 
adjacencies grew 16%. We launched Purley in Q3, and in less than three 
months we've had more than 200 OEM systems begin product
ion shipments.
 
Revenue scale from leadership products and spending leverage and 
efficiency drove strong operating income growth for the business. We expect 
DCG to meet our full
-
year expectations of high single
-
digit growth and 
operating margin percent in t
he low 40%.
 
The IoT, NSG, and PSG business segments are becoming a larger component 
of our overall business, growing 25% year over year. Our Internet of Things 
business achieved record revenue of $849 million, up 23% year over year, 
driven by strength in i
ndustrial and video and continued momentum in our 
retail business. Operating profit was $146 million, down 24% year over year, 
from continued investments in the automotive segment.
 
We closed the Mobileye transaction in early August, four months sooner than
 
we expected. The Mobileye team executed extremely well in the third 
quarter and exceeded our expectations, with $82 million in revenue and $39 
million in operating income. Going forward, results for the Mobileye 
acquisition will be included in our All Oth
er segment. Increases in spending 
in this segment will correspond with reductions in the IoTG segment as we 
realize cost synergies from this acquisition.
 
Our memory business had record revenue of $891 million, up 37% year over 
year, with strong demand from
 
data center SSD solutions and demand 
signals outpacing supply. This segment had an operating loss of $52 million, 
an improvement of $82 million versus last year.
 
Our memory fab in Dalian continues to make great progress. Yields continue 
to 
improve, and unit costs are well ahead of expectations. The core NAND 
business continues to be profitable, and we expect the memory business as 
a whole to be profitable in 2018, both ahead of our prior estimates.
 
The Programmable Solutions Group had revenu
e of $469 million, up 10% 
year over year, driven by strength in advanced products, data center, 
automotive, and military. Operating profit was $113 million, up 45% year 
over year. We're making good progress in realizing cost synergies with the 
integration 
of this business.
 
Moving to slide 8, our cash position of $17.5 billion at September 30 is 
basically unchanged from the beginning of the year, but we've had lots of 
moving pieces during the year. First, we have generated $7.2 billion in free 
cash flow year
-
to
-
date, and we've returned $7.4 billion to shareholders 
through the form of dividends of $3.8 billion and share repurchases of $3.6 
billion, including $1.3 billion and $1.1 billion respectively in the quarter.
 
Second, as we mentioned earlier, we closed M
obileye in the third quarter for 
$14.5 billion in cash and funded over 50% of the purchase price from the 
sale of non
-
core assets during the year, including McAfee and the sale of 
ASML shares. Earlier in the year, we received $924 million from the sale of 
51% stake in McAfee. And in the quarter, McAfee repaid the promissory 
notes of $2.2 billion and issued a dividend of $735 million.
 
Third, we expect to generate $1.5 billion to $2 billion more free cash flow 
versus where we were at the beginning of the year
. The additional free cash 
flow was driven by higher earnings, lower CapEx, customer prepayments on 
supply agreements, partially offset by increases to working capital 
associated with stronger growth and NSG and modem momentum.
 
Based on these factors, we'r
e raising our full
-
year revenue guidance by $700 
million to $62 billion, operating income guidance by $900 million to $18.8 
billion, and EPS guidance by $0.25 to $3.25 per share. The improvement in 
revenue outlook is primarily driven by higher expectations
 
of the PC 
business and continued momentum in memory. The improvement in 
operating margin is primarily driven by our increased revenue outlook and 
lower spending. The increase in EPS is driven by higher expectations of 
revenue coupled with gains on the sal
e of our equity investments.
 
And on slide 11, as we look to the fourth quarter of 2017, we are forecasting 
the midpoint of the revenue range at $16.3 billion, up 3% year over year 
excluding McAfee. We expect operating income of $5.2 billion with gross 
marg
ins flat year over year and spending, as a percentage of revenue, to be 
down approximately 2 points. We expect EPS of $0.86, driven by operating 
margin expansion and higher revenue.
 
2017 is shaping up to be a record year for Intel. We feel great about wher
e 
we are nine months into our three
-
year transformation. Since January, we 
have raised our revenue outlook by $2.5 billion, our operating income by 
$1.7 billion, and our EPS by $0.45.
 
At the same time, we are investing to compete and win in an expanded 
mar
ket. Our PC
-
centric team continues to operate very well in a down 
market and our data
-
centric businesses are up double digits collectively, as 
we continue to transform the company to power the cloud and smart 
connected devices.
 
With that, let me turn it ba
ck over to Mark.

Our first question comes from Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. Your line 
is now open.
 
Ross C. Seymore

Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
 
Hey, guys. Thanks for letting me ask a question. BK, 
a longer
-
term one for 
you, you rattled off a number of AI advancements that Intel is having, 
whether it be on the Nervana side or the Stratix side. Can you talk a little bit 
about the competitive environment in there? You mentioned that it's not 
going to b
e one size fits all. But you could give a little bit of how Intel does 
have an advantage versus some of the early movers in that space. And then 
perhaps, more importantly, when will we externally as investors be able to 
start to see the financial benefits 
of these new products?
 
Brian M. Krzanich 
-
 
Intel Corp.
 
Hi, Ross. So let's talk about this. We can kind of break this down. So, first, 
we are already seeing the benefits of AI in that. Remember, as I said, we 
lead in inference, which is the actual applicati
on of artificial intelligence, and 
we're continuing to really grow in that space.
 
I think AI, if you take a look at it in general, machine learning, it's the 
smallest segment to a workload if you look at the data center, but the 
fastest growing. So you're 
going to see it continue to become a bigger and 
bigger portion of our business. You're seeing the effects in our numbers 
already around Xeon, Xeon Scalable, the FPGAs; we talked about the 
Microsoft Brainwave launch that's occurring. So those products you'r
e going 
to see, I'll call those more of our traditional products. And also at the lower 
end, outside the data center, things like Movidius and now Mobileye, you're 
seeing those hit our P&Ls as well real
-
time now as we speak.
 
The other products like Nervana
, you'll start to see really more towards the 
back end probably of 2018 from a P&L perspective. If you take a look at 
Nervana, it actually 

 
we get our first silicon out. It will be handed out as 
test silicon. We have a yearly cadence of products, and so I
 
expect the first 
substantiations to be more people figuring out how to use it. It won't be a 
big impact. But as we go through next year and move on beyond that and 
get the second generation and beyond, that will grow, we believe, quite 
considerably.
 
And t
hen products like Loihi, which is our neuromorphic, are same things. 
The part we've put out so far is really a chip for people to begin to use and 
learn how to program with neuromorphic, which is a very different type of 
machine learning. It lets you learn
 
at hundreds of times faster rates than 
traditional, I'll say, GPUs and CPUs, especially around visual learning. Those 
as well you'll start to see late next year and beyond as people really begin to 
learn how to program with these. So seeing it already and
 
those newer 
products really think late 2018 and beyond before they really start to hit 
P&Ls.
 
Ross C. Seymore

Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
 
Great, thanks for that detail. And then the follow
-
up question I had was 
actually for Bob, and it's on the OpEx s
ide, and congrats on the great 
operating leverage in the quarter. As we think about the ways you can get 
that operating leverage, in the past Intel seems to have focused mainly on 
keeping the OpEx relatively flat and then revenue growth driving that 
levera
ge. But in the quarter and in the guide that you just delivered, it looks 
like OpEx is down about 6% year over year. Conceptually, as we go into the 
next couple years, how do you think investors should think about the 
balance of delivering that cadence up 
to the 30% mark that you're looking 
for over the next couple years? Is it more revenue growth, or are you indeed 
going to be cutting the absolute level of OpEx?
 
Robert H. Swan 
-
 
Intel Corp.
 
Ross, great question. First, as you mentioned, we had great progre
ss in the 
third quarter. We started the year at a spending level which was a little over 
35% of revenue, and we came into 2017 saying that we would get that 
down to roughly 34%.
 
Reflected in our guidance is it will be closer to 33%, so we're delivering wel
l 
ahead of our expectations, which have been a function of the two things you 
highlighted: one, much stronger growth; and two, lower spending levels. 
And those lower spending levels from the first half of this year to the second 
half are a function of cont
inuing to look at every dollar that we spend, 
whether it's R&D, whether it's sales and marketing, or whether it's G&A, and 
making sure that those dollars are allocated towards the biggest growth 
opportunities, and we are not to redeploy that capital or to 
get it out of the 
ecosystem. So our first half to second half spend levels will be down roughly 
$700 million on a business that will be roughly $2.5 billion bigger in the 
second half versus the first half.
 
So we're making great progress on making real trad
e
-
offs on our spending 
levels and getting the benefit of stronger growth, and we expect the 
combination of those two to continue as we go forward.

Our next question is from 
Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein. Your line is now 
open.
 
Stacy Aaron Rasgon

Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. First, I wanted to ask a little bit 
about the revenue drivers. Revenue upside for the year and I guess 
marchin
g up for three quarters, but it continues to look to be the same 
trend, almost entirely from PC and memory. In the meantime, this is, in 
your own words, your biggest server refresh in a decade, and yet we're not 
seeing any upside. We're doing 7% year over 
year pretty much for the full 
year, which I guess I would classify as barely high single digit. We're not 
really seeing meaningful ASP increases from mix as Purley ramps. I was 
wondering if you could just give us a view on I guess your expectations for 
dat
a center, where it's coming in, why we're not seeing more upside from 
the Purley ramp versus what we've seen from prior platform introductions, 
and whether or not 7% actually would qualify as high single digits by your 
definition.
 
Brian M. Krzanich 
-
 
Intel
 
Corp.
 
I'll start and Bob can jump in, Stacy. First, because you've got a couple 
questions in there, what I would tell you is that the Purley ramp has just 
really started. It starts with the big cloud service providers. You saw Google 
talk about it a coupl
e weeks ago. You saw Microsoft talk about it earlier this 
week. Those ramps are just beginning. I talked about the 200 design wins or 
design
-
ins at customers. Those are just starting to come out, so we're really 
early. These ramps, remember because we have
 
to 

 
it will go through the 
cloud service providers and the Tier 2 cloud service providers, then on into 
comms and eventually into enterprise as well. This is going to take a year or 
more. So I think it's early to make this judgment. The ramp is right wit
hin 
the range we predicted it to be from a ramp of that product
 
The second part of your question, is 7% high single digits, I'll just make it 
simple and say look, if you look mathematically, I think it would meet a 
minima of high single digits, but it's ce
rtainly not necessarily where we're 
targeting to get to, but it's a high single digit number. I'm not going to 

 
the 
math doesn't lie.
 
Stacy Aaron Rasgon

Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC
 
Thank you.
 
Robert H. Swan

Intel Corp.
 
I'll just maybe add a little 
bit, I think, on the first part of your question. 
Overall, growth for the year relative to the expectations back in January, 
revenue will be up $2.5 billion. Obviously, PC is a significant part of that. 
Memory is growing faster. IoT is growing faster. PSG 
and data center, PSG 
faster in the second half versus the first half and DCG in line with our full
-
year outlook at the beginning of the year to be high single digits. So real 
good strength on clients, on memory, on IoT, and in line with the other 
businesse
s.
 
The other thing I'd just offer to follow up on Brian's commentary on DCG 
growth, maybe two things. One, we started out at 6% in Q1. We were at 9% 
in Q2. We're at 7% in Q3 off a real tough comp last year of double
-
digit 
growth in the third quarter. So I 
would say from a top line perspective, we're 
right in line with the guide that we gave at the beginning of the year.
 
And secondly and as importantly, our operating margins have continued to 
grow significantly quarter on quarter through the course of the ye
ar, with 
46% operating margins in the third quarter. And we told you early on, 
despite a relatively slow start, the fact that operating margins for DCG to be 
above 40% for the year, and we're well on track to hit that important metric 
as well. So nine mont
hs through the year, great start to the year for us and 
DCG in line with our expectations and building momentum as we exit the 
year.
 
Mark H. Henninger

Did you have a follow
-
up, Stacy?
 
Stacy Aaron Rasgon 
-
 
Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC
 
I do, 
thank you. I wanted to ask about gross margins really quick. So 
revenue was up 6% I guess year over year excluding McAfee. Gross margins 
are down like 90 bps year over year. I was hoping you could give us some 
color on the drivers of that shift. And in par
ticular, how should we think 
about the trajectory exiting the year into 2018, puts and takes on gross 
margins as we go into next year, given what we've seen this year?
 
Robert H. Swan 
-
 
Intel Corp.
 
On your first part, we laid out for the year 63% gross marg
ins. And we're 
pretty much in line with that throughout the first nine months, and our 
outlook for Q4 is another 63%, so in line with the full
-
year outlook, which is 
in the high end of our historical guide range. So we feel pretty good about 
where we are.
 
For the dynamics underneath the covers, the trends have been fairly 
consistent: volume leverage with good scale going through the fabs; ASPs 
modestly better, much better in the first half on easier comps, slightly better 
in the second half on tougher comps
. Unit cost continues to come down. The 
ramp costs associated with 10
-
nanometer are lower.
 
And offsetting those, you really have three things going on. One, we have a 
high growth in our adjacent businesses of memory and modem that weigh 
on 

 
that are a big
 
contributor to improved earnings, but they weigh on our 
gross margin. Secondly, we have higher engineering samples as we go into 
the fourth quarter. And third, the co
-
marketing change that I mentioned in 
the prepared remarks, Stacy, that has no impact on 
operating income but a 
modest impact on gross margin but offset by lower spending levels.
 
So you take those all into account and they've delivered solid Q3 dynamics, 
solid Q4 outlook. And the one change between Q3 and Q4 is primarily 
attributable to the mi
x of the higher
-
growth adjacency businesses. Those 
trends and those dynamics, we'll talk much more about 2018 in January, but 
those trends have been fairly consistent for the last four quarters.

is now open.
 
Blayne Curtis

Barclays Capital, Inc.
 
Hey, thanks for taking my 
question. Bob, I just wanted to go back to some 
of the comments you made. In DCG, op margin was up a ton. It's actually 
above your full
-
year, so just curious where those cuts came from. And then 
as you look forward, I know you're not going to forecast for 
next year, but is 
there any reason why the spending would go up and down from here?
 
Robert H. Swan 
-
 
Intel Corp.
 
The first half gross margins 

 
I should say operating margins were lower, 
second half much stronger. Fundamentally, it's less about cuts, to be
 
honest 
with you. It's more about continuing to grow the top line. continuing to get 
ASP improvements or compensated for the performance that we're 
delivering, and modestly lower unit costs. So the combination of those three 
are getting really good leverag
e and allow us to expand operating margins 
while we continue to invest in obviously Xeon but also in artificial 
intelligence. So that's what's driven the first half to second half dynamics. As 
I indicated, we started out the year saying that we were highly
 
confident 
we'd be above 40% for the year, and that's how it's played out during the 
course of the year.
 
Blayne Curtis 
-
 
Barclays Capital, Inc.
 
Great. And then I wanted to go back to the question on AI and inference, 
Brian. I was wondering if you could jus
t comment on 

 
today I think you 
said it was small. I was just curious. Out of the cloud spend, how much is 
inference today? And when you look at future workloads driving server units, 
where could that be in a couple years?
 
Brian M. Krzanich 
-
 
Intel Corp.
 
Sure, we don't separate out inference. So what we said is simply in the past 
publicly that AI is one of the smallest workloads and in fact one of the 
fastest growing. We haven't broken out 

 
beyond just saying here's what 
cloud is growing at and here's wha
t comms and here's what enterprise, we 
don't break out by workload. And there's a variety of reasons for that. Part 
of it, it's sometimes hard. The mixture of what 

 
when somebody goes out 
and builds a rack, what is it going into? How much of its workload 
is really 
being used by AI? Anybody who tells you exactly what that number is, is just 
wrong, to be honest with you.
 
So it's very hard for us to say with precision that X percent of our units went 
into AI workloads because it's rare that a rack is purely A
I except for rare 
cases. But we know that it's small, just by the type of interactions we have, 
but also fast
-
growing and one of the biggest areas of interest.

Yeah, good afternoon, guys. Thanks for letting me ask a question. 
Congratulations on the strong r
esults. Bob, maybe I can just ask Blayne's 
DCG op margin question a little bit differently. In the calendar third quarter, 
you actually I think had revenue up about $500 million sequentially in that 
business roughly, and operating profits grew by about $60
0 million 
sequentially. Can you just help us understand what drove that dynamic? 
Were there any one
-
times? And just given how strong the operating margin 
is, I know you've reaffirmed for the full year. But is the Q3 level the new 
norm we should start basin
g operating profit off of, or was there something 
specific in Q3 that drove the op margin leverage above 100% sequentially?
 
Robert H. Swan 
-
 
Intel Corp.
 
No one
-
timers. In one sense, John, it's no real surprises for us. We 
anticipated growing throughout the
 
year. We anticipated higher ASPs, i.e., 
sequential ASPs being a little bit stronger, and that would drive incremental 
operating income. And some of the benefits of just a lower overall G&A 
spending for the company is benefiting all the different P&Ls. The
 
G&A is 
actually lower. So that's what's really been driving the improvement 
sequentially.
 
As you can tell from our full
-
year guide, there will be more of the same in 
Q4 relative to Q3. And then in terms of implications going forward, we got a 
great busine
ss. We've redefined the role we play in the data center business 
to be not a high 90% share player, but a 30% share player with lots of room 
to grow. And we expect that to be a continued important source of growth, 
both top and bottom line for the company.
 
The specifics around that we'll 
talk more about it in January.
 
John William Pitzer 
-
 
Credit Suisse Securities (

That's helpful. Maybe for my follow
-
up for Brian, Brian, I know this is not a 
big part of your growth strategy going forward. But as you mentioned in 
your prepared comments, CCG is still very important to scale advantages, to 
profitability, to free cash flow, to your ability to invest in growth markets. 
And that's been a business th
at's been sort of remarkably stable over the 
last four or five quarters. It's grown over the last couple of years, in part 
because we've had relatively easy compares in the PC market. So I'm kind of 
curious, as you think about this business over the next c
all it four to eight 
quarters, how are you guys thinking about the corporate upgrade cycle or 
refresh cycle on PCs, the consumer refresh cycle, the gaming market, and I 
guess importantly, the modem business which is becoming a bigger and 
bigger part of thi
s business over time? Do think you can still keep this 
business sort of on a flat growth trajectory, or how are you thinking about 
it?
 
Brian M. Krzanich 
-
 
Intel Corp.
 
Sure. So you've captured it quite well. Let's just talk about this. We can talk 
about it 
from a unit standpoint and then we can talk about it from how has 
our business done. From a unit standpoint, the decline has certainly slowed 
down. If you go back a year or two ago, we were high single digits to low 
teens declines at times year over year f
rom a unit basis, and that slowed 
into the low single digits that we're seeing today, but we still are seeing a 
decline on a unit level.
 
And I always remind people, we've taken probably something like 25% of 
the annual units out of this business, yet grown
 
in that timeframe the 
profitability of that business significantly. So, that I think just talks about 
both the great execution in products and segmentation strategy and just the 
leadership that that team, at first with Navin Shenoy and now with Greg 
Bryan
t, have really delivered to the company.
 
So our view is, John, that if you take a long
-
term view, we see the pattern 
kind of stabilizing at about where it is. I think we'll come in here and there 
will be quarters when the units are up slightly, and there w
ill be other 
quarters when the units are down a little more slightly. But when we look at 
it over the long haul, they're probably going to be down those low single 
digits.
 
But we also see segments that are growing, that are very performance 
focused, which 
allow us opportunity. So you talked about them, gaming, 2
-
in
-
1 devices, thin and light, the Ultrabook as we like to think about it from 
the old, those products are continuing to see growth actually, and they are 
pushing that record Core i5, Core i7. They'r
e pushing the desire for Core i9, 
which is a new product we introduced. Those are what's driving the 
segmentation, the ASP uplift, and the increased profitability. We think to 
some level that trend will continue. How long? I'm not going to be that good 
a p
rognosticator, but certainly for the near
-
term future, we don't see this 
trend shifting very much.
 
John William Pitzer

Credit Suisse Securities (

And then, Brian, just on the modem side, 
your prepared comments, I think 
you said it was up 37% year over year. What's the sustainability of that 
business and your ability to continue to grow that business through 
penetration?
 
Brian M. Krzanich 
-
 
Intel Corp.
 
Yeah. I'm excited about the modem busi
ness. We, I think, really gotten a 
team together that is world
-
class. We believe we now are on a yearly 
cadence of world
-
class modems, which is really critical. That's a big hurdle to 
get that technology to where you can reliably put out on a yearly cadenc
e a 
world
-
class modem. We believe we're there now. We continue to increase 
the profitability or the efficiency of that organization, which we've always 
talked about in the past, and that's continued. So we think we can continue 
to both drive the technology
 
and continue to grow that business.

Our next question is from Romit Shah with Nomura. Your line is now open.
 
Romit Jitendra Sh
ah 
-
 
Nomura Instinet
 
Yes, thank you; great EPS growth. Bob, I think some of us who are more on 
the optimistic side definitely see a path to $4.00 of EPS, which makes Intel 
look compelling. I think some of the pushback though has been among value 
investors 
who look at free cash flow. And this year, for example, even with 
the equity gains, it looks like free cash flow is tracking down. So I know that 
this is an investment year, but how should people be thinking about free 
cash flow growth relative to EPS grow
th next year and maybe even 2019 as 
well?
 
Robert H. Swan 
-
 
Intel Corp.
 
First, in 2017, people ought to be thinking about free cash flow growth being 
$1.5 billion to $2 billion higher than what was primarily reflected in our 
guidance, because we're saying t
hat our current forecast will be much better 
than kind of where we started the year. And that improvement is really a 
function of three things; one, earnings growth, more operating earnings 
growth as opposed to the ICAP gains, but real solid operating earn
ings 
growth. Secondly, we reduced our CapEx outlook for the year from $12 
billion to $11.5 billion this year. And third, the long
-
term agreements that 
we signed in the year.
 
One of the benefits in what we're trying to do is really match our net capital 
dep
loyed in memory in conjunction with demand from strategic clients and 
partners, which has the effect of reducing the impact of the memory capital 
intensity on the free cash flow to the business that makes sense for our 
customers and makes sense for us. So 
we'll continue to look for those 
opportunities.
 
The biggest gap between our earnings performance and our free cash flow 
performance has been the higher capital associated with growth, number 
one, but in particular, memory. And we're really looking for oppo
rtunities to 
reduce our net capital deployed into memory, which will in turn grow free 
cash flow over time just closer and closer to our EPS growth.

And I guess along those lines, Brian, can you just give us an update 
on how 
you're thinking about CapEx at these levels and going forward?
 
Brian M. Krzanich 
-
 
Intel Corp.
 
Sure. I think in our statements and in the release, we showed you that we 
actually lowered CapEx by about $500 million for this year. We've talked 
about C
apEx and thinking about it as being in this range. I don't think we 
have anything else to say about 

 
it's pretty close right now. We're just 
focused on the execution into Q4 and prepping for our view for 2018. So I 
don't want to have any other discussion 
on CapEx until we get to the 
January timeframe right now for 2018.

Our next question is from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.

Thank 
you for taking my question and congrats on the great execution. The 
ASP trend in DCG was up 2% year over year, but it can be skewed by mix. 
So if we look at the four sub
-
segments, cloud, comm, service provider, 
enterprise adjacencies, if we just look at th
ose buckets as a silo as you ramp 
Skylake, did ASPs move higher in all of those sub
-
segments? I'm just trying 
to get a sense for how broad
-
based the value capture was.
 
Robert H. Swan 
-
 
Intel Corp.
 
I would just, without giving you all the specifics of ASPs 
by segment, I would 
just say the biggest driver of ASP improvement is really incremental 
performance. So as we continue to transition 

 
yes, we're still transitioning 
Haswell to Broadwell, which all else equal there are positive ASP implications 
as we tran
sition to Xeon Scalable and deliver higher performance. That 
growing mix of higher
-
performance products is the single biggest contributor 
to ASP. We're still in the early days, as Brian mentioned, in Xeon Scalable, 
but that is a high
-
performance product. A
nd we would expect that will share 
in the benefits of high performance for our clients with higher ASPs. But 
that's the biggest dynamic.

Great, thanks for the insights there. And the team has talked about 
accelerating t
he server roadmaps to be more closely aligned with the 
cadence of manufacturing technology migrations, I believe starting with the 
10
-
nanometer node. Can you guys just give us an update there?
 
Brian M. Krzanich 
-
 
Intel Corp.
 
Yes, think of it 

 
so 
first, absolutely you're right that we are going to move 
much more of our focus towards data center products coming first. It's not 
going to be the early part of 10
-
nanometer, though. You've got to look at 
the design cycles. And you make a decision like th
at, even if you make it last 
year, you'll start to see the effect at the back end of 10
-
nanometers and 
you'll really see it affect 7
-
nanometers, so not these early products on 10
-
nanometer, though. They were already in the hopper when we made that 
move.

Thanks, Harlan. And, operator, I think we have time for one more question.

And our last question comes from Matt Ramsay with Canaccord Genuity. 
Your line is now open.

Thank 
you very much. Good afternoon. Bob, I wanted to ask a little bit 
about G&A leverage. You talked about in the script and in some of the Q&A 
here some changes to the co
-
marketing programs and the like going forward 
in both the PC and in the data center busin
ess. Is there any way you could 
maybe bound for us the size of those and their contributions to what the run 
rate has been of overall OpEx, and what kind of opportunities there are 
potentially to further restructure those going forward? Thank you.
 
Robert H
. Swan 
-
 
Intel Corp.
 
Yes, just on the co
-
marketing program in particular, really what we're trying 
to do is retain the value of the Intel Inside brand, but also to be more 
flexible and align our spending in conjunction with our customers, more 
tailored pro
grams by customer to drive more efficient demand. That's the 
intent of what we're trying to accomplish, and we're pretty excited about the 
change.
 
The quantification of that strategy in essence in the third quarter was 
roughly $200 million that in essence 
shifted from spending to contra
-
revenue, so no impact on operating income dollars but roughly $200 million 
lower revenue, $200 million lower spending. And we expect that to be 
modestly higher as we go into the fourth quarter. So again, more effective 
and e
fficient way to spend our marketing dollars in conjunction with tailoring 
programs with the OEMs, that drives the change in the geography of how 
those dollars are reflected in our P&L but doesn't really impact our operating 
income.

Cana
ccord Genuity, Inc.
 
Thank you, that's really helpful. And then as a follow
-
up, Brian, in the 
automotive space, I think you mentioned 14 ADAS wins for Mobileye versus 
12 all of last year, and that's in the ADAS space. And you have some of your 
competitors m
aking quite bold announcements about wins towards 
autonomous driving programs long term. Maybe you could talk about how 
commitments are being made in ADAS versus autonomous and then how the 
acquisition that you've seen so far of Mobileye has maybe pulled s
ome of 
your computing assets into these conversations for longer
-
term 
autonomous. Thank you.
 
Brian M. Krzanich

Intel Corp.
 
Sure, that's a great question. So we mentioned that even out of those 14, 
many of those continue on up into Level 3, Level 4. The L
evel 5 work that 
you see out there is pretty far out there. And I'd tell you that's there's a lot 
of just experimental work going on there.
 
If I take a look at the bigger picture, which is what you're asking, this whole 
picture that we've been putting toge
ther is 

 
I said in the statement that 
individually these businesses are great. But when you put all these together 
into one package and you're able to walk into a customer with a complete 
solution, they're truly world
-
class and something nobody else can d
eliver.
 
So you're right, when we go in and we talk to somebody about autonomous 
driving in general, whether it's Level 2 bots, Level 3, Level 4, or Level 5, we 
bring with us a suite of products, depending on what kind of architecture. 
And what we're seeing
 
is different OEMs, different customers thinking about 
those architectures even differently across that spectrum. Some are thinking 
but by Level 5, I think my skills will be up. I want a closed system. I want to 
have much more control of the software. So w
e have a set of solutions we 
bring to them there. Some of them want to have more FPGAs for how they 
bring their software down onto the silicon earlier on.
 
But what we're able to do is bring our modems. We shipped, and we 
mentioned it in the release, our fi
rst automotive modem. So we're able to 
bring automotive modems all the way through 5G. Most of these car 
companies are having to build data centers, and not just data centers, 
centralized data centers, but really a data center architecture that goes all 
th
e way out with data and compute at the edge. You're going to want to be 
able to manipulate and transfer mapping, high
-
precision mapping, to the 
cars and data back from the cars to change those maps' construction and 
things like that. So we're building that
 
architecture, and we have the 
products and the talent to uniquely work with them all through that 
infrastructure.
 
And then you get out to the car again and we can bring the FPGAs, the 
Mobileye for sensor fusion or compute. We can put Xeons in there. And e
ach 
one of these discussions, they're all a bit different. They all have multiple 
phases as you go through 3, 4, and 5 on the levels. And what we're able to 
do is say you don't have to just take this one solution. This is not the only 
solution there is. Wh
at would you like to do? What best solves your problem 
in the most cost
-
effective, lowest power, efficient way? How much work do 
you want us to do in software and development versus how much work do 
you want to own and have IP within your company? And that
's changing, as 
we said, over time.
 
And that's part of also why we're building out that 100
-
car fleet. Amnon 
[Shashua] really has driven a vision that says it's one thing to bring foils to a 
meeting. It's another thing to bring a car and say now let's go o
ut and drive 
and show you how all of these fit together. So all of that is 

 
this package 
that we have is unique and it's resonating quite well as we walk in to the 
various car OEMs. And I'm out there with them in various modes almost 
every week, every oth
er week. Amnon is out. We're all talking about a 
complete package.

Brian M. Krzanich

Intel Corp.
 
Thanks, Mark.
 
Q2 was an outstanding quarter in which we set a number of records. We 
beat the expe
ctations we set in April, primarily as a result of stronger 
desktop and notebook microprocessor volume, and set a second quarter 
revenue record. We're executing well to our priorities, and after adjusting for 
the McAfee transaction, revenue grew 14% year o
ver year while non
-
GAAP 
operating margin grew 30%. Our data
-
centric businesses were up 16% year 
over year.
 
Technology and performance leadership are fueling our results. And in Q2, 
we extended our leadership with new breakthrough products in client 
computi
ng, the data center and memory. With industry
-
leading products and 
strong first half results, we're on a clear path for another record year.
 
As we shared in February and reinforced in April, our strategy is to make 
Intel the driving force of the data revol
ution across technologies and 
industries. I outlined our top four priorities for the year in support of that 
strategy: growing the data center and adjacencies, ensuring a strong and 
healthy PC business, growing IoT and devices and executing flawlessly in 
m
emory and FPGAs.
 
I'd like to take a few minutes to highlight our progress in Q2. First, DCG. The 
Data Center business grew 9% in Q2 and remains on track to high single 
digit growth for the year. Strong public cloud growth continued, with 
revenue up 35%. En
terprise was down 11%, as workloads continued to 
migrate to the cloud and memory and solid
-
state drive constraints impacted 
server deployments. Comm service provider revenue was up 17%, while 
adjacencies, which serve all customer segments, rose 12%.
 
Cloud 
and comm service provider together are the growth engine in the data 
center, and together now make up nearly 60% of DCG's revenue. In 5G 
we're demonstrating end to end leadership in client and infrastructure. We 
have five ongoing trials with leading global
 
service providers and 15 more in 
the pipeline. And we're on track with our development of IA, FPGA and ASIC 
silicon platforms based on new radio standards.
 
Earlier this month, we launched Xeon Scalable, formerly known as Skylake 
and with it, the industry'
s biggest platform advancement in a decade. Using 
Xeon Scalable, our customers have already achieved over 50 third
-
party 
verified performance world records and are seeing more than 1.6x 
performance increase over our prior generation product across a wide r
ange 
of real world workloads.
 
For example, the new AVX
-
512 instructions double floating point 
performance, benefiting use cases like HPC, VR and AI. In fact, artificial 
intelligence inference throughput improves by 2.4x gen to gen. And when 
this silicon in
novation is combined with our AI software frameworks 
optimizations, customers like Amazon Web Services are seeing inference 
performance improvements of more than 100x. The enthusiasm for Xeon 
Scalable resulted in our largest early ship program ever. We del
ivered more 
than 500,000 units to over 30 customers who appreciate outright 
performance leadership.
 
The data center is central to our strategy and is a remarkable opportunity. 
By 2021 we expect the data center to be a $65 billion silicon opportunity, 
and w
e're less than 40% of the total available segment today. As we build 
out the adjacencies like Ethernet, Silicon Photonics and 3D XPoint memory 
and pull them all together with rack scale design, we'll be positioned to 
deliver even higher levels of performan
ce and efficiency to our customers 
and increase our percentage of the total TAM.
 
The Client Computing Group also delivered fantastic results. Revenue was up 
12% over last year as product leadership combined with a disciplined 
segmentation strategy led to r
ising Core mix. We along with our customers 
and partners in the PC supply chain are driving the evolution of the PC 
experience, as users seek out high performance and new form factors. We 
launched the powerful new Intel Core X
-
series processor family inclu
ding a 
new Core i9 Extreme Edition processor, extending our performance 
leadership. And we'll be shipping our first 10
-
nanometer products near the 
end of the year beginning with a lower volume SKU and followed by multiple 
SKUs and a volume ramp in the firs
t half of 2018. We've seen some modest 
improvements in the PC consumption but we continue to expect a mid single 
digit TAM decline for the full year.
 
We also began shipping our next generation 4G LTE modem known as the 
7480 to customers. As I mentioned ear
lier, we're continuing to make great 
progress with our wireless ecosystem, laying the groundwork for 5G, and 
starting in 2018, Intel will partner on what is expected to be the first 5G 
showcase at the Olympic games.
 
In our Internet of Things business, we'r
e focused on four key verticals, 
retail, video, industrial and transportation. We saw strong growth across all 
four, leading to a 26% increase in revenue. We're specifically excited to see 
the ramp of our IVI designs with both Jaguar Land Rover and Toyota.
 
We're also about to mark a very important milestone in our transformation. 
We expect to close the acquisition of Mobileye in the third quarter, several 
months earlier than expected. Autonomous driving is a massive compute 
workload that will disrupt indust
ries and save lives and we are investing to 
win in this important segment.
 
I'm excited to welcome the Mobileye team to Intel. Together, we expect to 
be the global leader in the $70 billion autonomous driving systems, data and 
services market opportunity by
 
accelerating auto industry innovation and 
delivering cloud to car solutions faster and at a lower cost. And we're looking 
forward to talking with you in more detail about our plans and the progress 
we're making in this segment later this quarter.
 
Memory a
nd FPGAs round out our priorities for the year. Our memory 
business grew 58% over last year, setting an all
-
time revenue record. A 
cornerstone for our strategy in this segment is differentiated technology. 
And that differentiation was on display earlier th
is month when we 
announced availability of the industry's first, and to date only, 64
-
layer 3D 
NAND SSDs. Our floating gate architecture already enabled industry
-
leading 
density at 32 layers. And we believe our density lead is even greater at 64. 
We also s
hipped more than 200,000 units of our revolutionary Optane 
memory for clients, which are available via our OEM partners and channel 
partners and have more than 50 data center customers testing Optane SSDs 
currently which will ship for revenue this year, Op
tane DIMMs remaining on 
track for availability next year.
 
Our memory factory, Fab 68, continues to exceed expectations, ramping 
ahead of schedule in terms of both output and yield. This will be a big part of 
our overall supply growth in the second half, wh
ich we expect to be greater 
than 20%. The combination of strong execution and favorable market 
conditions is accelerating our path to profitability. Core NAND returned to 
profitability this quarter ahead of our earlier estimate and we expect it to 
remain p
rofitable for the balance of the year. We also now expect the entire 
NSG segment to be profitable for the full year of 2018 versus our prior end 
of 2018 target.
 
Lastly, our FPGA business was down 5% over last year on weaker data 
center and comms sectors, b
ut remains on track to our mid single digit 
growth target for the full year, with broad reacceleration in the second half 
across markets, including the Data Center segment.
 
At their Build Conference in May, Microsoft disclosed a major advancement 
in the de
ployment of Intel FPGAs resulting in the industry's fastest public 
cloud network and new technology for acceleration of deep neural networks. 
Audi selected Intel for the Level 3 autonomous driving system in its 
upcoming A8 where our Cyclone V SoC FPGA tech
nology will perform object 
and map fusion as well as parking pilot and sensor data pre
-
processing. 
We're also seeing strong adoption of our 14
-
nanometer Stratix 10 FPGAs. 
We continue to gain key design wins in our focus segments, and we're on 
track to prod
uction later this year.
 
To sum it up, I'm very pleased with our progress, and I'm more confident 
than ever in Intel's future and growth. Based on our strong first half and 
higher expectations for the PC business and the expected close of Mobileye, 
we're raising our full
-
year reve
nue forecast from $60 billion to $61.3 billion 
and our non
-
GAAP EPS forecast from $2.85 to $3.00.
 
We continue to see intense competition across our businesses. That's the 
reality of the attractive markets in which we participate. The competition 
makes us s
tronger, and we're ready for it. We're executing well to our 
strategy to transform from a PC
-
centric company to a data
-
centric company 
that powers the cloud and billions of smart and connected devices.
 
The PC TAM is down more than 15% versus four years ago
. Despite that 
headwind, our revenue is up more than 15% and our operating profit has 
grown more than 30%. More than 40% of our revenue now comes from our 
data
-
centric businesses outside the PC sector. And those businesses 
together are growing at double
-
di
git rates. And while we're growing the top 
line, we're intensely focused on operating efficiency. We now expect 
spending as a percent of revenue to decline about 160 basis points versus 
last year, bringing it below 34%, on track to the 30% goal we're commi
tted 
to, to hit by 2020.
 
And with that, I'd like to hand it over to Bob.

Thanks, Brian, and good afternoon.
 
Like Brian said, we had an outstanding quarter and executed on several 
important milestones. Revenue was $14.8 billion,
 
up 14% year over year 
excluding the Intel Security Group. From an earnings perspective, operating 
income was $4.2 billion, up 30% year over year, and EPS of $0.72 was up 
22% year over year. Our EPS performance was the result of strong top line 
growth, goo
d gross margin improvement, and excellent spending leverage.
 
From a capital allocation perspective, we generated $4.7 billion in cash flow 
from operations, returned $2.6 billion to shareholders, and have capital in 
place to fund the Mobileye acquisition.
 
T
he planned acquisition of Mobileye, which will fuel our growth in the 
automotive segment, is expected to close in Q3, well ahead of our schedule.
 
At our Analyst Day in February, we talked about our strategy to transform 
from a PC
-
centric company to a data
-
centric company, a company well 
positioned to power the cloud and the billions of smart and connected 
devices. Our Q2 results demonstrate its continued momentum in our 
transformation, with the data
-
centric businesses, those outside of the PC 
segment, up 16
% year over year. Our PC
-
centric business executed 
extremely well in a declining market and was up 12%. Our data
-
centric 
businesses are more than 40% of the company's overall revenue.
 
Moving to earnings, we are seeing broad growth across the business, driv
ing 
4 points of operating margin leverage and 22% EPS growth year over year. 
Earnings growth is driven by strong top line growth for both the PC and 
data
-
centric businesses, improving unit costs with 14
-
nanometer ramp, and 
gains from a sale of a portion of
 
our equity investment in ASML.
 
On our Q1 earnings call, Brian and I talked about our commitment to 
achieving spending target of approximately 30% of revenue no later than 
2020. We made great progress in the second quarter, as total spending was 
down 330 b
asis points year over year. We've continued investments in our 
key priorities, including artificial intelligence, autonomous driving, and 
Moore's Law, while at the same time capturing benefits of our previously 
announced restructuring program and significa
nt leverage from strong top 
line growth.
 
R&D spending was down 1 point, and our SG&A costs were down 2.2 points. 
On a full
-
year basis, we expect direct spending to be below 34%, 
approximately 0.5 point better than our prior guidance.
 
Let me touch briefly o
n our segment performance on slide 5. The Client 
Computing Group had another outstanding quarter. Revenue of $8.2 billion 
was up 12% year over year. Client ASPs were up 8% year over year, as we 
continue to see strength in our gaming segment and strong Core
 
mix.
 
We also continue to see the worldwide supply chain operate at healthy 
levels. This segment had another quarter of significant profit growth, with 
operating profit growing 58% from a year ago. And the business continues 
to execute and benefit from con
tinued improvements in 14
-
nanometer unit 
costs, richer product mix, and lower spending.
 
Moving to slide 6, the Data Center Group had revenue of $4.4 billion, up 9% 
year over year. The Data Center Group had operating profit of $1.7 billion, 
down 6% year ove
r year. As Brian mentioned earlier, we had strong growth 
in both the comms and cloud service provider segments, which are nearly 
60% of our DCG revenue. Operating margin percent was impacted by 
increased technology development costs and higher artificial i
ntelligence and 
adjacency spending. Versus the first quarter, our revenue accelerated 3% 
and our operating margin improved by 3 points. We are on track to our full
-
year guide of revenue growth in the high single digits and operating margin 
of over 40% for 
the full year.
 
The IoT, NSG, and PSG business segments are well positioned to capitalize 
on the explosion of data and are becoming a larger component of our overall 
business, growing 28% year over year. Our Internet of Things business 
achieved revenue of $
720 million, growing 26% year over year, driven by 
strength in industrial and video and continued momentum in our automotive 
business. Operating profit was $139 million, up 56% year over year on 
higher volume and ASPs offset by continued investment in auto
motive.
 
Our memory business had record revenue of $874 million, up 58% year over 
year, with strong demand from data center SSD solutions and demand 
signals outpacing supply. This segment had an operating loss of $110 
million, largely driven by costs associ
ated with 3D XPoint and start
-
up costs 
for our memory capacity. Our memory fab in Dalian continues to make great 
progress and is ramping several weeks ahead of schedule. Yields continue to 
improve and unit costs are well ahead of expectations.
 
The core NAN
D business returned to profitability in the second quarter, and 
we expect the core NAND business to be profitable for the full year and the 
memory business as a whole to be profitable in 2018, both ahead of our 
prior estimates.
 
The Programmable Solutions G
roup had revenue of $440 million, down 5% 
year over year. Operating profit was $97 million, flat year over year after 
acquisition
-
related impacts. We're making good progress in realizing cost 
synergies with the integration of this business.
 
Moving to slide
 
8, let me remind you of our capital allocation priorities and 
progress. Our priorities, first, invest in the business; second, strategic 
acquisitions; and third, return cash to our shareholders through dividends 
and buybacks. As I mentioned earlier, in th
e quarter, we generated $4.7 
billion of cash from operations. We purchased $2.8 billion in capital assets, 
paid $1.3 billion in dividends and repurchased about $1.3 billion of stock.
 
In addition, we received cash of approximately $900 million as a portion 
of 
our Intel Security divestiture. And we generated approximately $1.3 billion 
from the sales of some of our interest in ASML, which generated $796 
million of pre
-
tax gains. At quarter end, cash and long
-
term investments 
was $34 billion, up $11 billion, an
d total debt was $32 billion. Offshore cash 
investments and proceeds from the sale of our ASML investments are being 
used to fund the Mobileye acquisition.
 
Now, let me turn to guidance on slide 9. Some context. First, while we see 
slightly higher PC TAM an
d supply chain inventory replenishment 
contributing to higher expectations for annual revenue, we continue to take 
a more cautious view of PC consumption versus third
-
party analysts. 
Second, we continue to see strong demand signals in our memory business 
t
hrough the year, and we expect memory fab in Dalian to support higher 
second half demand levels. And third, as I mentioned earlier, we expect to 
close the acquisition of Mobileye in the third quarter, and as such, are 
including expectations for this busine
ss into our guidance.
 
Based on these factors, we are raising our full year revenue guidance by 
$1.3 billion to $61.3 billion, operating income guidance by $600 million to 
$17.9 billion, and EPS guidance by $0.15 to $3 per share. The improvement 
in revenue 
outlook is driven by a strong first half, higher expectations of the 
PC business and the inclusion of Mobileye.
 
The improvement in operating margin is primarily driven by our increased 
revenue outlook. Our outlook for full year spending is $20.7 billion as
 
we 
expect modest increases related to revenue growth and the integration of 
Mobileye.
 
The increase in EPS is driven by higher expectations of revenue, coupled 
with gains on sale of our equity investments and the inclusion of Mobileye. 
We expect Mobileye t
o contribute approximately $200 million of revenue, 
$100 million of operating income, and $0.02 of EPS in the second half of the 
year.
 
And on slide 11 (sic) [10], as we look to the third quarter of 2017, we are 
forecasting the midpoint of the revenue range
 
at $15.7 billion, up 3% year
-
over
-
year excluding Intel Security Group. And we expect operating income 
of $4.8 billion and EPS to be approximately $0.80.
 
2017 is shaping up to be another record year for Intel. We feel great about 
where we are six months in
to our three
-
year transformation. We exceeded 
our EPS expectations for Q2, and increased our profit expectations for the 
full year.
 
At the same time, we are investing to compete and win in an expanding 
market fueled by the growth of data. We are 
already seeing an impact from 
our data
-
centric oriented businesses, up double digits collectively, as we 
continue to transform the company from a PC
-
centric company to a 
company of smart and connected devices that power the cloud.
 
With that, let me turn it
 
over to Mark.

Thank you. Our first question comes from Blayne Curtis from Barclays. Your 
line is open.
 
Blayne Curtis

Barclays Capital, Inc.
 
Hey. Thanks for taking my question and nice results. I was curiou
s on the 
data center business, maybe you can talk about the growth you they 
sequentially in the back half to get to that high single digits for the year. 
Maybe you can just talk about it by segment. I know cloud was up a lot in 
Q2, enterprise down. Talk ab
out it by segment as well as the contribution 
from Scalable into those segments. What's the right timing to think about as 
those ramp in?
 
Brian M. Krzanich 
-
 
Intel Corp.
 
Sure. Thanks, Blayne, for the question. So I'll start and Bob can add some 
comments at
 
the end. We think the data center continues to be just a great 
growth engine for the company. And you saw the 9% growth this quarter. 
What we have really been also focusing on at the same time is really 
increasing operating margin, and I want to make that
 
point. You saw our 
operating margin increase to 38% this quarter. You'll see us continue to 
raise that operating margin so that we're back at the 40% plus operating 
margin for the back half and for the year.
 
So first wanted to lay that groundwork. What we
've projected for the second 
half is quarters that are pretty much in line. We continue to expect 
enterprise to continue to decline. It declined a bit more in the second 
quarter than I think we had really projected. It declined at about 11%. But if 
you loo
k at Q1, it declined a little less than we expected at 3%. But we still 
expect it to decline in those high single digit numbers. Cloud though, and 
grew greater than we what expected at 36%. We expect it to be in the mid 
20s, probably more likely. And then 
networking and comms, 17% and the 
adjacencies at 12%.
 
So we expect that trend to continue. We don't need any big shifts in those 
trends to really get to that high single digit growth rate for the data center. 
We talked about Xeon Scalable. The initial reac
tion has been extremely 
positive. You see the largest number of prequalification samples sent out to 
customers. You see the cloud applications. We try to talk about it's the 
largest performance improvement in a decade, gen to gen. So we're seeing 
a very la
rge ramp in the second half as we move on with the Xeon Scalable. 
And so I think that's what's going to fuel second half 2017, and then but it's 
going to continue on into 2018 as well. So I think that's how we see the 
second half playing out.

Thanks, and then

Robert H. Swan

The only thing I would add, Brian, is we came into the year looking at high 
single digit growth for the business and margins expanding quarter by 
quarter throughout the year, and two
 
months in we see nice acceleration on 
both top and bottom line. And as we go into the second half of the year, 
we're comfortable with the full year outlook that we've given. And the only 
dynamic other than the things Brian highlighted is Q3 comps are a li
ttle 
tougher as we go into the second half of the year, but we feel good about 
the mix of the business as we go through 2017 and beyond.
 
Just to reiterate a point Brian said, with the strong cloud growth and the 
strong performance in the comms and networki
ng space, we now generate 
60% of our revenues from the higher growth aspects of the business. So we 
think that bears well for us in 2017 but also going into 2018 and beyond.
 
Blayne Curtis 
-
 
Barclays Capital, Inc.
 
Thanks. And then I did want to ask you on t
he memory side, you looking for 
breakeven next year. What is driving that? Obviously, memory pricing has 
been strong, but I was just wondering if there's any other factors you're now 
adding into that outlook?
 
Brian M. Krzanich 
-
 
Intel Corp.
 
Sure. So let's 
make sure we clarify, right, so on traditional NAND, we are 
breakeven this year. And we broke even actually this quarter, and we expect 
to remain there the rest of the year. When we talk about for next year, 
that's inclusive of 3D XPoint. And so the differ
ence is really as we ramp 
products on through the XPoint and as we ramp out the rest of Fab 68, both 
of those. Whenever you're ramping a factory, because you have a certain 
amount of underutilization of the equipment just as you start to get it going, 
you 
tend to have slightly higher costs. And so that's what you see as the 
driver for the rest of the profitability growth as we go into next year.
 
I want to also say that the 64
-
tier NAND products gives us a cost and 
performance advantage just because they're 
leading edge products as well 
that is going to play into as we move through the remainder of this year and 
next year. So it's 64
-
tier products on traditional NAND, the ramp
-
out of Fab 
68, and then the real startup and continuation in getting the rest of th
e 
products qualified on 3D XPoint is what gets us 

 
everything profitable next 
year.

Deuts
che Bank Securities, Inc.
 
Hi, thanks for letting me ask a question. Brian, I wanted to follow up the 
data center side that Blayne just asked about and get a little bit more color 
about the acceleration on the cloud side and the deceleration on the 
enterprise side. If you could give any more color on why you think those 
were at the extremes and why do you think they normalize going forward, it 
would be helpful.
 
Brian M. Krzanich 
-
 
Intel Corp.
 
I don't want to say that they're going to ""normalize"". In 
fact, there's not 
going to be a major shift. The trend of 

 
look, enterprise is going to continue 
to decline. We estimate, and again, this is just based on what we get from 
our customers, talking to the industry. It's going be in the high single
-
digit 
decl
ine. I think you'll see quarters like Q2 that was 11%. You'll see quarters 
like Q1 that were 3% or 4%. We've seen quarters higher than the 11% over 
the last couple years. So it's going be lumpy as we see this shift, but the 
overall macro shift of enterpris
e to cloud or traditional on
-
prem systems to 
cloud is going to continue.
 
I think we'll also see, we still again, talking to our partners, thinking that 
mid
-
20% for cloud growth, but I think we'll see quarters like this quarter 
that was a little bit high. O
ther quarters we've had in the past have been 
more in line. So I don't think we're talking about something going 
normalizing. I'd say it's still going to stay relatively lumpy like this. But if 
you look at it over the long haul, even when you look at the f
irst half of the 
year, 11% down this quarter, 3% down last quarter, you take a look at 
those on average and you get to that high single
-
digit number. So I still feel 
like that's going to be roughly about where it goes down, and then the cloud 
will continue
 
to grow at that rate plus additional as more of the growth goes 
into the cloud.
 
Robert H. Swan 
-
 
Intel Corp.
 
The only thing I'd add, Brian, is the supply/demand imbalance of SSDs in 
the quarter we believe had an impact on the enterprise sector. And as tha
t 
supply/demand imbalance normals out, we think that will help. But all that 
being said, the trends Brian highlighted is still how we see the workloads 
playing out over time.
 
Ross C. Seymore 
-
 
Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
 
That's very helpful. I guess for
 
my follow
-
up if I can shift gears over to the 
margin side of things, and specifically the fall
-
through. It was great to see 
that you guys beat your OpEx guidance for the second quarter. As we think 
about the full year with revenues going up, why isn't gro
ss margin changing 
at all? And then the OpEx increase ex
-
Mobileye, is that just the variable 
comp that comes in with bonuses et cetera, or is there something else in 
that roughly $150 million increase to your spending line?
 
Robert H. Swan 
-
 
Intel Corp.
 
Jus
t on the second one first, the short answer is yes. The combination of the 
incremental growth and the addition of Mobileye are the primary drivers for 
the slightly higher spend.
 
Your initial comment on flow
-
through, to put it into context, from where we 
we
re in January, our full
-
year outlook, the revenue is up roughly $1.8 billion. 
And with that $1.8 billion, there will be roughly $200 million of costs, 
primarily Mobileye. So in context, we feel like we're managing the cost and 
spending side of the business
 
effectively as we position to a 30% spending 
of revenue by 2020 at the latest.
 
In terms of the gross margin dynamics, I think the trends that you've seen 
over the last couple quarters we expect to continue through the year. And 
it's really ASP improvement
s, good unit cost performance, volume leverage 
through the fab working in our favor. And on the flip side, the strong growth 
of the memory and the modem business and the ramp costs for 10
-
nanometer are partial offsets. Those dynamics are what has driven th
e 
strong gross margins in the 63% range in the first half, and we expect those 
same dynamics to play out in the second half as well.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Vivek A
rya from Bank of America. 
Your line is open.
 
Vivek Arya

Bank of America Merrill Lynch
 
Thank you for taking my question. Brian, for my first one, my question is on 
the competitive landscape in the data center. There's been a lot of 
discussion about AMD pe
rhaps posing more competition than it has in the 
last several years. And I appreciate it's early days and you have a very 
strong product out, but are you hearing about them more in your customer 
conversations? Is that a more real threat than it has been in
 
the past? 
Because they did have an event, they did show up with 10
-
plus potential 
customers. And in some of the benchmark data, they are showing some 
performance that is perhaps better at a lower price. So how real is that 
competition and how are you reac
ting to it?
 
Brian M. Krzanich 
-
 
Intel Corp.
 
Sure, Vivek. I think in general, we see competition across almost every one 
of our platforms, whether it be in the data center or in the client business, 
and it's come from a variety of sources.
 
You're right, AMD
 
has raised up a bit with their more recent products, but 
you see us responding. This is a traditional performance battle that we're 
very accustomed to, and we're comfortable in reacting and competing very 
aggressively in. And so you see us coming out with
 
our Xeon Scalable. You'll 
see us make maneuvers like we accelerate our Core i9 products, which are 
all the way up to 18 thread systems on the client based products. So I'd tell 
you that yes, we're seeing increased competitive pressure from a variety of 
pl
aces. But that actually will just drive us even harder, make us better in the 
end. And we're comfortable that we can make the right products to deliver 
the right performance against those.
 
Vivek Arya 
-
 
Bank of America Merrill Lynch
 
And as my follow
-
up, Bri
an, if you could give us a little bit more color on 
your 10
-
nanometer progress. What is the timing of products around that 
node? And as part of that, if Bob could remind us how the CapEx and 
depreciation and OpEx for that node are flowing through the finan
cials. 
Thank you.
 
Brian M. Krzanich 
-
 
Intel Corp.
 
Sure, so on 10
-
nanometers we are sampling, engineering samples to 
customers currently. The yields on 10
-
nanometers are continuing to improve 
pretty much right in line with the forecasted ramp rates. It's a 
new 
technology, so you always have some problems to get solved but we're 
pretty comfortable with where we're at right now. Like we said in the 
earnings script, we are set to qualify the first production products right 
towards the end of the year. You'll se
e those start to ship in the first half of 
next year and you'll see a ramp of SKUs.
 
One of the things we're seeing is each one of these technologies, and 
actually products that we generate, we're generating quite a few more SKUs, 
Vivek. And so you'll see a
 
variety of SKUs progressing through 2018 as we 
ramp the 10
-
nanometer products, starting with the, I'll call it, more simpler 
SKUs at the beginning, going all the way through the high performance, high 
complexity SKUs towards the middle and back half of th
e year. Which is it's 
a traditional ramp like you see us push out on a new product ramp.
 
Robert H. Swan 
-
 
Intel Corp.
 
And then just in terms of the capital, yes, just as a reminder, our full year 
outlook for CapEx is roughly $12 billion. We did indicate th
at approximately 
$2.5 billion of that would be for memory. So underlying that, you have $9.5 
billion dollars CapEx for the logic business. For 10
-
nanometer and 
specifically you have TD lines and pilot lines going in this year and beginning 
to scale as we m
atch the capacity with the production that scales in the first 
half and second half of next year. So that's reflected in the CapEx guide and 
the depreciation guide that we gave you earlier in the year and that hasn't 
really changed.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Stacy Rasgon from Bernstein 
Research. Your line is open.
 
Stacy Aaron Rasgon

Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC
 
Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. I had a question on the
 
trajectory 
of data center growth into the second half. And to be honest, I'm still 
wondering why you don't think you can do better than high single digits. I 
mean I know you're calling out the tough comp in Q3 but it's only like 10%, 
right, which is rough
ly in line with full year guide and it's below the longer
-
term CAGR. So you're going to see comps at that level or higher kind of into 
perpetuity. I guess why call that out as an excuse? And what are the issues 
in terms of hoping and driving for a bigger l
ift in the second half versus what 
you're still currently guiding for with the Skylake
-
SP launch on its way?
 
Brian M. Krzanich 
-
 
Intel Corp.
 
So I think, Stacy, first, we're quite proud of the growth rate we're seeing 
and especially the growth rates in the 
growth segments. We're forecasting 
mid 20s for the cloud business, the networking and storage business and 
adjacencies on down. What we're having to counter is not only the comps 
that Bob talked about, but the declining function of the enterprise, right. A
nd 
so those two things counter those growth rates. Now, as the enterprise 
continues to shrink, it will become less and less moving forward. So we 
agree that over time, this will become a smaller and smaller impact to the 
growth rates. But right now, it's s
till a large enough percentage. It weighs on 
our ability to get the growth rate higher.
 
Robert H. Swan 
-
 
Intel Corp.
 
Yes, and I would, if I sounded like I was giving an excuse, I maybe should 
just correct that. We feel great about where we are, first half 
up 7%, full 
year up high single digits, profit expanded during the course of the year and 
continuing to win in those segments of the market that have differentiated 
growth rates. So six months into the year, we feel good about where we are 
and we're excite
d about the new product that we launched.
 
Stacy Aaron Rasgon 
-
 
Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC
 
Got it. For my follow
-
up, on the PC side of things, I know you said that the 
channel's healthy, but it sounds like you also had channel fill in the quarter 
and it
's also included in the guide going forward. So, I guess if the channel's 
healthy, why is there inventory filling up and what does that imply as we 
kind of get through the year and look into next year for the likely trajectory 
of your products' sales into 
that market?
 
Robert H. Swan 
-
 
Intel Corp.
 
I think as we look at kind of the quarter performance 

 
well, I should start 
with kind of the TAM overall, and Brian highlighted this in the prepared 
remarks. We have assumed that PC TAM will continue to decline in
 
the mid 
single digits for the full year, and on the margin, that might be a little better 
today than it was six months ago. But we're not counting on a dramatic 
change in the PC TAM consumption for the year.
 
That being said, we've taken up our guidance qu
ite a bit. So in that, there's 
a stronger Q2 performance with a little bit of more healthy inventory 
channels as we go into the second half of the year. So, if the inventory was 
maybe a little bit leaner over the last three to four quarters, I think we'd 
c
haracterize them in the healthy level now. And we think the ecosystem is 
building for a second half that's consistent with our outlook for PC TAM.
 
Stacy Aaron Rasgon

Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC
 
And it needs to build inventory to do that?

Stacy Aaron Rasgon 
-
 
Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC
 
And it needs to build inventory to do that?
 
Robert H. Swan 
-
 
Intel Corp.
 
I think the inventory levels, as we see it in the channel, is slightly higher 
than the lean levels th
ey've been for the last couple quarters, but no 
dramatic difference from our perspective on how we see PC TAM for the full 
year.

Credit Suisse Securities (

Yes. Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for letting me ask the questions. 
Congratulations on the solid 
results. Brian, I apologize if I missed this in 
your prepared comments. My first question is just around pricing in DCG. It 
was down about 1% sequentially. There's always a lot of mix things there. 
You usually have some commentary about ASPs per bucket. We
re they still 
strong? And I guess more importantly, as you think about the product 
launches in the back half of the year, at least some of our initial checks are 
suggesting that the customers are kind of chomping at the bit to buy higher 
up into the stack,
 
which could drive some good ASPs. Can you talk about 
your expectations around ASPs and/or attach rates for adjacency data center 
businesses with the launch of the Xeon Scalable?
 
Brian M. Krzanich 
-
 
Intel Corp.
 
Sure, John. So we expect the second half of 2
017, from an ASP perspective, 
to be pretty much what you've seen in the past, where ASPs continue to 
increase on the various platforms of Xeon, right. So looking at each one, 
you'll see ASPs overall increasing. What you're seeing on this is a little bit of
 
mix, right, so as you saw, networking and storage grow at 17%, the 
adjacencies at 12%. Those are starting to become a little bit more a 
percentage of that business and those draw down the overall ASPs a little 
bit. But if you look within just the Xeon cor
e function, those ASPs continue to 
increase at about the normal rates that you'd expect, especially as you move 
into a new architecture like Xeon Scalable.
 
John W. Pitzer

That's helpful. And then for my follow
-
on, just turning to the Client Compute 
Group, your ability to sort of segment that market and drive higher mix has 
been sort of a multiyear endeavor with a lot of success. What inning do you 
think you guys are in 
in that process, especially with AMD coming to market 
with new products? Is there still a mix, a potential story here, and what 
would drive that?
 
Brian M. Krzanich 
-
 
Intel Corp.
 
I actually think there is. So I think if you take a look at this, John, what's
 
driven this has not been clever segmentation necessarily. It's been the 
ability to segment into specific markets and specific performance. And so 
things like Core i9 are a good example where you're really targeting 
performance. And so what I believe is th
at what the growth areas in the 
client space, gaming, virtual reality, thin and light, they're requiring 
performance and power. And remember those are always somewhat 
tradeable as you take a look at this.
 
And so those trends are going to continue, and that
's why that's as we 
talked about, how do you feel about competition, where do you see 
competition playing. We believe our leadership and performance will 
continue to allow that trend to continue and continue to allow the trend 
within CCG to continue as wel
l. And that's part of what drove the forecast for 
the second half.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Romit Shah from Nomura 
Se
curities. Your line is open.
 
Romit Shah 
-
 
Nomura Securities International
 
Yes. Thanks so much for letting me ask a question. It looks like this is the 
fifth consecutive quarter that CCG beat expectations. Revenues were up 
12%, and I think there's a debate 
out there as to whether or not you 
deserve credit for this performance with skeptics really pointing to 
sustainability more than anything else. And when you break down that 12% 
as you guys mentioned, ASPs are a big part of the increase. My question is, 
as 
you look at the mix in that business overall, is there room to drive ASPs 
higher and effectively capture more value inside of the PC TAM?
 
Brian M. Krzanich 
-
 
Intel Corp.
 
So, yes is the simple answer, Romit. Remember this isn't necessarily us 
raising prices
. So it's not we're out there going and saying okay, I'm going 
to charge $10 more for the next Core i7. It's actually the percentage of units 
that are being bought at those higher units, and we continue to deliver 
higher performance at the same price with 
each one of these generations.
 
So what you're seeing is actually an overall trend that, yes, units are down. 
We talked about that, both I and Bob, around TAM being down somewhere 
in that low to mid
-
single
-
digit range. And that's pretty much in line with 
wh
at I'm seeing third parties here. Some third parties are a little bit better 
than that. But for the most part, we're within a couple of percent.
 
But yes, we believe that there is room for continued demand, for movement 
upwards. So the number of Core i7s. t
he number of Core i9s, the number of 
people buying the performance thin and light laptops, those are going to 
continue. And you see it in our OEM partners and the type of systems they 
are producing and the type of systems they're bringing to market. Now th
ey 
are targeting that more and more as well.

The only thing I would add is, again, we have a business that has a declining 
market. It's growing not by raising prices, but
 
to Brian's point by a market 
that increasingly values performance. And the operating margins of the 
business for the first half of the year were up over 50%. So this team 
through its segmentation is executing extremely well.
 
And then as we mentioned earli
er, with that great margin performance, we 
are redeploying our resources to invest in these data
-
centric set of 
businesses that have high growth characteristics that collectively were up 
16% again in the quarter. And through this journey of a PC TAM declin
e, we 
have a bigger business, a stronger business, and a more profitable business 
with an increasing portion, over 40%, coming from high
-
growth oriented 
businesses, so great performance in a declining market. Continuing to invest

have, and with the addition of Mobileye as we head into the second half of 
the year.

And in terms like, you obviously provide ASPs for CCG, but is the Core m
ix 
as a percentage of units a metric that we should be focusing on? And if I 
remember correctly, that percentage was close to 70%. I'm curious where it 
is today.

It's continuing to climb. It is, but don't forget even within 
that Core mix, 
Romit, you have the ability to continue to scale up. So Core i3 versus Core i5 
versus Core i7 and now we've introduced the Core i9, which is even higher 
performance.

Okay.

So we saw early on people choosing Core over Pentium or Atom, for 
example, and you saw the Core mix move up. You're now seeing not only 
that continue to climb, but you're going to see within Core the amount of 
Core i7s, Core i9s, Cor
e i5s continue to climb as well.

And that's why we continue to see that there are legs behind this. And you 
said are we getting credit for this, so we don't think when you
 
look overall 
this business, last year's performance with great growth in all of the 
segments. You look at this year's performance so far in the first half and our 
projections now in the second half, we think that our ability to segment, to 
drive better op
erating margin, and to continue to drive performance into the 
PC and keep it more and more profitable while we invest and grow these 
other businesses, we think that there's an option around Intel that is quite 
good.

Thank you. And our last question comes from Harlan Sur from JPMorgan. 
Your line is op

Thanks for taking my question and congratulations on the solid execution. In 
DCG, you guys are probably full throttle from a manufacturing perspective 
for Xeon Scalable or Skylake in the June quarter. But my questio
n is how 
much of the data center growth in June was the initial production revenue 
shipments of Xeon Scalable to your customers, or did that contribute just 
very little to the June quarter mix?
 
Brian M. Krzanich 
-
 
Intel Corp.
 
Okay. Yes, it's very little. W
e don't give out exact percentages by SKU like 
that. But I can genuinely tell you that it is really just the beginning of the 
ramp of the Xeon Scalable. And so its impact into Q2 was minimal at best. 
What you'll see is, as it ramps into the second half, it
 
becomes a higher and 
higher percentage, and really the big volume is going be 2018. So that's 
when it really takes over from the way the data center looks from a revenue 
and profit standpoint.
 
What we're excited about is we talked about the 500,000 units 
that are out 
there. That was the highest number of pre
-
samples. That shows you the 
demand by the big infrastructure guys around the performance. They were 
willing to take the product even before, quote, we were ready to start 
shipping it. And then the numb
er of records we've broken already in 
performance, we talked about 50 records worldwide already. Those are 
laying the groundwork for how this ramp is going look and feel as we move 
into the second half and into 2018.

Gr
eat, thanks for the insights there. And good to see the profitability in the 
NAND segment. In enterprise SSD, I think you guys are still number two 
global market share leader there. And it looks like based on the first half 
performance, you guys are outpac
ing the market. So I guess the question is 
where is the team winning. Is it high capacity? Is it high performance for 
these enterprise and cloud drives? And similar to maybe some of your peers, 
is the team currently capacity constrained?
 
Brian M. Krzanich

Intel Corp.
 
Sure. So our whole strategy around the memory is that we are focused on 
differentiation and performance and specifically around supporting the data 
center. We do sell into client as well but that's not the main focus of this 
business. And so 
I'd tell you when we talk about our growth and when we 
talk about our projections for the rest of this year and why we're investing in 
the future, that 64
-
tier NAND gives us the ability to be a better cost but the 
high performance end. So we're not going a
fter commodity SSDs that you're 
going to see even in high
-
end workstations necessarily. It's really focused 
towards the data center products.
 
Even still, there's not all SSDs and data centers are high
-
end performance. 
So we're comfortable with where we are
 
in a market share. We want to 
balance those investments against the demand for these high performance 
areas and make sure we keep that in balance. And our real goal is then to 
move more and more of the business towards the 3D XPoint as we move 
into next y
ear because that really differentiates us again as we really change 
the hierarchy between memory and storage as the data center DIMM 
memory systems come out.

Good day ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Intel Corporation Third 
Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a 
listen
-
only mode. Later, we will conduct a question
-
and
-
answer session, and 
instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, 
this conference is being recorded.
 
I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mr. Mark 
Henninger, Head of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.
 
Mark Henninger
 
Thank you, Amanda, and welcome everyone to Intel's third quarter 2015 
earnings conference call. By now you should have received a copy of our 
earnings release and the CFO commentary that goes along with it. If you've 
not received both documents, they're av
ailable on our Investor website, 
intc.com.
 
I'm joined today by Brian Krzanich, our CEO; and Stacy Smith, our Chief 
Financial Officer. In a moment, we'll hear brief remarks from both of them, 
followed by Q&A.
 
Before we begin, let me remind everyone that tod
ay's discussion contains 
forward
-
looking statements based on the environment as we currently see 
it, and as such, does include risk and uncertainties. Please refer to our press 
release for more information on the specific risk factors that could cause 
actu
al results to differ materially.
 
Also, if during this call we use any non
-
GAAP financial measures or 
references, we'll post the appropriate GAAP financial reconciliation to our 
web site, intc.com.
 
And finally, I'd like to remind everyone that we will be ho
sting our annual 
investor meeting here at our Santa Clara headquarters on Thursday, 
November 19. If you have questions about the event or logistics, please 
contact investor relations.
 
With that, let me hand it over to Brian.
 
Brian Krzanich
 
Thanks Mark. We 
executed well against our strategy in the third quarter, and 
delivered revenue just above the midpoint of our expectations; as a result of 
a richer client mix, driven largely by our new 6th Gen core products.
 
Despite ongoing macroeconomic headwinds, there 
are signs that the PC 
market is beginning to stabilize and we continue to benefit from a strategy 
designed to capitalize on the growing need for the infrastructure that powers 
the smart and connected world.
 
I'd like to take a moment to touch on a few highl
ights; the client confidence 
[ph] on these products and good, better, best segmentation strategy to 
record core mix. The third quarter saw the release of both Windows 10 and 
our 6th Generation core microprocessors, formerly known as Skylake. Our 
partners i
n the industry are using this combination to drive an 
unprecedented innovation, creating new generation of high performance 
enthusiast desktops and thinner, lighter and more versatile two
-
in
-
ones. 
There are more than 50 sixth generation core systems in the
 
market, 
available and shipping now, and we expect to more than triple that number 
by the end of 2015.
 
We remain solidly on track to our previously committed goal to improve 
mobile profitability by $800 million. Over 75% of that goal has already been 
reali
zed to
-
date. At the same time, our strategy to be a foundational supplier 
of internet infrastructure is delivering growth. Our Data Center, non
-
volatile 
memory and IOT groups all posted double digit growth year
-
over
-
year.
 
BCG grew 12% on strong cloud and n
etworking volume. At the same time, 
the Internet of Things grew 10% year
-
over
-
year, driven by the video, 
manufacturing and retail segments.
 
The Altera transaction remains on
-
track to our original six to nine month 
closing schedule. During the quarter, both
 
U.S. regulators and Altera 
stockholders approved the transaction. We are excited about the new 
opportunities and innovations that integrated FPGAs will make possible, in 
both the Data Center and the Internet of Things.
 
In the third quarter, the strength i
n our memory business continued, 
growing 20% year
-
over
-
year. We are excited about our 3D XPoint 
technology, the industry's first new memory category in more than two 
decades. This breakthrough technology is up to 1,000 times faster than 
NAND and up to 10 t
imes denser than conventional memories, like DRAMs. 
This enables memory intensive applications to be performed at much faster 
rates and much lower costs, opening up entirely new opportunities.
 

 
a direct 
result of our 10 plus year research and development pipeline. While we have 
more work to do, together, these results reinforce my confidence in our 
strategy, to create shareholder value. I look forward to talking with you 
more about our opportuni
ties and our plans during our November investor 
meeting.
 
And with that, let me turn the call over to Stacy.
 
Stacy Smith
 
Thanks Brian. Revenue for the third quarter was $14.5 billion, 10% growth 
quarter
-
on
-
quarter and above the midpoint of our outlook. The 
higher than 
expected revenue, was driven by higher notebook and desktop platform 
average selling prices, as we shipped a record core mix. Year
-
on
-
year 
revenue was flat.
 
Third quarter gross margin of 63% was in line with the outlook. Operating 
income of $4.
2 billion was down 8% year
-
over
-
year and up 45% quarter
-
over
-
quarter. Net income was $3.1 billion, down 6% year
-
over
-
year and up 
15% quarter
-
over
-
quarter, and earnings per share of $0.64 was down 3% 
year
-
over
-
year and up 16% quarter
-
over
-
quarter.
 
The Clien
t Computing Group had revenue of $8.5 billion, a 7% decrease 
year
-
over
-
year. From a PC market perspective, we continue to see weakness 
in nine consumer segments in emerging markets.
 
The worldwide PC supply chain is healthy, as we ramp our sixth generation 
core microprocessors, formerly known as Skylake. Operating profit for the 
overall Client Computing Group was $2.4 billion, down 20% year
-
over
-
year. 
The Data Center, Internet of Things and Memory businesses continue to 
account for almost 40% of our revenue 
in the third quarter. The Data Center 
Group had record revenue of $4.1 billion. The 12% growth year
-
over
-
year is 
driven by strength in the cloud and improvement in our enterprise business. 
The Data Center Group had operating profit of $2.1 billion, up 9% y
ear
-
over
-
year. The Internet of Things segment also achieved 10% year
-
over
-
year revenue growth of $581 million.
 
Additionally, the memory business grew at 20%. The business continued to 
generate significant cash, with $5.7 billion of cash from operations in 
the 
third quarter. We purchased $1.2 billion in capital assets, paid $1.1 billion in 
dividends and repurchased $1 billion of stock in the third quarter. Total cash 
balance at the end of the quarter was $20.8 billion, up $7 billion quarter
-
over
-
quarter. Our
 
net cash balance, total cash less debt, and inclusive of our 
other longer term investments, is approximately $5.1 billion. Over the next 
two quarters, we expect to complete the acquisition of Altera. During the 
third quarter, we issued $8 billion of new l
ong term debt, consistent with 
financing plan I outlined on the last earnings call.
 
As we look forward to the fourth quarter of 2015, we are forecasting the 
midpoint of the revenue range at $14.8 billion, up 2% from the third 
quarter, and we are forecastin
g the midpoint of the gross margin range to 
be 62%, a one point decrease from the third quarter. This revenue forecast, 
aligns with our prior full year 2015 revenue guidance of down approximately 
1% when compared to 2014.
 
Overall, we are seeing a weak PC c
lient business being offset by strong 
growth in the Data Center, memory and Internet of Things businesses. For 
the full year 2015, we expect the memory business to grow at a fast pace. 
Both the Data Center and Internet of Things businesses will also exhibi
t 
strong growth. But the annual growth rate for these businesses will be lower 
than expectations at the beginning of the year, as a result of weaker than 
expected macroeconomic growth.
 
We now expect the Data Center business to grow in the low double 
digits 
versus the prior forecast of approximately 15%. Relative to our forecast at 
the beginning of the year, we are seeing a weaker enterprise segment being 
partially offset by a stronger than expected cloud segment.
 
The third quarter results and the four
th quarter forecast reinforce our 
strategy. Despite weakness in the macroeconomic environment and the 
overall PC market, we are achieving solid financial results as we benefit from 
the growth in Data Center, memory, and Internet of Things businesses. More 
importantly, we are building the foundation for future growth. The 
combination of the 6th Generation core microprocessor and Windows 10 
creates exciting devices for the PC segment. Our investments and leadership 
in the Data Center are resulting in strong g
rowth. We have a strong and 
growing memory business, which is well positioned to disrupt the industry 
with a launch of 3D XPoint technology, and lastly, we are well positioned to 
benefit in the Internet of Things market.
 
Our process technology leadership a
nd a broad range of leadership IP 
creates a competitive advantage that we believe will result in increased 
shareholder value, and as we complete the Altera acquisition, we expect to 
broaden our product portfolio and enable even more innovation.
 
With that, 
let me turn it back over to Mark.
 
Mark Henninger
 
Okay. Thank you Brian and Stacy. Moving on now to the Q&A; as is our 
normal practice, we would ask each participant to ask one question and just 
one follow
-
up, if you have one. Amanda, please go ahead and in
troduce our 
first questioner.
 
Question
-
and
-
Answer Session
 
Operator
 
Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Chris 
Danely of Citigroup. Your line is open.
 
Chris Danely
 
Hey, thanks guys. I guess just to kind of go over the revenue be
at; so it 
sounds like, to paraphrase, it was mostly driven by 
--
 
or all driven by CCG 
and that it was mostly driven by pricing, is that true? And then why wouldn't 
--
 
gross margins haven't been a little better than expected, if pricing was so 
strong, or if
 
you could just illustrate [ph]on that?
 
Stacy Smith
 
Yes. The first approximation, the revenue higher than expectations was a 
result of a richer mix inside of the client group. You can see that the unit and 
ASP trends in the supplemental materials that I pu
t out. But pretty much to 
our expectations, it was all due to just a richer mix. We saw strength at the 
core i7 level literally across the core product line, as we launched Skylake.
 
The gross margin question, if you look at the margin recon, what we saw is
 
we saw some good news associated with the richer mix. It was offset by 
higher 14
-
nanometer costs than we were anticipating. We are expecting 
some bad news. We had a little bit more bad news than we anticipated, and 
that comes down till we actually ramped 
the Ireland factory a little bit earlier 
and the first wafers out of that factory were pretty expensive, and so we saw 
a mixing up of costs in Q3 a little bit more than we thought.
 
Chris Danely
 
Okay, thanks. And for my follow
-
up, you mentioned some demand 
going on 
out there, some demand changes in the geos and everybody is concerned 
about China. Can you just comment on your business in China, and maybe 
just talk about how your geos did in general versus expectations?
 
Brian Krzanich
 
Sure. This is Brian. I th
ink if you take a look at 
--
 
there has been a trend this 
entire year, where the mature markets have tended to do 
--
 
be the 
strongest for us, so U.S., western Europe. And Asia, PRC, parts of Eastern 
Europe, developing countries not being as strong, they are
 
having some 
softness that carried into the third quarter as well. And so, if you just take a 
look at China in general, it kind of mimics that and 
--
 
if you look at it, sales 
are down slightly, they are softer, and its more of the consumer than the 
enterpr
ise in that space, and across all the different segments. We saw it 
across the board.
 
Chris Danely
 
Okay. Thanks guys.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question comes from Ross Seymore of Deutsche Bank. 
Your line is open.
 
Ross Seymore
 
Hi guys. Thanks for lettin
g me ask the question. I got a follow
-
up on the ASP 
side of things. Stacy, could you give us a little color underneath the covers 
on how the CCG ASPs can be up 15% year
-
over
-
year when the desktop and 
notebook breakdowns are up at most like half or a third 
of that? And then, 
how sustainable is that ASP increase going forward, as I notice you did not 
put it into your gross margin benefit in the fourth quarter?
 
Stacy Smith
 
Yeah. So on to your first question, the piece of the math you're missing is, 
what's goin

business, if you remember, a year ago, we were seeing very significant 
counter revenue dollars which was coming out of ASP, and those for the 
large part, have abated. And so a change in the tab
lets is giving you that 
average that's higher than both desktop and notebook.
 
We provided the data. If you just look at desktop, the ASP is up about 8% 
year
-
on
-
year and notebook ASP is up about 4% year
-
on
-
year, and that's 
really just mix. I am not sure if 

 
Ross Seymore
 
Just that the sustainability and what it would do to gross margin? You didn't 
mention it in the fourth quarter, as far as being an ASP benefit?
 
Stacy Smith
 
Yeah. We are shipping a rich mix, that has been true across 2015, if you just 
see 
--
 
against the backdrop of a relatively weak PC market. We have seen 
pockets of strength and a lot of that has been at the high end. And I think its 
coming down 
--
 
we have go
t some great technology there, we are doing a 
reasonably good job of segmenting the product lines, so its not one size fits 
all anymore, you have all in ones and gaming PCs. We have launched a 
specific line now for gamers, those kinds of things. I think it
s likely to stay a 
fairly rich mix. So that's not 
--
 
gross margin, we kind of 
--
 
this means we 
are expecting it to maintain, not necessarily grow from here, but also, not 
necessarily come down.
 
Ross Seymore
 
Great. And I guess, as my follow
-
up, looking at y
our MCG, which you used 
to call the MCG side, and more specifically, the cellular side, you have had 
another reasonably large player exit that market during this last quarter in 
Marvell. Can you just give us an update on where you are with your LTE and 
may
be SoFIA product lines, and strategically, have you noticed any change 
in that business, now that the number of suppliers at the high end seems to 
be down to two?
 
Brian Krzanich
 
Yeah. So I think, let me start with the first part of your question, which is 
how is the progress going inside. So we have our 7260 modem that's been 
shipping throughout this year. There are products throughout the world that 
are using that modem, including in the U.S. The 7360, which is our next 
generation modem, is 
--
 
we will be s
hipping by the end of this year, with 
products to be announced by our customers, next year. So the LTE modem 
ramp, basically you need to be on a 
--
 
yearly cadence with these modems is 
going well. SoFIA 3G and the 3G
-
R, which is the Rockchip version of the 
SoFIA is in market today, that you can see tablets and phones with those 
today. You will see the first of the SoFIA LTEs next year, first half of next 
year, and SoFIA with Intel 14
-
nanometer in the back half of next year, and 
so those continue on schedule 
as well.
 
And market dynamics, I guess the way I look at the modem business is, its 
not really dependent 
--
 

how many players are in it. There is actually I think more than two. But its 
really about keepin
g that yearly cadence and having the right technologies in 
place and being competitive, and it doesn't really matter almost how many 
there are, there will be somebody there trying to compete with you at that 
leading edge. That's where the modem is really d
riven at that leading edge.
 
Ross Seymore
 
Great. Thank you.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question comes from Stacy Rasgon of Bernstein. Your 
line is open.
 
Stacy Rasgon
 
Hi guys. Thanks for taking my questions. First, can you tell us what drove 
the CapEx this
 
quarter and what that implies for how you're viewing sort of 
forward unit trajectory, as we exit the year?
 
Stacy Smith
 

configuration of a specific piece of equipment that we were g
oing to buy 
[indiscernible] some delivery slots that were towards the end of this year. As 
we upgraded to a richer configuration, it swapped out to delivery slots from 
the end of this year, to Q1 of next year. So just shifted a few hundred 
million dollars 
worth of CapEx from 2015 to 2016.
 
In terms of outlook for next year, we are not providing that forecast now. 
We will talk obviously a lot more about that in November. You do have to 
keep in mind, this was an unusually low year, so I'd expect directionally,
 
CapEx will be up some next year, but we will talk much more about that in 
November.
 
Stacy Rasgon
 
Got it. Thank you. So my follow
-
up, I just want to clarify, so you're 
essentially holding your Q4 revenue guidance, effectively unchanged versus 
what was impl
ied before? We have got Data Center, which is basically lower. 
PC outlook is still weak, and it seems like the unit outlook there, maybe 
lower than it was. Your cap is cut again, suggest you don't see the unit trend 
improving. Is it fair to say then that r
eally the pricing outlook is really all 
that's kind of helping you support the outlook into Q4? And I guess you sort 
of talked about a little bit on sustainability of that, as you see it. But I guess, 
would you to find sort of I guess the outlook on pricin
g now to be the 
biggest near term risk on beyond just 
--
 
with the channel doing great? I 
guess, was pricing the biggest near term risk, in terms of what's driving the 
business, if we are looking over the next couple of quarters, as we exit the 
year?
 
Brian 
Krzanich
 
So let me start with this, and then I am sure, Stacy is going to have 
something to add. I think first, in our comment that we are not 
--
 
given the 
CapEx shift, we are not thinking about units growing. Anything we spend in 
CapEx today is really abo
ut capacity, probably more towards the end of next 
year, maybe even into 2017. So you have to remember, there is this lag, 
and that's why, as we looked at the tool, actually, we are making an 
adjustment on the efficiency of that tool, basically the number 
of units per 
tool out. In order to get more capacity, when that tool is really required. So 
I want to just separate that, so people don't get the wrong message about 
the CapEx and what we will do in the future.
 
If you take a look at Q4, we said whilst it's
 
absolutely relatively a seasonal, 
when you just take a look at the unit level standpoint. So there is a natural 
decline in the total number of units, as you go from Q3 into Q4, based on 
just holiday shift.
 
Now we are going to move 
--
 
if you take a look at
 
Q4 versus Q3, there is a 
higher percentage of Skylake, which is our 6th Generation core as we talked 
about, and we think there will be a richer mix, as you move into there. So 
that's kind of how Q4 was laid out, and then as we said, we are not really 
talk
ing about 2016 yet until the investor meeting. But I think we should 
separate out the CapEx, we have predicted 
--
 
the key 
--
 
seasonal Q4, but 
with a mix that is remaining rich, but that richness is based on both the 
great products that we have been produci
ng, but also a richer percentage of 
Skylake/Intel 6th Gen Core.
 
Stacy Smith
 
I guess, I'd just add. I would just zoom out a little bit on the math. We 
exited Q3 with healthy worldwide supply chain inventories. We actually think 
we probably undershipped the 
market a little bit in Q3, and we are 
forecasting seasonal Q4, and there was a little bit of movement into the 
businesses, but nothing that really moves the numbers. So to us, it feels like 
a pretty natural forecast in support of all the data we have seen.
 
Brian Krzanich
 
Thanks Stacy.
 
Stacy Rasgon
 
Thank you guys.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question comes from John Pitzer of Credit Suisse. Your 
line is open.
 
John Pitzer
 
Yeah. Good afternoon guys. Thanks for letting me ask the question. Stacy, 
maybe 
just a follow
-
up on the September quarter; you said in your prepared 
comments that platform for client was up about 3% on a volume basis. Can 
you help me better understand what desktops and notebooks did 
sequentially, because if I kind of rack the year
-
ove
r
-
years, I am getting up 
high single digit to low double digit sequentially; is that right? And then just 
relative to your comment about 
--
 
earlier about inventory, how does that 
[indiscernible] sort of a lean inventory, or do you actually feel like Skylak
e is 
producing a build or will continue to produce a build into the calendar fourth 
quarter?
 
Stacy Smith
 
Yeah I think 
--
 
we saw units up some in Q3. But I think the year
-
over
-
year 
compare probably tells the tale a little bit better. We were down 14%
-
15% 
be
tween notebooks and desktops when you compare that against what the 
third parties would say happen with the TAM, they are kind of down in the 
more high single digits. So I think we undershipped a bit, relative to the 
overall TAM. And when we go do our test
 
of inventory, we come back with 
healthy inventory levels, if that's what you're getting at.
 
John Pitzer
 
Well, I guess what I am getting at is, just a seasonal Q4, with a new product 
launch and undershipping in Q3. I would assume that Q4 could actually be 
better. I don't know what I am missing relative to that math.
 
Brian Krzanich
 
Maybe you and Stacy should go arm wrestle, and between the two of you, 
you can figure out whether you are too high or too low. So yeah, I mean, 
there could be headwinds and tailwi
nds, as we go into the quarter as always. 
But we are kind of looking at it, saying, we have got healthy inventory levels 
and we are going into the seasonally stronger selling season. It feels like we 
are kind of balanced in terms of the risks and opportuni
ties.
 
John Pitzer
 
That's helpful. And guys, my follow
-
up, Brian, just on the Data Center 
Group, we are going to be a little bit shy of the long term target this year, 
because of macro. Do you have to rethink what that long term growth rate 
target should be
? And I guess more importantly, at what point is the 
enterprise part of the business small enough, because that's actually the 
most macro sensitive, where these macro issues won't kind of be this 
significant?
 
Stacy Smith
 
Sure. So I don't want to 
--
 
I am no
t going to go rethink the long term 
growth. We are still very confident that we can keep this over the long term, 
growing at mid
-
teens level. You really have to take a look at this John, over 
a longer period of time. you can't live in this industry by a qu
arter. For 
example, we have talked about 
--
 
enterprise is a bit weak right now and the 
cloud has been basically helping us in growing at a rate faster than we'd 
even projected as we entered this year. But what typically happens in the 
fourth quarter, the c
loud enterprises, and not to do large purchases in the 
fourth quarter. Well they have in the past at times, but in general, don't, 
because really fourth quarter is their selling season, and so they don't want 
to disrupt their systems during that quarter, a
nd then it comes back in the 
first half of the follow
-
on year.
 
So there is always this lumpiness to this quarter
-
by
-
quarter and you have to 
look over a much longer period of time.
 
Your second kind of question built into that, when does cloud and networking
 
and the rest of the infrastructure work. I really want to remind people that, 
what we are doing in the Data Center is not only just growing cloud versus 
enterprise, but we are driving hard into networking, we are driving 
--
 
next 
year you will see our Sili

a broad spectrum of products that should increase our footprint in the Data 
Center. We haven't set a date for when those are big enough, that they 
offset enterprise. But its not long, its in the near f
uture that we can offset 
enterprise weakness.
 
John Pitzer
 
Thank you.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question comes from Jim Covello of Goldman Sachs. 
Your line is open.
 
Jim Covello
 
Great guys. Thanks so much for taking the question. I will let Stacy and John
 
arm wrestle over the near term stop. I will ask a couple longer term things. 
First I guess Brian, on the NAND market; obviously this has been a terrific 
market for you guys. There is a lot going on there, there is a lot of growth 
opportunities commensurat
e with what's going on in the Data Center. There 
seems to be a lot of consternation next year about which of the various 
players are going to do what, and potential consolidation on the industry. 
Maybe you could just give us an update on how the NAND marke
t looks to 
you, as you go out to 2016, and where you see the opportunities, and you 
know, what kind of investments you think you will need to make there?
 
Brian Krzanich
 
Sure Jim. So let's start at kind of the macro level and then work our way 
down. As 
you said, the non
-
volatile business has been very good to us, and 
it has grown at a better rate than we even anticipate, as we entered the 
year. We need to remember that, more than 80% of what we sell are 
enterprise SSDs that are going into those Data Cent
ers. So we made a very 
tight connection. When we think of our NAND business, we think of it tied 
very closely to our Data Center business, and in fact, we trend a lot of 
synergy on the products, the efficiencies, the performance of these products, 
as we go
 
to market and then, how we go talk to our customers.
 
If we take a look at next year, its really the ramp of our 3D NAND process, 
and that we believe gives us a performance and cost advantage over the 
competition. We are very comfortable with where we are 
positioned for next 
year, from that perspective.
 
In addition, we talked about our 3D XPoint, which is really a 
transformational product for the memory market. What we said was, we 
start shipping limited engineering samples end of this year. You have seen 
o
n
-
stage, we showed at IDF and a couple of other places now, working 
products with benchmarks, we will continue to show more and more of those 
as we go through this year, and we will start shipping product for that next 
year.
 
As I look out in next year and 
beyond, it really becomes the 3D NAND 
driving the real high volume, better cost and performance enterprise SSDs 
and in 3D XPoint, really transforming how memory and storage work 
together and again, we will target the Data Center and have that very close 
cr
osslink between these. But I think 3D XPoint, you will actually see in 
many
-
many other products, as the value of both memory, storage, and 
performance start to play out in a variety of applications, IOT, mobile, all 
over the place.
 
Jim Covello
 
That's very helpful. Thank you. Maybe for a follow
-
up, I will kind of ask 
about one of the other longer term drivers that you have talked about, the 
foundry business to kind of offset what you expect to be continued declines 
in the PC unit business over ti
me, or continued slow growth in that business 
over time. So you have talked about NAND, you have also talked about 
foundry. Could you give us a little bit of an update on the thoughts around 
foundry, bringing Altera and how its notwithstanding, you still s
ee 
incremental growth opportunities in that space, even though a lot of them, 
you can't really talk about too much publicly.
 
Brian Krzanich
 
Yeah. We do see incremental growth and as you said, there are deals and 
have [ph] that we cannot talk about publicly
. But I do see it still as a growth 
business. Its not going to be one of those ones that's going to largely move 
the needle in the next couple of years, but we do see continued growth and 
continued acquisition of customers in that space.
 
Jim Covello
 
Very h
elpful. Thanks so much. Good luck.
 
Brian Krzanich
 
Thanks Jim.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question comes from Vivek Arya of Bank of America. 
Your line is open.
 
Vivek Arya
 
Thanks. So let me ask a question; for my first question, I am wondering 
what the cur
rent run rate of losses is tied to your division, which I guess 
formerly was called Mobile Communications Group. So I know last year, on a 
quarterly basis, you were losing about $1 billion a quarter in MCG, and this 
year you have made improvement, to $800 
million for the year. So on a 
quarterly basis, Stacy, is it [indiscernible] to assume that the loss there is 
less than $900 million, so as you make improvements, it continues to be a 
source of accretion to your EPS?
 
Stacy Smith
 
I just want to be clear, we 
have completely reorganized. We no longer have 
the MCG segment. So when we talk about this, we are not talking about it in 
the context of the commitments we have made to improve the overall 
profitability of our mobile business broadly.
 
We are well on track
 
to the commitment that we made at the beginning of 
the year. As Brian said, we have kind of loomed up to having achieved 75% 
of the overall target. I did say it was a little bit back end loaded, so if you 
are doing your quarterly math, you'd probably get 
to a little bit 
--
 
you 
wouldn't be linear, you get to a little bit of a bigger reduction as we move 
into the back half relative to the first half, because the counter revenue 
dollars really ramped up for us, as we bought SoFIA into the marketplace 
and that
 
was more of a back half phenomenon for us.
 
Vivek Arya
 
Got it. And then for my follow
-
up, could you remind us, what is the core mix 
right now, and as a percentage of your PC clients, and where can it get to, 
and is that how we should think about, what dete
rmines the upper limit on 
when client ASPs start to saturate, because pricing has been an important 
part of stability in your PC division?
 
Stacy Smith
 
So we will go through some of the mix stuff in the investor meeting in 
November. The heart of your questi
on, what's driving the upside; I really a 
lot of it is segmentation. And its interesting, if you use our desktop business 
as a proxy, we have been in a low unit growth environment for a while, 
that's kind of slightly down, slightly up kind of thing. This y
ear down a bit 
more. But we have managed to maintain the profitability of that business, 
because we are seeing a lot more segmentation of the business. You still 
have the first time buyer PCs that happen in emerging markets, but 
increasingly, there is rela
tively expensive PCs that provide a lot of value to 
the consumer, in all
-
in
-
ones, and we now see dedicated gaming PCs that are 
doing quite well, and those kinds of things.
 
I think the future for us is, more segmentation of our product line. I think 
that he
lps us both from a standpoint of volume mix and should give us some 
opportunities in terms of price.
 
Vivek Arya
 
All right. Thank you.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question comes from Doug Freedman of Sterne Agee. 
Your line is open.
 
Doug Freedman
 
Hi guys. T
hanks very much for taking my question. I am going to really 
follow
-
up on one that has already been asked, let's see if I can get a little bit 
more clarity. First off, congrats on getting the 75% target of the $800 
million of savings. Do you want to introd
uce a new target, given that you are 
so far along in this, and just to try to get a handle on how much more cost 
reduction, or what your strategy is really going forward with the mobility 
side of the business. The tablet units look like they did soften her
e. So my 
question really is, what's your target for your mobility IP?
 
Brian Krzanich
 
So let me start a bit about the strategy, and we can then lay out. I think 
Stacy gave you some indication that we are well on our way, and in fact, if 
you take a look at i
t, its non
-
linear. So we should be handling $800 million 
and probably slightly above that number. How much, we are not going to 
forecast that right now. Our strategy really when you 
--
 
and as we get into 
the investor meeting, we will talk about it next yea
r. But you can assume, 
we will have another goal next year, where we do another reduction and 
improve the P&L. That's fundamental, as we said, we are going to go into 
this business to make money and we have to get there.
 
That is absolutely the 
fundamental strategy. That said, what we said around 
mobility is that, on tablets, we pretty much keep our share and our position 
in the market relatively equal to where it was, and everybody sees tablets 
have shrunk this year as a category. And so we have
 
been careful about not 
chasing the bottom as prices drop, figuring out where the value is, where we 
can go in and make a little bit of money, and actually add some innovation. 
So you're going to see some tablets as we go towards the holidays, with 
things 
like RealSense and that allow people new usages and new 
applications. And as we go into 2016, you will see more of that.
 

partnerships with people, where we can go in, we can provide 
innovation 
and the right cost model, make some money for both us and our partners, 
and we have been very
-
very careful. And that's why, we have actually said 
our bigger, longer term strategy there is modems, to the general phone 
market, and then partnership
s for specific products; and that's the Spectrum 
and Rockchip partnerships that we have right now.
 
Doug Freedman
 
Great. Terrific. Thanks for all that color. If I could, similarly, looking over at 
the Data Center business, clearly cloud has been quite an ar
ea of strength. I 
think investors continue to be concerned about your new competitors 
entering that market, some people talking about the progress ARM has 
made. Can you maybe talk about how you are feeling about your 
competitive positioning against that th
reat? Thank you.
 
Brian Krzanich
 
Absolutely. All these markets, there has always been a competitor. Whether 
you look in the PC market, or whether you look the Data Center market, or 
any of these, there has been competitors. We have worked our way up in 
this
 
position. And our goal is always, to continuously push the product 
performance and the way we think about it is, is really, what does it take to 
replace ourselves even, in this market, especially the Data Center. How do 
we do a total cost of ownership, su
ch that, it pays to go to our next 
generation, in both footprint, cost of operation and performance. All of those 
things are what we drive; that and system integration right, the whole 
[indiscernible] scale architecture and doing system integration, such t
hat it's 
simpler, quicker and cheaper for people to install a cloud based system. We 
really focused on those and just really trying to have the best performance 
we can in that space.
 
And there will always be competitors and our goal is to just consistently
 
outperform, and there will be new entrants and old entrants all along, trying 
to win share away from us. That's going to be a norm.
 
Doug Freedman
 
Great. And congratulations on the strong results.
 
Brian Krzanich
 
Thanks.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next questio
n comes from David Wong of Wells Fargo. Your 
line is open.
 
David Wong
 
Thanks very much. Your Client Computing Group, the operating margins you 
reported, jumped several percentage points in the September quarter. Can 
you give us some idea as to what you exp
ect going forward in the near 
term, and also, do you have a long term goal for operating margin for this 
Group?
 
Stacy Smith
 
So we don't forecast at that level, David. On a long term view, we will 
--
 
as 
we always do, we will give you some thoughts in terms 
of what the long 
term growth potential and overall profitability goals are, when we get to 
November.
 
In general, what you are seeing there when you look at it sequentially is, 
you're seeing a quarter where volume was up some, and we had a nice rich 
mix as 
we launched Skylake. So that helped a lot from the same point of 
profitability, quarter
-
on
-
quarter.
 
David Wong
 
Okay, great. And are there any new major product launches for Data Center 
we might expect this year, in the remaining months?
 
Brian Krzanich
 
Noth
ing that we haven't already made public. No.
 
David Wong
 
Okay, great. Thanks very much.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question comes from Romit Shah of Nomura. Your line 
is open.
 
Romit Shah
 
Yes, thank you. Had a question on the PC market. Brian, every year, 
we are 
looking for 
--
 
calling for a bottom in PCs. And last year, the units were better 
than expected, they were still down. This year has obviously been weaker. 
But now we are at the point, where you look at the supply chain as you guys 

 
fairly lean. You have got the new operating system from 
Windows plus Skylake. So it just seems like all the pieces are there for PCs 
to finally bottom, but I wanted to gauge your confidence?
 
Brian Krzanich
 
I guess my answer to that would be, I do 
believe that we are in a unique 
situation, where we have, as you said, new operating system with Windows 
10. We have our sixth generation core Skylake in place. We have a lot of 
innovation from OEMs. We have some additional product like 
--
 
our 
innovation l
ike RealSense. You will see some unique memory architectures 
next year, even 3D XPoint gets into this space. I do think that, there is a 
good point for optimism. That said, some of these transitions are going to 
take some time, and so I am very cautious of
 
people to say how fast and 
when.
 
So if you take a look at it, there is the ability to do Windows 10 upgrades 
today, but actually on
-

until later this month, that actually 
--
 
you can walk into the st
ore and get an 
on
-
shelf system with Win 10.
 
Enterprises will go, I think quicker than Win 10 than some of the prior 
generations of Windows. But still enterprise takes a while to do these kinds 
of conversions, so it will be into next year, those conversions
.
 
So I do see that this is a great opportunity, and that we should see some 

not going to be, boy next quarter it jumps. So I kind of want to lay out that 
its going to be over nex
t year or so that it takes to get this transition 
through.
 
Stacy Smith
 
If I can just add, as Brian and I talk about the business and think about it. I 
think this quarter is a great illustration point of how we view it. In a time 
period, where PC units are 
down in high single digits at the TAM level. We 
still get enough growth from the Data Center and the Memory business and 
the Internet of Things to pretty much tread water in terms of revenue 
growth, right? And you can see it in our results in Q3, in fact y
ou can see it 
in our results for the year.
 
If PC units are down in the mid
-
single digits, we actually grow at a pretty 
fast pace, and if we get to where the PC units are flat, we are growing at a 
very fast pace. That's kind of fixing the growth rate for ev
erything else, but 

the business. So we don't really need unit growth to grow the company at a 
fast pace, because we are much less dependent on the PC segment than we 
have historical
ly been and our growth really comes from 
--
 
the Data Center 
is a very large business and then we are investing in things like Memory and 
the Internet of Things business that will add some growth to that.
 
Romit Shah
 
Helpful. Thank you.
 
Mark Henninger
 
Operat
or, I think we have time for two more questions.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question comes from Ambrish Srivastava with BMO 
Capital Markets. Your line is open.
 
Ambrish Srivastava
 
Hi. Thank you, Mark. Thanks for squeezing me in. I just had a question on 
t
he gross margin Stacy. Looking at the year
-
over
-
year comparisons for 
similar revenue run rate on gross margin is going to be down about 300 
bips, is the biggest offsetting factor, on a year
-
over
-
year basis, is the 
startup costs; because unit costs should b
e getting lower, or am I not right?
 
Stacy Smith
 
No. The biggest difference compared to 
--
 
if you looked back to Q3 of 2014, 
if memory serves, I think we were at 65%, we were 63% in Q3 of this year. 
And units were down some from last year, we talked about t
his as a weaker 
TAM. So that's one piece. But the bigger piece is, 14
-
nanometer costs. And 
you're right, we are coming down the costs pretty rapidly on 14
-
nanometer, 
but its becoming a richer and richer percentage of the overall shipment mix 
and 14
-
nanomet
er still is more than 22
-
nanometer. And so we have seen a 
little bit of a mix
-
up in terms of costs, as we have worked our way through 
2015.
 
Ambrish Srivastava
 
Got it. So the cadence of the usual tick
-
tock; the cadence of the startup 

as much. So in Q1, we should be seeing an increase 
in startup costs for TAM, correct?
 
Stacy Smith
 
We are actually seeing a bit of an increase in startup costs starting in Q4. If 
you look at the Q4 margin reconciliation, you start to see that increasing 
sta
rtup costs.
 
Ambrish Srivastava
 
So it shifted more to Q4, and there won't be as much in Q1, is that the right 
takeaway there?
 
Stacy Smith
 
Well, keep in mind, the elevation started since the last, way more than one 
quarter. I am just saying, you are seeing t
he front edge of the elevated 10
-
nanometer startup costs as kind of starting as we speak.
 
Ambrish Srivastava
 
Got it. Okay. Thanks for the clarification. Thank you.
 
Stacy Smith
 
Thanks Ambrish.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our final question comes from Michael 
McConnell of Pacific Crest 
Securities. Your line is open.
 
Michael McConnell
 
Thank you. Just regarding DCG again. I think I recall in Q2, the weakness in 
enterprise was largely in China. Just in that bucket, are you starting to see 
the weakness spread out i
nto different geographic regions, or is this still 
mostly isolated in China, relative to your original expectations?
 
Brian Krzanich
 
Yes. I think we said in Q2 that it was more pronounced in China, but it was 
general across the enterprise, and that is consi
stent with what we see now. I 
just want to come back to what Brian said earlier, the overall enterprise 
segment is weak, and when you look at it, that correlates very closely for us 
over time with GDP growth rates, and the GDP growth rates are quite a bit 
less than we thought, when we started the year.
 
We are offsetting much of that 
--
 
in fact, we are offsetting most of that, by a 
cloud growth rate that's significantly more than we thought when we started 

onounced in China, but 
we see it elsewhere in the enterprise segment, being offset by, I'd say torrid 
growth rates and cloud computing, and we will share more of that when we 
get to November.
 
Michael McConnell
 
Okay, great. And then just my final follow
-
up 
would be, just relative to PC 
end demand, as far as you can tell the early part of this quarter, obviously 
we will get more signals here over the next month or so. What are you 
seeing right now with the end demand side, not necessarily the channel 
inventor
y ups and downs?
 
Brian Krzanich
 
We can't give you 

 

call.
 
Stacy Smith
 
I would just say, everything that we knew as of one o'clock this afternoon is 
reflected in our forecast.
 
Michael McConnell
 
Great
. Thank you.
 
Stacy Smith
 
Thank you.

-
GAAP 
financial measures when describing our consolidated
 
results. The earnings 
presentation and earnings release available on intc.com include the full 
GAAP and non
-
GAAP reconciliations.
 
With that, let me hand it over to Bob.
 
Bob Swan
 
Thanks ,Trey. Q3, 2019 was the best quarter in our company's history. We 
gene
rated $19.2 billion in revenue and a $1.42 in non
-
GAAP EPS, exceeding 
our guidance by $1.2 billion and $0.18, respectively. We've achieved record 
revenue both overall and in our data centric businesses while making 
continued progress on our strategic prior
ities.
 
Simply put, our ambitions have never been greater. We are growing share in 
a large and expanding $300 billion market opportunity fueled by the 
exponential growth of data, which is reshaping computing.
 
I want to start with a recap of our May Analyst 
Day and our three priorities; 
accelerating growth, improving execution, and deploying capital for 
attractive returns. First, growth. It starts with the core belief. We are at a 
key inflection point with the exponential growth of data creating massive 
deman
d for semiconductors. Cloud workloads are diversifying, networks are 
transforming, and more computing performance is moving to the edge.
 
We've been on a multi
-
year journey to reposition the company's portfolio to 
take advantage of this industry catalyst. T
oday we have the product and 
technology leadership that uniquely positions us to capitalize on these trends 
and we're investing in the IP required to help our customers win the 
inflections of the future.
 
The opportunity is massive. As we told you in May, w
e expect to generate 
$85 billion in revenue and $6 in EPS in three to four years. But that doesn't 
happen just by saying it. Achieving this goal means delivering on our 
operational and financial priorities every 90 days.
 
Growth starts with our core busines
s for our workload optimized platforms 
are winning in a highly competitive marketplace. It's now been nine quarters 
since the first Xeon Scalable processor launched and we're proud to have 
delivered over 23 million units as customers rely on Xeon to power 
their 
data
-
centric workloads.
 
In the third quarter, leading cloud customers ramped our second
-
generation 
Xeon Scalable processors with AWS, Google, and Alibaba deploying instances 
based on Cascade Lake. Customers including BP and TU Darmstadt selected 
our 
highest performance Xeon Scalable platform, the 9200 series for their 
most demanding workloads.
 
One key reason customers are choosing Xeon Scalable is the platform's 
built
-
in workload acceleration for AI. With the combination of Intel deep 
learning boost a
nd AVX
-
512 technologies, we're seeing advantages of up to 
9x in AI influence versus competitors' CPUs.
 
We also see cloud and enterprise momentum building for our breakthrough 
memory technology, Intel Optane. This quarter we announced a strategic 
collaborat
ion with Oracle. Oracle is incorporating the high performance 
capabilities of Intel Optane, DC persistent memory into its next generation 
Exadata platform, which powers high performance database infrastructure at 
most of the world's leading banks, telecoms
, and retailers.
 
And in Client Computing, we're excited that all our major PC OEM customers 
have Ice Lake designs with 18 already shipping out of a total 30 expected to 
launch this year.
 
We recently announced the next generation of Intel Xeon W
-
 
and X
-
seri
es 
processors for high
-
end desktops. These platforms lead the industry in 
bringing Intel deep learning boost powered AI acceleration into high
-
end PCs 
and mainstream workstations for the first time.
 
Available soon, these products deliver performance and va
lue that give 
enthusiasts and creators more reasons to keep choosing Intel. We've also 
embarked on a multi
-
year program called Project Athena that charts a 
course for the PC ecosystem to raise the bar on laptop innovation.
 
Amazing devices like the Dell XPS
 
13, two
-
in
-
one, and the HP Elite 
Dragonfly, that meet the Project Athena spec are already available. Our PC 
and server franchises are vital, but our ambitions are even greater.
 
We're extending our product leadership to power, and increasing the 5G and 
AI 
enabled world. We have multi
-
billion dollar networking and IoT edge 
businesses, delivering double
-
digit growth, and AI is driving significant 
revenue across our product portfolio.
 
We began investing 10 years ago in network, IT, SOC capabilities, and 
softwa
re, so that we could drive workload convergence on Intel's silicon. 
Today, we achieved number one share in the network and silicon market, 
with expected 2019 revenue of more than $5 billion growing at 12% this 
year.
 
We're also well positioned for 5G deploy
ments in 2020 and expect to grow 
our market segment share and wireless base stations to 40% by 2022. And 
we're ready for the next market inflection as 5G enabled significant new IoT 
and edge growth opportunities that extend from in
-
network and on
-
premise 
e
dge equipment to smart connected endpoints.
 
Winning here means blending the right compute performance per watt with 
the emerging killer apps of the edge. Computer vision and AI Inference 
acceleration, these are the differentiating capabilities that have pr
opelled our 
IOTG and Mobileye businesses to leadership share and a combined annual 
revenues approaching $5 billion.
 
The businesses are also growing quickly, up 18% year
-
to
-
date excluding 
Wind River. We're only at the bend of the curve in the edge opportuni
ty, and 
we're investing to lead.
 
Finally, Artificial Intelligence. AI is becoming a pervasive use case. According 
to IDC, 75% of enterprise applications will use AI by 2021, and that's why 
we're infusing AI in everything we build.
 
But this isn't just 
about the future. We are driving meaningful AI revenue 
Inside Intel now. With products spanning from the Data Center to the Edge, 
we expect to generate more than $3.5 billion in AI driven data
-
centric 
revenue in 2019, up more than 20% year
-
over
-
year.
 
We're
 
confident in our growth, but we also need to improve our execution on 
multiple fronts. First, supply, we've increased our output in response to 
stronger
-
than
-
expected demand.
 
We've invested record levels of CapEx the last two years to expand our 
capacity 
and support our customers' growth. With that investment, we've 
increased our 14
-
nanometer capacity 25% this year, while also ramping 10
-
nanometer production.
 
We expect our second
-
half PC client supply will be up double
-
digits 
compared to the first
-
half, an
d we expect to further increase our PC client 
supply by mid
-
to
-
high single
-
digits in 2020, but that growth hasn't been 
sufficient.
 
We're letting our customers down, and they're expecting more from us. PC 
demand has exceeded our expectations and surpassed t
hird
-
party forecasts. 
We now think the market is stronger than we forecasted back in Q2, which 
has made building inventory buffers difficult. We are working hard to regain 
supply demand balance, but we expect to continue to be challenged in the 
fourth quar
ter.
 
Our manufacturing process node execution is also improving. We have Fabs 
and Oregon in Israel and volume production on 10
-
nanometer and will soon 
start 10
-
nanometer production in Arizona. Yields are improving ahead of 
expectations for both client and 
data center products.
 
The Intel 10
-
nanometer product era has begun and our new 10th Gen Core 
Ice Lake processors are leading the way. In Q3, we also shipped our first 10
-
nanometer Agilex FPGAs. And in 2020, we'll continue to expand our 10
-
nanometer portfol
io with exciting new products including an AI Inference 
Accelerator, 5G base station SoC, Xeon CPUs for server storage and network 
and a discrete GPU. This quarter we've achieved power on exit for our first 
discrete GPU DG1 an important milestone.
 
As we di
scussed at the May Investor Meeting, we are accelerating the pace 
of process node introductions and moving back to a two to two
-
and
-
a
-
half 
year cadence. Our process technology and design engineering teams are 
working closely to ease process design complexi
ty and balance schedule, 
performance, power and cost.
 
We are on track to launch our first 7
-
nanometer based products, a data 
center focused discrete GPU in 2021 two years after the launch of 10
-
nanometer. We are also well down the engineering path on 5
-
nan
ometer.
 
Last, a few thoughts on our capital deployment priorities. We are confident 
in our future and our Board has approved an additional $20 billion share 
buyback authorization. We have an excellent balance sheet generate strong 
free cash flow and contin
ue to invest in R&D and CapEx to grow.
 
We've also returned 100% free cash flow to shareholders over the last 10 
years. At the same time we're making trade
-
offs. While we've increased R&D 
spending by more than a $1 billion since 2015, we have reduced our to
tal 
spending by nine points over the same period. Additionally, we have 
established clear criteria for our big bets like Mobileye, 5G and memory and 
storage.
 
Our ambitions are to play a larger role in our customers' success and 
generate attractive returns 
for our shareholders. And if we can't do both, 
we'll take swift action. We are making great progress with our Mobileye 
acquisition. We've now shipped over 12 million IQ devices this year, up more 
than 40% over the same period last year. And in the third qu
arter, we 
delivered record revenue and secured six major new design wins totaling 
nearly 10 million lifetime units.
 
We've increased our investment in 5G, but we've also announced our 5G 
smartphone modem exit and the sale of the IMFT fab to Micron. We expec
t 
those to close in the fourth quarter and we continue to take steps to improve 
3D NAND profitability and reduced memory CapEx investments, while 
evaluating a variety of partnership options that can accelerate the path to 
profitability and improve returns.
 
We are confident in our multi
-
year business plan and consistent with that we 
are increasing our buyback commitment. We expect to repurchase 
approximately 20 billion shares over the next 15 months to 18 months. We 
will fund the buyback from proceeds we gen
erate from partnerships and/or 
non
-
core asset dispositions and by returning approximately 100% of 2020 
free cash flow to investors.
 
In summary, our energies are focused on accelerating our growth, improving 
our execution and allocating our capital wisely. 
Thanks to the team for a 
great quarter.
 
And now, I'll hand the call over to George for more details on our Q3 results 
and business outlook.
 
George Davis
 
Thanks Bob, and good afternoon everyone. We had an outstanding Q3, with 
record revenue of $19.2 billion
 
approximately flat year
-
on
-
year, and $1.2 
billion higher than guide. We saw a record data
-
centric revenue of $9.5 
billion, representing just under 50% of our total revenue an all
-
time high. 
DCG, IOTG, NSG and Mobileye, all individually achieved record rev
enue in 
the quarter. PC
-
centric revenue was down 5% year
-
on
-
year on a very tough 
compare.
 
Q3 operating margin was approximately 36%, one point ahead of our guide 
on revenue strength and spending leverage. Gross margin for the quarter 
was 60.4%, modestly be
low expectations as strong flow through of higher 
DCG revenue was more than offset by mix effects of higher than expected 
NAND revenues and one
-
time impacts in NSG including the absence of an 
expected grant associated with our NAND factory.
 
Q3 EPS was $1.4
2 $0.18 above our guide. The results demonstrate strong 
top line performance, expense discipline, increased share buybacks as well 
as non
-
operational factors like lower tax rate offset by the one
-
time items in 
our NSG business. Year
-
to
-
date, we have genera
ted $11.7 billion of free 
cash flow and returned $14.3 billion to shareholders.
 
Operating margin of 36% in the quarter was down approximately four points 
versus last year as ASP strength in our server and client businesses and 
lower spending were more than
 
offset by NAND pricing degradation, changes 
in modem reserves, platform volume declines and higher cost as we ramp 
our 10
-
nanometer client products.
 
EPS was up 1% or $0.02 year
-
over
-
year as lower operating margin was 
offset by lower share count, the absen
ce of one
-
time impairments related to 
the IMFT joint venture and a lower tax rate.
 
Our non
-
GAAP tax rate in Q3 was approximately 11%, down one point 
versus last year and below our 13% guide. As we reported a better than 
expected tax benefit related to our 
non
-
U.S. sales on our recently filed 2018 
U.S. tax return as well as for the 2019 tax year.
 
Let's move to segment performance. Our Data Center Group had record 
revenue at $6.4 billion, up 4% from the prior year on our recently filed 2018 
U.S. tax return as
 
well as for the 2019 tax year.
 
Let's move to segment performance. Our Data Center Group had record 
revenue at $6.4 billion, up 4% from the prior year and up 28% sequentially. 
These results beat our expectations with platform ASPs up 9% year
-
over
-
year on s
trong adoption of our highest performance second
-
gen Xeon 
Scalable products.
 
Against the tough year
-
over
-
year compare, platform units were down 6% 
while DCG adjacencies achieved 12% revenue growth driven by our 
connectivity solutions. DCG growth segments, 
cloud and comms, now 
represent over two
-
thirds of total DCG revenue.
 
Cloud revenue was up 3% year
-
over
-
year. Returning to growth after a 
historic 2018 platform refresh as cloud service providers exited a three 
quarter passivity absorption cycle.
 
Enterprise and government revenue came in ahead of expectations growing 
1% on strong mix and better China demand while communication service 

IA
-
based solutions.
 
We estimate in Q3 tha
t the enterprise and government and communications 
service provider segment benefited from trade
-
related demand pull
-
ins of 
approximately $200 million in revenue from Q4. As a result of the strong top 
line performance, DCG achieved record quarterly operati
ng income and 
operating margin of 49% was up 13 points sequentially.
 
Our other data
-
centric businesses were up 13% year
-
over
-
year, and Q3 
marked IOTG's first $1 billion revenue quarter, up 9% year
-
over
-
year, 
underscoring Intel's expanding opportunity at th
e edge. IOTG operating 
income was down 4% year
-
over
-
year due to lower benefits from inventory 
reserves and a mix shift to lower margin products.
 
Mobileye revenue and operating income were up year
-
over
-
year 20% and 
29%, respectively on continued ADAS penetr
ation and new program 
launches.
 
NSG revenue return to growth, up 19% on continued bit growth, partially 
offset by year
-
over
-
year pricing declines. These pricing declines along with 
the one
-
time impacts discussed earlier contributed to NSG's operating loss 
of 
approximately $500 million. PSG revenue grew 2% year
-
over
-
year on 
continued strength in wireless, partially offset by softness in Cloud and 
Enterprise. And operating income was down 13% on segment product mix.
 
DCG revenue was $9.7 billion, down 5% year
-
over
-
year as ASP strength, 
partially offset lower platform volume. PC unit volumes were down 10% 
versus Q3 2018, where we benefited from drawing down internal inventory 
to satisfy demand. We continue to be supply constrained in Q3, particularly 
at the valu
e end of the market as higher than expected PC demand strength 
continues to outpace our supply despite the capacity additions that Bob 
discussed earlier.
 
Adjacencies grew 10% year
-
over
-
year, driven by strong demand for 
modems and connectivity solutions. Op
erating margin was 44% flat year
-
on
-
year as lower revenue was offset by lower spending driven by the 5G 
smartphone modem exit. Year

date, we have generated $23.3 billion in 
operating cash flow and invested $11.5 billion in CapEx.
 
We also returned 122% o
f free cash flow to shareholders through dividends 
and buybacks. During the quarter we ramped buybacks purchasing 92 
million shares at an average price of $48.78 per share.
 
Now moving to the full
-
year outlook. As a result of our strong Q3 operating 
perform
ance and momentum into Q4, we are increasing our revenue outlook 
for 2019 by $1.5 billion to $71 billion. We expect revenue from our data
-
centric businesses to be flat to slightly up for the full year and expect our 
PC
-
centric business to be flat to slight
ly down both improving versus prior 
guidance.
 
Operating margin for the year is expected to be approximately 32.5%, up 
0.5 point from our prior guide. Full year expectations for gross margin are 
unchanged at approximately 60%. We expect Q4 gross margin to b
e down 
two to 2.5 points sequentially as we continue to ramp 10
-
nanometer and will 
have sold through the previously reserved inventory consistent with prior 
expectations.
 
Expectations for full year spending are unchanged, down approximately 
$900 million ye
ar
-
on
-
year. As a result, non
-
GAAP EPS for the year is now 
expected to be $4.60, up $0.20 from our July guide on the strong top line 
performance and tight expense control. We are raising gross CapEx by $0.5 
billion to $16 billion, as a result of increased 1
0
-
nanometer and 7
-
nanometer 
investments. And we are raising our free cash flow guide by $1 billion to $16 
billion.
 
Let's turn to Q4. After adjusting for the impact of trade related pull
-
ins in 
DCG, we expect Q4 revenue of $19.2 billion, up 3% year
-
over
-
yea
r and flat 
sequentially. Data
-
centric businesses are expected to be up 6% to 8% year
-
over
-
year on continued cloud recovery and sequential NAND pricing growth.
 
Our PC
-
centric business is expected to be flat to slightly down year
-
over
-
year. We expect Q4 oper
ating margin of approximately 33.5% and a tax rate 
of 13.5%. EPS is expected to be $1.24, down sequentially on lower gross 
margin, lower below the line non
-
operational benefits and a higher tax rate. 
In summary, we are very pleased with the Company's stron
g operating 
performance and we will be very focused over the quarter on delivering a 
record year.
 
With that, let me turn it back over to Trey.
 
Trey Campbell
 
All right. Thank you, George. Moving on now to the Q&A, as is our normal 
practice, we would ask eac
h participant to ask just one question. Operator, 
please go ahead and introduce our first caller.
 
Question
-
And
-
Answer Session
 
Operator
 
Certainly. Our first question comes from the line of CJ Muse from Evercore. 
Your question please.
 
CJ Muse
 
Yeah. Good afte
rnoon and thank you for taking the question. I guess a 
question on the data center side, it's just it's 

 
to square up the numbers, it 
looks like you're suggesting DCG, up maybe 5% year
-
on
-
year. So, can you 
speak to the accuracy of that, and then I guess b
igger picture the comm 
service provider side clearly a very large source of strength for you guys, up 
11% year
-
on
-
year and now representing more than 40% of the mix. So, 
curious if you can kind of speak to the most important drivers of that 
business and ho
w you're thinking about growth over the next one, two, 
three years? Thank you.
 
Bob Swan
 
Yeah. Thanks, CJ. First, you're 

 
we gave a DC centric guide of 6% to 8%, 
and yeah, I would 

 
we didn't get DCG specifically, but I would say it's a 
little bit lower th
an our 6% to 8% data center growth. So, you're in the 
ballpark.
 
On comm service, the comms this has been an extremely important aspect 
of the business for a number of years now where we've seen the 
programmability at the network with NFV and software defin
ed networks, an 
opportunity for us to migrate the networking environment to IA architecture. 
So, we've been doing this for a number of years, it's been a source of 
growth for us over time. And in the quarter, the 11% growth was significant 
in and of itself
, but remember last year's third quarter was also up in the 
mid
-
to
-
high 20s.
 
So, we continue to make great progress. What we see going forward in this 
business is really a big opportunity in 5G so next year you're going to see 

 
yeah, our good progress has
 
been on 3G and 4G, next year we see real 
design wins that we've achieved real growth as we go into it a 5G world 
where we continue to see what we characterize as cloudification of the 
network. More and more compute moving from the cloud and data centers 
o
ut to a network in edge and that's been an opportunity for us that we've 
been invested in over the past, and we expect to be a big source of growth 
for us going forward. Thanks CJ.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Pitzer fr
om Credit 
Suisse. Your question please.
 
John Pitzer
 
Yeah. Hi. Good afternoon guys. Congratulations on the solid results. I want 
to stick with DCG Bob. If you look impressive that ASPs were up 9% year
-
over
-
year, especially as the mix shifted toward the 
comms business, which I 
believe tends to be lower ASPs. It's also happening in the quarter, where 
you're seeing your competitor ramping their next generation chips. So, I 
guess I'm trying to understand, what's the power of the Xeon Scalable 
upgrade cycle y
ou referred to in your prepared comments, what innings are 
we in, in your mind, how much of an ASP lift can that give you, and do you 
anticipate any unusual pricing action as competition heats up in this market?
 
Bob Swan
 
Boy, was that your one question, Jo
hn?
 
John Pitzer
 
Multi 

 
multiple parts.
 
Bob Swan
 
Yeah. Okay. So first I'd say in our 

 
yeah, obviously we're well into Skylake, 
but the transition now is in the Cascade Lake and that's a higher 
performance SKU. In the quarter, the high ASPs were really dri
ven by 
particularly cloud customers really move into the highest
-
end product within 
the Cascade Lake family. So, we're seeing the transition from Skylake to 
Cascade Lake and within Cascade Lake a real high performance SKU, that's 
our highest, highest perfo
rmance ASP.
 
So, that mix dynamic in Q3, I don't expect that to stay where it is. I think 
we'll go to more of a balance as we get into Q4 next year. And in terms of 
competitive dynamics, I would just say that we've got a great lineup of 
products. We got Sky
lake to Cascade Lake; first half of next year, we're 
looking at Cooper Lake. As we talked before, we're really excited about Ice 
Lake server coming out in the second half of next year, and we realize that it 
will be a more competitive environment and we've
 
tried to capture in 
essence on how we think about 2020's both demand 

 
demand equation, but 
also the margins that we flagged a little bit on the 

 
on our Q2 call or back 
at Analyst Day, I think. So good, good quarter, good momentum first half to 
second ha
lf, high performance SKUs driving real high ASPs even though 
you're right. The ASPs with comms have a tendency to be a little bit lower. I 
think that's...
 
John Pitzer
 
Perfect. Thank you.
 
Bob Swan
 
Thanks John.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question comes fro
m the line of Joe Moore from Morgan 
Stanley. Your question, please.
 
Joe Moore
 
Great. Thank you. I wonder if you could talk to the shortages a little bit 
more. And, I guess, in the context of how much you said you brought 14
-
nanometer capacity up. And I rea

a few points better and yet the shortages are intensifying. Can you just talk 
a little bit about that and when do you think we'll be in a position where you 
don't have those tensions in your business anymore?
 
B
ob Swan
 
Yeah. Thanks. Thanks, Joe. First, I'd just kind of try to put it into context. 
Over the course of the last three years, I guess, we've grown the business 
by about 20%, so $13 billion in revenue over the last three years, and the 
practical reality i
s we didn't anticipate that kind of explosive growth three 
years ago, so we didn't have the capacity in place to deal with it, and we've 
been working our tails off for the last 12 months to ensure for our customers 
that we wouldn't be a constraint on their
 
growth.
 
From the last two years, I think, as you know, we've spent over $30 billion 
in CapEx to both, have more capacity for 14, while we also begin to ramp 
10. In my prepared comments I said, we added 25% wafer start capacity 
2018 to 2019.
 
Our first half
 
to second half unit volume will be up double
-
digits. So we're 
making good progress throughout the course of the year, but our 
expectations were in the second half, we would be back in a supply/demand 
equilibrium. And the fact of the matter is we're not th
ere, because the 
demand profile that's resulted in our $1.5 billion higher revenue is just 
higher than we had anticipated. So we have more work to do to meet our 
customers' demands in the fourth quarter and going into 2020.
 
As we see fourth quarter, we're 
still going to be a constraint in our 
customers' growth, which is absolutely where we do not want to be. But with 
the higher demand, we will be constraining their growth in the fourth 
quarter.
 
But as we go into 2020, our expectations are, we'll add another
 
25% 
capacity both for 14 and 10 and that we will have particularly for PC client 
we expect to be able to do a mid
-
to
-
high single
-
digit unit volume growth 
next year and that we don't expect the market to grow that fast. But we got 
to have just more invento
ry buffers, so we're there when our customers 
need it. So Q4 will be a little challenging and 2020, we expect to be able to 
rectify things.
 
Joe Moore
 
Thank you.
 
Bob Swan
 
Thanks, Joe.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ambrish Sriv
astava 
from BMO Bank of Montreal. Your question, please.
 
Ambrish Srivastava
 
Hi. Thank you very much. Bob, I wanted to go to the triarchy and the 
cadence that you talked about bringing it back to two, two
-
and
-
a
-
half year. 
Is that 
--
 
because my understanding it is that they were just simply laws of 
physics that were causing the cade
nce to stretch out. So what problems 
have the engineers and the process folk solved out there and 
--
 
or is it just 
limited to the 7
-
nanometer. And then you would revisit that again? Thank 
you.
 
Bob Swan
 
Yeah it's a good question. Last 
--
 
back in our Analyst
 
Day, we tried to go 
through this in quite a bit of detail, both, one, kind of our lessons learned 
coming out of the challenges we had with 10 and how we're capturing those 
lessons learned as we think about the next two generations. But first our 
focus and
 
energy is right now around scaling 10.
 
And, as we said, we feel very good about the capacity we put in place, the 
products we have coming down the pipeline and the yields that we're 
achieving, almost week
-
on
-
week improvement over the last six months. So 
f
or 10, we feel really good.
 
Second, when we put the design rules in for 7
-
nanometer, we were less 
aggressive in terms of density. Our learning from going from 14 to 10 is with 
a benefit of hindsight, we were just 
--
 
we tried to scale at a 2.7 factor and 
th
at was 
--
 
that ended up putting too much invention or revolutionary nodes 
into the fab environment to meet those kind of hurdles and the learning 
from that is, we just can't hit those kind of really aggressive targets, when, 
to your point, the dynamics are
 
getting increasingly challenging. So lots of 
learnings out of 10. Our transition to 10 that we incorporated into 7, the 
design the design rules there's less complexity and for the last couple of 
years that we've been working with EUV.
 
Litho has been the c
hallenge. We've had EUV that we've been working with 
for a few years now and we expect to use EUV as we scale 7. And we 
indicated that our first product will be two years from this quarter. So fourth 
quarter of 2021, our first 7
-
nanometer product will come
 
out and our 
expectation is that we'll get back on a two
-
year cadence from 7 and beyond. 
So lots of learnings out of 10
-
nanometer that we've incorporated, and we 
said back in May and we reiterated today, we expect to be back to a two to 
two
-
and
-
a
-
half year
 
cadence going forward at least for the next few nodes.
 
Ambrish Srivastava
 
Thank you.
 
Bob Swan
 
Thanks a lot.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Pierre Ferragu from 
New Street Research. Your question please.
 
Pierre Ferragu
 
Hey, tha
nk you for taking my question. I'll ask one question, but maybe you 
have [Technical Difficulty]
 
George Davis
 
Pierre, you are breaking up
 
Pierre Ferragu
 
Okay, is it better now? Okay. So my question is really that if you look at the 
landscapes your [Technica
l Difficulty] And so my question is, what's your 
perception on the evolution with your competitive landscape in the last three 
months? Are things may be in line with what you had in mind and what you 
were expecting when we spoke over the summer? And then h
ow much of the 
footprint you have in your data center you think you can lose to competition 
with that in mind?
 
George Davis
 
Pierre, let me kind of reframe that maybe. I think you're talking about 
competition and how we feel about that or now maybe both of 
the PC and 
the data center level and I'll 
--
 
maybe I'll jump in on the PC, because I think 
the year
-
over
-
year compare on Q3 is it could be causing to some concern.
 
Just a reminder in Q3 of last year, we had basically drawn down more than 
we can have of inv
entory that 
--
 
which went into the channel and so when 
you do compares year
-
over
-
year on Q3 PC looks a little bit like on demand.
 
Really as we look over the last 90 days, we haven't seen any difference in 
our view of the competitive dynamics. We are clearl
y being impacted 
significantly on the value end of the market which is a supply issue for us. 
It's one of the reasons why we're building volume capacity 
--
 
continuing to 
build volume capacity into 2020 because we think it gives us an opportunity 
to compete
 
for those units again next year.
 
Bob, I don't know if you want to comment on the DCG side?
 
Bob Swan
 
Yeah, I'll try because I'm not exactly sure I got the question. But, you know, 

 
George Davis
 
That was, y
eah.
 
Bob Swan
 
Look it's a more competitive world. And in that world we just raised our full 
year outlook by $1.5 billion and increased our operating margins. So yeah, I 
think, competitively nothing's really changed in the last three months, six 
months, nine months relative to what we expected. And our 
--
 
the only thing 
that's really changed is our performance.
 
But we do know that going into next year that our role is to dramatically 
expand the role we play in our customers' success. So we're expa
nding the 
product, the architectures, the packaging technologies, the process 
capabilities and the software that we build.
 
So we can continue to deliver better and better product performance for our 
customers. And yeah, I'd just say that we feel 
--
 
we feel
 
really good about 
where we are. But we're not complacent by any means in terms of an 
increased competitive environment as we go into 2020.
 
Pierre Ferragu
 
Thank you.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon from 
Bernstein R
esearch. Your question please.
 
Stacy Rasgon
 
Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I was wondering if you could tell us 
within your enterprise cloud and comm businesses in DCG, in the quarter, 
how much of each of those was driven by China?
 
And given the 
$200 million pull forward across enterprise and cloud that you 
mentioned 
--
 
enterprise and comm that you mentioned, was that beef in 
enterprise relative to your expectations more or less than $200 million?
 
George Davis
 
Yeah, I think Stacy, you've got the n
umbers right. $200 million was on the 
enterprise and government and comms area and that's 
--
 
I would say it was 
more in line with our expectations once you take out that 200 number. We 
had expected it to come up a little bit, the growth year
-
over
-
year was 
definitely above our expectations and
--
 
Stacy Rasgon
 
So, by more than $200 million?
 
George Davis
 
Yeah that was 
--
 
yeah that was 
--
 
that was a fairly big number for us 
relative to our expectations.
 
Stacy Rasgon
 
So, how much of enterprise was China 
then?
 
Rob Swan
 
Yeah. Look I think in terms of the makeup of the business for data center, 
you got roughly two
-
thirds is cloud and comms and roughly one
-
third is 
enterprise and government. So, that that as you know has changed 
dramatically over the years as
 
we've continued to grow our presence in the 
cloud and as I mentioned earlier to Joe's question I think gained share in 
comms.
 
So, now we're in kind of a two
-
third/one
-
third state and enterprise and 
government was across the Board in DCG in the quarter. Th
e strength was 
much higher than we anticipated back in July. We had a first half to second 
half acceleration, but the acceleration was just more than we expected. And 
I would say we saw strength across the Board.
 
But as we look at the EMG growth in particu
lar, we're trying to determine 
what is kind of 
--
 
what has a tendency if they pull in versus what can we 
count on as we project things forward. And our best guess on our stronger 
performances of the $1.2 billion that we were over roughly $200 million of 
th
at was particularly related to enterprise and government, particularly 
related to China. Thanks Stacy.
 
Stacy Rasgon
 
Thank you.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line Timothy Arcuri from UBS. 
Your question please.
 
Timothy Arcuri
 
Thanks so much. Bob it sounds like for 10
-
nanometer, it sounds like Ice 
Lake is still on track for the second half of next year and it sounds like the 7
-
nanometer GPGPU is still on track for 2021.
 
You did talk about for the first time about 5
-
nanometer. So
, can you talk a 
little bit about how you think of make versus outsource? And really what I'm 
after is sort of anything sacred or if go into a foundry partner to make CPU 
or maybe even like a chiplet strategy. If that would eliminate a significant 
piece of
 
your competitive disadvantage, would you consider that or is that 
sort of off the table for now? Thanks.
 
Rob Swan
 
Yeah I mean first to the comment. Yeah nothing new about process relative 
to what we said at Analyst Day ramp 10 two year cadence for 7 and o
ur 
expectations at the cadence going forward to be more at two to two and a 
half year timeframe. So, intently focused on 10 now and 7 for the products 
you mentioned in the fourth quarter. So, we're investing to recapture 
process leadership going forward.
 
A
t the same time, it's going to be extremely open
-
minded about how do we 
ensure that we're building the best products and where we build them was 
--
 
is something that we will always evaluate. I think as you know with the 
other foundry players, they've been 
a source of our capacity over the years 
and our expectation is to the extent that they can do something to support 
our growth better and/or for peak kind of demands, we're always going to 
look at how do we evaluate the opportunity set that's going to posit
ion us 
best to meet our customers' demand for the growing diversity of products 
that we have in our portfolio.
 
Timothy Arcuri
 
Thanks Bob.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ross Seymore from 
Deutsche Bank. Your question, please.
 
R
oss Seymore
 
Hi, guys. I wanted to ask on gross margin. A year ago on your third quarter 
call, Bob you gave some directional commentary on what you thought for 
the out
-
year for 2019. Today, as we look into 2020. You have a lot of 
moving parts with two nodes
 
ramping 10
-
nanometer, 7
-
nanometer yields 
competition lots of moving parts admittedly. But I was hoping at least versus 
maybe the fourth quarter exit rate this year that you could give some puts 
and takes on how you're feeling about next year's gross margi
n?
 
George Davis
 
Hey, Ross. This is George. Maybe I'll take that. Actually, there is 

 
with 
respect to 2020. There is no material change to my characterization on the 
last call, where we were talking about a 58% outlook for Q4 and 57% in 
2021. And the quest
ion was well should that 

 
are those good proxies for 
2020, and my point was now we think we'll be closer to 60% than to those 
numbers. But, if you want to think about tailwinds and headwinds going into 
2020 that we look at, as we think about that number. 
So tailwinds will be 
obviously we're going to have lower modem in the mix next year.
 
Memory is starting to come out of that deep down ASP period, and we think 
volumes are going to be up as we get a little better supply and demand 
situation. The headwinds t
hat we're very mindful of is obviously 10
-
nanometer ramping is 

 
it can be a little bit of a headwind on margins, and 
also competitive impacts on ASPs. So, those are the 

 
those are the things 
that we'll continue to look at, but as we look at those today n
o material 
change at all from my previous comments.
 
Ross Seymore
 
Well, thank you.
 
Bob Swan
 
I would probably just, I guess echo. In all the complexity and all the moving 
parts 

 
George kind of flagged the 

 
where I'd characterize the four things 
that we're 
really dialing in on. One, going into next year mix is going to be 
better as our modem volume will be lower and our NSG profitability will be 
better. So, mix is going to have a 

 
mix has been a drag on 2019's gross 
margin, and it will be a big contributor 
as we go into 2020.
 
And secondly, on the first half of 2019, we had a lot of the 

 
on cost of sales 
related to pre
-
PRQ 10
-
nanometer products. So that will not repeat itself. So 
those two things are good favorable things.
 
The third thing is just George flag
ged this I just simplified. There's no 
transition and for us no transition next year is going to be 14
-
nanometer, 
we'll be a little better in terms of its profitability. Yields won't be dramatically 
different because we're extremely mature. But depreciatio
n levels will be 
lower, because a lot of these tools have been fully depreciated, there 
because we've been on that node for so long. So, for the node transition 14 
will be a little bit better.
 
Our expectation is 10
-
nanometer yields will continue to improve
, but at the 
same time the mix of 10 versus 14 will be a little bit of a wait. So, no 
transition will work against us. And we also 
-
 
we've tried the best we can 
take into account competitive dynamics as we exit this year and going into 
next year in our que
st to play a bigger role in our customers' success. We're 
going to compete to protect our position and expand the role we play. So 
those are the four things and lots of complexity and lots of moving parts, but 
we 

 
a year ago we dialed in 2019 pretty well.
 
Now, we've got to dial in 
2020 as well.
 
Ross Seymore
 
Thanks for all the detail.
 
Trey Campbell
 
Operator, I think we'll have time for two more calls.
 
Operator
 
Certainly. Our next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya from Bank of 
America. Your question
 
please.
 
Vivek Arya
 
Thanks for taking my question. Bob, you mentioned you're still facing some 
capacity shortages. I wanted to understand how you are planning capacity 
for next year. What proportion will be 14? What will be 10? And will that mix 
require a higher or similar level of capital intensity as we saw this year?
 
Bob Swan
 
Yeah. I mean, our intention next year is to not be a constraint on our 
customer's growth first and foremost. And given that, what I indicated is we 
expect to increase capa
city by 25% next year, which is the same kind of 
level that we did this year. We expect to do that again.
 
So, we believe that data center we've been in pretty decent shape, but for 
client we just want to get to mid
-
single
-
digit kind of unit output 
--
 
mid t
o 
high
-
single
-
digit unit output. So one, we can meet what we expect customer 
demand profiles to be. But also 
--
 
so, we can rebuild buffer levels of 
inventory, so we can deal with these peaks, et cetera. So, we're trying to 
put the capacity in place that we
 
think will meet the customer demand and 
try to give us the inventory buffer that has been depleted over the course of 
the last nine months or so.
 
In terms of capital, and I would just say, we'll probably give you more detail 
on that come January, but Geor
ge kind of laid out back in May a multi
-
year 
view of capital and wasn't any dramatic changes from kind of where we are 
now. But obviously that will be a function of growth.
 
George Davis
 
I would just add one thing to remind everybody is that in 2019 we made
 
a 
major shift from move to spending capital in the memory area to moving 
that capital over to expand our 
--
 
both our 10
-
nanometer and some 14
-
nanometer, we continue to add capacity in 14
-
nanometer and began adding 
capacity at 7
-
nanometer as well. So, we a
re very focused on getting the 
capacity in place that will allow us to take the word shortage out of our 
quarterly discussions.
 
Vivek Arya
 
Very good. Thank you.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our final question for today then comes from the line of Harlan 
Sur from JP
Morgan. Your question please.
 
Harlan Sur
 
Good afternoon and great job on the quarterly execution. Last time we had a 
cloud and enterprise spending digestion paused was first half of 2017. It's 
kind of the same setup as is passed by similar to 2017. DCG had
 
strong 
second half growth, and in fact back in 2017 it kicked off what was a four or 
five quarter period of strong spending by your cloud customers. Do you guys 
get a sense in discussions with your customers that the spending 
reacceleration is sustainable
 
for the next few quarters? I mean if I look at 
things like compute workload growth that continues at a strong pace. 
Workload themselves are getting more complex and so, just wanted to get 
your views on sustainability of this strong growth profile in DCG i
nto next 
year.
 
Bob Swan
 
Yeah. So, to 
--
 
I think the trends, the macro trends that we see haven't 
subsided at all. And that is this insatiable appetite for the creation of data 
and the need to compute 
--
 
process store move make that data more 
relevant.
 
Thos
e macro trends have been very 
--
 
had been very attractive for the long 
--
 
for a while. And we expect those to continue, but to your point, the 
--
 
our 
experience with the cloud providers as they go through big buying cycles 
and then relatively long digestio
n periods.
 
What we did experience last year was a gang 
--
 
gang
-
buster year. But it's 
been three quarters coming into the third quarter, where they went through 
digestions. And what we started to see in the third quarter was particularly 
for high performanc
e compute started to see them come back into the 
market to really begin to 
--
 
begin to purchase a little bit more.
 
So how long that cycle lasts is going to be a function of several variables. 
But yes their end demand seems to continue to be relatively stro
ng. And 
therefore, they need to add capacity. We think will follow their end demand, 
given they have been out of the market a little bit for about three quarters 
now 
--
 
up to 
--
 
up till Q3.
 
Harlan Sur
 
Thank you.
 
Trey Campbell
 
Thanks Harlan. And we're going
 
to hand the call back over to Bob for some 
closing comments.
 
Bob Swan
 
Yeah. Look thanks for 
--
 
thanks for joining us. We feel great about the 
quarter, it's 
--
 
we're looking at 
--
 
we had a record quarter where about 
raising our outlook for the full year.
 
T
he market we see, the trends we see, are as big as they've ever been. And 
we're really focused on continuing to deliver for our customers. 10
-
nanometer area is now. We're ramping a multitude of products, we have 
increased confidence, in 5
-
nanometer.
 
And as
 
we mentioned, for seven and five getting back to a two
-
and
-
a
-
half 
two year cadence is what we're focused on. And we're confident in the 
future. And you're seeing both in the first nine months of the year as well as 
with our higher share buyback that we're
 
putting your money where 
--
 
to 
work to reduce the flow.
 
Because we think there is disconnect between the intrinsic values of the plan 
we shared with you back in May and how we're trading. So, with our balance 
sheet we're taking advantage of that.
 
So thank
s for 
--
 
thanks for joining us. Thanks for your questions. And we'll 
talk to you soon. Thank you.

Before we begin, let me remind everyone that today's discussion contains 
forward
-
looking statements based on the environment as we currently see it 
and as such does include risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our press 
release for more information on
 
the specific risk factors that could cause 
actual results to differ materially.
 
A brief reminder that this quarter, we have provided both GAAP and non
-
GAAP financial measures. Today, we will be speaking to the non
-
GAAP 
financial measures when describing o
ur consolidated results. The earnings 
presentation and earnings release available on intc.com include the full 
GAAP and non
-
GAAP reconciliations.
 
With that, let me hand it over to Bob.
 
Bob Swan
 
Thanks, Mark. The second quarter was significantly stronger th
an we 
forecasted in April and our results demonstrated our customer's preference 
to the performance of Intel XPUs as workloads grow, diversify, and become 
increasingly complex. That leads for performance manifested in strong mix 
in ASPs across the business
. Our Q2 results are proof points for the 
megatrends that underpin our strategy. The world's insatiable appetite for 
data is driving demand for solutions to process, store and move it faster and 
better.
 
Customers want to work with partners, who can deliver
 
performance and 
platforms to address their most important technology challenges. Our data
-
centric businesses overall performed roughly in line with our April 
expectations. Data center and IoTG customers chose our highest
-
performing 
products leading to str
ong mix in ASPs. While our cloud customers absorb 
capacity they put in place over the last year, we continue to expect cloud 
demand to improve in the second half.
 
Enterprise and government spending remains weak however, particularly in 
China. PC demand con
tinued to improve particularly in the commercial 
segment. We now expect the PC TAM to be up slightly for the full year. 
Strong demand for our highest
-
performing products and the productivity and 
TCO gains they deliver continues.
 
Mix was stronger than we an
ticipated. While small core supply improved we 
were not able to fully satisfy customer demand for these SKUs in the second 
quarter. Tariffs and trade uncertainties created anxiety across our customers 
supply chain and drove a pull
-
in of client CPU orders i
nto the second quarter. 
We also halted shipments to certain customers in response to the U.S. 
government's revised entity list. After a thorough review, we were able to 
resume shipments of some products in compliance with regulations and the 
net impact on 
the second quarter was limited.
 
While we hope and expect trade issues to be resolved, further tightening of 
export restrictions would come with revenue risk to our business. As a 
result, we entered the second half of the year a little more cautious than we
 
were 90 days ago.
 
We met with many of you in May at our investor meeting, where we outlined 
three major thrusts of our game plan to transform our company and grow. 
First, we're pursuing the largest opportunity in our company's history a 
nearly $300 billio
n TAM comprised not just of CPUs for PCs and servers, but 
of XPUs and adjacent technologies for an incredibly wide range of workloads 
and devices. Second, we're strengthening our product leadership by 
accelerating the rate of innovation. And third, we're e
volving our culture and 
improving our execution so that we can play an even greater role in our 
customer's growth and success.
 
I'll take a few minutes to share some of the progress we're making. I'll start 
with expanding our opportunity and expanding our T
AM. Over the last few 
years, we have dramatically expanded our served market, while the PC 
market was declining. Our served market now is more than five times larger 
and growing faster and we have reallocated spending to expand our 
capabilities in higher g
rowth areas.
 
We are evolving Intel Inside from a CPU inside a PC to XPUs inside 
everything that processes stores and moves data. Big bets in 5G, AI and 
autonomous systems are an important part of this transformation. In May, I 
outlined a disciplined framew
ork for investing in and evaluating big bets as 
we expand into new markets. First, we'll invest where we have an 
opportunity to lead major technology inflection.
 
Second, our investments should allow us to play a larger role in our 
customers' success. And f
inally, they must show a clear path to profitability 
and attractive returns. Network infrastructure, which is transforming as the 
industry transitions to 5G, is one of our most important areas of investment 
and we are laser
-
focused on this opportunity. Thi
s business is growing at a 
40% CAGR since 2014 from just over $1 billion in revenue to more than $4 
billion last year.
 
The network cloudification that comes with 5G expands our opportunity in 
the core network and at the edge, as more data moves closer to w
here it is 
created. We expect to be in production on Snow Ridge, Intel's 10
-
nanometer 
system
-
on
-
chip technology for 5G base stations early next year. We've 
already announced that two large telecom equipment manufacturers have 
committed to this architecture
 
and we're on track to 40% share in this 
market segments by 2022.
 
While the 5G network opportunity meets each of our investment criteria, the 
5G smartphone opportunity does not. This is why we decided to exit the 5G 
smartphone modem business and conduct an
 
analysis of our options for the 
remaining parts of that portfolio.
 
Today, we announced the sale of the majority of our 5G smartphone modem 
business to Apple. This deal preserves Intel's access to critical IP we have 
developed. It enables us to focus on th
e more profitable 5G network 
opportunity where we are growing and winning share. Another growth 
market we're gaining share is the Internet of Things. We are using our 
architecture accelerators and software assets, combined with unmatched 
scale and partners
 
to develop one of the industry's fastest
-
growing IoT 
portfolios.
 
Taken together, the IoTG and Mobileye businesses grew at 22% over last 
year after adjusting for the sale of Wind River. More intelligence is moving to 
the edge and more industries want to ha
rness the power of data to create 
business value innovate and grow. Devices and systems are becoming more 
autonomous. This is a trend IoTG is shaping and capitalizing on. Our team's 
work is producing outstanding results.
 
In the second quarter, we grew at r
oughly 3x the market rate and are 
positioned to significantly outgrow the market over time. Here again, we saw 
demand for performance and strength across all verticals we served with 
computer vision being an especially critical workload. Mobileye is positi
oned 
to lead another huge opportunity, autonomous driving. This business has 
grown at more than 30% CAGR since we acquired them in 2017.
 
Our market leadership continues to build momentum with 20 new design 
wins this year, representing 11 million lifetime u
nits. Nissan's ProPILOT 2.0 
and NIO's pilot vehicles have begun production featuring Mobileye base L2+ 
system for hands
-
free assisted driving technology. I visited the Mobileye 
team in Israel last month and was treated to an autonomous ride through 
the str
eets of Jerusalem. The progress we are making in Level four and Level 
five autonomy is extraordinary. Our mobility as a service JV with VW for 
deploying a commercial robotaxi service in Tel Aviv by 2022 is on track.
 
Global coverage of REM or Road Experienc
e Management mobilized real
-
time 
crowdsourced mapping capability is expanding rapidly. Several major auto 
OEMs, most recently Ford, are adopting this breakthrough data
-
centric 
capability.
 
To understand the power of this data consider this; 1.5 million kilo
meters is 
sent to the cloud daily for BMW production vehicles. With the data collected 
from just the last four weeks, Mobileye was able to automatically map 94% 
of the German Autobahn and motorway network.
 
And the commercial opportunity for REM extends bey
ond real
-
time maps for 
vehicles. Since announcing the agreement earlier this year, Mobileye and 
Ordnance Survey have jointly launched a service that delivers high
-
precision 
road network location data to companies across multiple sectors.
 
Artificial intelligence is a $10 billion data center silicon opportunity by 2023. 
And today it's fueling cloud customer demand for solutions that accelerate 
demand in AI workloads. This is evidenced by the fact that key cloud 
customers, most recently Baidu
, are collaborating on our Nervana Neural 
Network Processor for Training or NNP
-
T.
 
NNP
-
T will sample to customers later this year expanding our already diverse 
AI portfolio which spans multiple architectures including ASICs like NNPI, 
TPUs, GPUs, and FPGAs
, all unified by single programming model, One API.
 
The second major element of our game plan is extending product leadership 
by accelerating the rate of innovation. The future of computing will require a 
solution
-
oriented mindset building on six pillars o
f innovation.
 
Over the last 50 years, Intel has delivered breakthrough
-
after
-
breakthrough 
in computing performance that has propelled technology and society 
forward. We are far from finished as our product and customer 
announcements over the last quarter d
emonstrate.
 
Our Data Center Group just announced a very important strategic 
partnership with SAP to optimize Intel's platforms including Xeon Scalable 
processors and Optane DC persistent memory for SAP's end
-
to
-
end 
enterprise software applications includin
g SAP S/4HANA.
 
For over a decade, we have worked closely with SAP and developing 
differentiated breakthrough technologies that make organizations run more 
efficiently. The broadening of our strategic partnership with SAP will allow 
our mutual customers to 
accelerate the organization's digital transformation 
by deploying SAP business applications optimized for Intel
-
based 
infrastructure in the cloud, on
-
premises, and in hybrid environments.
 
Our ecosystem partners have already received Icelake server samples.
 
We 
are making good progress on Icelake server and are now planning to start 
production wafers in the first half of 2020 with the volume ramp in the 
second half of the year. Both yield and defect density are ahead of schedule 
for our 10
-
nanometer data cent
er products.
 
Cascade Lake, which is ramping now, is on track to be one of our fastest 
ramping products ever and we have a great solution for our customers in the 
first half of 2020 with Cooper Lake in the same platform as Icelake.
 
We are working more deepl
y with our customers to understand their needs 
and become the partner that they rely on to innovate and grow their 
businesses. They challenge us. It's producing results and it's making us 
better.
 
For example in the second quarter, we announced a strategic 
partnership 
with Google to collaborate on Anthos, a new reference design based on the 
second
-
generation Xeon Scalable processor and an optimized Kubernetes 
software stack that will deliver increased workload portability to customers 
who want to take advant
age of hybrid cloud environments.
 
These deep customer engagements are frankly one of my favorite parts of 
the role. We are constantly thinking about how we can help our data center 
customers harness the potential of data by processing, storing, and moving 
it more efficiently. And a central part of the equation is interconnect 
technology, which is why we recently announced our intention to acquire 
Barefoot Networks. Barefoot Networks is an emerging leader in Ethernet 
switch silicon software with the programm
ability and flexibility necessary to 
meet the performance needs of the hyperscale cloud. We closed the 
transaction this week and we are excited to have the Barefoot team as part 
of the Intel family.
 
Our client computing customers can look forward to exciti
ng new Intel 
products this year. In the second quarter, we launched a special edition of 
the world's best gaming processor the Core i9
-
9900KS. We also launched 
our new 10th Gen Core product family codenamed Ice Lake which integrates 
Wi
-
Fi 6, Gen11 graphics
 
and AI acceleration. While we are delivering on the 
present we are also creating the future.
 
Intel Labs is researching completely new architectures like quantum and 
neuromorphic computing that promise incredible leaps in performance and 
power efficiency. 
Neuromorphic computing strives to emulate the neural 
structure and operation of the human brain, which could deliver big 
advancements in artificial intelligence by allowing computers to sense, learn 
and behave more naturally and efficiently.
 
Just this mont
h, we announced an eight million neuron neuromorphic system 
comprising 64 Intel Loihi research chips that's now available to the broader 
research community. Finally, we are evolving our culture and improving 
execution because our customers are counting on 
us.
 
Our process technology road map continues to improve and we're making 
excellent progress on 10
-
nanometer. We began shipping Ice Lake clients in 
the second quarter supporting systems on the shelf for the holiday selling 
season and expect to ship Agilex,
 
our first 10
-
nanometer FPGA later this 
year.
 
We now have two factories in full production on 10
-
nanometer. We are also 
on track to launch 7
-
nanometer in 2021. With a roughly 2x improvement in 
density over 10
-
nanometer, our 7
-
nanometer process, which will 
be 
comparable to competitors' 5
-
nanometer nodes, and will put us on pace with 
historical Moore's Law scaling.
 
We're also making steady progress increasing CPU supply. Through our 
investments, focused execution and tighter customer collaboration, we 
expect 
our PC CPU supply will be up mid single
-
digits this year, while we 
expect the PC TAM to grow slightly. We'll continue to work with our 
customers to meet their required product mix and ramp additional capacity 
to ensure we are not a constraint on their grow
th.
 
A final point of pride in the second quarter that speaks to Intel's values is 
the release of our annual Corporate Responsibility Report, which highlights 
the progress made over the last year toward our 2020 goals around 
environmental sustainability, su
pply chain responsibility, diversity and 
inclusion and social impact.
 
We achieved a number of our 2020 goals ahead of schedule: energy 
conservation, non
-
hazardous waste recycling, workforce diversity and 
technology empowerment. Being responsible stewards o
f the communities in 
which we operate is central to our culture and it is helping us transform and 
deliver the results you expect of us. I'm proud of what our team has 
accomplished over the last quarter and look forward to sharing more proof 
points of our 
progress with you in the coming months.
 
With that, I'll hand off to George, who will take you through the financial 
details.
 
George Davis
 
Thanks, Bob and good afternoon everyone. We had a solid Q2 with revenue 
coming in at $16.5 billion, down 3% year
-
on
-
ye
ar and higher by $900 
million compared to our guide. Data
-
centric revenue was $7.7 billion, down 
7%. And PC
-
centric revenue was $8.8 billion, up 1% year
-
on
-
year.
 
Our Q2 operating margin was 31%, down two points as client ASP strength 
was more than offset b
y platform volume declines and continued NAND 
pricing degradation. Q2 earnings per share came in at $1.06, up 2% year
-
on
-
year and $0.17 over our guide for the quarter. Year
-
to
-
date, we have 
generated $5.7 billion of free cash flow, returned $8.4 billion to
 
shareholders, paid dividends of $2.8 billion, and repurchased approximately 
117 million shares.
 
As mentioned last quarter, we anticipated a more challenging year in 2019 
coming off a large build
-
out of capacity in 2018 by DCG customers as well as 
the pric
ing dynamics in memory, which is largely playing out as expected. In 
light of these factors I'm pleased with our results and operating performance 
for the quarter.
 
Non
-
GAAP EPS was up 2% year
-
over
-
year driven by strength in our platform 
ASPs, lower 10
-
nano
meter startup costs, lower operating expenses, as well 
as lower shares outstanding and a McAfee dividend.
 
Offsetting factors were data centric demand softness, continued NAND 
pricing pressure and PC supply constraints, impacting our ability to fulfill 
low
-
end PC demand. Our non
-
GAAP tax rate came in at around 12% in line 
with last year.
 
Let's now turn to segment performance. Our Data Center Group ended the 
quarter with revenue at $5 billion, down 10% from the prior year and up 2% 
sequentially. This was slig
htly ahead of our expectations with platform ASPs, 
up 2% year
-
on
-
year.
 
Xeon ASPs were up double digits year
-
on
-
year on mix as our customers 
continue to select high
-
performance products. Against the tough year
-
over
-
year compare platform units were down 12%.
 
Cloud revenue was down 1% year
-
over
-
year as cloud service providers 
absorbed capacity after growing demand 40% in 2018. Enterprise and 
government revenue declined by 31% with particular weakness in China 
while communication service provider's 
revenue increased 3% year
-
over
-
year. We see comms service provider demand still in the early phase of a 
meaningful 5G
-
related build
-
out.
 
Overall, our other data
-
centric businesses were down 1% year
-
over
-
year or 
up 2% excluding Wind River on strength in our
 
Internet of Things 
businesses, partially offset by ASP weakness in our memory business.
 
Our Internet of Things businesses, which include IOTG and Mobileye 
continue to show growth and delivered record revenue, up 22% excluding 
Wind River. IOTG showed stren
gth across all segments with revenue growth 
of 23% year
-
over
-
year excluding Wind River and operating income growth of 
21% on strong demand for higher
-
performance products in the quarter. We 
believe a portion of the revenue outperformance in IOTG is from ta
riff
-
related pull
-
ins.
 
Our Mobileye revenue and operating margin were up year
-
over
-
year 16% 
and 20%, respectively on continued ADAS penetration. Our memory 
business revenue was down 13% as the industry supply surplus continue to 
feed a deteriorating NAND p
ricing environment.
 
NSG operating income weakened by approximately $220 million year
-
over
-
year. PSG revenue declined 5% year
-
over
-
year as softness in cloud and 
enterprise demand more than offset growth in 5G wireless. Advanced 
products, which includes thos
e manufactured on 28
-
nanometer through 14
-
nanometer process nodes grew 15% year
-
on
-
year. PSG operating margin 
was down 49% year
-
over
-
year on lower revenue, product mix and 10
-
nanometer road map investments.
 
The Client Computing Group demonstrated strong ex
ecution this quarter 
with revenue up 1% year
-
over
-
year on mix driven ASP strength, strong 
demand in commercial PCs and modems and $200 million to $300 million in 
revenue from order pull
-
ins due to trade and tariff concerns.
 
We believe the PC TAM grew sligh
tly in Q2, led by our commercial PC 
demand. Our PC units were down 5% as our small core supply was 
constrained and we cannot fulfill all of our customer demand. We have made 
significant progress against our supply challenges and we expect supply and 
demand
 
to return to balance in the second half.
 
That said, demand has been stronger than expected and product mix will 
continue to be a challenge in the third quarter as our teams work to align 
available supply with demand.
 
We saw strong ASPs in the quarter with
 
notebook ASPs, up 3% year
-
over
-
year and desktop ASPs, up 5%. Operating margin for our client group was 
42%, up five points year
-
on
-
year on strong revenue and mix and lower cost 
of sales post qualification of our 10
-
nanometer Icelake client product.
 
For th
e first two quarters, we generated $12.5 billion in operating cash flow. 
And we invested $6.9 billion in capital to ramp 10
-
nanometer capacity and 
for 7
-
nanometer product development.
 
We also spent $5.6 billion to repurchase 117 million shares to date. Buy
back 
was accelerated in the second quarter, where our average purchase price 
was $46.78 per share. We have $11.7 billion remaining on our Board 
authorization.
 
Now let's talk about the full year outlook. For the full year, the market 
dynamics reflected in o
ur April guide remain largely in place, although, 
memory has continued to weaken relative to our expectations.
 
Although we have seen a weaker first half in our data center business, we 
expect a better second half as demand from cloud and comms service 
prov
iders, improves and our second Gen, Xeon Scalable continues to ramp.
 
We are increasing our revenue outlook for the full year by $500 million to 
$69.5 billion to reflect the out performance in the second quarter, somewhat 
offset by the effect of trade
-
relat
ed pull
-
ins and a weaker memory 
environment.
 
We continue to expect revenue from our data
-
centric businesses to be down 
low single digits for the full year.
 
Our guidance for full year PC
-
centric business growth, remains a low single
-
digit decline for the ye
ar, reflecting share loss in small core applications, 
where we have been short supply longer than expected and demand has 
remained healthy.
 
We expect to have additional small core forward supply in the second half 
which should allow us to regain some of th
at lost share. Operating margin 
for the year is expected to be 32% flat to our previous guide. Full year 
expectations for gross margin are unchanged at approximately 60%.
 
We expect Q3 gross margins to be roughly line with Q2, on strong flow
-
through of high
er revenue offset by increased 10
-
nanometer cost as we 
ramp production. The cost increase in Q3 will be tempered, as we will be 
selling through some of the previously reserved 10
-
nanometer in the 
quarter. And we see the benefit of a grant related to our NA
ND factory in 
China.
 
We expect Q4 gross margin to be down 3 points to 3.5 points sequentially, 
as we continue to ramp 10
-
nanometer. And will have sold through the 
previously reserved inventory. And will also not see the benefits of the NAND 
grant.
 
We are m
aking great progress on 10
-
nanometer. And expect to see 
continued yield improvement as we move into 2020. And work through the 
cost curve. Full year spending is expected to be down almost $1 billion year
-
on
-
year, in line with our prior outlook, adjusted fo
r cost related to our 
acquisition of Barefoot Networks.
 
We are now expecting 2019 savings from our modem exit to rise to 
approximately $400 million to $500 million from our earlier estimates of 
$200 million to $300 million. The increased savings are being 
offset by 
higher spending on 10
-
nanometer and 7
-
nanometer processes and product 
R&D.
 
Earnings per share for the year, is now expected to be $4.40 up $0.05 from 
our April guide, reflecting higher Q2 earnings offset somewhat by the impact 
of tariff pull
-
ins 
on the second half, weaker memory and a slightly higher full 
year tax rate.
 
We now expect the non
-
GAAP tax rate for Q3 and Q4 to be approximately 
13% up slightly from our April guide as we anticipate a higher mix of lower 
pre
-
tax income in the second half 
and higher tax demands.
 
Turning to Q3 outlook, we expect revenue of $18 billion up 9% sequentially, 
which is within our normal seasonal range after adjusting for trade
-
related 
pull
-
ins in Q2. Our data
-
centric and PC
-
centric businesses will be down mid
-
sing
le digits year
-
over
-
year in Q3 against very challenging compares.
 
We expect Q3 operating margin of 35% and non
-
GAAP EPS of $1.24, on 
higher sequential revenue particularly in PC, data center and IoT.
 
I will conclude here. And turn the call back to Mark.

All right. Thank you, George. Moving on now to the Q&A. [Operator 
Instructions] Operator, please go and introduce our first caller.
 
Question
-
and
-
Answer Session
 
Operator
 
Certainly, our first question comes from the line of Chris Danely from 
Citigroup. Your question please.
 
Chris Danely
 
Hey! Thanks guys. Just a question on share expectations, I know in the 
Analyst Day you expected the competitive environment to get a little more 
-
-
 
I guess a little more competitive, although it doesn't seem ha
ppening in 
Q2. And maybe you can talk about how you expect your share to trend over 
the next four to six quarters in light of the competitor coming out with 7
-
nanometer and then you guys introducing 10
-
nanometer later on. Do you 
think you'll maybe lose sha
re over the next three to four quarters and then 
gain it back? Or how should we think about things are going to play out?
 
Bob Swan
 
Hey, Chris, it's Bob. First, I would say that during the course of this year as 
George mentioned in his prepared comments, we
 
lost a little bit of share in 
the second quarter, particularly in CSG at the low and small core, primarily 
due to supply constraints. And our expectation is that we'll begin to work our 
way back in the second half of the year given the capacity we put in 
place to 
have more supply and meet our customers' demand. But stepping back and 
just looking at the macro environment over the next several years and 
particularly in the second half of the year on the data center side, what 
we've indicated is it will be a 
much more competitive environment.
 
Our intentions are with a 
--
 
not a 90% share position, but more like a 23% 
share position that we have significant prospects for growth across multiple 
aspects of our business. And our intentions are over the 
--
 
over that
 
time 
frame to continue to grow our data
-
centric collection of businesses at or 
above market rates to grow. So that's consistent with what we said back in 
January. We reiterated it again at our May Investor Day and nothing's really 
changed from that standp
oint. Thanks, Chris.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ross Seymore from 
Deutsche Bank. Your question please.
 
Ross Seymore
 
Okay. So a two
-
part question on the Data Center Group. I guess first and 
foremost, could you just discuss 
a little bit about the differences between 
the sub segments? The cloud side was impressively strong in the quarter 
and it sounds like you think it's going to continue. But the enterprise and 
government side, I know you said that was China specific, but tha
t was 
exceedingly weak. Any more color on what's going on and that enterprise 
side in the current quarter and probably of equal if not greater importance 
the second half looks like you still expect a really big ramp and potentially 
better than seasonal. Wh
at gives you the confidence in the second half ramp 
in DCG?
 
Bob Swan
 
Yeah. Hey, Ross, it's Bob. I'll comment and then George will pile on. First on 
growth overall we had 
--
 
cloud I'd still put in the relatively soft category to 
the first half of the year a
s the cloud players continue to digest. And our 
expectations have been and still are that cloud will get a little bit stronger as 
we go into the second half. And as George mentioned, comms has been low 
single
-
digits as our customers begin to build up for t
he transition to 5G, so 
we expect that growth to probably materialize more as we go into the latter 
part of this year, but I think more in 2020.
 
Enterprise and government has been brutal through the first six months of 
the year. Q1 was really soft. Q2 was 
even softer. And while we don't like it, 
it's been pretty much in line with how we expected the first half and even 
the second half of the year to kind of play out. A couple of dynamics. You'll 
remember last year was really strong for enterprise and govern
ment. 
Growth was much stronger than we expected. Our belief at the time is that 
that was largely a function of increased digital transformation by CIOs, a 
favorable tax reform environment that gave them a little more capacity to 
spend. And we benefited fro
m that tremendously last year.
 
So the first half of this year even the second half comps 
--
 
or comps are 
much tougher. And I would say our sense is that CIOs broadly speaking are 
a little more cautious as they go into the second half of the year. And then 
when you just take 
--
 
that's a broad
-
based comment. And then when you 
take China into account, China is even worse than that. So our thoughts to 
the first half of the year and even going into the second half of the year is 
the E&G environment won't get dra
matically better. Cloud will get a little bit 
stronger and comms will get a little bit stronger in the context of our overall 
full year guide.
 
George Davis
 
Yes. I would just add that we 
--
 
again we saw enterprise and government 
down 31% year
-
over
-
year. I w
ould say, maybe a little bit weaker than even 
we were forecasting which is for a pretty weak performance in that group. 
But in general, I wouldn't add any more to what Bob said.
 
Ross Seymore
 
Thanks a lot.

Thank you. Our next question comes from th
e line of Stacy Rasgon from 
Bernstein Research. Your question please.
 
Stacy Rasgon
 
Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. So we have gross margins coming 
down into Q4, you're probably in the low to mid
-
58%. And I know at the 
Analyst Day, you sort of gave
 
an indication for gross margins in like the 
2021 time frame to be around 57% on a $77 billion number. I guess how do 
I think about the trajectory from where we're exiting this year to the gross 
margin profile in 2021? Does that imply that 2020 gross margi
ns should be 
down from obviously 2019, and 2021 should be down from 2020? And then 
what happens if you actually don't hit your revenue guidance of $77 billion in 
2021, because the margins impact is mostly fixed? Does that imply margins 
come down even more 
in that case?
 
George Davis
 
I think 
--
 
hey, Stacy. It's George. We did say that we think we'll bottom out 
at 57% in 2021. We didn't guide specifically for 2020, but implied it would 
be closer to the 60% range. And I would say, one of the things that's going
 
to help us 
--
 
two things that are probably going to help us as we think about 
2019 to 2020. One is we're going to see more of the benefit of moving up 
the yield curve in 10
-
nanometer, which is pretty painful now and you're 
seeing that really in the fourth
 
quarter gross margin. I would also say, 
though you're seeing a really pure impact of memory in the fourth quarter 
as well, because we have a grant in the third quarter. So, you're going to 
see a sequential step down just because of the absence of the gran
t, and it 
just tells you how much the impact on gross margin overall for the DC
-
centric group has been because of memory.
 
I think memory, if we can start to see improvement on that in 2020, and 
there's some evidence of firming of the ASPs, but probably too
 
early to call 
that. I think that could also be a factor. But you're also seeing growth in our 
adjacent businesses, which have attractive margins. They'll continue to grow 
into 2020. And like I said, I think largely it's going to be 10
-
nanometer yield 
curv
e benefits, maybe a little bit improving memory and then improving 
adjacent businesses should be a little more positive than what we're seeing 
purely in Q4.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri from 
UBS. Your 
question please.
 
Timothy Arcuri
 
Hi, thanks. I had a question for George. So George, I'm just trying to figure 
out the incremental accretion from the sale of the modem business. It 

e 
investing more in 7 and 10
-
nanometer. So I'm just wondering why that 
would be the case if yields are on track. Thanks, George.
 
George Davis
 
Well, one of the things that we talked about Tim was trying to pull in as 
much as possible both the 10
-
nanometer a
nd 7
-
nanometer road map, 
because we think the economics of that is more than worth the investment. 
And really the investments we're making now are all focused on executing 
for that. We're going to see more accretion from this deal coming in the 
following y
ear when we would expect a significant increase in the reduction, 
and sort of the run rate OpEx for the piece that's going out at the end of the 
year. So maybe $400 million to $500 million this year, but you can probably 
double that number for next year, w
hich we think will help on the total 
spending.
 
And the question is will we need to retain this higher level run rate that 
we're seeing today for acceleration fully into next year? I think there might 
be some opportunity there as well. But we're going to 
--
 
we're going to 
invest first in those things that we think drive yield improvement in 10 and 
product performance improvement in 10 and 7.

Thank You. Our next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur from 
JPMorgan. Your question please.
 
Harlan Su
r
 
Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe just again to kind of 
step back from the data
-
centric businesses. On the revised full year outlook, 
you're still guiding data
-
centric to be down low single
-
digits year
-
over
-
year. 
Previously within data
-
centric you guys were looking for DCG specifically to 
be down mid
-
single digits year
-
over
-
year which implies about 20% growth in 
DCG second half versus first half. Is that still how the team sees DCG for the 
full year?
 
Bob Swan
 
I would say we're still rou
ghly in that ballpark. We haven't really changed 
our view of the full year to maybe a little bit that slipped into the first half 
relative to our original second half expectations on the pull
-
ins even though 
it's more of an impact on the PC side that we sa
w a little bit of that in DCG. 
So now we're looking to a strong second half for DCG.
 
Harlan Sur
 
Great. Thank you.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya from Bank 
of America Merrill Lynch. Your question please.
 
Vivek Arya
 
T
hanks for taking my question. On inventory they were up about 12% 
sequentially in terms of dollars. And now when I look at your second half 
sales, you're forecasting them to grow 13% to 14% half over half so it kind 
of makes sense. But just inventory in te
rms of historical levels they're still 
quite elevated given the macro conditions. So is this all 10
-
nanometer
-
related inventory? Just what's driving this? How do you see it trending in the 
second half? And will there be any impact on the gross margins from
 
any 
utilization changes that might be needed?
 
George Davis
 
Sure. Great question. And we're watching inventory very closely ourselves. 
The big bounce this quarter as you suspected was really about 10
-
nanometer within finished goods coming onto the balance 
sheet. And so 
there is actually some gross margin benefit which we began to see this 
quarter and we'll see a little bit next quarter previously reserved inventory 
then flowing into the marketplace so some gross margin benefit from that 
and you've seen that
 
in the CCG margins.
 
We 
--
 
yes, normally we'll be up going into the seasonally strong third and 
fourth quarters in this quarter. I would say overall that we think the 
--
 
add 
this quarter which are all related to 10
-
nanometer make sense. I think we 
feel sti
ll that our inventory is higher than we would like in memory and we 
will look to bring that down over time. It's a very tough market to bring it 
down and then feel good about yourself. So we'll continue to watch that. But 
that's been part of the pressure o
n free cash flow has been some of these 
working capital particularly inventory impacts.
 
A 

 
Bob Swan
 
To George's point the 
--
 
while we're not big fans of growing inventory we 
feel great about qualifying the Icelake product in the second quarter. And 
that q
ualification is the single biggest reason for the step function and 
inventory from Q1 to Q2. So we knew if we executed on our plans of the 
Icelake clients qualifications we'd have a step
-
function inventory and we feel 
good about getting that qualification 
done and behind us. The implications of 
that is the higher balance in Q2 versus Q1.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Pitzer from Credit 
Suisse. Your question please.
 
John Pitzer
 
Yeah, good afternoon, guys. Congratulations o
n the solid results. Maybe if I 
can go back to the gross margin from 
--
 
at the Q4 level, I'm just kind of 
curious given that CapEx has been running significantly ahead of 
depreciation I'm kind of curious if there's anything going on the depreciation 
schedu
le which is impacting the calendar fourth quarter gross margins.
 
And George to the extent in the previous question, you talked about maybe 
some tailwinds relative to the fourth quarter run rate next year in 2020 how 
do we think about the bridge from sort o
f the Q4 guide of kind of 58.5 to the 
Analyst Day guide for 2021 of 57. Is that all just the impact of 7
-
nanometer 
coming on in that year? Or is there some price consideration? How should 
we conceptually think about that?
 
George Davis
 
Okay, John. That's a great three
-
part question. There's nothing unusual 
going on in depreciation in the fourth quarter. As I said most of the impact is 
really related to 
--
 
we'll have gotten through all of the previously reserved 
10
-
nanometer products. So 
you're going to see more pressure on gross 
margin from the products that are coming into the marketplace while we're 
still at the low end of the yield curve on 10
-
nanometer, which is where we 
are today.
 
In 2020, how I think about 2020, I think, we 
--
 
as I 
said earlier we think 
we'll see a benefit from moving up the yield curve on 10
-
nanometer. We're 
pleased with our process work that's going on there now. And also we would 
expect that memory which has been a significant drag on gross margin this 
year will h
elp us a little bit overall. So, no real change. Probably the easiest 
thing would have just to go back and say no real change in our outlook that 
we gave at Analyst Day in terms of the gross margin trajectory over the next 
few years.
 
Bob Swan
 
Hey, George, 
the only thing I would add on the depreciation is, there's 
nothing kind of out of the norm. There are two fairly big dynamics that 
happened over the course of the next several months. One is over time we 
had more and more of our 14
-
nanometer equipment that
's fully depreciated. 
So, as you know, that's been our engine for a while, and we'll have more 
and more fully depreciated assets that are at work. Now, that's obviously 
favorable.
 
On the flip side, we have 
--
 
we talked about ramping two fabs and we've had 
a lot of assets under construction on our balance sheet that weren't being 
depreciated. So, in one sense you have a drop
-
off from the life of 14
-
nanometer equipment. At the same time, you're deploying some of the 10
-
nanometer equipment that we bought previ
ously.
 
So, those two things underneath the cover at the macro level to George's 
point, there's not a dramatic change. But underneath the cover is just two 
fairly big dynamics in the makeup of our equipment base and what's fully 
depreciated versus what's be
ing put into service.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joe Moore from Morgan 
Stanley. Your question, please.
 
Joe Moore
 
Great. Thank you. You talked about the reasons for being a little more 
conservative about the second half tha
n you felt 90 days ago, but your 
second half guidance isn't materially different than it was 90 days ago. So, I 
guess, how are you thinking that relative to the forecast?
 
And I guess when you talk about pull
-
ins like what is that 
--
 
I'm surprised 
that ther
e is pull
-
ins at the same that there's shortages. So, maybe you can 
just describe what the behavior is that's pulling revenue into Q2.
 
George Davis
 
Yeah. So, again, for the second half 
--
 
really for the full year, we're largely 
seeing the full year as we t
alked about it 90 days ago.
 
What I think the biggest difference is just how strong PC demand has been 
and the pull
-
ins that came into the second quarter leading to a much 
stronger second quarter where we are passing obviously some of that 
through with the 
exception of the pull
-
ins to the full year.
 
So, I don't want to sound like we're going to 
--
 
we'll see the normal seasonal 
balance and will be a strong second half of the year for the company. And I 
think, we're expecting a strong DCG improvement in the se
cond half as they 
get through the capacity digestion. We think the PC is going to continue to 
be quite strong. So, relative to our forecast, I guess, I may be countering a 
little bit this idea of a weaker second half. Other than memory has been a 
little bi
t weaker than we had expected. ASPs are certainly down more, and 
so we're anticipating some pain from that. And then, of course, some level of 
demand was pulled into the second quarter, but it's really reflective of the 
year that is playing out largely as 
we expected with some upside on PC TAM.
 
Bob Swan
 
Yeah. And I think the only thing that I would add to that is relative to where 
we were in April, looking out the second half of the year, we still have the 
threat of tariffs going up for goods coming out of 
China and the implication 
to that. And there's still a little bit of 
--
 
a little lack of clarity about the 
implications of the entity list and how quickly applications for licenses will be 
received and processed. So, I think that the real 
--
 
we're kind of 
$900 
million better in the quarter. It took the year off for $500 million. We 
attributed roughly $400 million to pull
-
ins.
 
As we go into the second half, we're just the 
--
 
there's still a little bit 
unknown about what 
--
 
how this China thing is going to pl
ay out. And that's 
a big important market for us and that's probably what makes me a little 
more anxious.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matt Ramsay from 
Cowen. Your question, please.
 
Matt Ramsay
 
Yes. Good afternoon. Thank you
. George and maybe Bob as well, we've 
heard and continue to hear rumblings of 
--
 
and you guys have addressed 
this at the Analyst Day and in other forums about how you might be price 
aggressive in certain sectors to try to protect market share. And I wonder
 
if 
you might comment about how you're thinking about that strategically in 
your notebook business where you have 10
-
nanometer product coming 
online versus in your desktop business where you might be on 14
-
nanometer for a bit longer. Thank you.
 
Bob Swan
 
Ye
ah. First, I'd start with at the risk of repeating myself a TAM of $300 
billion, the largest TAM in the company's history with a pretty decent wind at 
our back in terms of this insatiable appetite for data and what it means for 
the products that we build a
nd design. So we view ourselves as having a 
relatively low
-
share position with significant opportunity to grow. But at the 
same time, we know it's just 
--
 
we're not the only ones that have seen a 
data
-
centric world. That will be a more intensely competitiv
e environment. 
And our expectations over time are to protect our market share position, 
while continuing to invest in new prospects for growth. And that hasn't really 
changed.
 
When you look at that by segment, we're going to be 
--
 
on the PC side, 
we've bee
n protecting our position for the last couple of years. I'd say the 
competitive intensity on the PC side started probably in the first part of 
2017. And during that time frame, we've either protect our position, while 
moving end customers up to higher perf
ormance products that generate 
higher ASPs and with that have the capacity also to fight back and meet 
comps in targeted areas, where we need to.
 
So, that's how we think about this big opportunity to grow large market, 
protect our position while expanding 
into new vectors, and that transforms 
all segments and we're a little more protective about some segments versus 
others in those cases particularly when we're in a supply
-
constrained 
environment. So, not a whole lot has really changed on that other than we
 
know it's going to be more competitive, and we try to take that into account 
as we thought about not only our second half outlook, but our three
-
year 
outlook.
 
Mark Henninger
 
Thanks, Matt. And operator, I think we have time for just one more 
question 

 
Operator
 
Certainly. Our final question then comes from the line of David Wong from 
Instinet. Your question, please.
 
David Wong
 
Thanks very much. Just a clarification of what you had 
said with regard to 
restrictions in shipments to various entities in China. Can you say that the 
net result was actually small in the second quarter? And will there be 
--
 
do 
you expect any meaningful impact on DCG revenues from restrictions and 
shipments i
n the third quarter? Or is that going to be small too?
 
George Davis
 
Again, it was more in the second quarter. In fact, it was probably a net 
positive, because of pull
-
in activities. So if you look at what we were 
prohibited from shipping versus what was pu
lled in on things we're allowed 
to ship, where people were concerned that perhaps restrictions would 
become greater that was a net positive in the second quarter.
 
We think that dynamic just remains in play in the second half of the year. 
How much of the de
mand concerns were met in the second quarter, we'll 
have to see how that plays out, but our forecast is based on kind of the 
current state of activity. And as Bob said, we're 
--
 
it doesn't mean that we're 
not concerned or cautious about what could happen i
f there's a change in 
policy between now and the end of the year.
 
Mark Henninger
 
Thanks David. And we'll hand the call back over to Bob to wrap things up.
 
Bob Swan
 
Thanks, Mark, and Thanks everybody for joining us. I'd just kind of close 
where I started. W
e had a 
--
 
the quarter played out much stronger than we 
expected. Revenue better, gross margin's better, spending in line, earning's 
greater. And therefore from that confidence, we're raising our full year 
outlook and kind of feel good about our performanc
e six months through the 
year.
 
Secondly, and just more importantly, we continue to really work the supply 
chain, so we're never in a position to constrain our customers' growth. 
We've made good progress through the first half. But I think more as we go 
int
o the second half, we're just in a better position than we've been in a 
while. We still have work to do. We're still working with our customers, but 
we feel pretty good on the supply as we enter the second half.
 
And then third, our progress on both 10
-
nano
meter and our confidence in 
migrating from 10 to seven continues to grow based on execution. So, we 
kind of gave you a three
-
year outlook. We consider this the second deposit 
of that 12 deposit three
-
year outlook and I'd say we feel pretty good about 
where
 
we are. And we look forward to giving you another update 90 days 
from now about continued progress and momentum on our multiyear 
journey.
 
So, thanks for joining us and we look forward to talking to you again in 90 
days.
 
Mark Henninger
 
Thanks, Bob, and tha
nk you all for joining us today. Operator, can you 
please go ahead and wrap up the call?

Thanks, Mark.
 
Our second quarter results were consistent with our outlook as a year
-
over
-
year decline in the PC business was partially offset by 10% growth in our 
Data Center business, more than 40% growth in NAND r
evenue, and 4% 
growth in our IoT segment. I'll take just a moment to review our results 
before discussing the rest of the year, the Altera acquisition, and a process 
and product technology update too.
 
During this quarter, we qualified our sixth generation 
Core products, 
previously code named Skylake for production, and we continue to see 
excitement in the industry for the launch of these products and Windows 10. 
And while there were year
-
over
-
year declines in desktop and notebook 
volume, we saw record Core 
desktop mix due to growth in the high
-
end 
segment and record Core i7 mix overall for the PC business.
 
We're excited about the opportunities created by new products from our 
OEM partners and the upcoming launch of Windows 10. We worked closely 
with Microsof
t to make sure the best Windows 10 PC and tablet experience 
run on Intel.
 
We have also updated our mobile roadmap. Our OEMs' first Atom x3, x5, 
and x7 products were announced and are ramping using our previously code 
named Cherry Trail SoFIA 3G and SoFIA 3
G
-
R products. The 4G version of 
our Atom x3 platform, SoFIA LTE, is sampling now for network certification, 
and is expected to ship in volume in the first half of next year. Our latest LTE 
modem, the CAT
-
10 7360, is on track for shipments to customers this
 
year.
 
The Data Center business continued to perform, growing 10% over Q2 last 
year, and we remain on track to grow this business by more than 15% year 
over year. Again, this quarter we saw the growth of consumer services 
fueling the build
-
out of the cloud
. We also saw very strong growth in 
network infrastructure with the continuing migration of workloads onto Intel 
architecture and the rise of network function virtualization. These areas of 
strength were partially offset by weakness in the Enterprise segme
nt.
 
While our overall billings roughly matched our forecast, PC supply chain 
inventories declined at a slower rate than we expected, as PC demand 
weakened further. While we are expecting a seasonal second half, we're now 
forecasting total revenue to declin
e by about 1% for the full year, down from 
our prior expectation of approximately flat.
 
I'd like to shift gears now and talk about a couple of important strategic 
updates. Last month, we announced our plan to acquire Altera, a leading 
FPGA vendor. We see f
our key strategic drivers behind this acquisition. First, 
we believe we can enhance Altera's base FPGA ARM
-
based business 
substantially. We plan to do this through our leadership in Moore's Law and 
our ability to execute designs using our tools and silicon
 
more quickly, 
allowing us to continue to support and develop their ARM
-
based products. 
Second, history tells us that the FPGA vendor who is first to a manufacturing 
process node enjoys a market segment share advantage over the life of that 
node.
 
Finally, 
integrating Altera's world
-
class technology with Intel architecture in 
the high
-
growth data center and Internet of Things market segments will 
create new product categories and capabilities. We expect this strategy to 
produce significant shareholder value,
 
and we're looking forward to 
implementing our plans. We plan to have a deeper discussion on the value 
drivers underlying this strategy at our investor meeting this fall.
 
The last thing I'd like to share with you is an update related to our 10
-
nanometer te
chnology transition. Just last quarter we celebrated the 50th 
anniversary of Moore's Law. In 1965, when Gordon's paper was first 
published, he predicted a doubling of transistor density every year for at 
least the next 10 years. His prediction proved to be
 
right. And in fact, in 
1975, looking ahead to the next 10 years, he updated his estimate to a 
doubling every 24 months. These transitions are a natural part of the history 
of Moore's Law and are a by
-
product of the technical challenges of shrinking 
transi
stors while ensuring they can be manufactured in high volume.
 
As node transitions lengthened, we adapted our approach to the Tick
-
Tock 
method, which gave us a second product on each node. This strategy 
created better products for our customers and a compet
itive advantage for 
Intel. It also disproved the death of Moore's Law predictions many times 
over. The last two technology transitions have signaled that our cadence 
today is closer to 2.5 years than two.
 
To address this cadence, in the second half of 2016
 
we plan to introduce a 
third 14
-
nanometer product, code named Kaby Lake, built on the 
foundations of the Skylake micro
-
architecture but with key performance 
enhancements. Then in the second half of 2017, we expect to launch our 
first 10
-
nanometer product,
 
code named Cannonlake. We expect that this 
addition to the roadmap will deliver new features and improved performance 
and pave the way for a smooth transition to 10
-
nanometers.
 
As we move forward, we are focused on innovation and execution. We 
continue to
 
be confident in our strategy to drive growth.
 
And with that, let me turn the call over to Stacy.

Thanks, Brian.
 
Revenue for the second quarter was $13.2 billion, in line with our outlook 
and down 5% year on year, as a result of lower desktop and notebook 
platform volume. This was partially offset by increases in the Data Center 
Group and NAND. Quarter on quarter, revenue was up 3%. Second quarter 
gross margin of 62.5% was 0.5 point above o
ur outlook. Operating income 
of $2.9 billion was down 25% year over year and up 11% quarter over 
quarter. Net income was $2.7 billion, down 3% year over year. Earnings per 
share of $0.55 was flat year over year.
 
The Client Computing group had revenue of $7
.5 billion, a 14% decrease 
year over year. Both desktop and notebook unit volumes were down as a 
result of lower demand in the business segment and in emerging markets.
 
In terms of the worldwide PC supply chain, we saw a slight decline of 
inventory levels quarter over quarter and believe that overall inventory 
levels are normal. Our own inventory declined in units but grew in dollars, as 
we refreshed inventory levels with 14
-
nanometer products.
 
Tablet unit volumes were 9.9 million units, up
 
11% year over year. We are 
on track to our annual goal of improving mobile profitability by $800 million, 
with about a third of the improvement realized to date. Operating profit for 
the overall Client Computing group was $1.6 billion, down 38% year over 
year.
 
Our business portfolio continues to transform. We're growing the Data 
Center, Internet of Things, and NAND business, which accounted for almost 
40% of our revenue and more than 70% of the company's overall operating 
profit in the second quarter. The 
Data Center Group had revenue of $3.9 
billion, 10% growth year over year, driven by very strong results in cloud 
and networking infrastructure. The Data Center Group had operating profit 
of $1.8 billion, flat year over year. Additionally, year over year, t
he Internet 
of Things segment achieved revenue growth of 4%, and the NAND business 
achieved record revenue and grew at over 40%.
 
The business continued to generate significant cash, with $3.4 billion of cash 
from operations in the second quarter. We purcha
sed $1.8 billion in capital 
assets, paid $1.1 billion in dividends, and repurchased about $700 million of 
stock in the second quarter. Total cash balance at the end of the quarter was 
$13.9 billion, flat to the first quarter. Our net cash balance, total ca
sh less 
debt and inclusive of our other longer
-
term investments, is approximately $4 
billion.
 
Over the next two to three quarters, we expect to complete the acquisition 
of Altera for $16.7 billion. The financing plan for this acquisition is to issue 
$7 bil
lion to $9 billion in new long
-
term debt and finance the remaining 
balance with our cash and short
-
term commercial paper. As we generate 
free cash flow, we expect to get back to approximately zero net cash in the 
second half of 2016.
 
As we look forward to 
the third quarter of 2015, we are forecasting the 
midpoint of the revenue range at $14.3 billion, up 8% from the second 
quarter. This forecast is at the higher
-
end range of the average seasonal 
increase for the third quarter. We are forecasting the midpoin
t of the gross 
margin range to be 63%, a 0.5 point increase from the second quarter.
 
Turning to the full year 2015, we expect revenue to be down approximately 
1% from 2014, lower than our prior guidance of approximately flat. Our 
expectations are that the 
PC market is going be weaker than previously 
expected. We continue to forecast robust growth rates in the Data Center 
Group, Internet of Things Group, and NAND businesses, which we expect to 
mostly offset the PC decline.
 
We are forecasting the midpoint of 
capital spending at $7.7 billion, down $1 
billion from the prior outlook. This is driven primarily by manufacturing 
efficiencies and changes in timing for purchases. We are forecasting the 
midpoint of our gross margin range at 61.5%, up 0.5 point from our 
prior 
guidance. And we are forecasting the midpoint of R&D and MG&A spending 
for the year at $19.8 billion, up $100 million from the prior outlook.
 
The second quarter financials came in a little better than our expectations. 
As we look at the second half, 
we expect seasonal market growth from here, 
and we are very excited about the devices based on Skylake, our sixth
-
generation Core processor, that are coming to market. Additionally, we 
expect continued robust growth in the Data Center, Internet of Things, 
and 
NAND business. And lastly, we are working to complete the acquisition of 
Altera. This acquisition will broaden our product portfolio, enable innovation 
in our current product line, and deliver value for our shareholders.
 
With that, let me turn it back 
over to Mark.

Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Vivek Arya of Bank of

Thank you for 
taking my question. Brian, I'm trying to reconcile your 
concern about the PC market with the seasonal guidance that you're giving 
for the back half. So for instance, you're guiding up 8% for Q3 and implied 
it's up 5% for Q4. How much benefit are you expect
ing from Windows 10, 
because I think there is very limited conviction whether that would indeed 
be a growth driver for PC? So I'm just trying to reconcile your caution with 
just seasonal guidance. Are you being adequately conservative with your 
second half
 
guidance?
 
Brian M. Krzanich 
-
 
Chief Executive Officer & Director
 
Sure, Vivek. We think we 

 
remember, this is seasonal off Q2, which was 
down. So this is off a forecasted and actual Q2 that was down from our 
original assumptions for this year. And so we b
elieve that yes, a seasonal 
forecast off that, roughly seasonal, is a reasonable forecast for the 
remainder of this year. You also saw in the announcement that Stacy and I 
took down our overall revenue guidance a bit as well to be in line with all of 
that,
 
the seasonal guidance off a lowered Q2. I don't know, Stacy, if you 
have something else you want to add.
 
Stacy J. Smith 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
 
I'll just piggyback, Vivek, to the commentary on the last call. If you 
remember, o
ur prediction for Q2 was that inventory levels would be taken 
down fairly significantly, which is unusual in a Q2. What we actually saw in 
the second quarter is inventory levels did come down but they're kind of at 
normal. And so what you're seeing now in 
Q3 is a little bit of a pipeline fill 
based on inventory levels that came down in Q2 against the backdrop of Q2s 
that normally would have inventory levels going up. So it's the same 
phenomenon of some shift of billings from Q2 to Q3. It's just much more 
mu
ted than what we thought a quarter ago.
 
Brian M. Krzanich 
-
 
Chief Executive Officer & Director
 
But we didn't base that or we didn't base any of the forecast in the second 
half off an upside from Win 10 launch. We're excited about Win 10 launch 
and Skylake.
 
We believe great products are coming to market, but we didn't 
build in a large increase. That's why we stuck with the seasonal off the 
lowered Q2.
 
Stacy J. Smith 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
 
We're getting a lot out on your one ques
tion. I'd also say if you zoom out, 
our view of the PC market now is down in the high single digits. And our 
view a quarter ago was a PC market that was down in the more mid
-
single 
digits. So we've definitely brought down our expectations of the PC market 
overall for the year, but you're still seeing a little bit of that inventory 
lumpiness.
 
Vivek Arya 
-
 
Bank of America Merrill Lynch
 
Got it, very helpful. And then as my follow
-
up on the Data Center business, I 
understand it's lumpy and there are many moving
 
pieces. But you're still 
expecting mid
-
teens growth for the year but in Q2 it slowed down to 10%. 
And I think you mentioned enterprise as one area of weakness. So are you 
anticipating a recovery there in the back half, and are you seeing any impact 
with a
ll the macro headwinds in Europe and China for instance?
 
Brian M. Krzanich 
-
 
Chief Executive Officer & Director
 
So if you take a look at the Data Center and you take a look at the first half, 
remember, we exited Q1 at about 19% growth. And we said hey, 
that's 
pretty robust. Don't expect that for the whole year. You take that 19% and 
combine it with this 10%, the first half actually played out right close to 
between 14% and 15%, which was what we've said would be roughly our 
growth rate in this business. 
We did say that enterprise was weaker than we 
had forecasted, but the cloud has been stronger. We've taken that cloud 

 
actually cloud, networking, and some storage as well, all three of those have 
been stronger and enterprise weaker. We took that same mod
el and carried 
that through the rest of the year. So we do not expect a large recovery of 
the enterprise as we go through the remainder of this year.
 
You said it. The headwinds are the macroeconomic, companies looking at 
how do they spend their capital and
 
when do they deploy their capital, being 
careful about that. All those things are causing enterprise to be a bit weaker, 
and we didn't say there would be a big recovery of that. We do think the 
other trends, the cloud continuing to grow, networking contin
uing to grow, 
especially with the conversion, software
-
defined infrastructure, and storage 
continuing to grow. We do believe those will continue, and that's what drives 
the second half as well.

Thank you. And our next question comes from Timothy Arcuri of Cowen & 
Company. Your line is now open.
 
Timothy M. Arcuri

Cowen & Co. LLC
 
Thank you so much. First question, Stacy, for the first time now you're 
moving to a Tick
-
Tock
-
Tock model. So I
'm wondering if you can talk about 
what the CapEx implications are for that, and maybe also what the gross 
margin implications are for maybe the back half of this year and into next 
year. Thanks.
 
Stacy J. Smith 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice Pr
esident
 
Sure, a lot in that question, so let me take a shot and you can come back if I 
don't appropriately or adequately answer all of it. The CapEx implications, so 
we've taking down our CapEx forecast again this cycle relatively significantly 
from where 
we were at the beginning of the year. If you go back to the 
beginning of the year, what you see in terms of the reduction in CapEx, it's 
been 

 
I'll call it four buckets. There's a big piece that's just factory 
efficiency. We talked about this last quarter
. The 14
-
nanometer factories are 
becoming more efficient. Our confidence in that ramp has gone up, so that 
was a chunk of it.
 
We talked last quarter about taking advantage of some of the unit weakness 
that we saw to bring down the capacity in our 22
-
nanome
ter factories. And 
we successfully executed on that in the second quarter. We took the 
utilization down. We took a bunch of capacity offline. We rolled it forward to 
14
-
nanometers, so that was a chunk of what we're seeing. We talked a bit 
about desktop uni
ts being lower as a result of the XP refresh last year. 
That's a piece.
 
And then there's a big chunk associated with this third wave of products that 
Brian talked about. And so just isolating then on that, the implications in this 
generation are that we'll
 
be at the 14
-
nanometer peak for longer, and we'll 
delay a little bit some of the purchases on 10
-
nanometer from when we 
were on a two
-
year cadence. And so that is definitely a piece of the lower 
CapEx this year.
 
In terms of the gross margin implications, 
minor; for us the key is to have 
great products, and that's why we're adding in this third wave of products. 
At the first approximation, that's the best correlation of gross margin is 
when you've got leadership products, you tend to have a healthy gross 
ma
rgin. It does change the shape of startup costs a little bit, and you can 
see the 10
-
nanometer costs are a bit later than normal. But we'll talk more 
about that at the investor meeting in Q4.
 
Timothy M. Arcuri

Cowen & Co. LLC
 
Thanks a lot. And then I gue
ss just as a follow
-
up, is the push
-
out on 10
-
nanometer, can you give us just a little color in terms of what should be 
happening there? Is that simply the result of Broadwell having pushed out, 
or is there something specific to 10
-
nanometer that is causin
g it to push? 
Thanks.
 
Brian M. Krzanich 
-
 
Chief Executive Officer & Director
 
No, I'd call it similar to what happened on 14
-
nanometer. Remember, on all 
of these technologies, each one has its own recipe of complexity and 
difficulty, 14
-
nanometer to 10
-
nano
meter same thing that happened from 
22
-
nanometer to 14
-
nanometer. The lithography is continuing to get more 
difficult as you try and scale and the number of multi
-
pattern steps you have 
to do is increasing. This is the longest period of time without a lith
ography 
node change. So we're assuming 10
-
nanometers does not have EUV 
[Extreme Ultra
-
Violet] for our technology; that combined with just the other 
material science changes you do with the new technology.
 
And then you look at the pattern we've been having 
with the same kind of 
sets of conditions, which was the 22
-
nanometer technology and the 14
-
nanometer technology. And we said those took about 2.5 years. And the 
feedback from our customers that said, look, we really want you to be 
predictable. That's as im
portant as getting to that leading edge. We chose to 
actually just go ahead and insert; since nothing else had changed, insert this 
third wave.
 
When we go from 10
-
nanometer to 7
-
nanometer, it will be another set of 
parameters that we'll reevaluate this. We
'll always strive to get back to two 
years. And we'll take a look at what's the maturity of EUV, what's the 
maturity of the material science changes that are occurring, what's the 
complexity of the product roadmap that we're adding, and make that 
adjustmen
t out in the future here. So, we took a snapshot of the 14
-
nanometer to 10
-
nanometer transition. We looked at the history, and we 
said let's be very predictable and do the best thing for shareholders and for 
our partners and customers.

Good afternoon, guys. Brian, maybe just to follow up on Tim's question 
around the Moore's Law cadence, one of the things that Intel has always 
done better than most is get down Moore's Law more quickly. And I 
understand there 
are definitional differences of line nodes and not 
everyone's 10
-
nanometers is the same. But relative to the targets you've 
put out this afternoon for second half of 2017, if you look at some of the 
publicly available data from some of your manufacturing c
ompetitors, it 
appears like everyone's going to get to 10
-
nanometers at the same time. So 
how do you guys think about that historic relative manufacturing lead 
relative to those peers, and how should we think about it?
 
Brian M. Krzanich 
-
 
Chief Executive O
fficer & Director
 
I think first, John, I'll just say, we believe, even with this 2017, our lead in 
Moore's Law will not change dramatically. We believe we'll continue to lead 
with roughly the same leadership position that we have today. We base that 
on, on
e, what really counts when I talk about 2017, that's not samples, 
that's not small volume. That's converting over to Cannonlake and producing 
a large percentage of our CPUs in volume in the second half of 2017. So 
there's a bit of definition. When we say s
econd half of 2017 we're talking 
about millions of units and large volumes.
 
And then as you said, there's this definitional difference, right. This will be 
now our third generation of FinFETs by then. It will have several other 
transistor enhancements. And
 
we believe if you take a look at the scaling, it 
will be quite strong relative to the normal scaling parameters that occur with 
the Moore's Law transition. I'm not going give you the exact numbers right 
now. But we think if you combine all those together,
 
our leadership position 
doesn't change, even with this date.
 
John William Pitzer 
-
 
Credit Suisse Securities (
USA

That's helpful. And then, guys, going back to DCG, relative to the 
full
-
year 
guidance of growing at least 15% year over year, it does assume a 
reacceleration of year
-
over
-
year growth. I know it's a business where 
seasonality is less relevant than PCs, but it would suggest a second half 
that's growing half on half much mor
e significantly than it historically has. 
And so I'm curious. Is the expectation enterprise comes back to bolster 
what's been strong, cloud, or how do you think about the growth profile of 
DCG in the back half of the year, if it needs to reaccelerate year 
over year?
 
Stacy J. Smith 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
 
Hey, John. This is Stacy. So I think if you look at DCG, we've said for years 
it's lumpy. We've deconstructed what happened in Q1 and Q2. When you 
look across the quarters, we'r
e growing 14% to 15%. That's pretty 
consistent with what we expect for the year. So I think you'll come up with a 
number that's pretty consistent with that in the back half of the year.
 
As we zoom out a bit on the market, from what we thought when we start
ed 
the year, as Brian said, we'd say that we're seeing an enterprise market 
that's weaker than expected. We're not expecting a lot of incremental 
strength there. It's more macroeconomic driven than anything else, and 
we're not predicting a big macroeconomi
c boom in the back half. But that's 
being offset by a cloud market primarily, but also networking and storage 
that is stronger than what we expected. And we saw some spectacular 
growth rates in networking 

 
in the cloud segment of the business this 
quarter
.
 
John William Pitzer

Credit Suisse Securities (

That's helpful. Thanks, guys.
 
Brian M. Krzanich 
-
 
Chief Executive Officer & Director
 
The only thing I would add to that, John, is the 
same dynamic that causes 
the enterprise to be a little bit weaker, those macroeconomics, drives 
businesses and organizations to move their workloads to the cloud. What I'm 
seeing is there's a little bit of a counteract between those two, which is why 
we've
 
said no, we believe that overall the year will be 

 
on balance, still 
grow at that 15%. But again, we are looking over the long haul. Don't get 
caught by a quarter in this kind of a growth rate.

Christopher B. Danely 
-
 
Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)
 
Thanks, guys
. So you said that your PC forecast has gone down from I guess 
5% to down high single digits. One question on that is, on your inventory, 
have you adjusted your inventory to I guess increase the server products 
and decrease some of the PC processors? And c
an you give us a sense of 
where you expect inventory to trend in the second half of the year?
 
Stacy J. Smith 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
 
Sure. It's less driven by server and more driven by the mix of Skylake on 
14
-
nanometer. And so
 
what happened in Q2 is that, as you can see, dollars 
went up but units were down, and actually down a bit more than we had 
expected when we started the quarter. But the mix of the units that are in 
inventory have shifted from 22
-
nanometer products to 14
-
n
anometer. And 
within 14
-
nanometer, we're starting to see the shift from Broadwell to 
Skylake. And so it's a more expensive product because it's brand new. It's 
also the newest product, which gives me a lot of comfort about what's sitting 
in inventory.
 
As w
e play out through the rest of the year, what we expect to happen is 
that units will continue to come down from here. 14
-
nanometer comes down 
the cost curve, but the inventory shifts even more dramatically from 
Broadwell to Skylake. And so when I take thos
e three trends into account, 
I'm predicting that we'll end the year with inventory levels roughly flat to 
where we are today, not dramatically different. But again, units will be 
down, dollars will be flat.
 
Christopher B. Danely

Citigroup Global Markets,

Great, and for my follow
-
up, just I guess a longer
-
term question on the PC 
market. You guys are closer to it than anybody. Why do you think it's so 
weak this year? Do you think that 

 
should we be expecting down 5% to 
10% every year? Is ther
e something going on? Has your long
-
term outlook 
on the PC market changed? Any color you could provide as to why this is 
happening would be very helpful.
 
Brian M. Krzanich 
-
 
Chief Executive Officer & Director
 
Sure. If I had a perfect mirror into this, this
 
wouldn't be a forecast. It would 
be a guaranteed schedule of earnings for the next couple of quarters. In 
general, I think if you look at it, the PC has always had a fairly decent tie to 
GDP, both for the countries that we sell in. but then I think if you
 
just look 
at the worldwide GDP, so worldwide GDP growth has slowed, especially in 
areas like China, where a lot of growth in PCs was occurring. But even in the 
mature areas like the U.S. and Western Europe, that has caused it to slow 
down a bit more.
 
I th
ink there has been a little bit of a stall. There's always a little bit of a stall 
right before a new product like Skylake. But when you have a new product 
like Skylake combined with a new OS like Win 10, which the majority of 
these devices will run on, th
at tends to have people waiting to see what 
those products are going to be. What's going be offered, the new form 
factors? How is Windows 10 accepted? So I think you put all these together, 
it's made a bit 

 
2015 be weaker on the PC than we had anticipated
.
 
Long term, I still think it's a great form factors we have coming, we're going 
to be talking about all
-
day battery lives, no wires. We've got some great thin 
form factors. The fact that there's very little difference between a two
-
in
-
one 
device and a tab
let and the ability to take back that volume onto the PC, all 
those things put together, I still stick with the forecast that we can keep this 
stable, that it will be over the long haul relatively flat. There will be years 
like last year that it's up. Ther
e will be years like this year that will be down, 
depending on all of those factors, but over the long haul, relatively flat 
forecast.

at's coming now from those

Barclays Capital, Inc.
 
Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to follow up 
on the outlook into the seco
nd half. Windows 10, they're talking about giving 
it away to the consumer. Obviously, enterprises always adopt new platforms 
later. So just curious of your thoughts this time where you have the software 
given away for free. What are your thoughts in terms 
of that impacting the 
consumer demand?
 
Brian M. Krzanich 
-
 
Chief Executive Officer & Director
 
When you talk about that, first let's just talk about our forecast, our basic 
forecast. Remember, we said it's basically seasonal off the lowered Q2. We 
didn't bu
ild in a big boom from the Windows 10 transition. That said, we are 
excited about it. You're right. It has a free upgrade. But a lot of the really 
good features of Windows 10, things like Windows 10 Hello, where you have 
facial log
-
in and you don't have to
 
use all your passwords, the start screen 
and your ability to go through that, the touch usages of gaming as they 
move games more and more onto this product, those are going to come with 
PCs that have the latest features.
 
And so that combined with products
 
like Skylake, over the long haul, I think 
Windows 10 will be a boost for the PC market. It will take some of the 
negativity about Windows 8 out of that marketplace, and I think it will be a 
real positive for us. As you said, some people will have to go th
rough a free 
upgrade and then see what they really wanted and see the new form factors 
and go okay, I'm going to upgrade. Some of the enterprise guys will take a 
little bit longer because enterprises always have to check everything they've 
got on the new O
S. And that's why we didn't really build it into the forecast 
as a big plus for the second half of this year. I think if you look long term, 
it's going be a positive.
 
Blayne Curtis

Barclays Capital, Inc.
 
Thanks, and then just, Stacy, a follow
-
up on a pri
or gross margin question. 
You typically get a benefit in the second year of a process node. You said the 
third year you don't get much benefit. Is that because you've gotten the 
yields pretty maxed out in the second year, or are you adding more content? 
Wh
at are your thoughts on why you don't get another little bit of a boost on 
a third year?
 
Stacy J. Smith 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
 
I didn't mean to say that I don't get a benefit on the third year of a process 
technology. I haven'
t provided a forecast yet for next year, but I would 
expect that a third
-
wave product coming out on 14
-
nanometers will have a 
good cost structure. You have a very healthy process running at high 
utilization. That tends to be the sweet spot. If you look at 
22
-
nanometer, 
you've seen that phenomenon, not because we had a third wave, but just 
because the process was running full relatively 

 
on a relatively mature 
process. And in fact, we got great costs out of it. So my comment was about 
startup costs. It does
 
change the trend of startup costs, and I'll provide 
more insight into that at the investor meeting in the fourth quarter.

Hi, guys, a quick question on the formerly
-
called PCG side of things. It 
sounds like the inventory in the channel didn't burn as much as you thought. 
Are you building i
n that it bounces back just to normal levels? I would think 
that your sequentials would be impacted off of a relatively higher base, 
given that that didn't burn down in the second quarter. So put that all 
together, how does the lack of that burn in the sec
ond quarter fall into your 
guidance for the third?
 
Stacy J. Smith 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
 
Remember last quarter what we were expecting was a substantial burn of 
inventory. And the way we articulated that, our belief was that cu
stomers 
would burn off inventory levels in advance of Windows 10 and then replenish 
inventory levels in the third quarter. What we actually saw was much more 
normal than that. We saw customers maintain inventory levels. I think their 
confidence in the over
all PC market grew some as they worked through the 
quarter and got towards the end of the quarter. So I had articulated we have 
relatively normal inventory levels now. We expect relatively normal 
inventory levels in the third quarter. Historically, you see
 
inventory build 
some in the third quarter in anticipation of the Q4 selling season.
 
Ross C. Seymore

Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
 
And I guess as my follow
-
on, a bit of a longer
-
term question. It's on the 
OpEx side of things. Clearly, OpEx to revenue wi
ll come down closer to your 
target in the back half of this year if you guys hit the forecast that you laid 
out. But you're still well above the 30% OpEx to revenue targets you have. 
What's the plan to get there? Last year was better than expected on 
reven
ues and you didn't really get much leverage on that metric. This year 
has obviously been a little bit worse, so it's a bit more challenging. Is there 
ever the need to do something more structural, or is it only going to be grow 
to get to the target?
 
Brian 
M. Krzanich 
-
 
Chief Executive Officer & Director
 
I think it has to be growth. Structural would mean starting to lower our 
investments in things like the Data Center or IoT, and I really think that 
would be the wrong thing to do to keep this company growing
. I think we 
have to get this by the growth metric. And our models say if we can stabilize 
the PC and continue to grow at our forecasted numbers for the Data Center 
and IoT and NAND, we get there. And we have a plan to not grow our 
spending while that grow
th occurs, or grow the revenue faster. And we just 
need to get that and execute to that.

Thank you. Just first question to clarify going back to something you said 
with regard to the revenue expectations for the year, the change in your 
expectatio
ns from last quarter, the 1% change, was that entirely due to your 
comments on the PC channel, the PC segment, and the DCG expectations 
are essentially unchanged? Is that the right way to think about that?
 
Stacy J. Smith 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer & Executi
ve Vice President
 
Yes, entirely is a word that makes me nervous, but it's the vast majority of 
the change. I guess I'd also say it's a much smaller business, but I'd also 
say our expectations on the year have come down for the IoTG business, but 
that's not
 
adding up to a big number at the corporate level. Some of the 
issues that Brian talked about, macroeconomics and the sectors in which we 
play, I think we're unlikely to be at the growth rate that we were at last 
year. We'll be a little bit less than the p
rior year (38:38).
 
But again, the big dollars are the PC TAM. Our expectations last quarter 
were down mid
-
single digits. We're now down high single digits. That puts us 
in the low end of what we see from third parties, although in fairness they're 
revising
 
their forecasts over the next quarter.

Okay, great. As a follow
-
up, with regards to mobile, you had a goal to 
reduce your mobile operating losses this year. Your comments on SoFIA LTE, 
I think that's a l
ittle later than what you had indicated earlier. Does that 
have any effect on your ability to reduce the mobile operating losses? And 
maybe just give us a general indication of where you stand against those 
goals.
 
Brian M. Krzanich 
-
 
Chief Executive Office
r & Director
 
Not at all. So SoFIA, as you said, it's a little bit later than what we wanted. 
The good news is it's out. It's yielding well. It's, as we said, in carrier 
validation. And it will ship in volume in the first half of next year.
 
As far as the sp
ending reduction targets we had for mobile, we've said we'd 
get $800 million out. I think Stacy in his part of the presentation stated 
we're right on target actually to do that. We're very happy with our results 
there and have already done about a third of
 
it out of the system. It was 
back
-
end loaded as the SoFIA 3G, not LTE, products ramped. So we feel like 
we have a very good detailed plan to go and continue. And we'll at the 
investor meeting update you on how we'll continue that program to reduce 
the cos
ts and the losses again next year as well.
 
And really that's part of 

 
the SoFIA LTE is a good example. We weren't 
going to go spend the money to necessarily try and pull that product back in 
versus say, you know what, it's fine in the first half of the ye
ar and the 
product is healthy. It's more important that we get an LTE product for 2016. 
And getting it in early in 2016 is going to be just fine.

Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ian Ing of MKM 
Partners. Your line is now open.
 
Ian L. Ing

MKM Partners LLC
 
Yes, thanks. I'm looking for some color on this strength in memory. It looks 
like NAND is up 40% year over year. Working with Micron, it seems the 
offerings are actually relatively stale. So I was just wondering if migration to 
TLC and 3D NAND is going benefit you or if that doesn't really affect 
enterprise.
 
Brian M. Krzanich 
-
 
Chi
ef Executive Officer & Director
 
No. Maybe I'm not quite understanding your question, but our conversion to 
3D NAND we believe is a major boost to our product roadmap, both in a 
performance standpoint and a cost. And remember, we believe we have an 
architec
tural advantage to how we've built with Micron our 3D NAND over 
the competition. And we believe that as those products ramp into the second 
half and into next year, the performance and cost advantage of 3D NAND 
will be quite visible. So we're full go on th
at.
 
Ian L. Ing 
-
 
MKM Partners LLC
 
Yeah, so...
 
Stacy J. Smith 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
 
In terms of the Q2 results, Ian, I think what you're seeing is the positioning 
of our products in enterprise and compute, those markets were r
elatively 
strong. In particular, we saw strength in cloud
-
based NAND, and we saw 
some strength in China based on some specific design wins that we had 
there.
 
Ian L. Ing 
-
 
MKM Partners LLC
 
Great. And then for a follow
-
up, your full
-
year gross margin 
guidance does 
imply a falloff in Q4. You're attributing it to a 14
-
nanometer ramp. Should 
we see that as a transient issue, or does that get more normalized in the 
future after that?
 
Stacy J. Smith 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
 
No, i
n Q4, what I would attribute it to is 10
-
nanometer startup costs, not 
14
-
nanometer. The costs on 14
-
nanometer are coming down nicely over the 
course of the year. What happened specifically in Q4 is we started to see the 
steep part of the curve on 10
-
nanome
ter startup costs.
 
Ian L. Ing 
-
 
MKM Partners LLC
 
Okay, so that's very transient or that's more prolonged into next year? I 
know you can't guide that far, but...
 
Stacy J. Smith 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
 
I'd say it's cyclical. You'
ve seen these cycles from us every two years. As we 
start up a new process technology, you get a couple of quarters where the 
gross margin has a significant portion of startup costs in it, and then it starts 
getting better from there.
 
Ian L. Ing

MKM Part

Okay. Thank you, Stacy.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Joe Moore of 
Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.
 
Joseph L. Moore 
-
 
Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
 
Great, thank you. I wanted to understand; you've described Q3 a
nd Q4 as 
roughly seasonal. But if I look at it, your average Q3 the last two years has 
been up 5% and you're guiding up 8%. The average Q4 has been up a little 
less than 1%, and the implied is up 5%. So what is the delta there that fits 
the overall number?
 
That looks like a little bit better than at least your last 
few years' seasonality.
 
Stacy J. Smith 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
 
So versus 

 
let's just talk about Q3. Q3 acknowledged that the revenue's at 
the higher end of the seaso
nal range. The point we were making earlier is 
we think the market is pretty seasonal, but we saw an unusual inventory 
depletion in Q2. We think some of that inventory fill has just shifted into Q3. 
So there's a little bit of a billing shift. It's not a lo
t. It's maybe a couple of 
points at the top line.
 
Q4, I think you have to be a little careful with the math about implied. I 
think if you just assume 

 
we've said on the call we're expecting Q4 to be 
roughly seasonal. And I think if you plug that in, you'r
e still rounding to the 
number that I gave you for the year.
 
Joseph L. Moore 
-
 
Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
 
Got it, okay. Great, thank you for that. And then with regards to the savings 
on the wireless side, with SoFIA late, it seems like you would have less o
f 
the subsidies rolling off. So can you talk about what are the sources of the 
$800 million savings, how much of that is lower subsidies versus other 
potential cost savings in that segment?
 
Stacy J. Smith 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice Presiden
t
 
Remember that the SoFIA that has been shipping since the first half of the 
year is the SoFIA 3G. That was the vast majority of the improvement in 
margin dollars and contra
-
revenue dollars. That product was right on time. 
In fact, I think we said it was e
ven a little bit early in high volume as we go 
into the back half. The shift that Brian was talking about is the SoFIA LTE 
version. There was almost no volume this year, and it will be in the market 
first half next year.

Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Kevin Cassidy at 
Stifel. Your line is now open.
 
Kevin E. Cassidy

Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.
 
Thank you for taking my question. Just to be clear, when wi
ll SoFIA come in 
house for manufacturing?
 
Brian M. Krzanich 
-
 
Chief Executive Officer & Director
 
That's different than the LTE version that we're talking about. So the LTE 
version that we've been talking about in this call is one that's still 
manufactured outside. And we said that will be the first half. The target for 
the LTE on the inside or Intel 14
-
nanometer is the back half of the year.
 
Kevin E. Cassidy 
-
 
Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.
 
Okay, great. And can you say how some of your relationsh
ips with the 
Chinese manufacturers have worked out? Are there significant design wins? 
Are you getting good traction?
 
Brian M. Krzanich 
-
 
Chief Executive Officer & Director
 
One of the products that we listed that's ramping this year and has been 
going quit
e well is the SoFIA 3G
-
R. R stands for Rockchip. So that's a part 
that was co
-
designed between Intel and Rockchip. So that part is in market 
selling today, and so I'd say that that portion of the Chinese relationships 
has gone quite well and is quite far a
long now.
 
The other relationship that we have in this space is with Spreadtrum. That 
deal is still going through closure. It had to go through a variety of 
regulatory approvals in China. It's looking to close fairly soon now. But the 
engineering teams have
 
already started to engage and look at product 
roadmaps and start to build product roadmaps together. So that relationship 
is going quite well. It's just not nearly as far along.

Good afternoon, thank you for taking my question. I guess first question, in 
the move to Tick
-
Tock
-
Tock, I'm curious what the implications are for your 
long
-
term CapEx run rate, and then how we should think about the 
implications to free cash flow.
 
S
tacy J. Smith 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
 
I'm going to punt on that one, C.J., until the investor meeting and we'll talk 
a bit more. And one of the reasons that's hard is, as Brian talked about, 
each one of these process technology
 
transitions has its own personality. At 
7
-
nanometer, we're trying to bring in EUV. Depending on the health of that, 
we could be at two years, we could be at 2.5 years, and that will change this 
answer. So we'll give more insight into this in the Q4 invest
or meeting.
 
C.J. Muse 
-
 
Evercore ISI
 
So are we...
 
Stacy J. Smith 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
 
The CapEx and free cash flow are directly linked.
 
C.J. Muse 
-
 
Evercore ISI
 
So is this a temporary phenomenon, or is this 

 
you're just not
 
sure?
 
Brian M. Krzanich 
-
 
Chief Executive Officer & Director
 
I think it's we're not sure. It's a good forecast for this year. We've told you 
what's going to happen at 10
-
nanometers with 2017. So you can now model 
out 

 
that's part of why we wanted to get 
this out to everybody today. You 
can now model out what the typical CapEx would be given that schedule, 
based on previous node transitions. But what we're saying is don't 
necessarily count on that for 10
-
nanometers to 7
-
nanometers. We'll again 
take a look 
at the tool set that's available, the maturity of those tools, the 
maturity of the material science additions that we'll be doing, what's the 
next around FinFET transistors and other kinds of materials that we'll put 
into the transistor or the die itself. 
And when you take a look at all those, 
we'll be trying to pull it into two years, but we really won't know. And we 
won't be able to give a signal to that until, my guess, late next year at the 
earliest.
 
C.J. Muse 
-
 
Evercore ISI
 
Sure.
 
Stacy J. Smith 
-
 
Chief
 
Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
 
And just as I think about this and simplify it in my head, the way I think 
about it is if a process node were on a two
-
year cadence, two waves of 
products is the thing that delivers the best value to the custom
ers and then 
we quickly get to the next node. When the process node transition shifts out 
to be longer than that, then that third wave of products gives us another 
opportunity to deliver features to the customer. And so the uncertainty 
you're hearing isn't
 
whether this is a good model or not. The uncertainty is 
7
-
nanometer, there's still enough open questions that we don't know exactly 
the cadence.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur of 
JPMorgan. Your line is now open.
 
Harlan L. Sur

JPMorgan Securities LLC
 
Good afternoon, thanks for taking my question. The first half was marked by 
weakness in desktop, primarily l
ackluster demand pull from the SMB market. 
Is some of the strength in the second half predicated on some of this SMB 
desktop demand coming back, or is it going be mostly consumer driven?
 
Brian M. Krzanich 
-
 
Chief Executive Officer & Director
 
We don't usual
ly forecast to that level forward looking. But I would tell you 
in general we don't see the market shifting dramatically from the first half to 
the second half. So I don't think there's going be a huge resurgence of SMB 
in the desktop. There are some good 
products coming out on Skylake in the 
desktop space, but that's not necessarily something we forecasted as a big 
return for right now. So the majority of this seasonality that we've projected 
is based on just standard consumer, which as you said, has got a
 
higher 
percentage of laptop, two
-
in
-
one, thin and light devices.
 
Harlan L. Sur 
-
 
JPMorgan Securities LLC
 
Okay, thanks for that insight. And then back to the flash business, obviously 
another solid quarter of growth. I think you guys are number one in 
ente
rprise SSD with about 25% market share. I just wanted to confirm that 
the team is still on track to roll out 3D NAND
-
based platforms in the second 
half of the year. And then secondarily, how do the cost per bit yield and 
reliability metrics look relative t
o your planar
-
based 2D NAND products?
 
Brian M. Krzanich 
-
 
Chief Executive Officer & Director
 
So absolutely I can tell you that we're on schedule to ramp the products in 
the second half. 3D NAND is looking quite good. From a cost, yield, and 
performance, I 
don't think we've gone public with much of those numbers 
right now. But what we have said is that 3D NAND, especially with the 
architectural choices that Micron and Intel chose, we believe gives a 
significant cost and performance advantage over their compe
titors, and 
those specifics are holding as we go through the ramp process. So we 
haven't broken down it's X% or anything like that yet.
 
Harlan L. Sur 
-
 
JPMorgan Securities LLC
 
I appreciate it. Okay, thank you.
 
Brian M. Krzanich 
-
 
Chief Executive 
Officer & Director
 
We'll be doing NAND updates as we go through the back half of this year and 
give you guys more color in that space. Clearly, at the investor meeting that 
Stacy talked about, we'll spend some time on NAND because, as you said, 
it's a good
 
growth area for the company right now.

Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Intel Corporation Q4 
2017 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen
-
only mode. Later, we will conduct a question
-
and
-
answer session and 
instructions will be 
given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, 
this conference call is being recorded.
 
I would now like to turn the conference over to Mark Henninger, Head of 
Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.
 
Mark Henninger
 
Thank you, operator, and welco
me everyone to Intel's fourth quarter 2017 
earnings conference call. By now, you should have received a copy of our 
earnings release and the CFO earnings presentation, which replaces the CFO 
commentary that we previously used. If you've not received both 
d
ocuments, they're available on our Investor website, intc.com. The CFO 
earnings presentation is also available via the webcast window for those 
joining us online.
 
I'm joined today by Brian Krzanich, our CEO; and Bob Swan, our Chief 
Financial Officer. In a 
moment, we'll hear brief remarks from both of them 
followed by the Q&A.
 
Before we begin, let me remind everyone that today's discussion contains 
forward
-
looking statements based on the environment as we currently see 
it, and as such, does include risks and
 
uncertainties. Please refer to our 
press release for more information on the specific risk factors that could 
cause actual results to differ materially.
 
A brief reminder that this quarter we have provided both GAAP and non
-
GAAP financial measures. Today, 
we will be speaking to the non
-
GAAP 
financial measures when describing our consolidated results. The CFO 
commentary and earnings release, available on intc.com, include the full 
GAAP and non
-
GAAP reconciliations.
 
With that, let me hand it over to Brian.
 
Br
ian Krzanich
 
Thanks Mark. 2017 was a record year for Intel and fourth quarter results 
were outstanding. Well ahead of the forecast we outlined in October, based 
on the strength on both our PC
-
centric and data
-
centric businesses. I will 
review our results w
ith you in just a moment, but before I do that I would 
like to share a few words about security. We've been around the clock with 
our customers and partners to address the security vulnerability know as 
Spectre and Meltdown. While we made progress, I'm acu
tely aware that we 
have more to do, we've committed to being transparent keeping our 
customers and owners appraised of our progress and through our actions, 
building trust.
 
Security is a top priority for Intel, foundational to our products and it's 
critica
l to the success of our data
-
centric strategy. Our near term focus is on 
delivering high quality mitigations to protect our customers infrastructure 
from these exploits. We're working to incorporate silicon
-
based changed to 
future products that will direct
ly address the Spectre and Meltdown threats 
in hardware. And those products will begin appearing later this year.
 
However, these circumstances are highly dynamic and we updated our risk 
factors to reflect both the evolving nature of these specific threats 
and 
litigation as well as the security challenge more broadly. Security has always 
been a priority for us and these events reinforce our continuous mission to 
develop the world's most secured products. This will be an ongoing journey, 
but we're committed t

To keep you informed, we've created a dedicated website and we're 
approaching this work with customer first urgency. I've assigned some of the 
very best minds at Intel to work through this and we're m
aking progress.
 
With that, let's turn to our 2017 and fourth quarter results. We just wrapped 
up the best year in Intel's history with the best quarter in Intel history. 
Revenue was up 4% year
-
over
-
year in the fourth quarter, 8% if you exclude 
McAfee, sett
ing an all time record. Our data center, IoT and FPGA businesses 
each set revenue record. We meet or exceeded all of the financial 
commitments we made to you at the beginning of the year and our focus on 
efficiency and profitable growth produce significant
 
leverage, driving non 
GAAP operating income up 21%.
 
Our data
-
centric businesses deliver the technology foundations for the newer 
data economy, making the analysis, storage and transfer of data possible, 
giving our customers the ability to turn data into a
mazing experiences and 
actionable insights. They are central to our strategy. Data
-
centric revenue 
excluding McAfee was up an impressive 21% over the fourth quarter of last 
year, and I would like to share a few highlights with you starting with DCG.
 
DCG's 
revenue was up 20% over the fourth quarter. The cloud segment was 
up 35%, comp service providers were up 16%, enterprise was up 11%, and 
our adjacency revenue was up 35%. We saw broad base demand strength 
with customer preference for high performance produ
cts driving richer ASP 
mix. Cloud segment results were driven by significant volume growth and 
continued customer preference for higher performance products. In the 
comm service provider segment, we continue to take share and grow 
revenue as customers chos
e IA
-
based solutions to virtualize and transform 
their network.
 
Enterprise segment strength was driven mostly by ASP as customers 
transition to Xeon Scalable product in a seasonally strong fourth quarter, IT 
buy window. While we continue to see enterprise 
customers offload 
workloads to public clouds, we're also seeing those customers prioritize 
performance solutions for hybrid and on
-
premise build outs. Customers 
across all of our segments are accelerating deployment of the Xeon Scalable 
processors, which i
s ramping roughly in line with our historical Xeon 
transition.
 
We continue to demonstrate leadership and progress in artificial intelligence 
with the data center, for the edge and from 100s of watts to megawatts. Our 
software optimization for the Caffe fra
mework has improved already strong 
Xeon Scalable ResNet
-
50 influenced performance by two times, just since 
the launch in July. The first generation Nervana Neural Network Processor 
ran on neural network less than two weeks after we received silicon and 
we'
ve shipped our first customer unit.
 
At the edge, Google announced its AIY vision kit featuring our Movidius 
vision processing unit and Amazon announced the DeepLens, the world's 
first deep learning enabled video camera for developers, which uses an 
install
ed CPU, graphics and compute libraries for deep neural networks. 
We're also seeing design wins that combine technology from multiple data
-
centric business units, reinforcing the idea that we've developed a unique 
and differentiated collection of capabiliti
es that can address customer 
challenges together more effectively than anyone business could alone.
 
A great example is Darvas' recent announcement of their deep sense 
product line, which combines core CPU, Intel FPGA
-
based network video 
recorders along wit
h Movidius VPU
-
based cameras, enable people and 
automobile detection in smart city applications using artificial intelligence. In 
the Programmable Solutions Group, we saw strong double
-
digit growth in 
the data center, auto, embedded, and advanced product c
ategories, as well 
as last time buys of legacy products. That strength was partially offset by 
softness in the comm's infrastructure.
 
In Q4, we launched the Intel FPGA SDK for OpenCL to dramatically increase 
productivity for our customers. We also delivere
d first
-
to
-
market leadership 
innovations in this Stratix 10 product line, including the first SoC FPGA with 
an armed processor at more than 1 million logic elements and the industry's 
first FPGA with integrated HBM2 memory. Our Internet of Things grew 21%,
 
with continuing momentum in retail, video and in
-
vehicle infotainment 
vertical. Wind River saw strong multiyear contractor growth and delivered its 
most profitable quarter ever for Intel.
 
Memory business grew 9% and achieved profitability in Q4, a strong 
client 
volume was partially offset by a one quarter qualification delay of a data 
center SSD volume. Last quarter, I shared with you that our leadership 
technology is resulting in strong customer interest in long
-
term supply 
arrangement. That interest has 
continued to grow. We have since signed 
additional agreement and now expect prepayments totaling roughly $2 
billion over the course of 2018. Mobileye had another strong quarter and 
business momentum is growing. Our steady design winds over the course of 
20
17 and 15 new program launches in 2018 are both increases a 2.5 times 
over the prior period.
 
We now have level two plus and level three design wins with 11 automakers 
to collectively represent more than 50% of global vehicle production. These 
advance progr
am launch over the next two year and they represent a major 
lead in functionality versus current semi
-
autonomous distance, and our 
significant step towards saleable level four and level five fully autonomous 
distance. We reached an important milestone in t
he fourth quarter, the 
announcement of our level through five autonomous driving platform based 
on EyeQ5 and Atom, which will sample over the next few months.
 
We believe this will be the most advanced, scalable and efficient platform of 
its kind. EyeQ5 wil
l deliver 23 tera ops of deep learning performance and a 
10 watt power envelops or about 2.5 times, the efficiency of the 
competition. Just a couple of weeks ago at CES, we announced that by in 
2018, we expect 2 million EyeQ

solution. The resulting map will first be utilized in level three getting in 2019. 
The ability to crowd

sourced data to build and rapidly update the procession 
match required for high
er levels of automation is a major differentiator in 
our plan to build out the safest and most affordable autonomous vehicle 
system. It's also a great example of our data

centric strategy at work.
 
And finally, I would like to touch on our PC
-
centric busine
sses, the client 
computing group. Over the course of the year, the PC market improved our 
14
-
nanometer manufacturing cost came down and the competitive 
environment intensified. Against our backdrop, DCG is focused on innovation 
and performance especially i
n growth segment by gaming two in one thin 
and notebook and enterprise, led to record core mix and record i7 volume in 
the fourth quarter. We also shift our first low volume 10

nanometers skew 
and our modem business grew 26% over the fourth quarter of last
 
year.
 
Intel is undergoing one of the most significant transformation incorporate 
history. While the PC

centric company. We've 
made thoughtful disciplined investment along the way that expanded our 
TAM to $260 billion. Those same 
investments have produced the collection 
of data

digit rate 
and approaching 50% of the Company's revenue. Our opportunity is larger 
than it's ever been and we're hungry to compete and win.
 
In 2018, o
ur highest priorities will be executing to our strategy and meeting 
the commitments we make to our owners and our customers. This concludes 
our commitment to restoring customer confidence in the security of their 
data. This year Intel will celebrate a half
 
century of innovation that has 
profoundly changed the world. Over the last 50 years, we invented the 
architecture and manufacturing technologies that have made personal 
computing, the Internet and the cloud not only possible but pervasive. The 
journey has
n't been without challenges, nothing worth doing ever is.
 
Our culture has been forged through taking challenges head on and 
developing solutions our customers can count on. That includes working 
directly to address the Spectre and Meltdown security threats
. We leave 
2017 on a financial high note, but I am even more excited about what's to 
come about our strategy producing great products for our customers and 
great returns for our owners.
 
I see Intel innovation changing the world for another 50 years and 
that 
journey starts with 2018. Over the coming year, we'll bring amazing 
innovation and performance for the PC market against the state

of

art in the 
artificial intelligence, lead the way towards mass 5G deployment, launch the 
industry's first new memory a

step towards a safer world in which autonomous driving is a reality. Looking 
back on 2017, I could not be more proud of our team and all they have 
accomplished. As I look to our 50th year, I am more optimistic an
d confident 
than I've ever been about Intel's future.
 
And with that, let me hand it over to Bob.
 
Bob Swan
 
Thanks, Brian. The fourth quarter was an outstanding close to a record 2017 
and we're building real momentum heading into 2018. Revenue for the 
quarte
r was $17.1 billion up 8% year
-
over
-
year. Operating income was $5.9 
billion up 21% year
-
over
-
year and EPS of a $1.08 was up 37% year
-
over
-
year. From the capital allocation perspective, we redeemed $1.6 billion of 
2,035 convertible debt, reducing our share 
count by 59 million shares, and 
repurchased 500 million of higher coupon debt and exchanged $1.8 billion 
into 30 year debt at a 1% lower coupon rate. On tax reform, our Q4 GAAP 
earnings reflect a one
-
time tax impact of $5.4 billion, and our guidance 
reflec
ts approximately 7 point improvement in our effective tax rate going 
forward.
 
To summarize, we had a fantastic quarter and year and are on track to 
exceed the three year targets we laid out at our Analyst Day, one full year 
ahead of schedule. Our Q4 result
s demonstrate a continued momentum in 
our transformation from a PC
-
centric to a data
-
centric company. Intel's 
data
-
centric businesses those outside of the PC segment are at an all
-
time 
high mix of 47% of our revenue, up from approximately 40% in 2012. We'v
e 
made significant investments to expand our TAM and do new data rich 
markets like memory, programmable solutions and autonomous driving. 
These investments are just starting to pay off and will fuel Intel's growth 
going forward.
 
Our PC
-
centric business was
 
down 2% in a declining PC market and it 
continuous to be a great source of profitability. DCG delivered its most 
profitable year since 2011 by focusing on premium and growth segments 
with industry leading products. This business generated the cash to fund
 
Intel's investment in new data
-
centric growth. Moving to Q4 earnings, we 
generated significant EPS expansion in the quarter up 37% year
-
over
-
year. 
Our EPS improvement was driven by strong top line growth a five point 
improvement in operating margin and si
gnificant gains from our ICAP 
portfolio.
 
Our gross margins expanded two points in the quarter and outstanding is a 
percent of revenue declined by 3 points as we delivered 700 million more 
revenue and 300 million less spending. In terms of operating efficie
ncy, 
we're well ahead of schedule of meeting our commitment by reducing 
spending to 30% by 2020. We now expect to achieve this goal no later than 
2019. Total spending was down 6% year
-
over
-
year in the fourth quarter 
while we continue to investing in our ke
y priorities including driving more to 
off forward, wining artificial intelligent and autonomous driving. R&D 
spending is a percent of revenue was down approximately 1 point and our 
SG&A cost was down over 2 points as we rationalize our marketing and sales
 
programs and generate significant leverage in our SG&A functions.
 
Let met touch briefly on our segment performance. The Client Computing 
Group had another strong quarter. Revenue of $9 billion was down 2 points 
and operating margins were down 2 points. Op
erating margins were lower 
on 10
-
nanometer transition cost. We saw strength in the commercial gaming 
business and we believe the worldwide PC supply chain is operating at 
healthy level.
 
The Data Center Group had record revenue of $5.6 billion, up 20% year 
over 
year, and operating income of $3 billion grew 59%. Q4 operating margin 
was 54%. As Brian mentioned earlier, we had strong growth in execution 
across all segments. Overall, unit volume was up 10%, ASPs were up 8%, 
and our adjacencies grew 35%. Our ASP 
strength demonstrates the value 
customers see in our high performance products.
 
Xeon Scalable launched in July is ramping well with customer broadly 
deploying its leadership products family. Revenue scale from leadership 
products, ASP strength and the excl
usion of 2016 one
-
time charges drove 
strong operating income growth for the business. For the full year, revenue 
was up 11% and operating margin came in at 44% both ahead of the 
expectations we provided at the beginning of the year.
 
The IoT, NSG, and PSG b
usiness segments are becoming a larger component 
of our overall business, collectively growing 19% year over year. Our 
Internet of Things business achieved record revenue of $879 million, 
growing 21% year over year, driven by strength in industrial and vid
eo and 
continued momentum in our retail business. Operating profit was $260 
million, up 42% year over year. The Mobileye business also had a record 
quarter and we're on track to our deal thesis.
 
As we called out last quarter results for the Mobileye acquis
ition are included 
in our all other segment and reflects the Q4 integration of Intel autonomous 
driving group spending in the Mobileye. Our memory business had revenue 
of $889 million, up 9% year
-
over
-
year with strong demand for data center 
FFT solution an
d demand signals outpacing supply. This segment was 
profitable for the quarter and we expect this segment to be profitable for the 
full year of 2018. Programmable Solutions Group had record revenue of 568 
million with 35% growth driven by strength in data 
center, automotive and 
embedded.
 
Operating profit was a $156 million, up 95% year
-
over
-
year. The Stratix 10 
design win pipeline, which represents FPGAs largest ever doubled over the 
last year due to engagements in 5G, cloud computing and the infrastructure
 
transition to network function for virtualization. We laid out our capital 
allocation priorities early in the year. Invest organically, expand acquisitively 
and return capital to our shareholders and do it wisely. In the year, we 
deliver on our promise.
 
F
irst, we generated strong free cash flow at 10.3 billion in the year and 
returned 8.7 billion to shareholders through dividends of 5.1 billion and 
share repurchase of 3.6 billion. Second, we funded a majority of the 
Mobileye acquisition from the sale of no
n
-
core assets during the year 
including McAfee and the sale of ASML shares. And third, we redeemed 1.6 
billion in convertible debt reducing 59 million shares, and we also tendered 
higher coupon debt for lower coupon debt.
 
Let me expand on the ICAP and trea
sury related transactions we executed in 
the quarter. First, we sold 11.4 million shares of our ASML Holding, which 
generated $2 billion in cash proceeds and again a $1.5 billion. Second, we 
redeemed our 2035 convertible debenture. This redemption created 
a 2.8 
billion cash outflow in a non
-
cash loss of 385 million, which was tax 
decidable. Since this debenture was convertible and therefore dilutive, the 
redemption effectively acted as a buyback that will reduce diluted share 
count by 59 million shares. And
 
third, we successfully tender 2.3 billion of 
high coupon debt in the quarter. We exchange 1.9 billion of all debt in the 
$2 billion of 30
-
year new debt, reducing our coupon rate by 1%.
 
We also redeemed 425 million of all debt for cash. This transaction bo
th 
lowered our leverage and our interest expense. Adding in all up, 2017 was 
another record year for Intel revenue of 62.8 billion was up 9% year
-
over
-
year, driven by 16% growth in our data
-
centric business and 3% growth in 
PC
-
centric business. Operating i
ncome of 19.6 billion was up 18% on strong 
execution across the businesses and discipline spending. Earnings per share 
of $3.46 was up 26% on excellent operational performance and the benefit 
of $0.35 from ICAP net gain. With the change to the accounting r
ules for 
recognizing price changes on equity investments, we do not expect to see 
these ICAP gains repeat.
 
Before I turn to guidance let me provide a little more context on the impact 
of tax reform on our business. Intel's fourth quarter results reflect a 
higher 
GAAP income tax expense of 5.4 billion, as a result of U.S. corporate tax 
reform enacted in December. This includes a one
-
time required tax 
adjustment on previously untaxed foreign earnings able over eight years 
which was partially offset by the re
-
measurement of deferred income taxes 
to the new U.S. statutory tax rate.
 
Looking ahead, we expect the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act will help level the 
playing field for U.S. manufacturers like Intel that compete in today's global 
economy. We expect the 2018 tax r
ate of approximately 14% driven by 
lower U.S. statutory tax rate of 21% lower tax on foreign income benefits of 
U.S. exporters and the continuation of the R&D credit. The change in our tax 
rate drives approximately $0.28 in 2018 EPS. Intel has a rich histo
ry of 
investing the U.S. led research and development and U.S. manufacturing. 
This last year we committed to the setup of our fab 42 facility creating 
thousands of jobs at completion. These tax forms provide further incentive 
to continue investments like t
his.
 
Before we turn to our 2018 outlook, I also want to highlight two accounting 
rule changes. First, new accounting rules for revenue recognition; and 
second, accounting for equity gains and losses. We do not expect a material 
impact to revenue from the r
evenue recognition accounting change. The 
changes in accounting for equity gains and losses will require the recognition 
of unrealized price changes each quarter. The equity holdings like our ASML 
position will see mark
-
to
-
market adjustments that will flow
 
through earnings 
in 2018, which may create greater volatility on a GAAP basis. This change 
resulted in an impact of 2.7 billion of net unrealized gain at year end that we 
booked to equity on January 1, 2018.
 
Now moving to the full
-
year, we are forecasting
 
the midpoint of the revenue 
range at $65 billion up 4% year
-
over
-
year. We expect operating margin of 
approximately 30% with gross margins down 2 to 2.5 points and spending 
as a percent of revenue to be down 1 to 1.5 points. The decline in gross 
margin is 
driven by growth in our adjacent businesses as we play in an 
expanded TAM and transition costs associated with 10
-
nanometer, both 
partially offset by higher gross margins from our 14
-
nanometer products. 
We expect EPS of $3.55 up 14% excluding the ICAP net 
gains driven by a 
strong top line growth and a lower tax rate of approximately 14%, which will 
increase EPS by approximately $0.28.
 
We expect to net capital deployed at $12 billion. This reflects gross CapEx of 
14 billion offset by approximately $2 billion
 
of customer prepayments for 
memory supply agreement. Increasing CapEx reflects our and our customers 
confidence in our memory technology leadership. We expect free cash flow 
of $13 billion, an increase of approximately 30% directly contributing to our 
dec
ision to raise our dividend by a full 10%.
 
As we look to the first quarter of 2018, we're forecasting the midpoint of 
revenue range at $15 billion up 5% year
-
over
-
year. We expect operating 
margin of approximately 27%, flat year
-
over
-
year with a 3 point dec
line in 
gross margin offset a 3 point decline in spending. We expect EPS of $0.70 up 
11% excluding ICAP net gain from strong top line growth and a lower 
effective tax rate.
 
We believe 2018 will be another record year for Intel and we feel great 
about where
 
we are entering year two of our three year transformation. 
We've met and exceeded our commitments. Our PC
-
centric team continues 
to operate very well in a down market, and our data
-
centric businesses are 
up double
-
digits collectively as we continue to tra
nsform the Company to 
power the cloud and smart connected devices.
 
With that, let me turn it back to Mark.
 
Mark Henninger
 
Alright, thank you Brian and Bob. Moving on now to the Q&A as is our 
normal practice, we would ask each participant to ask one questio
n and just 
one follow
-
up, if you have one. Operator, please go ahead and introduce our 
first questioner.
 
Question
-
and
-
Answer Session
 
Operator
 
Our first question comes from the line of John Pitzer from Credit Suisse. Your 
line is now open.
 
John Pitzer
 
My 
first question just revolves around the revenue guidance for the March 
quarter at the midpoint down about 12% sequentially is a lot worse than I 
guess normal season, and I guess I am trying to figure out kind of the 
parameters that you guys are using to co
me up with that number. Was there 
something in the DCG strength in the calendar first quarter that you don't 
think is repeatable given your comments around the PC supply chain being 
healthy, that to me feels a little bit more seasonal than not in the March
 
quarter? So I am just kind of curious as to why the Q1 revenue would be so 
much below, what is being kind of the five year medium seasonality for Q1?
 
Bob Swan
 
John, thanks, it's Bob. So really two things going on, one, the enterprise 
growth in DCG as Bria
n highlighted, it was up 11% in the fourth quarter. So 
extremely strong seasonal growth for enterprise, a little bit 
--
 
more than we 
expected frankly, that's number one. Number two, PSG 35% growth was 
helped by end of life sales during the course of the qu
arter. And if you adjust 
for maybe a more normalized enterprise growth and PSG growth, you get to 
more of a seasonal Q4, Q1 dynamic, so in line with seasonal if you make 
those two adjustments.
 
John Pitzer
 
And then Brian on my second question revolves aroun
d CapEx, I think it was 
a year ago on this conference call that you kind of mentioned that you 
thought that calendar year '17 and calendar year '18 would be sort of above 
churn line CapEx spending for you guys and then you thought it would come 
down again 
in calendar year '19 to a more normal trend albeit you didn't 
quantify the trend. Just given the big uptick in '18 the 14 billion, I realized 

about kind of the trend line CapEx from he
re especially in light of the 
changing relationship between yourself and Micron on INFT?
 
Brian Krzanich
 
So you know my prospective is, if you take a look at right memory kind of 
logic on our CapEx scaled with our increase in revenue and kind of our 
overall
 

a look at it, really on a year by year basis, and I would tell you that Bob's is 
really doing a good job of helping their business unit, look over the capital. 
And when we have demand e
nough and people are willing to pay upfront to 

go head and put that capacity in place plus what we think what Mark and we 
can do as distributing across overall market.
 

eally independent of that changing relationship with Micron, 


This was really about what we saw for the ov
erall main memory market plus 
the additional capital and capacity that people wanted to reserve through 
that process. We will look at that each year John and say, okay as we look 
out into '19 at the end of '18 will be that same analysis.
 
John Pitzer
 
Thank 
you for that evaluation, Brian.
 
Bob Swan
 
I would just 
--
 
sorry, just follow on to Brian's comment. In the way we're 
looking at memory and we talked a bit about this on the last call is increased 

eveloping 
where those relationship, they will help fund the scaling of the capacity to 
grow the business and we're really trying to match net capital employee to 
be in conjunction with known customer demand. So what that means 
--
 
what that meant for 2017 a
s the net capital was roughly $1.5 billion. We 
held that relatively flat in 2018, so our growth capital is higher.
 
We have more conviction in the customer base to fund $2 billion of the 

ad
option of our technology to effectively and efficiently scale the business. 
And then just the only other point that make logic and remember year ago 
in terms of our outlook for growth we're well ahead of our outlook for 

, implied in our outlook was probably 
62.2 billion kind of number in 2018. Obviously, with our guide now 65 billion 
were 2.5 billion higher and if that incremental growth that's placing similar 
demand for our logic, logic capacity both for 14, 10
-
nanometer
 
and as we 
take forward about 7
-
nanometer.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question comes from Joe Moore from Morgan Stanley. 
Your line is open.
 
Joe Moore
 
I wonder if you could talk about OpEx obviously you've been pretty discipline 
there bringing that down, 
but you've also got some other initiatives you 
announced to discrete graphics effort, maybe if you talk about 
--
 
it seems 
like we costs a lot, if I just look at what your competitors are spending? And 

 
that used to be 
shared with Micron. So just, can you talk about the puts and takes are? And 
is there something we should think about this coming down to sort of offset 
those potential increases?
 
Brian Krzanich
 

give you there under the cover detail 

things like the discrete graphics is a ramping spend. The memory R&D 

e given an 
overall efficiency and all of our R&D spending to offset that. So increasing in 
GPU spending, there are some other increases as well around things like 
autonomous driving and some of the other artificial intelligence in some of 
the emerging area
s.
 

being offset by efficiencies that were driving into the rest of our product 

place of innovation going 
on our core products, while we fund these new 
initiatives as well and not to compete from our continued efficiency efforts 
across spending as a percent of revenue.
 
Bob Swan
 

from 36% t
o 35% to 34% to a second half of 2017 at roughly 31% of 


growth; and number two, we're making real trade
-
offs in 

investing our money. As we go into implied in our guidance as we go 

annualized 2017 spending level.
 

--
 
and underneath that, continuing to drive efficienc
ies 
and sales and marketing, as we become more of a B2B or data
-
centric 
company and getting real leverage on our G&A functions across the board. 

Including the second half, we expe
ct to make continued progress while 
making the critical investments and things like discrete graphic, autonomous 
driving, artificial intelligence and continuing to invest in Moore's Law.
 
Joe Moore
 
AND as you think about that NAND investment, I guess people
 
have asked 
me, what your 
--
 
what the separation from Micron on the long
-
term path 
means? Is that you know sort of more of a focus on proprietary products like 
3D XPoint? Or do you from fully committed to sort of more competitive 
NAND to your more competit
ive market?
 
Brian Krzanich
 
So, sort to make sure you 
--
 
we clarify a little bit, Joe. The separation of 
development work is 
--
 
again out in time think of it in 2020 timeframe is 
when real independences come and its NAND specific. So, we continue to 

separation of the Company or something about the relationship. The 
relationship with Micron continues to be a good one. And I foresee it will 
continue to be good one in the future a
s well. This is about direction of 
where we are going to take our products and we have talked about our 
aggregate data center
-
centric and really tie a performance and allaying to 
the customer market that we are really looking at. And so, the spending in 
R&
D we are talking about right now is really a NAND specific, 3D XPoint 
continues to be a joint effort.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question comes from Ambrish Srivastava with BMO 
Capital Markets. Your line is now open.
 
Ambrish Srivastava
 
I wanted to go bac
k to DCG specifically on the up margin front. We have not 
seen the high handle if my model is correct, it's been eight plus quarters. 
So, can you please speak to the sustainability of the up margin? And kind of 
what were the drivers that got you to that le
vel? And then I have a follow
-
up 
for these things.
 
Bob Swan
 
Yes, so we came into the year and we indicated that we expected margins 
for the full
-
year to be in the 40% to 45%, and obviously, we started out low 
but we said our expectations were that we grow 
throughout to the course of 
year. A couple of things in the fourth quarter, obviously, you know growth. 
So we'll build leverage on our existing investment was a big contributor.
 
Secondly, ASPs were up 8% so of the 20% growth ASPs accounted for 8 
point to t
hat. And as Brian highlighted, whether its cloud comps or 
enterprise, customers in the quarter will really paying for performance and 
that performance for us was higher ASPs.
 
Third, continued progress on unit costs. And then last you may remember 
last year
's fourth quarter, we had some warrantee and IP
-
related charges in 
that data center business that I think cost was roughly 4 points year ago. So 
last year's, we're little deflated. But good volume leverage, strong ASPs as 
customers paid for performance and
 
unit cost improving.
 
Ambrish Srivastava
 
So we should expect this level going forward Bob?
 
Bob Swan
 
Yes, I think I wouldn't get too far away from the 40 to 45 to be honest with 

consi
stent performance over the course of the year or last couple of years. 
Comms, our performance we believe it was real strong in a somewhat 
sluggish market so real share gains. But the high kind of seasonal enterprise 
growth and strong ASPs in the quarter, w
e think are more seasonal in nature 
and we are not anticipating enterprise growth to stay at these levels as we 
go into '18.
 
Ambrish Srivastava
 
And then from my follow
-
up on the gross margin for next year, you provided 
the sort of qualitatively the adjacen
cies as well as the cost impact from the 
10 RAM. But A, I was surprised you didn't mention competition because now 
AMD will have a full year of a product in an area they never were for 
--
 
I 

 
question 
is, are you seeing any competition? Are you factoring that in? And then B, 
would it be possible to quantify the two impacts that you've mentioned?
 
Bob Swan
 
Yes, it's just 
--
 
I'd highlight three things that are driving the deterioration 
that I'd s
tart first with 
--
 
we've always characterized our long
-
term gross 
margins to be in the 55% to 65% range, and for the last several years and 
including in our guidance this year will be at the upper end of that 60% to 
65% range. But for the last couple of ye
ars that we've had maturity of 14
-
nanometer and that maturity both in terms of getting more and more 
performance and lower and lower unit costs, has been contributors to gross 
margin.
 
As we go into '18, we see 14
-
nanometer modest contributions from 
profita
bility because we've matured on the cost curve, that's an increasingly 
competitive environment, and we don't anticipate dramatic ASP 
improvements over the entire company, some cases yes, but for the most 
part, no. So, we'll see some continued improvement i
n 14
-
nanometer 
products during the course of the year.
 
Secondly we're really accelerating the growth of our adjacent businesses, 
the investments that we've been making in both the data
-
centric businesses 
and our growth in modem. Those are contributing to o
ur year
-
on
-
year EPS 
growth; however, those both of those product lines of businesses have lower 
margin. So our success in modem and memory is having a mixed impact on 
our gross margins.
 
The third area is we're going from 10
-
nanometer startup where costs ar
e 
coming down to more the ramp to the 10
-
nanometer and that ramp is going 
to weigh on the margins, as we begin to develop production going into the 
second half of the year where we're way up the curve where our yields and 
costs are. So, those are kind of t
he three things as we see it. If I were to 
characterize roughly plus one, roughly minus two, roughly minus one, 
rounding those.
 
Brian Krzanich
 
I understand your question about specifically around competition. I think 
every year we look at it as the competi
tive environment, and we're out to 
compete for our customers. And so we factor that in each year appropriately 
I think against the competition. So we look at the competitive environment 
and we believe Xeon Scalable, great performance that has, our overall 
product roadmap, we think we have a highly competitive roadmap and have 
adjusted for that in our forecast.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question comes from Stacy Rasgon from Bernstein. 
Your line is now open.
 
Stacy Rasgon
 
Firstly, can you walk us through yo
ur free cash flow waterfall? I can't get 
your flattish operating income on 4% revenue growth. It was a couple of 
billion dollar ICAP gains, CapEx I guess maybe flattish with some memory 
payments. Taxes maybe get to me a third to half of the way there, but 
where does the rest of the free cash flow comes from? Are you just draining 
the kind of working capital or what? Can you walk us through?
 
Bob Swan
 
Yes, first $13 billion free cash flow, up roughly 30% year
-
over

year, first 
higher cash earnings. Our guide h
as EPS of up roughly 14% in that guide 
there is depreciation has grown in '18 relative to 2017. So that has just 
higher cash earnings. Secondly, we do expect lower working capital as we go 
through 2018. And third, we have higher strategic customer supply 
a
greement and those three things were all contributed positive. And then 
obviously, Stacy, the higher growth capital is a bit of an offset; so longer 
cash earning, better working capital, more strategic supply partially offset by 
higher CapEx.
 
Stacy 
Rasgon
 
Okay, so my follow
-
up, I want to ask about that gross next year of your kind 
of adjacent businesses versus your core businesses. Of that 65 billion of that 
4%, can you give us a feeling how much of that is coming from adjacent, I 
guess mostly memory
 
in modems versus the core must be the decent given 
the gross margin pressures? And I guess as a corollary to that you 
mentioned a one delay 
--
 
one quarter delay in data center memories, was 
statement in XPoint?
 
Brian Krzanich
 
No, that was a NAND out start
 
with just answer to that question, Stacy. That 
was 3D NAND SSD we 
--
 
has been delayed in the fourth quarter and those 
are being addressed now. So, that was that comment.
 
Stacy Rasgon
 
And growth on 
--
 
sorry, go ahead.
 
Bob Swan
 
I think on your first questio
n. In the 65 billion, we characterize it as roughly 
low single digit decline in our PC
-
centric businesses. So implied to that is, PC 
may be decline a little bit more and modem adjacency within the CCG 
segment partially offsetting that. In the overall guide
, we said that the data
-
centric businesses would be growing in the mid teens, obviously that we 
believe that would be a strongest segment within the makeup of our data
-
centric business will be in memory. There would be the function of customer 
calls that B
rian just highlighted, and we expect NSG growth to accelerate 
throughout the course of 2018. Those single digits decline on PC
-
centric and 
mid team growth on data
-
centric businesses.
 
Stacy Rasgon
 
So, what is the memory strength implies for the data and the
 
growth of the 
DCG growth, unprecedentedly given the strong performance in Q4?
 
Bob Swan
 
For the most part, the wins for NSG that will go through date center will be 
late in 2018 and won't really have an impact on the overall growth rate of 
that business. S
o it's primarily about growth of 3D NAND during the course 
of the year.

Thank you. Our next question comes from C.J. Muse from Evercore. Your 
line is open.
 
C.J. Muse
 
I guess couple of housekeeping questions, if I could kind of put them 
together. C
urious, if you could share with us, how are you thinking about 
CapEx spend between logic and memory? And then on the 10
-
nanometer 
start
-

those costs?
 
Bob Swan
 
First, on the CapEx, we indi
cated the gross capital in the year of 14 billion 


two pieces; memory, net capital employee no chang
e and logic CapEx up 
roughly a $1 billion year
-
on
-
year. And as we mentioned earlier that $1 
billion is a function of primary growth continuing to grow 14
-
nanometer. 
Second, scaling up 10
-
nanometer. And third, investing in next node 7
-
nanometer during the c
ourse of the year. So, those three things are really 
driving the $1 billion increase in CapEx for logic.
 
The second part of your question 
--
 
so for 10
-
nanometer, as we bring that 
equipment online, we turn on. There is some equipment now that being 
deprecia
ted, but as we bill bring online as we ramp in the second half of the 

expect our depreciation bill in second half for the year to be growing. And 

-
-
 

contributors to the gross margin deterioration during the course of the year, 
as we start to ramp 10
-
nanometer.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question comes from Vivek Arya from Bank of America. 
Your line is n
ow open.
 
Vivek Arya
 

of pricing for many resolution on the processor security issues? There is one 
line of thinking that says, customers might decelerate their purchase, and 
th
en you have others industry saying that customers might accelerate that 

implications positive or negative from this issue near
-
term and longer term?
 
Brian Krzanich
 
Sure, so we try a
nd kind of break it into two kind of answers for that Vivek. 

expect any material impact of this security exploit on our spending or 

ked that in. From a fourth 
half standpoint, we actually made our forecast and we've checked it as we 
go through this the first two weeks here of the year against our prior 
forecast to make sure that the forecasting incorporated any changes or any 
signs we'
re seeing up or down.
 
And I would tell you at the highest level, we are not seeing much of the 
change in those forecasts as a result of that the flow. I'd tell you it's pretty 

there and 
then our forecast we had a forecast we checked in as we go 

as we looked at it.
 
The only other think I'd add for Brian's comment earlier, we kind of go into 
the year realizing tha
t it's an increasingly competitive environment and our 
focus is on right now continuing to bring the best highest performance 
products to market, but also to lots of time and energy spend on focusing on 
fixing those issue, primarily through software patche
s as opposed to short
-
term hardware things.
 
Vivek Arya
 
And as my follow
-
up. For the full
-
year, how should we think about a growth 
in just the DCG business? I understand you gave some color around the 
entire data centric group which includes memory than 
other segments, but 
just sort of apples
-
to
-
apples how should we think about growth in just DCG 
that had a very strong double
-
digit growth here in '17?
 
Brian Krzanich
 
Throughout the course of the year, we 
--
 
sorry, throughout the course of 
'17, we kind of g
uided high single
-
digits; and we kind of executed to that 

quarters of the year really with the exception of the high seasonal spend for 
enterprise. And that really took us from a hi
gh
-
single digit to low double
-
digit or 11% growth for the year. As we go into '18, we do not expect that. 
We think that in the enterprise space, things will go back down to the 
negative single
-

differen
ce in the how we laid out DCG a year
-
ago. So that's how we are 
thinking about it.
 
If I maybe elevate that back up a little bit and just think about when we are 
putting together our plans for the year, there is two areas where our 
tendency is to be a little
 
cautious on the outlook. One is PC TAM, we tend to 
be a little more cautious on PC TAM, and we tend to be a little more cautious 
as we think about enterprise growth in the DCT business. And the reason we 
do that as we think it's important to be cautious g
et our cost in line, and if 
our assumptions on market rates to growth turn out to be conservative, we 
will benefit from 
--
 
we believe we benefit from higher volume and real strong 
flow through to net income. That's how we plan the year covenant to 2017 
and
 
we did kind of the same thing for 2018.
 

2017 as we enter 2018 because we really haven't assume a change in 
trajectory of enterprise CIO spending in the course of the year.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Yes, our last question comes from Blayne Curtis from Barclays. 
Your line is now open.
 
Blayne Curtis
 
Just wanted to go back to the DCG ASPs. You were talking about the ramp of 
scalable being kind of to plan, but then I think you got a nice tailw
ind and I 
think you implied enterprise at a higher percent of scalable. So just wanted 
to give us talk on broad strokes just where the scalable ramp is here? And 
how your expectations kind of getting through the year where that could go?
 
Brian Krzanich
 
So 
I'll start and Bob can add some number detail in all. The Xeon Scalable 
ramp is right in line with prior ramps of similar products on our DCG 
roadmap. And what you saw when you talked about Q4 was not necessarily 
more Xeon Scalable, but people buying up th
e stock on Xeon Scalable which 
drove the ASP. So, they're buying a higher performance, higher priced part, 
and that's not uncommon when the early stages of the ramp. People come in 
and they typically want to buy the highest performance parts at the 
beginni
ng. And then they fill out their distribution as other buyers come in 
and other parts in the market kind of opened up. So, ramps on schedule and 
aligned with high ramps and the ASP was more about SKU, they're buying 
up on higher performance parts than nece
ssarily a volume statement.
 
Blayne Curtis
 
And then I also want to go back on just 
--
 
I just want to also go back on 
gross margin as well as you look for March that you mentioned, the drop is 
from adjacent businesses as well 10
-
nanometer. Obviously, memory 
you're 
signaling a big ramp and it doesn't move out fully. I just wonder, Bob, if you 
just walk through the 10
-
nanometer startup costs as they kind of move 
through the year and kind of picking our line between those two in Q1, 
what's the bigger factor?
 
Bri
an Krzanich
 
So, actually the mix dynamics are going to be a bigger factor overall for the 
year both in Q1 and for the rest of the year as our memory and modem 
business continue to accelerate strong growth. So that's going to be the 
biggest impact. I think 
10
-
nanometer will have an impact just right off the 
gate and will kind of continue throughout the year, as we scale volume, but 
also need to improve yields during the course of the year. So hopefully that's 
helpful.

GAAP and non
-
GAAP reconciliations.
 
With that, let me hand it over to Bob.
 
Robert Swan
 
Thanks, Mar
k. With the interim introduction, I thought on our outlook I was 
getting demoted already. But look, coming off a record 2018, our top line 
results came in slightly higher than expectations, with upsides in the PC and 
IoT segments, offset by incremental NAN
D pricing weakness. Total revenue 
of $16.1 billion was flat year
-
over
-
year, as our PC
-
centric business grew 4% 
and our data
-
centric businesses were down 5%. The team executed well, 
though underlying trends are concerning, and as a result, we've revised our
 
expectations down for the full year.
 
I'll give you some insight into the customer trends informing our outlook, 
but first, I'd like to take a few minutes to recap the progress we've made 
over the first quarter. It's been just under 3 months since I was ho
nored 
with the best job in the world. At that time, I said that our leadership team 
would focus relentlessly on delivering for our customers to take advantage of 
the biggest opportunity in our company's history. We're making important 
progress by intensify
ing our focus in 3 key areas: expanding our TAM, 
accelerating innovation and improving our execution while evolving our 
culture. I'd like to spend a few minutes talking about our philosophy and 
progress in each of those areas.
 
First, expanding our TAM. We 
are transforming from a PC
-
centric company 
to a data
-
centric company, and our ambitions are bigger than they've ever 
been. Our aim is to identify and capitalize on key technology inflections that 
set us up to play a larger role in our customers' success wh
ile improving 
returns for our owners. You can see the impact of this approach in our Q1 
execution.
 
For example, our first
-
ever data
-
centric portfolio launch marked an 
important milestone in our efforts to capitalize on the AI opportunity and 
undisputed tec
hnology inflection. Our new second
-
generation Xeon Scalable 
is the only processor in the industry with built
-
in artificial intelligence 
acceleration. Not only did we deliver a 14x generation
-
over
-
generation 
performance improvement, but we also showed CPU p
erformance beating 
GPU performance on major AI workloads like recommendation engines. And 
we worked closely with the software industry ahead of the launch to deliver 
a great out
-
of
-
the
-
box experience for customers like Siemens. They're 
collaborating with u
s on a breakthrough AI
-
based cardiac MRI model. This 
application has the potential to provide real
-
time diagnosis using the DL 
Boost technology in our newest Xeon Scalable processor.
 
Another TAM
-
expanding business that continues to gain traction is Mobiley
e, 
with 8 new global ADAS designs in the first quarter alone, including our first 
win in India. Mobileye's real
-
time crowd
-
sourced mapping technology, Road 
Experience Management or REM, continues to build momentum with a major 
North American automaker adop
ting this breakthrough data
-
centric 
capability. Autonomous driving is a technology inflection that we're ready to 
lead.
 
2019 will be a foundational year for another disruptive technology, 5G. As 
you know, we recently sharpened our 5G focus. When it became 
apparent 
that we don't have a clear path to profitability in 5G smartphone modems, 
we acted. We are now winding down that business and conducting a 
strategic assessment of 5G modems for the PC and IoT sectors while 
continuing to meet our current 4G custome
r commitments. By acting now, 
we focus our 5G efforts on the transformation of the wireless network and 
edge infrastructure, where we have a clear technology advantage, market 
share to win and a strategic role to play with customers.
 
At Mobile World Congre
ss, we demonstrated a range of 5G products under 
development, including the 5G
-
ready N3000 FPGA acceleration card and the 
new 10
-
nanometer
-
based Snow Ridge network SoC for use in 5G base 
stations. As networks cloudify, Intel is in a great position to win i
n this base 
station segment, where we expect to grow to 40% market segment share by 
2022. The vast majority of the 5G market opportunity and profit is in the 
transformation of network and edge infrastructure, where we are now laser 
focused.
 
Next, accelerat
ing innovation. Successfully competing in a bigger TAM 
requires a broad range of products and technologies. Only Intel has the 
breadth of IP to deliver leadership products across increasingly diverse 
workloads for the data
-
centric era. Harnessing data for 
discovery, invention 
and business value is not a one
-
size
-
fits
-
all computing challenge. That's why 
we are investing in 6 important pillars of innovation: process technology, 
architecture, memory, interconnect, security features and software. Already 
this y
ear, we've introduced incredible examples of this approach to 
innovation across the business. Let me take a minute to talk about a few.
 
We are currently architecting what we expect will be the United States' first 
exascale supercomputer for the U.S. Depart
ment of Energy's Argonne 
National Laboratory. This supercomputer, called Aurora, will be delivered in 
2021 and powered by Intel technologies designed specifically for the 
convergence of artificial intelligence and high
-
performance computing. These 
include 
a future generation of the Intel Xeon Scalable processor, Intel's Xe 
compute architecture, a future generation of Optane persistent memory and 
Intel's One API software. It's a great example of how our data
-
centric 
products architected together can deliver 
technology breakthroughs for our 
customers.
 
We are also accelerating innovation in our PC
-
centric business. For example, 
our team is hard at work with our OEM customers to define and deliver a 
stunning new class of next
-
generation laptops. We call this Pro
ject Athena, 
and the first of these sleek, beautiful designs are coming in the second half 
of 2019. And just this week, we launched the most powerful generation of 
Intel Core mobile processors ever, designed for gamers and content 
creators.
 
On the process 
technology front, our teams executed well in Q1 and our 
velocity is increasing. We remain on track to have volume client systems on 
shelves for the holiday selling season. And over the past 4 months, the 
organization drove a nearly 2x improvement in the ra
te at which 10
-
nanometer products moved through our factories.
 
Finally, execution and culture. This is about concentrating our resources on 
the vital few programs that will have an impact on our customers' success 
and our owners' return, rather than the tr
ivial many. Over the last couple of 
years, that focus has resulted in exiting McAfee and wearables business, 
shutting down Saffron and divesting Wind River. And our spending as a 
percentage of revenue has gone from approximately 36% to about 30% this 
quart
er. It has allowed us to invest more of our resources, and just as 
importantly, our collective attention and focus, where it really counts. By 
doing fewer things, we'll execute better at the things that matter most.
 
Specific areas where we need to improve 
execution include meeting 
customer demand and delivering on our 10
-
nanometer lineup of products, 
and we are making progress. Our supply constraints have had a disruptive 
impact on our customers and ecosystem. We've committed never again to 
be a constraint 
on our customers' growth. We've increased capacity to 
improve our position in the second half, although product mix will continue 
to be a challenge in the third quarter as our teams align available supply 
with customer demand.
 
As I shared earlier, our conf
idence in 10
-
nanometer is also improving. In 
addition to the manufacturing velocity improvement I described earlier, we 
expect to qualify our first volume 10
-
nanometer product, Icelake, this 
quarter and are increasing our 10
-
nanometer volume goals for the 
year.
 
I'll shift now to our full year outlook. Going forward, George will deliver our 
forecast. But given this is his third week with us, I'll share my thoughts on 
our full year reset and he'll review our first quarter results and second 
quarter guide.
 
Our
 
conversations with customers and partners across our PC and data
-
centric businesses over the past couple of months have made several trends 
clear. The decline in memory pricing has intensified. The data center 
inventory and capacity digestion that we desc
ribed in January is more 
pronounced than we expected, and China headwinds have increased, leading 
to a more cautious IT spending environment. And yet those same customer 
conversations reinforce our confidence that demand will improve in the 
second half. So
 
we've reassessed our '19 expectations based on the 
challenges we're seeing.
 
Our full year outlook is now $69 billion in revenue, down 3% year
-
over
-
year 
and down approximately $2.5 billion from our previous estimate. Given the 
magnitude of change, we'll be
 
somewhat more granular in explaining the 
drivers. We now see data
-
centric revenue down low single digits year
-
over
-
year, with DCG down mid
-
single digits year
-
over
-
year off a tough compare, 
continued China weakness and inventory and capacity absorption. We
 
are 
also anticipating an incrementally more challenging NAND pricing 
environment.
 
Our PC
-
centric forecast remains unchanged at low single digits. We are 
forecasting operating margin to be 32%, down approximately 3 points year
-
over
-
year and down approximat
ely 2 points from our previous guide. This 
outlook reflects lower full year revenue and a year
-
over
-
year decline in gross 
margins as a result of the 10
-
nanometer ramp and NAND pricing.
 
We continue to see good discipline on spending and expect our exit from
 
the 
5G smartphone modem segment, annualized in 2018 spending actions, and 
incremental spending efficiencies to reduce OpEx by approximately $1 billion 
year
-
over
-
year, partially offsetting the impact of lower gross margin. We 
now forecast full year EPS at 
$4.35 per share, down approximately 5% year
-
over
-
year and $0.25 from our previous guide. We now expect our full year 
tax rate to be 12%, up 1 point year
-
over
-
year and down 1.5 points versus 
our prior guide, largely as a result of lower pretax income.
 
Before I hand the call over to George, I'd like to welcome him as Intel's new 
CFO. I've known George for a long time from his CFO days at Applied 
Materials while I was a board member. He brings deep industry knowledge 
from prior roles. He's a true team pla
yer and he cares deeply about people 
development and diversity. George will review our first quarter financials and 
second quarter guide, then we'll get to your questions. George?
 
George Davis
 
Thanks, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm delighted to be 
at Intel and 
look forward to regularly engaging with our key stakeholders. Revenue for 
our first quarter came in at $16.1 billion, flat year
-
on
-
year and slightly 
higher than our guide. Data
-
centric revenue was $7.5 billion, down 5%; and 
PC
-
centric revenue 
was $8.6 billion, up 4% year
-
on
-
year. Q1 operating 
margin was 28%, down 2 points due to cost of our 10
-
nanometer ramp and 
NAND reserves, partially offset by platform ASP strength as supply 
constraints at the low end in CCG led to an especially rich mix as 
well as 
lower spending overall.
 
Q1 EPS came in at $0.89, up 2% versus the prior year and $0.02 over what 
we guided for the quarter. Year
-
to
-
date, we have generated $1.6 billion of 
free cash flow; returned $3.9 billion to shareholders, including dividends o
f 
$1.4 billion; and repurchased approximately 49 million shares.
 
We are pleased with the team's focused execution for the quarter. We 
anticipated a challenging start to 2019, and that's what we have 
encountered. We also knew that the timing of our 10
-
nanom
eter ramp would 
pressure margins in the first quarter. And while we continue to make 
progress on the road map, that pressure remains a factor.
 
We see customers becoming more cautious in their buying patterns, with the 
most acute deceleration happening in C
hina. Demand pressure is particularly 
evident in our data center business, where we are seeing a continuing 
inventory correction in enterprise and comms and capacity digestion among 
cloud service providers who ramped consumption strongly in 2018.
 
Non
-
GAAP 
EPS was up 2% year
-
over
-
year driven by strength in our client 
and IoT ASPs, lower spending, lower shares outstanding and the McAfee 
dividend received in the quarter. Offsetting factors were continued NAND 
pricing pressure, 10
-
nanometer ramp cost and weak e
nterprise and 
government data center demand. Our tax rate came in at 12.5%, up almost 
1 point year
-
over
-
year due to nonrecurring benefits in Q1 of 2018.
 
We continue to improve our operating efficiency year
-
over
-
year from 32.4% 
to 30.3% spending as a percen
t of revenue. Total spending was down 7% 
year
-
over
-
year in the quarter as we drove efficiencies in our SG&A spending 
and kept R&D spending flat compared to the prior year. Within that overall 
flat R&D spend, we are making thoughtful trade
-
offs so that we c
an amplify 
the investments into key priorities to grow the business. This has resulted in 
more investment in 10
-
nanometer and 7
-
nanometer process technology and 
accelerating road maps in DCG and CCG and in key growth areas like 
autonomous driving, AI and 5
G network infrastructure.
 
Let me now break down our performance by segment. Our Data Center 
Group ended the quarter with revenue of $4.9 billion, down 6% from the 
prior year and 19% sequentially within our expected range of sequential 
decline, given the he
adwinds we noted last quarter. Against the challenging 
year
-
over
-
year compare, platform units were down 8%. We saw record Xeon 
ASPs as customers continue to select high
-
performance products. We also 
saw a strong ramp of network SoCs, resulting in moderatio
n of our blended 
platform ASP.
 
Non
-
CPU adjacencies were up 2% driven by strength in network ASICs and 
silicon photonics. Cloud revenue grew 5% year
-
over
-
year in the first quarter 
as cloud service providers absorbed capacity put in place in 2018. Enterprise
 
and government revenue declined by 21%, and comms service provider 
revenue declined 4% year
-
over
-
year in the first quarter as both enterprise 
and comms customers worked through inventory and China demand 
weakened.
 
Overall, our data
-
centric businesses were
 
flat year
-
over
-
year. Our IoT 
businesses saw 19% revenue growth adjusted for Wind River and operating 
income growth of 11% year
-
on
-
year due to a mix shift to higher core 
products in the quarter, with the growth of compute
-
intensive applications 
like AI and
 
computer vision.
 
Mobileye had record revenue, up 38% due to an extended 
--
 
expanded 
product portfolio and customer base. Our memory business was down 12% 
due to continued NAND pricing pressures, offset by NAND data center and 
client bit growth. Operating 
income for this group is down driven by NAND 
ASP deterioration and demand softness, resulting in inventory revaluations.
 
The PSG group declined 2% year
-
on
-
year due to weakness in cloud and 
enterprise, partially offset by strength in wireless and advanced n
ode 
products. The Client Computing Group showed continued growth, with 
revenue up 4% year
-
over
-
year. Platform revenue was up 3% driven by 
strength in large commercial and gaming. Modem drove the majority of 
strength in the adjacencies, resulting in a 26% i
ncrease over the prior year. 
We have added supply capacity and continue working closely with our 
customers to align our available supply to their demand. However, supply of 
our PC processors and chipsets remains tight, particularly for our small core 
produ
cts as we prioritize big core. We saw strong ASP growth in desktop and 
notebook in part due to the small core constraints, but also on strong 
performance in gaming. Constraints were also responsible for the year
-
over
-
year decline in volume.
 
This quarter, w
e generated $5 billion in operating cash flow, and we invested 
$3.3 billion to expand our 14
-
nanometer capacity and ramp 10
-
nanometer. 
We raised the dividend by 5% and repurchased 49 million shares.
 
Let me wrap up with our Q2 outlook. We expect Q2 revenue 
to be $15.6 
billion, down 8% year
-
over
-
year. Our data
-
centric businesses are expected 
to decline in the high single digits year
-
over
-
year as memory pricing declines 
weigh on our NAND business and DCG customers continue to consume 
inventory and absorb capac
ity. We expect DCG to be approximately flat 
sequentially. The PC
-
centric segment is expected to decline in the high 
single digits on declining PC ASPs on a relative mix of more small core units. 
Operating margin in Q2 is expected to be 29%, down 4 points y
ear
-
over
-
year on lower platform revenue, the 4G modem ramp and NAND pricing.
 
We forecast earnings per share of $0.89, flat sequentially and down $0.15 
year
-
over
-
year. We expect the non
-
GAAP tax rate in the quarter to be 
11.5%.
 
I will conclude here and turn
 
the call back to Mark.
 
Mark Henninger
 
Great. Thank you, George. After that eventful start to the call, we'll now 
move on to the Q&A. [Operator Instructions]. Operator, please go ahead and 
introduce our first caller.
 
Question
-
and
-
Answer Session
 
Operator
 
Ce
rtainly. Our first question comes from the line of Joe Moore from Morgan 
Stanley. Our next question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers.
 
Aaron Rakers
 
Yes, as we think about the gross margin trajectory through the course of the 
year, I'm wondering if you co
uld help us understand the delta between the 
impact of 10
-
nanometer ramping relative to kind of the impact that you're 
seeing. It seems like it's going to persist, related to NAND flash.
 
Robert Swan
 
Yes, it's lots of movement going on in the gross margin l
ine. I'd start by 
saying implied in our guide for the first half is roughly 60%, so it implies a 
little increase off of Q1. And our implied guide then for full year is almost 
60%. So through all the ups and downs, there's going to be quite a bit of 
consist
ency. That being said, the Q1 will likely be the lowest, because as I 
indicated in my prepared remarks, that we're going to 
--
 
we intend to qualify 
the 10
-
nanometer part in the second quarter. So what that means is in the 
first quarter, all of our 10
-
nanom
eter cost is flowing through cost of sales. 
When we qualify, it goes on the balance sheet. And then when we sell those 
previously reserved units in the third quarter, those units go out with no 
cost. So the dynamics imply low Q1 and a much stronger Q3, but
 
through it 
all, fairly stable at roughly 60% level.
 
On the year
-
on
-
year decline, obviously, the NSD 
--
 
sorry, NSG pricing is 
having a real impact on us. We expect NSG for the year to be down roughly 
10% almost, and that is primarily driven by significant 
change in pricing 
dynamics during the course of the year. So that'll be a headwind for us 
throughout the year.
 
Aaron, sorry, I should probably add something, Mark. The one last thing is, 
as we indicated, we expect to have systems on shelf in the fourth qua
rter or 
for holiday season, so 
--
 
and that given the progress we've made on 10, 
we're going to be shifting more units in the fourth quarter than we 
previously anticipated. So all else equal, that implies Q4 would a little bit 
lower than the full year guide
.
 
Operator
 
Once again, Joe Moore, your line is open.
 
Joseph Moore
 
With regards to DCG being down mid

single digits for the year, I understand 
the issues in the first half. But it seems like the cloud guys were 
--
 
the 
CapEx has been okay, and I 
thought we had a little bit more snap back in 
the back half. Can you just talk a little bit more about the dynamics, 
specifically on the cloud side, and related to your 
--
 
the inventory that they 
may have of your parts there?
 
Robert Swan
 
Yes. Joe, as you k
now, the 
--
 
we came off a very strong 2018, up 21%. As 
we came into the year, implied in our guide, particularly in Q1, was our 
expectations that we'd be in quite a digestion period, both for enterprise and 
government but cloud as well and that, that would
 
really impact our Q1. 
Look, what we're highlighting today as it relates to cloud is two things: that 
we expect the digestion to continue into Q2; that demand is going to be soft 
in Q2. And it's even exacerbated in China where, if you'll remember, through 
the third quarter last year, our demand for cloud players in China was close 
to triple digits. That was negative in the first quarter. So overall, they're still 
in a digestion period, the cloud guys. And in China is even 
--
 
it's been even 
more dramatic in 
the first quarter and the first couple weeks here in the 
second quarter.
 
That being said, when we asked that, when we look at end demand in this 
data
-
centric environment, when we're looking at end demand, it still seems 
relatively strong. And the 
--
 
in our
 
dialogues with our customers, they are 
implying an uptick as we move from first half into second half.

Our next question comes from the line of Toshiya Hari from Goldman Sachs.
 
Toshiya Hari
 
I had a question on your enterprise business within DCG.
 
I was a little bit 
surprised by the magnitude of the decline in Q1. Bob, in your view and 
based on what you know, what you hear from customers, how much of that 
decline is tied to true end demand versus inventory dynamics at your 
customers? And I ask that
 
question because some of your customers may 
have pre
-
bought in fear of supply constraints.
 
Robert Swan
 
Yes, it's a great question. Truly, we believe that there's the end demand, 
and forget about which segment, but end demand remains relatively strong. 
But
 
by segment, enterprise and government year
-
on
-
year decline was not 
way off what we expected, because we didn't have a real robust guide for 
Q1, but we have seen it continue into the second quarter. And I just think 
that the ordering ahead or the digestion
 
of last year's strong growth, we 
expect now just to continue in enterprise and government through the first 
half and even a little more into the second half as it relates to E&G.

Our next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon from Bernstei
n 
Research.
 
Stacy Rasgon
 
I wanted to know, of the mid
-
single
-
digit decline for data center, how much 
of that do you think is units versus pricing? I would have expected, with the 
new platform launch, we might have seen better. And obviously, you have 
the i
nventory in digestion, but there's also competition that's coming in the 
second half. So how do you see units versus pricing declining within the 
envelope of your down mid
-
single digits for the business overall?
 
Robert Swan
 
Yes, we kind of 
--
 
as we came in
 
--
 
the updated guide, the guide now is 
more a unit story. When we came into the year, back in January, our 
expectation on ASPs is they would be pressured in DCG by 2 things in 
particular: one, just we indicated at the time that we expected an increased 
co
mpetitive environment as we go into the second half; and then two, as we 
look at 5G SoCs beginning to ramp as we go into the fourth quarter, they 
tend to be at lower ASPs. So we expect product enhancements, but offset by 
tougher competitive environment and
 
mix of SoCs for the comms service 
providers. So the big change from January is really more a unit story. And 
we think we bounded the ASPs best we could back in January time frame. 
That hasn't changed.

Our next question comes from the line of C.J.
 
Muse from Evercore.
 
Christopher Muse
 
I guess a question on the modem side of things. As you think about the cost 
savings as you deemphasize that business, will that be repurposed? Or 
should that accrue to the bottom line? And can you give some thoughts as
 
to 
what the cost savings will have 
--
 
look like and what time frame we should 
see it?
 
Robert Swan
 
Yes, let me 
--
 
C.J., let me take a run and ask George to chime in as well. We 
announced that we were going to exit the 5G smartphone business and that 
we are
 
going to evaluate the 5G Modem in other applications, like PC and 
IoT, while assessing our alternatives as it relates to the 5G Modem overall. 
So what's reflected in kind of the updated guide we gave is we do expect 
lower spending for 5G smartphone as we 
go through the course of the year. 
That is part of the lower spending going into the second half that we 
reflected. But we also 
--
 
we haven't really completed our assessment about 
what to do with the wonderful IP that we've developed, the real strong team 
that we have and the other opportunities we have, whether it's in network 
infrastructure, where we're really excited about the role we'll play in 5G, or 
whether it's the role that 5G Modem plays in these non
-
smartphone 
applications. So that's something tha
t we're working very hard on to try to 
get to the right answer about how we'll deal with the technologies we built, 
the capabilities we have and what the implications will be on cost structure 
as we go into the second half of the year and into next year. S
o that's still a 
work in progress.
 
George Davis
 
And C.J., I just might add, we talk about spending being down $1 billion 
year
-
over
-
year, I would say the expectations for slowing 5G spend or 
reducing 5G smartphone spend prior to getting through the decision
 
process 
of 
--
 
that we're going through right now, is maybe 20% to 30% of that. So 
there is not a lot yet evident in the spend rate that we're talking about that 
results from the 5G Modem business.

Our next question comes from the line of John 
Pitzer from Crédit Suisse.
 
John Pitzer
 
I know you would like us to focus a little bit more on op margin than gross 
margin, but I just want to go back to the gross margin line. As far as I can 
remember, with an in line revenue quarter for March, this is the
 
most 
significant gross margin miss to Street estimates that I can remember for 
the company. And I know you've talked about 10
-
nanometer volumes being 
higher than you expected this year. Can you talk a little bit about the yield 
curve and kind of the cost 
of 10
-
nanometer? And I guess really importantly, 
if the long
-
term sort of upper range of your gross margin had been 60% to 
65%, do you still think that that's the right sort of higher
-
end range as we 
go to the 10
-
nanometer node for CPUs, notwithstanding th
at some of the 
adjacencies are lower gross margin?
 
Robert Swan
 
Yes. Thanks, John. First, in the first quarter, kind of 2 things that really 
impacted gross margin: one, frankly, we planned for and played out as we 
expected; and two, we did not plan for. But
 
the one we planned for is just as 
we ramp 10, and as you're aware and I mentioned earlier, until we qualify 
the product, which we expect to do in the second quarter, all that cost flows 
through cost of sales. So when we're in early stages of ramp prior to
 
qualification, that does compress gross margin. And that played out as we 
expected, because I mentioned in my prepared remarks that our progress 
and our improvement on 10
-
nanometer yields was in line with what we've 
expected coming into the year, a little
 
bit better, that gave us the comfort 
that we're going to increase volume at the end of the year. But Q1 is just 
the dynamics of all of that ramp cost going through cost of sales. That was 
planned and that was anticipated. The not planned in the quarter wa
s just 
the ASP declined much greater than we had anticipated for NSG. We were in 
the 
--
 
we were expecting kind of mid
-
20s to 30% ASP declines. The reality is 
it was closer to the mid
-
40s. And as a result, and George flagged this, but as 
a result, we had to
 
take a lower cost or market reserve against our inventory 
balance in the quarter. That cost us over 1 point of gross margins in the 
quarter. That we did not quite anticipate.
 
So gross margin Q1, in line with kind of what we thought, with the exception 
of 
inventory reserves that we took in the quarter. And as I said, Q2, we 
expect it to be better than Q1 because we'll begin to capitalize those costs 
because of the progress we're making on 10
-
nanometer. And then just to 
kind of go from your Q1 to your 5 year
s out point of view, I guess maybe on 
the gross margin, operating margin dynamics, maybe we'll defer that, kick 
the can couple of weeks, until we see you on May 8 when we kind of walk 
through our longer
-
range planning process.

Our next question co
mes from the line of Timothy Arcuri from UBS.
 
Timothy Arcuri
 
Bob, I wanted to ask you just a question strategically about memory. And I 
wanted to understand, obviously, you need to make cost point, but relative 
to NAND, why the need to make NAND on your ow
n? It seems like you could 
sell the factory and maybe strike some sort of a supply agreement and save 
a lot of free cash flow, particularly after a quarter rotation can cost you 100 
basis points.
 
Robert Swan
 
Yes. First, maybe just some context on when we t
alk about expanded TAM, 
the 
--
 
maybe the criteria we think about and then I'll try to apply them to 
where we are in memory. First, we look for technology inflections where we 
think we have a real advantage, whether it's process manufacturing or 
performance
-
oriented design that is worth pursuing, number one; number 
two, such that we can play a more important role in the success of our 
customers; and third, in an area where we think we can get attractive 
returns for our investors. So those are our 
--
 
the 3 cr
iteria that we're 
applying, and we're going to be increasingly disciplined on the third aspect 
of those criteria.
 
As it relates to memory, we have a high
-
performance Optane product that 
we think is really differentiated, coupled with our CPU that can do th
ings 
best in industry that's really needed to keep pace with the increased 
performance of CPU processing. So strategically, we think it's really 
important. Technically, we think we have a real advantage. And third, we 
think we can get good returns.
 
As it r
elates to NAND, we think we have process technology advantage. 
We're in the stage where we've gone from 32
-
layer to 64
-
layer now. The 
profitability of the NAND business pre this massive decline in ASPs was okay 
last year as we were ramping the business. An
d our challenge going forward 
is we're just going to have to execute better on the NAND business, so we 
can check that third box of attractive returns for our investors. And I don't 
want to 
--
 
when the market's plummeting I don't want to conclude what the 
right decision is. I want to maybe look through the horizon a little bit to get 
to the right decision. But clearly, we got to generate more attractive returns 
on the NAND side of the business, and the team is very focused on making 
that a reality. And to t
he extent there is a partnership out there that's going 
to increase the likelihood and/or accelerate the pace, we're going to evaluate 
those partnerships along the way so it can be enhancing to the returns of 
what we do in the memory space.

Our ne
xt question comes from the line of David Wong from Nomura.
 
David Wong
 
Bob, given your stance on concentration of resources, what are you thinking 
with regard to Intel developing a term GPU product? And if you are pressing 
ahead with this, can give us an up
date on where you are and when we might 
see the first Intel GPUs?
 
Robert Swan
 
Yes. I mean first, as we think about the key technologies that we believe are 
going to be increasingly important going forward, I flagged them earlier, but 
we characterize them a
s our 
--
 
kind of our 6 pillars of technology 
differentiation. Obviously, process technology is an important component; 
Second, architectures, I'll come back to that; third, memory; fourth, 
interconnect; fifth, security; and sixth, software. And how we brin
g the 
collection of those 6 things together that nobody else in the industry can do, 
we think is really what's going to allow us to capitalize on an increasingly 
data
-
centric world.
 
When we think about architecture, we just 
--
 
as we learn more and more 
abo
ut how workloads are evolving and the increasingly importance of 
artificial intelligence and parallel processing, we believe that architectures 
beyond the CPU, like GPU, like FPGA, like AI, like other accelerators, become 
increasingly important. So we have
 
decided that we are going to invest in 
discrete GPUs. We're going to launch a new integrated GPU in the near term, 
which we're pretty excited about. But discrete GPUs, I think we said that we 
are going to launch it in 2020 time frame, both for clients and
 
for data 
center. Increased workloads, we're going to leverage the integrated 
technology that we've enhanced and invested in discrete GPUs because we 
think it's an architecture that's increasingly important. And we think we can 
develop some real attractive
 
products based on our existing core 
architecture.

Our next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya from Bank of America.
 
Vivek Arya
 
Bob, I had a question on 10
-
nanometer progress and the competition on the 
server side. I know your 
--
 
the team 
is sounding more confident about 10
-
nanometer on the client side. I'm curious what the progress is on 10
-
nanometer and the server side, and as part of that, how do you think your 
customers are reacting to a competitor bringing out their products in the 
bac
k half? Your products are coming out next year. What are you hearing 
from customers as to how they are thinking about the next generation of 
server CPUs and the desire for perhaps diversifying suppliers?
 
Robert Swan
 
First, on 10
-
nanometer for server, what 
we've indicated is that we would 
have client systems on shelf for the holiday season, and our expectation is 
that server CPUs would be a fast follow. Historically, I think it's been more of 
a 12
-
 
to 18
-
month gap between client and then server. On 10
-
nanome
ter, 
that gap would be much shorter. And again, what we said is fast follow after 
client systems on shelf, so sometime in 2020, earlier versus later. In terms 
of just competitive positioning, with the 
--
 
we've been 
--
 
our Xeon Scalable 
product that we laun
ched last year and then enhanced with our Cascade 
Lake launch just a few weeks ago I think, that has increased performance. 
It's got AI acceleration built into it. It's coupled with Optane memory. It's 
got a 56 core count. And the performance of that produ
ct, coupled with our 
knowledge of the environment in which 
--
 
our customers' environments, we 
think we really have demonstrated differentiated performance, a product 
leadership performance, even though it is still on 14
-
nanometer.
 
So we have a good product
 
that really pulls together those 6 pillars that I 
talked about earlier. We launched it a few weeks ago. We said we expect it 
to ramp as fast as any launch that we've done in the past. And we think it 
positions us competitively in the second half of the ye
ar, despite increased 
competition prior to launching 10
-
nanometer in 2020.
 
So we feel good about 10
-
nanometer in general. We're going to be a fast 
follow with server in 2020. In the meantime, the Cascade Lake product has 
some real performance 
enhancements based on our deep domain knowledge 
of our customers. And it'll be an increased competitive environment, but we 
feel pretty good and we tried the best we could to capture that in our 
outlook for 2019.

Our next question comes from the l
ine of Harlan Sur from JPMorgan.
 
Harlan Sur
 
5G network connectivity is very strong and projected to continue to 
accelerate on a go
-
forward basis. Korea, China, U.S., all starting to fire. You 
guys have a great lineup of products, Xeon D, full
-
blown Xeon, b
ase station 
ASICs, FPGAs and so on. So help us understand, given all these dynamics, 
why did the comms service provider segment decline year
-
over
-
year in Q1? 
And maybe more importantly, just given the strong 5G lineup that you have, 
do you see comms servic
e provider contributing to the strong second half 
implied growth in your data
-
centric segment guidance for the full year?
 
Robert Swan
 
Yes. I think, first, yes, we feel like we got a great product lineup for the 
launch of 5G. We have a strong position today
, and we think 5G is only 
going to accelerate that across a broad swath of our products and 
technologies. The 
--
 
a couple of things going on, we believe, in Q1. One, just 
in terms of the increased demand, we do expect it to be coming maybe a 
little bit lat
er in the year. I think FPGA is a little bit earlier, but the Xeon, we 
expect to follow later in the year and even more in 2020, to be honest with 
you. So timing, we expect it to be out a little bit, modest improvement in the 
second half but not dramatic.
 
And the other thing I would say is that we have a strong customer base in 
China in comms. And we 
--
 
like we saw in cloud and enterprise and 
government, comms growth we think was also impacted by strong comms 
growth last year that's probably being digested 
a little bit in the first couple 
of quarters of this year. Again, one of our large customers in China is a 
contributor to the question earlier about buying ahead and then digestion, is 
a weight on comms growth in the first quarter. So we're pretty excited 
about 
the demand signals we're seeing, the relationships we've built for 5G and 
think it's going to be a really important part of our story going forward.

Our next question comes from the line of Ambrish Srivastava from BMO.
 
Ambrish Srivastava
 
Bob, I just wanted to 
--
 
I was wondering if you could shed more light on the 
DCG op margin. We've not seen this low a number in quite a few quarters, I 
think 6 to 8 quarters, 38%. And you list 3 reasons, but it disproportionately 
seems to be lower versus t
he revenue decline. Could you shed a little bit 
more light? And more importantly, how should we expect this to trend as the 
year progresses?
 
Robert Swan
 
Yes, I mean I think the things we flagged, obviously, unit volume declines on 
a high
-
margin business wo
rked against us. Secondly, it's really DCG now. I 
talked to you about the fast follow of DCG on 10
-
nanometer after client 
launch. So as a result, they're just now beginning to bear some of the brunt 
of the cost of sales that all went through the P&L in the
 
first quarter until 
those products qualify. And then third, this is a 
--
 
this is a big growth area 
for us and we're going to continue to make investments. So those 3 things 
are really what drove the op margin decline in the quarter.
 
As you know, just from
 
historical trends, data center margins tend to be a 
little bit lower in the first quarter. And obviously, implied in our guide first 
half to second half, second half is a little stronger. And with that strength on 
unit volumes despite maybe more intense A
SP environment, we expect 
operating margins to kind of improve in line with revenue growth in the 
second half. Those trends are fairly consistent with how the quarterly 
dynamics of DCG operating margins go. They're just more exacerbated in Q1 
with the 10
-
n
anometer cost of sales starting to impact the business.

Our final question for tonight comes from the line of Blayne Curtis from 
Barclays.
 
Blayne Curtis
 
Just one more on gross margin, if possible, and I know you don't want to 
comment on '20. But I
'm just trying to understand the trajectory here, 
because it seems like your 10
-
nanometer has been delayed. You're ramping 
it now. It does seem like it's on a portion of the product line, not like the old 
days, where it would flip over all of client. So I'
m just trying to understand, 
if you look at the impact you saw this year, why is it incorrect to think about 
that you should see a similar impact next year?
 
Robert Swan
 
Well, yes, I think you know that our expectations are as we begin to ramp 
high
-
volume m
anufacturing, that in conjunction with that, we expect to see 
improved yields and better units
-
to
-
die performance as we go throughout 
the course of the year and as we step on the pedal and ramping volumes. So 
the 
--
 
part of the answer is we expect to impro
ve yields as we go forward. 
But that being said, any time we transition to a new node, the earlier stages 
tend to be 
--
 
have a little bit of a compression effect on gross margins until 
we get a little more maturity. And I don't want to get out ahead on 202
0. 
We're more focused on '19 right now, but it's natural for the transition to a 
new node in early stages to have a bit of a downward pressure on gross 
margin.

Good day ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the First Quarter 2015 Intel 
Corporation Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a 
listen
-
only mode. Later, we will conduct a question
-
and
-
answer session and 
instructions will be given at that time [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, 

 
I would now like to turn the call over to Mark Henninger, Head of Intel 
Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
 
Mark Henninger
 
Thank you

earnings conference call. By now, you should have received a copy of our 

not received both documents, they are available 
on our Investor Web site, 
intc.com. I am joined today by Brian Krzanich, our CEO; and Stacy Smith, 

of them, followed by the Q&A.
 
Before we begin, let me remind everyone that today

forward
-
looking statements based on the environment as we currently see it 
and as such, does include risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our press 
release for more information on the specific risk factors that could cause 
actual
 
results to differ materially. Also if during this call, we use any non
-
GAAP financial measures or references, we will post the appropriate GAAP 
financial reconciliation to our Web site, intc.com.
 
With that, let me hand it over to Brian.
 
Brian Krzanich
 
Tha
nks Mark. Following a reset to our outlook in March, the first quarter 
finished roughly as expected. Our PC business was impacted by slowing 
desktop sales, particularly in small and medium business. At the same time, 
challenging macroeconomic conditions an
d an appreciating U.S. dollar 
weighed on our business in important geographic markets. Despite this, 
revenue was flat year
-
over
-
year as our Data Center, Internet of Things, and 
NAND business all delivered double
-
digit growth.
 
The diversity and scale of Int
el products today puts us in a position to 
compete across the breadth of devices that compute and connect.
 

expectations for the rest of the year. Our newly formed Client Computing
 
Group results reflected weakness in desktop demand and the depletion of PC 
supply
-
chain inventories. And while desktop volume declined, notebook 
volume grew year
-
over
-
year for the fifth consecutive quarter. Our silicon 
technology leadership remains a valu
able competitive advantage, and the 
percentage mix of our latest 14 nanometer processors, the 5th Gen Core 
and Core M processor, is just ahead of our expectations.
 
In addition to launching the high volume, 5th Gen Core products at CES, the 
CCG Group also r
eached some important product milestones. We launched 
our newest Broadwell based vPro notebook SKUs that feature aspects of the 

mobile product portfolio to adjust a range of price p
oints and form factors. 
This includes the Intel Atom X5 and X7 for mainstream and premium tablet, 
formerly called, Cherry Trail, which is powering the new Microsoft Surface 3. 

first sin
gle
-
chip integrated baseband and apps processor, designed for entry 
in value
-
smartphones and tablets. This product was not even on our 
roadmap a year and a half ago, but is now launched in the market. This is a 
great example of the velocity of the new Inte
l.
 
In the Data Center, our manufacturing and architectural leadership 
combined with opportunities driven by the values of cloud
-
computing in each 
PC usages, continue to yield impressive results. DCG revenue grew 19% 
year
-
over
-
year and our Xeon E5 Version 3
 
product line, formerly known as 
Grantley platform, now represents more than 50% of our two
-
socket 
volume. New products like Grantley and our increased support of custom 
versions of the product helped us achieve record cloud revenue. And in the 
Telco segme
nt, we continue to significantly outpace the market with the 
adoption of Intel architecture.
 
We also introduced our first Xeon based SoC processor, optimized for micro 
servers, storage, network and IoT devices. This product is an example of our 
strategy to
 
reuse IT from our core business in complementary and profitable 
segments. Many of the secular turns underpinning our growth in the Data 
Center also benefited our NAND business, which grew 14% year
-
over
-
year.
 
Just three weeks ago, Intel and Micron, formall
y announced our jointly 
developed 3D NAND technology. Intel 3D NAND will be available in the 
second
-
half of this year, and offers roughly three
-
times the stated capacity 

example, can
 
provide greater than 10 terabytes of storage in a 2.5
-
inch solid 
state drive and is the first 3D NAND solution to be architected to be lower 
cost than 2D NAND. And finally, the Internet of Things Group grew 11% over 
the first quarter of last year, based o
n strength in the retail and digital 
security market segments.
 
Our first quarter results, combined with a variety of third
-
party insights from 
across the industry, and form our thinking for the balance of 2015. We 
expect the PC market to remain challenging
, leading to a mid single
-
digit 
decline in the overall full year PC TAM. That said, we are excited about the 
launch of our 14
-
nanometer Skylake microprocessor and the capability that 
this product family will enable on a variety of operating systems. In 
par
ticular, we are enthusiastic about the release of Windows 10 this 
summer, especially when combined with Skylake.
 
We continue to be confident in our strategy to drive growth. We're focused 
on innovating in our client business, improving mobile profitability
 
and 
investing in and growing profitable adjacent markets. We are applying our 
process technology leadership, silicon integration expertise and the efficient 
use of shared intellectual property. This strategy is delivering results as 
evidenced by the growt
h we saw this quarter in the Data Center, IoT and 
NAND segments.
 
The performance of those businesses remains strong, and is expected to 
roughly offset weakness in [PC] [ph]. As we move forward, we will continue 
to work to ensure that it is smart and connec
ted its best with Intel.
 
And with that, let me turn the call over to Stacy.
 
Stacy Smith
 
Thanks Brian. Revenue for the first quarter was $12.8 billion, flat year
-
over
-
year and in line with the downward revision to outlook provided on March 
12. As a reminder
, the change in revenue outlook was a result of weaker 
than expected demand from business desktop PCs and lower than expected 
inventory levels across the PC supply
-
chain. While the PC market was 
challenging in the first quarter, we continue to see strength
 
in the Data 
Center, Internet of things, and NAND business.
 
First quarter gross margin of 60.5% was slightly above the original outlook 
provided on the January earnings call. Spending on R&D and MG&A was $4.9 
billion, down $100 million from the fourth quar
ter and in
-
line with our 
guidance. Operating income of $2.6 billion was up 4% from a year ago. 
Earnings per share of $0.41 was up over 8% from a year ago.
 
The newly created Client Computing Group had revenue of $7.4 billion an 
8% decline year
-
over
-
year, dr
iven by a 16% decline in desktop unit 
volumes, partially offset by a 3% increase in notebook volumes. Tablet unit 
volumes were over 7 million units, up 45% year
-
over
-
year. We are on track 
to our annual goal of improving mobile profitability by $800 million
 
with the 
majority of improvements to be realized in the back half of the year.
 
Operating profit for the overall Client Computing Group was $1.4 billion, 
down 24% from a year
-
ago. The decrease was driven primarily by lower 
desktop revenue and higher unit c
osts. The Data Center Group had revenue 
of approximately $3.7 billion, 19% growth on a year
-
over
-
year basis, driven 
by 15% unit growth. The Data Center Group had operating profit of $1.7 
billion. This was up 27% year
-
over
-
year driven by unit growth, a rich
er mix 
and lower unit costs.
 
Additionally, year
-
over
-
year, Internet of Things segment achieved revenue 
growth of 11%, and the NAND business grew at a fast pace. The business 
continues to generate significant cash with $4.4 billion of cash from 
operations i
n the first quarter. We purchased $2 billion in capital assets, paid 
$1.1 billion in dividend and repurchased $750 million of stock in the first 
quarter.
 
Total cash balances, at the end of the quarter, is roughly $14 billion down 
approximately $5 billion f
rom a year ago. Our net cash balances, total cash 
less debt is below $1 billion, and inclusive of our other longer
-
term 
investments, is more than $4 billion.
 
As we look forward to the second quarter of 2015, we are forecasting the 
midpoint of the revenue r
ange at $13.2 billion, up 3% from the first quarter. 
This forecast is in line with the average seasonal increase for the second 
quarter. We believe there was an inventory burn across the worldwide PC 
supply
-
chain in the first quarter and we expect a furthe
r reduction in 
inventory supply
-
chain levels in the second quarter in anticipation of 
Windows 10 launch in summer. We are forecasting the midpoint of the gross 
margin range to be 62%, plus or minus a couple of points, 1.5 point increase 
from the first quar
ter.
 
Turning to the full year 2015. We expect revenue to be approximately flat to 
2014, down from the prior guidance mid
-
single
-
digit percentage growth. 

-
single
-
digit decline in the overall PC market. We 
continue to forecast robus
t growth rates in the Data Center Group, Internet 
of Things Group and NAND businesses which we expect to offset the decline 
in the Client Computing Group. As a result of lower than expected demand 
and reduced growth rates this year, we are lowering capital
 
spending, 
spending on R&D and MG&A. We are moving to reuse capital by rolling a 
forward to 14
-
nanometer and to align overall capacity with demand. We are 
now forecasting the midpoint of capital spending at $8.7 billion, down $1.3 
billion from the prior ou
tlook.
 
We are also forecasting the midpoint of our gross margin range of 61%, 
down 1 point from our prior guidance as a result of temporarily lower 
utilization rates and lower platform volumes. And we are forecasting the 
midpoint of R&D and MG&A spending for the 
year at $19.7 billion, down 
$300 million from the prior outlook.
 
We are prudently managing our cost capacity in inventory to address the 

to transform the Company by developing leadersh
ip products across a broad 
range of end
-
markets. That product leadership is driving growth in revenue, 

illustrated this transformation. In the first quarter, almost 40% of our 
revenue came
 
from the combination of these businesses and these 
businesses accounted for more than two
-

operating profit in the first quarter. Our work is far from done, but the 
transformation of the Company is well underway.
 
With that, 
let me turn it back over to Mark.
 
Mark Henninger
 
Thank you, Brian and Stacy. Moving on now to the Q&A as is our normal 
practice. We would ask each participant to ask one question and if you have 
it, just one follow
-
up. Jenny, please go ahead and introduce 
our first 
questioner.
 
Question
-
and
-
Answer Session
 
Operator
 
[Operator Instructions] The first question comes from John Pitzer from 
Credit Suisse.
 
John Pitzer
 
Stacy, my first question is, relative to your full year gross margin guidance 
of 61%, it sort of as
sumes that the back
-
half of the year is coming in around 
61%. I am kind of curious given the revenue guidance implies a pretty steep 
ramp in back half of the year, i.e. utilization going up. Can you just help me 

aging gross margins in the 
second half?
 
Stacy Smith
 

first
-

over the back
-
half is in that range of about [inaud
ible]. You see some 

associated with just seasonally stronger volume in the back
-
half of the year.

-
nanomet
er start
-


 

-
nanometer factory network and have now and through the Q2, maybe a l
ittle 
bit into Q3 those products will go into inventory and they will ship in the 
back
-

what we thought in the back
-
half, associated with bringing down the 
utilization rates in the
 

that we can free
-
up some capacity and roll it forward to 14
-
nanometer and 

But the impact of that is higher costs.
 
John Pitzer
 
And then just my follow
-

the press about potential M&A activity. And I doubt you can address specific 
speculation. But I am kind of curious, can you just step back and give us a 
sense of broadly what y
our acquisition strategy will look like, what areas do 
you feel like you need to augment? And importantly, as you think about use 
of cash, does any potential acquisition have to be more accretive than 
actually buying back your own stock?
 
Brian Krzanich
 
You
're right, John, I am not going to comment on any of the rumors and all 
in the press. Our strategy on investing in this business or what we do with 

me and that is always first in
vestment of business, firmly believe in that, 

that and M&A at times and then share buybacks and dividends.
 

cash 

invest in the business and get a better return in that, then we do that, no 
matter how we can invest in that. But yes, I am not going to speculate on 
any of the rumors.
 
Stacy S
mith
 
And just coming on the last part of your question, John, we 
--
 
as Brian said, 
our priority is to invest in the business first, dividend second, and then we 

buyback to specific 
stock prices. We use it as the second mechanism to 

 
Operator
 
The next question comes from Romit Shah from Nomura.
 
Romit Shah
 
Stacy, the revenue outlook for 2015, now it sort of assumes a similar 
recovery as y
our original guidance just off a lower base and back in early 
March, you talked about things like weaker business PC demand, the macro
-
environment and currency impact in the quarter. So, is it implicit in the new 
outlook that you think these issues will go
 
away?
 
Stacy Smith
 
No, and maybe I am not completely grokking your question. We were 
projecting mid
-
single digit revenue growth for the Company on the back of a 

-
single digit PC 

ding to relatively flat revenue growth year
-
on
-
year. But 
it has changed my view of your 
--
 
so maybe you can define your question a 

 
Romit Shah
 
Just to get to flat for 2015 it assumes pretty healthy sequential
 
growth for 
the next couple of quarters. And I was wondering if the issues that hurt you 
in the first quarter do you see those issues becoming less of a headwind as 
we move through the year?
 
Stacy Smith
 

linearity. So yes, let me put the PC 


in linearity over the course of the 
--
 
we saw a fairly signifi
cant inventory 
burn in Q1. Normally in Q2, we would expect to see customer strive to put 
inventory in place for the back
-
half.
 


 

summer. And so what we think is going to happen is that our customers will 
lean
-


or
 
two of growth from the first half to the second half as a result to that in 
the quarter.
 
Romit Shah
 
As my follow
-
up, Brian, I was hoping you could elaborate on the $8.7 billion 
in CapEx and this idea of increased reuse of equipment. Is that just a

Brian Krzanich
 

these technology ramps have a personality and a image on their own. And 

re seeing, as we move through 2015, is just that. You did see that 
we shifted our overall view of the market from single digit growth to single 
digit decline, so that has one impact. You are seeing us be able to move 
more capital now as a result of that, p

Move more capital from 22
-
nanometers to 14
-
nanometers.
 
We also said that 14
-
nanometer, the ramps of our Broadwell products, are 

product demand
 
over to the 14
-

like better yields, better utilization out of our 14
-
nanometer as it continues 
to get healthier. And so all of those combined have led us adjust our capital. 

er efficiency, but also the ability to 
move more 22

nanoemter capacity over the 14

nanometer.

The next question comes from Joe Moore from Morgan Stanley.
 
Joe Moore
 
Just wondering if you could talk about your inventory level kind of barely 
went up 
I guess $140 million sequentially despite being $900 million below 



le bit of an inventory overhang 
after the magnitude of the shortfall in Q1?
 
Stacy Smith
 
We were expecting inventory levels actually to come down in Q2, Joe, as 

dollar comment, but we e
xpect the dollar values to come down because 14
-
nanometer costs are coming down the costs curve pretty steeply and we 
ended up top, so there is a 
--
 
from our perspective, a pretty significant shift. 
And then as we think about the rest of the year, we will 
--
 

bring utilization rates down on 22
-

capacity to 14
-
nanometer and we should bring inventory rates 
--
 
levels 
down by the time we get to the end of fall.
 
Joe Moore
 
Okay, great. And then my follow 
up, with regards to the buyback, how do 
you think about what the net cash level should be? Is there still a target of 
sort of I think you said historically you could feel comfortable at around zero 
net cash. And then how do you factor in any potential M&A 
into that 
equation? Does that mean that M&A would require to slow the buyback or 
just how should we think about those trade
-
offs, again not asking but any 
specific stories. But just how should we think about the balance sheet in that 
context?
 
Brian Krzanic
h
 
Its Brian, we're not going to answer any questions on M&A and those 
--
 
one 
of the speculations out there. In terms of net cash balances just we have 
said that we're targeting approximately zero net cash I also said it's 
impossible for me to manage it so 
tightly that we mathematically ever get to 
exactly zero. You can see we brought down cash balances a lot over the year 
and in Q1 we will serve $1 billion in net cash and when you include in some 
of the longer term portion of the portfolio we were pretty fl
at with $4 billion

we're kind of comfortably where we want to be and comfortably 
where we communicated.

The next question comes from David Wong from Wells Fargo.
 
David Wong
 
Stacy given your comment about start
-
up charges for 10
-
nanomete
rs 
towards the end of this year are you facing ahead of your original plan on 
10
-
nanometers or are things tracking roughly according to what you 
expected?
 
Brian Krzanich
 

nothing abou
t our timing of 10
-

for 10
-
nanometers at a later date. And the adjustments that talked about, 
does not have anything to be really with the 10
-
nanometer capital or 
spending or timing. So, they are completely disco
nnected.
 
David Wong
 
And given what 
--
 
you were saying on SoFIA. Do you expect to be incurring 
any contra revenues on tablet processor sales by the fourth quarter of this 
year? And can you give us some of idea as to how contra revenue payments 
might trend t
hrough this year?
 
Stacy Smith
 
Sure. And let me if I may, and let me just take it all the way up to the 
commitment Brian and I made around moving 
--
 
making $800 million 
improvement to the mobility portion. We are on track to that. There is two 
big buckets, 
if you will, one is the improvements in product margin and it's a 
combination of the cost structure we get with SoFIA and having a great 

tablet market. And a chunk of it is the reductio
n in contra revenue dollars 
again the build materials around SoFIA we make it a competitive build 
materials cost. And so we are planning to pay contra revenue dollars 
associated with the SoFIA shipment.
 
SoFIA is not shipping in the market so on track 
from a timing standpoint 

again it really is an example of the changes going on inside the Company. As 
I think about those playing out over the course of the year. Then the other 
big
 
bucket is just reductions in investment level that we talked about at the 
Investor Meeting. That second bucket plays out kind of linearly across the 

SoFIA reduction in contra
 
revenue dollars, really kicks
-
in in the back half of 
the year. So, it's more a back
-
end loaded of course based on the SoFIA 
ramp.

The next question comes from Harlan Sur from JP Morgan.
 
Harlan Sur
 
DCG was up 18% in 2014, it grew 19% here in Q1. I
 
assume much of this 
growth was you cloud and Web 2.0 customers. As you think about the 
pipeline of cloud in HPC programs, are you anticipating continued strong 
spend here in Q2, or should we expect some lumpiness? How confident is 
the team about driving d
ouble
-
digits growth in DCG this year?
 
Brian Krzanich
 


less. But this tends to be lumpy. There are large
 
cloud providers. They tend 

there is a very high quarter and not as high. What we said though is that, 
overtime, we believe we can continue to grow this business at a mid double
-
digit
 
--
 
mid
-
teens kind of growth rate, so 14%, 15%, 16%, somewhere in 
there, growth rate, over the rest 
--
 
several year of period moving forward.
 

growth that we're seeing in cloud, clou
d 2.0, as you say. Big Data is driving 
some of this growth as the cloud generates this data and the cloud providers 
realize it. They can utilize it to improve their cloud performance and their 
cloud offering. So, all of these things are working together an
d then that 
gives us confidence things that we can continue to grow this business 
segment.
 
Harlan Sur
 
And then the team started ramping its Core M product, just before the 
holiday season in discussions with your customers and partners. What's 
been the sell
-
through trend and uptake of 2
-
in
-
1 platforms to the holiday 
season and into the first half of the year? Just wondering what's the view on 
adoption and adoption rates with this form factor on a go forward basis? 
Thank you.
 
Brian Krzanich
 
As you said, Core 

had a limited number of SKUs available at holiday. And the amount of time 
we could get in front of it with marketing and all was limited as well. That 
said, we were very happy with the sales we sa
w in the holidays. Core M is 
really designed to provide the first truly fanless core product capability very 

starting to see a lot more. There are several designs that have come o
ut 
during this quarter. The uptake has been good and we're continuing to 
market and make the product awareness.
 

products come out on Core M that continue this thin light fanless device 
2
-
in
-
1s. And so far the uptake has been very good. We think those, combined 
with our tablet offerings, provide a very 
--
 
lot of choices for the consumer in 
this mobile space. And then as we move through into the second half for the 
year, as we introduce Sk
ylake, Skylake will have an additional Core M 
version which drives even the performance the battery life to the second 
generation for Core M. And again, we expect to see form factors, thin light, 
long better life fanless designs that are quite compelling.

The next question comes from Stacy Rasgon from Bernstein.
 
Stacy Rasgon
 
I wanted to try to verify something, just so I understand it. So, is that gross 
margin is down in the second half were your 14
-
nanometer start ups are 
coming down, your revenue
s up a bunch, your tablet profit
-
loss is again lot 

-
nanometer ramping. And you talked about 
reducing your 22
-
nanometer utilization in building inventory. So, that 
suggests that utilization has to be coming down a lot in the second
 
half. You 
got to be building inventory a lot in Q2, but it's mostly 22
-
nanometers that 

launching. Do I have those dynamics correct? And then what is the risk that 

 
building inventory I guess in the first half for Q2 that will 
be tougher to sale in the second
-
half given the new products that ought to 
be launching at that that point?
 
Stacy Smith
 

 
Stacy Ras
gon
 
Okay.
 
Stacy Smith
 
It is the inventory piece. So, what we're doing is in Q2, we're cutting the 
utilization rates of the 22
-
nanometer factories to avoid putting the product in 
it 
--
 

--
 
some of this in the past, when 
we have downturn or an opportunity to roll forward capacity we want to do 

if we can help it. But we're going to be cutting utilizations we're actually 
cutting them at the peak. 
The impact of that is we'll have some higher costs 
that are sitting in it because those products that we're producing in Q2 will 
sell through in Q3 and Q4, a little bit about cost headwind in the back half of 
the year. The utilization rates will bottom in 
Q2 and then we think to start to 
build backup because we'll take capacity offline on 22
-
nanometer. So build 
back in the back half.
 
Stacy Rasgon
 
So then why are you not calling out utilization as a negative margin driver 
for Q2 versus Q1, and gross margins 
are going up in Q2?
 
Stacy Smith
 
Because we're not cutting to the point that we have excess capacity charges, 
so what's happening is you will see production cost going up but that sits in 
inventory and it fills out in the back half. So that's why the way yo
u will see 
it is a cost increase in the back half as opposed to a period charge in Q.
 
Stacy Rasgon
 



the back half down versus prior guidance?
 
Stacy Smith
 
I would say, what we're doing is we're trying to react fast on bringing 
--
 
taking capacity offline and then rolling that 
forward and that was the same 
playbook we've had whenever we have a demand.
 
Stacy Rasgon
 
Got it. Thanks. Can I ask my follow up?
 
Mark Henninger
 

 
Stacy Rasgon
 
Okay. Thank you.

The next question comes
 
from Chris Danely from Citigroup.
 
Chris Danely
 
So, I guess just a hypothetical question on M&A then. Can you think of any 
scenario? I guess your previous biggest acquisition was McAfee, which was 
like 8 billion or something. Can you think of any scenario 
that would make 
you feel like you need it or want it or desired to do a $10 billion, $15 billion 
acquisition insurance like taking the company or a big product line or 
something like that? Will that ever come into play?
 
Brian Krzanich
 

that question back so let me give you the same answer 

going to speculate on hypothetical questions.
 
Chris Danely
 
Okay, that's fine.
 
Brian Krzanich
 
But you can try a different one, if 
you want.
 
Chris Danely
 
That's okay. I'll stop for the line somewhat behind.
 
Brian Krzanich
 
You are not behind.
 
Chris Danely
 
Next one will be more mainstream, so if we kind of do the math on your 
revenue guidance, we get like, I guess, basically high single
 
digit revenue 


something like that. So I guess, how can we get to high single
-
digit 
sequential revenue gr
owth for Q3 and Q4 with the PC business a little slow, 
when I look at the last 10 quarters, Q3, Q4 in high single
-
digit revenue 
growth has only happened once, so just wondering how we can get to the 
math?
 
Brian Krzanich
 

--
 
I would say not seeing anything unusual 


back half. So just with the exception of DCG we had a higher tha
n what our 
average is in Q1, so maybe that comes down a little bit. The little issue here 
is on the PC segment, we think we grew, we reduced inventories in Q1, 

PC supply chain, we'
ll reduce inventories more in Q2. But think of that as 
you shift a few million units from Q2 and they get replenished in Q3 and that 


 
built up for the 
backend foundry.
 

that plus economic volatility and currency volatility we think customers will 
reduce inventory levels into the summer and then replenish back t
o kind of 
more normal rates after Windows 10 is available.
 
Operator
 
The next question comes from Christopher Rolland from FBR Capital 
Markets.
 
Christopher Rolland
 

industry 
volumes are now going to fall, probably mid single
-
digits along with 
you guys and some including myself believe that tablet volumes might also 
fall this year. So overall total compute units might in fact be flatter or 
perhaps falling this year. So I guess 

missing piece here is. Are they really going to fall, is this a timing issue or is 
there something else here, is it PC lifespan for example that might be 
expanding, I know you guys track that. How do you look at it in term
s of 

 
Brian Krzanich
 

not too far, you said that the PC will be down mid single
-
digits, I would 
agree most people are thinking that tabl

heard a variety of forecasts, a little more difficult to forecast the tablet 
space. Just as a reference point, our tablet number for Q1 came in right 

significantly.
 

variety of things that we look out, when we look out at this, there is share 
growth, there is 
--
 

we continue to h
ave newer and better performance as our products get 
better and better at the higher end especially and then look like the 
introduction of Core M and the number of people coming with entry level 

w we formed 
our view of this year. But as you said it is formed around a view that when 
you probably look at the total computes from those products it declined. We 

the data center
, the growth in the Internet of Things and our memory 

quarter
-
to
-
quarter.
 
Christopher Rolland
 
Also if you could address PC lifespan for example, if you do have specifics 
there? And t
hen the other question I had was, a major bear thesis looking at 
least cash flow for Intel was around increasing cap intensity as we move 


record revenue here. So in 
your opinion does this speak against that capital intensity argument or is 
this really just sort of a timing issue?
 
Brian Krzanich
 

answer the capital int
ensity one. The first one was around what is happening 
to system longevity or system lifespan. Data is continuing to grow, our 
estimates are that there's something approximating 600 million PCs out 

ter than four 
years old. You could look at that as this is continuing to grow and push, you 
can also look at this as this is a great opportunity. And we still believe that 
at some point those systems will flip over. Windows 10, Skylake, all of those 
things
 
are opportunities that we think we can start to move some of those 
units. But the approximation is 600 million of unit is greater than four years. 
So I'll let Stacy handle the capital intensity.
 
Stacy Smith
 
On the capital intensity I will give you the lon
g
-
term answer and then come 
back to what we're seeing in 2015. The longer term answer and I'll refer you 
to some of the stuff we showed at the investor meeting. We do agree capital 
intensity is going to go up as measured by capital cost per square inch of 
silicon. We believe that through 14, 10 and with some insight all the way 
down the 7 nanometer we can offset that increase in capital cost per square 
inch of silicon by improving our density. And so we can keep the cost per 
transistor coming down at the hi
storical close.
 


what I showed at the investor meeting there is kind of this $7 billion to $8 
billio
n normalized run rate where we can respond to some unit growth with 
manufacturing CapEx and on top of that we put some other capital things 
across this building, fabs and specific then to what's happening this year is 
we were planning for 
--
 
if you all loo
k back to the investor meeting last year 
we've seen two big buckets of improvement, one is as Brian said our 
confidence around 14 nanometer has improved and second our desktop 
units have come down and so versus flat, I think we're down in the mid 
single
-
di
gits. And the combination of those two things has allowed us to 
have more reuse for 22 nanometer or 40 nanometer. And we've driven some 
efficiency in the factory network. And so I'd characterize this as being an 
unusually low level of CapEx relative to the
 
size of the business because 
we're driving efficiency at a faster rate and we are getting more reuse than 
we expect.
 
Operator
 
The next question comes from Jim Covello from Goldman Sachs.
 
Jim Covello
 
Guys you've talked about how the mobile losses declined 
in the back half of 
the year that was very helpful color. Could you talk a little bit about the 
strategy or the thought process behind combining the categorization of the 
groups and the reporting structure? What was the thought there?
 
Brian Krzanich
 
Sure I
'll start Jim and Stacy can voice in some of this as well because there 
is financial side to this. But in general we first made this move based on our 
customers and how we look at the architecture in the business. So our 
customers you walk into whoever tha
t customer is Lenovo, Acer or some of 
the ODMs, they look at the platform from the phablet especially up through 
at least the tablet and instead of low end entry level PC whether it be a 
window based system or Chromebook or Android. They look at all of tho
se 
platforms as the same type of hardware. And they want to have a single 
group that they interface with and so our customers wanted this.
 
Secondly from an engineering perspective from our side, the silicon, the cost 
improvement, the software work, the dri
vers all of those things again a lot of 
overlaps. So by driving these two organizations together we are getting 
efficiencies, that are helping contribute to that $800 million cost reduction 
that Stacy and I've committed to. So it was first and foremost our
 
customers 
and our efficiency were driven by this. This is not anything else. At that point 
then Stacy, what he does is that the financials need to represent how you're 
running the business and making decisions by it. So we also made the 
reporting structur
e that same way, but I'll let Stacy jump on that.
 
Stacy Smith
 
I think Brian said the only two pieces of commentary I would add to that I'll 
take you back to Chris's question earlier. We're seeing this blurring of lines 
between different devices and we were
 
doing some unnatural things to try to 
categorize them. I think the Microsoft Surface is a perfect example of that. 
When you look at partners in IDCs, where they characterize the market, 
they count that as a tablet. We were including that in the PC revenue
 
line 
and we've realized that the customer is reviewing this as one category of 
devices, we wished manages as one category devices and we would be more 
efficient and more accurate I think of client broadly.
 
The other comment I make is, as we showed in the 
investor meeting and 
Brian had some specific materials on this. We're also finding that the IP that 
we were developing was shared across these different groups. So again we 
were having to categorize things that ultimately came down to judgments 
and we real
ized it was one set of customers one set of products and one set 
of IP that we're playing across the different products.
 
Jim Covello
 
Follow up would be on the NAND market. I know what you said, NAND is 
going to fall on same secular trends as DCG. Is there 
ever going to be a time 
period where it makes sense to expand that opportunity for you? It's a good 
growth market, you're making good margins on it those up to factories. 
What would be the pros and cons of expanding your business in that 
segment?
 
Brian Krz
anich
 
First you're right Jim. As we said at our colors Jim especially for us because 
the majority of the NAND that we sell goes into enterprise level products 
mainly the data centre greater than 50% of what we sell in the net half the 
NAND is in enterprise
 
class device. We also announced our 3D NAND, which 
we think really is a game changer. We talked about the density, the cost, 
putting 10 terabytes or more into an SSD, we think is pretty compelling. And 

D especially and 
asking ourselves what are the level of investments.
 
Right now we have a great partnerships with Micron where we jointly 
developed these, the majority of the manufacturing is done, all the 
manufacturing on these technologies is done by 
them, and that relationship 

have the efficiency of having factories that they can offset loadings with 
other products that they have and it's a very efficient model in the memory 
m
arket to have basically two companies with two very different business 
models to be officially using the same factories network.
 
What would drive us outside that? Would be if we start some unique growth 
or some unique situation to where it make sense for u
s to manufacture. But 
right now this model works very well and efficiency that we get out of 
working together with them, I think is really what has been a game changer 
in the market for us.
 
Operator
 
The next question comes from Ambrish Srivastava from Bank
 
of Montreal.
 
Ambrish Srivastava
 

E5 if I remember correctly on Grantley. Just help us understand, what has 
that done in terms of driving growth so far for the business? And my second
 
question, my follow
-
up is on the PC side Brian. You have mentioned 
Windows 10 a couple of times, are you expecting a big bump up in demand 
from that? And if so why?
 
Brian Krzanich
 

as 
Stacy can voice in for the Window 10. In all of these cases, our new products 
as you said the Grantley platform which is our E5 series of products provides 
a new level of performance and when you look at this business there are 
some segments of this bus

new generation we look at the fact that the total cost of ownership for a 
cloud provider, an enterprise provider to come in and do a replacement from 
an older generation Intel product to a new generation Inte
l product tends to 
have a positive total cost of ownership return.
 
It has a replacement function not each one of these new generations have a 
lot of which the increased density in performance that a cloud provider can 
get with a new product like the Grantl
ey allows them to grow their business 
without having to grow their footprint as much. And so that allows cloud 
growth at a much more efficient and effective capacity. So if we look at new 
platforms like Grantley, the fast we do get a very fast transition a
s we said 
greater than 50% now is on Grantley. It's just an example of how fast 
people see the economics that these products deliver. So that would be my 
answer to this, it's really performance which then drive economics, which 
then drive both replacement 
and overall data center growth. Stacy had a 
comment on that.
 
Stacy Smith
 
Just 
--
 
activity in the place you see it is in our mix and this is a place where 
if we can drive technology faster than everybody else we get paid for it 
because as we bring more powe
rful products then people buy higher in the 
stack because they get an increasing return on that. And when you look at 
the DCG results year
-
on
-
year you see that units were up 15%, ASP was up 
5%. So you see it in both of those that drives this replacement cy
cle and it 
drives in increasing mix.
 
Ambrish Srivastava
 
I guess what I was trying to get to, sorry Stacy, what I wanted to get to is 
how much of the growth is 
--
 
are you able to handicap on the number, how 
much is that growth came from the Grantley?
 
Stacy 
Smith
 

and put those things on separations. Primarily as we said, the growth in 
Grantley in general, tends to be lumpy and it's based on orders by some of 
the big cloud providers. And as
 
we said, more than 50% of the volume is 

50% of the 19% growth was probably on Grantley, but I am not sure as 
necessarily that factor driving this, it's one of the factors.
 
Brian Kr
zanich
 
Keep in mind, we bring out a new product in the data center every 12 
months and then that product rolls out over the course of a year, right. So, 
Grantley has been shifting for since 
--
 
been shipping since Q3 of last year 
and it started in the cloud
. So it's not like an event, it's you bring out a 
product and starting a segment and we bring out products that are 
appropriate to different segments and we bring out a new micro 
architecture, and then we bring out the second generation of micro 
architectu
re. So it's always a product evolution happening in this.
 
Stacy Smith
 
With regards same question as we said in the script and in some of these 
questions, we're not really, currently forecasting a big recovery or boom in 
second half. What we said is there i
s some push out of the inventory that 
would normally be present in second quarter. As people mean that so that 
they're in preparation for Windows 10, so Windows 10 Launch is in the 
summer as it's been announced. As that occurs and we move into Q3, we 
antic
ipate that inventories will simply recover back to a normal level and 


actually projecting as we said re
latively seasonal mid single
-
digit decline in 

center of the near allowance that.
 
Operator
 
The final question comes from C.J. Muse from Evercore ISI.
 
C.J. Muse
 
I guess first questio
n on the PC side in terms of the single
-
digit decline. 

mixed shift from enterprise to consumer ASPs as well as the impact of U.S. 
dollar strength?
 
Brian Krzanich
 



happening from a macroeconomic standpoint, a currency volatility kind of XP 
hangover and then Window 10 shift is just kind of all
 
wrapped up together. 

when we started the year is that we would see particularly a little less 
strength in the enterprise segment of the market and the little less 
weakness in the
 
consumer segment of the market. I think we revised that 

to probably little bit of weakness in the enterprise segment and consumer 
was weak last year as prior little less weak this 
year, but expected to be 

minus 5% kind of mid single
-
digit decline.
 
C.J. Muse
 
And again as a follow
-
up, in terms of the cut for CapEx curious if this is a 
new steady state for you g
uys. And then I guess as the question that follows 
that, how do we think about impact to construction in progress if it all? And 

there do we see a stair
-
step higher in terms of that 
number and depreciation 
or how should we think about those moving parts?
 
Brian Krzanich
 


for the 
year. We were able to get as we said better yields better utilization 

--
 
and this happens from time
-
to
-
time. You can look back 
at our past it happened in the '08, '09 and from there we get that there is a 
slight increase in our projection
s for total volume at the same time we're 

-
very quickly.
 

shift capital from 1 million to another very quickly and that has all t
o do with 
the copy exactly and how we design our architectures and technologies to be 
able to reduce. That said again separate out capital intensity of a technology 
with the absolute unit cost of a technology. And the real fundamental of 
Moore's Law is one
 
is economic and on the 58th Anniversary of Moore's Law 
which this year is we should remember that Moore's Law is an economic law 

performance of these parts.
 
So we believe the 10 nanome
ter, yes that capital per wafer start does go up 
but it goes up less than the density does and so we believe our unit costs 
and when we measure that in transistor costs which is probably the best way 
to measure one
-
to
-
one or our overall product cost on a s
ame day equivalent 
is what skylight part on one technology of the other. We get an 
improvement in that cost greater than the capital intensity.
 


ying to reduce and be as efficient in 
CapEx as we can just the capital intensity will go up in some nanometers 

less than density and cost improvements of the product.
 
All right tha

7/28/17,Intel,"Good day, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the Q2 2011 Intel 
Corporation's Earnings Call. My name is Chasity, and I'll be your coordinator 
for today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being 
recorded for replay purposes. I 
would now like to turn the presentation over 
to your host for today's call, Mr. Kevin Sellers, VP of Investor Relations. 
Please proceed, sir.
 
R. Sellers
 
Thank you, Chasity, and welcome everyone to Intel's Second Quarter 2011 
Earnings Conference Call. By 
now, you should have received a copy of our 
earnings release and the CFO commentary that goes along with that. If 
you've not received both documents, they're currently available on our 
investor website, intc.com. I'm joined today by Paul Otellini, our Pres
ident 
and CEO; and Stacy Smith, our Chief Financial Officer. In a moment, we will 
hear brief remarks from both of them followed by Q&A.
 
I'd like to tell you about a change to our company's guidance and Quiet 
Period practices. Beginning this quarter, the co
mpany's Quiet Period will be 
reduced by 2 weeks to enable an extended period of dialogue with investors. 
Intel will observe the Quiet Period from September 16 until publication of the 
company's third quarter earnings release.
 
Additionally, certain of our s
maller business outlook items, the forecast for 
amortization of acquisition
-
related intangibles, impact of equity investments 
and interest and other and tax rate, will be pulled from guidance at the close 
of business, July 26, and not subject to an update 
by the company after that 
time.
 
We also want to make everyone aware of the annual Intel Developer Forum 
taking place September 13 through the 15 at the Moscone Center in San 
Francisco. In addition to keynotes from Paul and other senior leaders, we'll 
be be
holding a number of investor briefings, and invite you to come and 
hope to see many of you there.
 
Before we begin, let me remind everyone that today's discussion contains 
forward
-
looking statements based on the environment as we currently see it 
and, as su
ch, does include risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our press 
release for more information on the specific risk factors that could cause 
actual results to differ materially.
 
Also if during this call we use any non
-
GAAP financial measures or 
reference
s, we will post the appropriate GAAP financial reconciliations to our 
website. So with that, let me hand it over to Paul.
 
Paul Otellini
 
Thanks, Kevin. I'm very pleased to report another record revenue quarter for 
the company. In May, we met with many of yo
u at our annual investor 
meeting, and laid out our strategy and the opportunities we have before us. 
The transit of driving the growth of our business that we described then are 
playing out as expected. The Data Center business remains strong, our 
Embedded
 
business is seeing rapid growth, the Enterprise PC refresh 
continues, and the emerging markets continue to be significant drivers of 
our broad based momentum.
 
In the comparison of our second quarter results versus Q2 of last year, we 
saw strong double
-
dig
it revenue growth across every business segment. For 
example, the Data Center business is up 15%; Embedded is up 25%; NAND 
is up 15%; and our PC Client business is up 11%.
 
If we look at the channel, which is an excellent proxy for emerging markets 
strength
, our channel revenue was up 17% versus last year. In summary, 
this was a very strong quarter across all of our product lines and around the 
world.
 
Now let me take just a moment and provide a bit of color on performance of 
our major business segments. The 
Data Center Group had another very 
strong quarter with CPU revenues topping the $2 billion mark for the third 
consecutive quarter. Demand for our Westmere
-
EX family that was launched 
in April is very healthy, and this helped to strengthen server ASPs in th
e 
quarter.
 
At our Investor Day, we talked a lot about how the Data Center business 
was more than just servers. To highlight that, microprocessor unit shipments 
for storage applications set a record and we're up 38% from a year ago. 
Also, we grew our networ
king revenue 40% from a year ago. The non
-
server 
parts of our Data Center business are growing at an exceptional rate.
 
As for servers, the story is much the same. The market remains very strong, 
with demand from Cloud
-
based customers leading the way. The C
loud 
segment is up 50% in the first half of 2011 versus the first half of last year, 
demonstrating how fast that business continues to ramp. We believe that we 
are very early in the Cloud build out, and that Intel remains extremely well
-
positioned to profi
tably grow from the explosion of Mobile devices and 
Internet
-
based services.
 
In our Embedded business segment, I mentioned that revenues grew 25% 
from a year ago on record microprocessor unit shipments. We shipped over 
1 million units of Atom processors in
to embedded applications for the first 
time ever, which is an increase of 76% from a year ago. Overall, we 
witnessed very broad
-
based strength in our embedded segment, with the 
fastest growth coming from the Medical Imaging segment, up 50%; Print 
Imaging, 
up 48%; Communications, up 40%; and Industrial applications, up 
20%. We're starting to see many of the long cycle design wins that we've 
been tracking, turn into revenue, and expect Q3 to continue this trend.
 
McAfee turned in a very solid quarter with reve
nue beating our expectations. 
It was a second quarter record for McAfee in terms of revenue. Additionally, 
the number of large deals signed was almost double that of Q1. McAfee is 
executing very well and the importance of security has never been more 
evide
nt. We are excited that later this year, Intel and McAfee will be shipping 
the very first products codeveloped by both companies that will greatly 
enhance security for computing applications.
 
This new solution is a combination of enhanced software from McA
fee and 
security instructions built into the hardware from Intel. We look forward to 
providing more details of this product at our Developer Forum in September.
 
Lastly, the PC Client Group also had a very good quarter. Demand for Sandy 
Bridge processors ha
s been very strong, with the ramp rate of Sandy Bridge 
ahead of the previous generation products by 20%. Today, 2/3 of all the 
products that we ship into PC clients are Core i3, i5, or i7.
 
Overall, the trends in PCs remain much the same as the last few qua
rters. 
The Corporate business remains consistent and healthy, consumer markets 
are mixed. The mature market consumer segment is still soft, but the 
emerging market consumer segment is healthy and growing.
 
Our guidance for the third quarter assumes a modest
 
growth in the mature 
market consumer segments of the business. At this point in the year, we 
believe the PC unit growth will be around 8% to 10%, down a bit from our 
earlier view, but above that in revenue as Enterprise PC purchases continue 
to drive a ve
ry rich mix.
 
I previously mentioned that our channel revenue was up 17% from a year 
ago. Let me add some color to our emerging market results. In looking at 
the last 3 months of reported PC shipments, you can see why we're so 
optimistic about the emerging 
market's opportunity.
 
For example, Turkey and Indonesia are up over 70% each; India is up 17%; 
Russia is up 15%; and China is up 14%. The latest data on Latin America 
also showed growth of 12%. Brazil remains the key driver of this growth and 
is poised to 
become the third largest market for computers in 2012. In 
general, all of these are large, high growth regions, but PC penetration 
remains very low, while affordability of PCs continues to improve.
 
In closing, I want to highlight 2 important announcements 
made this 
quarter. The first was the process technology breakthrough that we made 
public back in May. Intel will be the first company to productize 3
-
D 
transistors. Our 22
-
nanometer process technology remains on track for high
-
volume production later this 
year, and will provide substantial improvements 
in power consumption and performance. This technology is very complex 
and very innovative, plus that we expect that the lead we have in process 
technology will expand going forward, providing Intel with impor
tant 
competitive advantages in the markets we're targeting.
 
Second was the Ultrabook announcement we made at Computex. Ultrabooks 
are the next evolution in personal computing that will combine the best of 
the consumer PC with tablet functionality, as well 
as consumer electronics 
features like instant on, and always on, always connected functionality. All in 
a stylish, thin and light system. We are very pleased with the industry 
response and customer commitments around this new product category, and 
will pro
vide more details at our September Development Forum.
 
With that, let me turn the meeting over to Stacy.
 
Stacy Smith
 
Thanks, Paul. The second quarter was strong and better than expected, 
resulting in our first ever quarter with greater than $13 billion in r
evenue. 
From a market standpoint, the quarter played out as expected, with strength 
in emerging markets and enterprise, offset by softness in the mature market 
consumer segment. We continue to benefit from the strength of our product 
lineup, as mix within 
both servers and clients was better than expected.
 
Demand for our latest product, Sandy Bridge, remained strong and is the 
fastest ramping product in our company's history. As a result of the 
acquisitions of McAfee and the Infineon Wireless 
division, we will provide 
non
-
GAAP financial information in addition to GAAP for 2011 to provide 
additional visibility into the operational results of the company.
 
On a non
-
GAAP basis, we achieved record revenue of $13.1 billion. Gross 
margin of $8.1 billi
on was also a record for the gross margin of 62%. 
Operating profit of $4.2 billion was up 6% from a year ago. Net income of 
$3.2 billion and earnings per share of $0.59 were up 10% and 16%, 
respectively from a year ago. The rest of my comments will use GAA
P 
financials unless otherwise called out.
 
Our business growth has accelerated over the past few years. Second 
quarter revenue of over $13 billion is up approximately $2.3 billion when 
compared to the second quarter of 2010, equating to 21% growth. The 
acqu
isitions of McAfee and the Infineon Wireless divisions contributed 
approximately $1 billion of the $2.3 billion increase from a year ago.
 
Gross margin in the second quarter was 61%, slightly down from the first 
quarter. As expected, our 22
-
nanometer startu
p cost peaked in the second 
quarter, and our costs were slightly higher as we ramped incremental 
factories on our 32 nanometer process technology. This was mostly offset by 
the reserves taken in the first quarter for the Cougar Point product issue, 
which w
ere significantly less in the second quarter.
 
As we look forward to the third quarter of 2011, we are forecasting the 
midpoint of the revenue range at $14 billion, up 7% for the second quarter 
and in line with historical seasonality. We are forecasting the
 
midpoint of the 
gross margin range to be up from the second quarter at 64%.
 
We are raising the midpoint of our outlook for R&D and MG&A by $500 
million to $16.2 billion. Some of this increase is due to a significant increase 
in our business. For the large
r portion is driven by investments we are 
making in innovation to drive future revenue growth. Our investments are 
focused on redefining the PC category with Ultrabooks, our server product 
offerings, strengthening our product offering in tablets and phones
 
and 
further extending our process technology leadership.
 
Our long term goal here is to make these important investments that 
contribute to our growth, while still maintaining the progress we have made 
on efficiency and keeping spending as a percentage of 
revenue below 30%.
 
The cash generation of our business remains strong, with cash flow from 
operations of $4 billion in the second quarter. On top of investing in our 
business, we are increasing the amount of free cash flow allocated to the 
dividend and act
ively repurchasing shares. Consistent with the philosophy 
we outlined in May. This was apparent in the second quarter, as we 
purchased $2.5 billion in capital and are forecasting CapEx of $10.5 billion 
for the year, completed a $2 billion buyback, and anno
unced a 16% increase 
to our dividend.
 
Our Intel
-
owned inventory was approximately flat to the prior quarter and 
the inventory that sits at our distributors were down slightly this quarter. As 
we look more broadly at the worldwide PC supply chain, we believ
e 
inventories are at a healthy level and did not grow this quarter.
 
As Paul mentioned, our business results in the second quarter continue to 
reinforce the key themes highlighted at our May Investor Meeting. The 
explosion of devices that compute and connec
t to the Internet continues to 
drive the buildout of the cloud and fuel our Data Center Group growth.
 
Our Embedded business is growing at a rapid pace, as the demand for both 
performance and low
-
power from the Internet of things drives architectural 
conver
sions for Intel.
 
Emerging markets already make up more than half of our revenue. And as 
the technology that we sell becomes more affordable to billions of 
consumers, we will continue to see robust growth from emerging markets. 
These are the market forces t
hat drove first half revenue growth of 23% 
from the first half of 2010. And these are the market forces that give us 
confidence as we enter the second half of 2011.
 
With that, let me turn it back over to Kevin.

Just 
a question on your total PC unit forecast that you're looking at. I guess, 
if you're not really looking for anything different than seasonal in your full 
year guidance appears to be about the same, how do we reconcile a weaker 
addressable markets to the fa
ct that your guidance has not changed?
 
Paul Otellini
 
Well, our guidance is in revenue dollars. And I said pretty clearly that one of 
the things we're seeing is less strength in the netbook segment and a 
stronger strength in the overall mix of PCs. In fact,
 
our PC Client business, 
notebooks and desktops, non
-
netbooks is running double digits.
 
Ross Seymore 
-
 
Deutsche Bank AG
 
And I guess, on that front, in the PC Client side of things, it looks like the 
core mix, it keeps rising. It's about 20%, I believe, of 
mixed now. How high 
do you think that can go and how long do you think it would take to get 
there?
 
Paul Otellini
 
Well, I think I said that 2/3 of our PC shipments were Core i3, i5, and i7. The 
branded portions of the product line. So the number is more tha
n 20%. It's 
66.5% [ph].

My error, sorry.
 
Stacy Smith
 
Answering your question of, going forward, you can kind of see it in the 
gross margin recomp for Q3. We're expecting pricing to be relatively flat. It 
says kind of 
stable from here. So it surprises with our strength, but we 
believe that strength continues through this year.

Our next question comes from the line of Patrick Wang with Evercore.
 
Patrick Wang

Evercore Partners Inc.
 
I just want to see if you cou
ld maybe give us some milestones we should 
look for over the next couple of 
--
 
over the next quarter or so in terms of 
how your core business is growing in these emerging markets, geographies?
 
Paul Otellini
 
For the next quarter, I mean, the next milestone 
is our 
--
 
is 3 months from 
today.
 
Patrick Wang 
-
 
Evercore Partners Inc.
 
Not specifically the next 3 months, but next few months. But just over the 
next couple of quarters here. Just maybe help us get a better sense of how 
to actually track the growth in th
ose areas.
 
Paul Otellini
 
Well, I mean, there's no better way than understanding than putting feet on 
the street. To the extent that you have the opportunity to go, look at the 
--
 
I 
was just in Brazil. The fact that Brazil will become the third
-
largest coun
try 
market in the world for computers next year is pretty astounding. It wasn't 
too long ago when they were number 6 or 7. And so it's the realtime 
dynamic of these markets waking up, increase in disposable income, a 
decrease in the cost of computing, a de
crease in the cost of bandwidth and 
connectivity all coming together. And there's no one indicator I can point 
you to because as we've discussed before, some of this stuff is below the 
radar screen of some of the third
-
party trackers. But we see it realtim
e, 
because we've got a feet on the street and we're serving the market.
 
Stacy Smith
 
And I think you can see it 
--
 
where you see it pretty clearly is in our overall 
results. The emerging markets have been the big driver of incremental units 
over the last fe
w years. Our prediction is that just continues as we go 
through the next few years.
 
Patrick Wang 
-
 
Evercore Partners Inc.
 
That's helpful. And I know you guys have also shared that the graph in 
terms of number of weeks it takes to actually buy a PC. And I g
uess, my 
second question is also on the same topic here. Just in your emerging 
markets, what kind of product mix are you looking for the strength there? 
And I know that you guys are also pushing pretty hard for Ultrabooks. Just 
curious how that impacts you
r mix over time.
 
Paul Otellini
 
The strength 
--
 
the mix of the emerging markets is really historically is not 
much different than our overall mix. And every emerging market is different. 
For example, the Tier 1 and Tier 2 cities in China have a slightly ric
her mix 
than the United States on average. When you average China out across all 
the cities, you get a closer to average mix, maybe slightly down as you 
move into the Tier 5 and Tier 6 cities. But we really haven't seen the mix go 
down. The price should be
 
dramatically different in these emerging markets 
because just like as you'd expect when it's your first time to buy a television, 
the first time to buy a computer, you want value. You want something that's 
going to last, that's going to be good for your c
ompany for more than a year 
or 2 and that tends to have you buy up a bit.

Our next question comes from the line Sumit Dhanda with Citadel.
 
Sumit Dhanda

Citadel Securities, LLC
 
A couple of questions. First, on the geographic trend, it seems like 
I hear on 
the mature markets that the Americas seem to do a lot better than Europe 
in the quarter, if you just looked at sequential sales growth. Any thoughts on 
the dichotomy there, especially given that North America had a tough comp 
as did Europe with t
he extra week in Q1?
 
Paul Otellini
 
Well, you have to be a little careful of that data because it's Billings data, 
Sumit, and now we're in a situation that worldwide supply chain builds and 
builds most of the notebooks in APAC. So I wouldn't draw too much o
f a 
conclusion from the Billings data. I do think we'd say that the consumer in 
North America was a smidge stronger than the consumer in Europe in the 
second quarter. And emerging markets across both regions was strong.
 
Paul Otellini
 
And Enterprise PC sale
s...
 
Paul Otellini
 
It's strong and good.
 
Paul Otellini
 
And the servers sales in North America...
 
Stacy Smith
 
Yes, and that's good point that Paul made. You tend to see more of the 
servers build directly in the market, so that also probably drives the 
North 
America numbers a little bit.
 
Sumit Dhanda 
-
 
Citadel Securities, LLC
 
And then for my follow
-
up, Stacy, your comment that ASPs will be flat in 3Q 
despite that being typically the stronger consumer quarter, is that more an 
Enterprise driven phenomenon,
 
i.e. PC Client business? Or is it just you think 
servers will be disproportionately strong in the third quarter?
 
Stacy Smith
 
No, it's more of an overall mix
-
within the different businesses, within the PC 
business and within the Server business. If I look 
back at what I've been 
predicting over the last several quarters, what I've been wrong on is that our 
mix to the core product line, Core i3, i5, i7, has been higher than I've 
anticipated. And so even with a bit of a seasonal uptick in the Consumer 
segment,
 
I think that rich mix keeps me approximately flat from the same 
point of ASP.

Our next question comes from the line of Glen Yeung with Citi.
 
Glen Yeung 
-
 
Citigroup Inc
 
If we look at your third quarter guidance, can you give us a sense as to what 
parts of your business are above your average sequential growth and what 
are below? And I think in the major groups, PC clients, Data Center, other 
IA, and software services.
 
Stacy Smith
 
Yes. I'd say across the major businesses, what we're expecting is sea
sonal. 
And so what it is, is kind of a continuation of the trends we've seen so far. 
We've seen relative strength in enterprise and we've seen relative strength 
in emerging markets. We think that continues into the back half of this year. 
We've seen relati
ve softness in the consumer segment. But looking back at a 
decade of data in every year, be it a strong year or weak year, we see the 
second half stronger than the first half on a unit basis just because that's the 
buying season both for enterprise and con
sumer. And so off of that weak 
first half, we think there's a seasonal uptick in the second half. So nothing 
significantly different from a normal trend. So I am just starting from a weak 
starting point and some starting from a strong starting point.
 
Glen 
Yeung 
-
 
Citigroup Inc
 
And then the other question I have is, when you look into the emerging 
markets client business, is there a difference there in the way inventories 
are managed, either from the perspective of overall PC inventories or from 
the perspect
ive of stand
-
alone microprocessors? Is it harder to track, easier 
to track, do you feel like there they have control over that or they don't?
 
Paul Otellini
 
Actually, it's probably slightly better than we have in North America or 
Western Europe. And we have
 
the same visibility into our multinational 
accounts, whether they ship in China or in Cleveland. That is we were off on 
these big hub. It's a system that basically they only draw what they need for 
their near term build. And in fact, we're seeing a conser
vatism there in 
terms of people moving a bit more to the air lanes versus shipping lanes just 
to be conservative. So in general, we feel pretty good about that part of the 
inventory. In emerging markets in general, a larger fraction of sales comes 
through 
the channel. A lot of that is white box and build
-
to
-
order. And by 
definition, build
-
to
-
order, if someone walks in and gives someone $200 and 
there's a computer that afternoon. So we get a much more real time feed 
there, and of course, we don't claim that 
revenue until it sells out through 
our distributors. So if anything, it may be slightly more realtime than the 
mature markets or the enterprise markets.

Our next question comes from the line of John Pitzer with Crédit Suisse.
 
John Pitzer

Crédit 
Suisse AG
 
Paul, you talked about the percent of the client business just sitting at core 
today. I think you said 2/3. I'm kind of curious, where are we now as Sandy 
Bridge as the percent of core. And I guess as you go from a Core i3, non
-
Sandy Bridge to Sa
ndy Bridge, is that kind of both an ASP and a gross 
margin accretive event for you guys?
 
Paul Otellini
 
We're taking Sandy Bridge in the second half of the year down below the 
core brand and taking version to that into Pentium and Celeron. And as a 
percent 
of our core business today, it's over half. And what was the second 
part of the question, John? I'm sorry.
 
John Pitzer 
-
 
Crédit Suisse AG
 
As you go from sort of like a core non
-
Sandy Bridge to a core Sandy Bridge, 
is that both an ASP and gross margin accre
tive event for you guys?
 
Paul Otellini
 
If we sell the same SKU at the same price, it's just slightly better, because 
you're selling one chip instead of the chip to CPU plus chipset. But what 
we're seeing with Sandy Bridge is the trend to sell up a bit for 
every SKU 
because of the demand for the performance and the graphics capability.
 
John Pitzer 
-
 
Crédit Suisse AG
 
And then Paul, as my follow
-
up, can you talk a little bit on DCG. Some of the 
challenge checks we've done around customer's 
expectations around Romley 
are pretty high. And I'm kind of curious timeline on Romley, and as you 
think about introducing that new server architecture, do you think that's 
going to cause some stall out in the DCG group? Or how should we think 
about that f
or the back half of the year?
 
Paul Otellini
 
There's really no change for the schedule for Romley, which for those of you 
who don't follow our code names, is the Sandy Bridge version of the server 
products. We're public in saying that we'll be in production
 
this year, 
nothing's changed. We still expect to be in volume production this year. We 
have not gone public on the launch date because our server customers are 
very conservative about putting the dates out for exactly the reason you 
point out. I don't exp
ect to stall out given the timing that we've built into the 
product. I would add that as you've seen the product, it looks very exciting . 
The performance is really quite good.

Our next question comes from the line of Daniel Berenbaum with MKM 
Par
tners.
 
Daniel Berenbaum 
-
 
MKM Partners LLC
 
Just wanted to revisit ASPs real quick. With ASPs up year
-
over
-
year, how 
much of that is being driven by the client platforms and the brand name 
you've driving there? How much is being driven by pure mix in client
 
and 
how much is being driven by a shift in the enterprise platforms?
 
Stacy Smith
 
Well, I don't think I can separate out the branding from the mix within 
client. I think those things are synonymous. I think that we've spent a lot of 
energy to be able to ar
ticulate differentiated features and performance at 
different price points. That's a tool that we hadn't historically used, and that 
in conjunction with having a great product like Sandy Bridge and the kind of 
performance that brings has led to the richer 
mix within the client segment. 
I think that in general, that's the bigger driver, and then the fact that the 
Enterprise market has been relatively stronger than the consumer market is 
a secondary driver to ASP good news that we've seen.
 
Daniel Berenbaum 
-
 
MKM Partners LLC
 
And then you talked a lot about emerging markets, and I just want to make 
sure, emerging markets versus enterprise. How much of emerging markets 
is enterprise? Or do you have more or less visibility into what the split is 
between, say, con
sumer and small, medium business in emerging markets?
 
Paul Otellini
 
We'll get to that level of detail in this call. In general, the business segment 
in emerging markets is a larger percentage of the total. But as the 
affordability of technology comes 
down like we showed at the investor 
meeting. We actually expect a lot of the growth to come in the Consumer 
segment of those markets. It's going to be a faster part of the growth 
equation.

Stacy, if I could dig in a little bit on the CapEx plan and if the little bit of pull 
in that you're showing. Should I characterize these slight increase in CapEx 
this year as a pull in from ne
xt year given the slide that you put up at the 
Analyst Day? Can you help offer some color there?
 
Stacy Smith
 
Some of it is a pull in. Some of it is we're growing faster. So this is really 
construction
-
related spending. Some of it is we're going a little fa
ster on the 
40
-
nanometer factories. The larger portion of it, and keep in mind, we're 
talking about a relatively small increment. But the larger portion of it is an 
increase in the scope of those factories. As we guide into the planning, we 
saw some opport
unities to do some things in the infrastructure that we're 
putting in place that make it easier for those factories to support multiple 
generations behind 40
-
nanometer. So kind of putting in place the capability 
for 10 and 7
-
nanometer, and when it gets kin
d of high ROI to do that now 
versus having to retrofit those factories later. So it's a combination of those 
2 things, but if I was ordering, the capability is driving a little bit more and 
the speed is driving a little bit less.
 
Doug Freedman

Gleacher &
 
Company, Inc.
 
If I could look at what's going on near term with the OpEx number, this one 
of the few times I think I've seen you guys grow spending faster than you're 
forecasting revenue growth from that perspective. How should we think 
about revenue grow
th and the fall through to EPS if we were to just be 
modeling your revenue. What should we 
--
 
is there a ratio we should think 
about that you're targeting to drop through or anything you can offer as 
color as far as understanding those 2 numbers?
 
Stacy Smi
th
 
Yes, I mean, the simple answer there is what I said at the Investor Meeting, 
which is Paul and I are still committed to drive spending as a percent of 
revenue at or below 30% is our long term goal. And so I do think we will, 
over the long term, get some
 
leverage in that line item. But we have a 
couple of things going on now. We see very fast growth in revenues. So 
some of this is revenue dependent. When I just step back and look, we grew 
from 2009 to 2010, we grew the business $8.5 billion. From 2010 to 
2011, 
we're on track to grow the business in excess of $10 billion again. And so 
that revenue and profit dependent spending is a piece of this. But I think 
more importantly, we're making some important investments in our business 
that we believe give us ev
en better position as we go forward. And we talked 
at the investor meeting about redefining the PC category with Ultrabooks. 
We're making investments there. We're making investments in our Server 
business to continue and accelerate the growth rate in that 
business. And 
we're making investments in our Tablet and Phone business in order to 
improve the offering that we can offer to customers there. And Paul can talk 
a bit about that. And so it's a combination of those things, but right now, 
those investments a
re important. They don't change our long term view of 
the business, but they're important investments for us to make.

Our next question comes from the line of Craig Berger with FBR.
 
Craig Berger

FBR Capital Markets & Co.
 
Can you just, on the Cap
Ex, help us understand how much of that is sort of 
4
-
year equipment versus how much of that is longer
-
term halls and walls? 
And how long are your halls and walls depreciated over?
 
Stacy Smith
 
Of the increment, it's almost all construction, and that's 
--
 
you can have 
varying depreciation schedules but think of that as depreciating over a long 
period of time. We tend to use buildings for a decade. That's part of the 
reason that we build in the capabilities to support multiple generations in a 
factory. Equip
ment tends to depreciate on a much shorter period of time. 
Again, it can vary, but think of that over a handful of years.
 
Craig Berger 
-
 
FBR Capital Markets & Co.
 
Can you talk about CapEx spending like that for the year not the increment, 
but the total?
 
St
acy Smith
 
Probably not at the level of detail that you'd want. But if you look at the 
CapEx that we're doing this year, we said at the investor meeting more of 
that, much more of that is being driven by building factories than what is 
normal for us. Andy t
alked about that in his investor meeting presentation. 
I'd refer you back to that. It's been a long time since we've had to build 
incremental shelves, but the growth in our business now requires it. So 
we're putting in place some clean room space that we h
aven't had to do over 
the last couple of generations. So it's a larger percent, but I'm not going to 
break out the exact percent between the 2.
 
Craig Berger

FBR Capital Markets & Co.
 
And then just a follow
-
up, gross margin Q2 to Q3, I know you've gone 
th
rough it a little bit. But can you just help us understand again why there's 
greater than 100% revenue fall
-
through?
 
Stacy Smith
 
Yes, when I walk you through kind of the gross margin 
--
 
the short answer 
to your question is we're getting 
--
 
we're starting t
o get benefit of the 
tapering off of other cost of sales. And so that tends to give us higher than 
normal fall through. But if I step back and we use a reconciliation of Q2 to 
Q3 and talk a little bit about what I expect for the year, as we go from the 
sec
ond to third quarter, gross margin is going to be up around about 3.5 
points. So that takes us up to 64%. The 3.5 points comes from 
--
 
we expect 
it to be a higher volume quarter. We've talked about that. We start to see 
--
 
as consistent with our historical
 
patterns, we start to see the falling off of 
startup costs, so that adds about 1 point. We get about 1 point because 
we're now projecting to be finished with the impact of the Cougar Point 
reserves, so we don't have to repeat that in the third quarter, an
d then 
there's about 0.5 point as we continue up the ramp of the various 32 
nanometer factories, our costs start to improve. We've talked about that on 
prior calls. So that's what gives us the benefit into the third quarter. And 
then as I think about the f
ourth quarter, and you can kind of get the math 
when you look at our annual forecast. I expect that we'll get little bit of 
benefit in terms of startup costs. You tend to see that come down over a 
couple of quarters. And so they think about the fourth quar
ter gross margin. 
I put it in the range of a bit higher than the 64%, probably based on what I 
know today, below the 65% that we've articulated as the high end of our 
range. So kind of in that zone.

Stacy, I had a question just looking at the segmented revenues here on fleet 
PC Client. Looks like you had growth in this business of about 11% year
-
over
-
year, yet
 
operating profits were down about 1% year
-
over
-
year. Could 
you talk about the disconnect there with ASPs being as firm as they are?
 
Stacy Smith
 
It's startup cost, Michael. So if you think about our trend, you're on a two
-
year cadence. So during this year
-
over
-
year comparison from Q2 '11 to Q2 
'10, what you're doing is you're comparing our lowest point in startup costs 
to our highest point in startup cost, because they start coming down here 
and if you think about that on a company
-
wide basis, some of that 
is DCG as 
well, but if you think about that on a company
-
wide basis, that's kind of 3.5 
points of gross margin on a year
-
over
-
year comparison. So it's pretty 
significant.

And then I wanted to ask, looks li
ke the upside driver relative to your 
expectations was in the other group or the Intel architecture group. And I 
think Infineon was about 90 million upside versus your expectation. So I 
understand that point and the driver there. What was the other areas, 
I 
guess, that were considerably strong and what's the outlook for that 
particular segment as we move into the back half of the year?
 
Stacy Smith
 
I apologize, I'm not sure I understand your question. If I look at what was 
different from the expectations whe
n we started the quarter, Infineon 
actually came in kind of right where we expected it. At a good quarter, but 
in line with the expectations. The other elements in there were pretty much 
in line. The difference from expectations was our ASP was a little bi
t higher, 
our mix was a little bit better. And so

and that was more of a PC and 
server comment than other Intel architecture group comment.

A simple one, and then a more complicated one on CapEx. So on the simple 
question, what did your units do sequentially for processors? Where they 
down 3%, down 1%, flat?
 
Stacy Smith
 
Yes, on a sequential basis, it's a little bit complex, Shawn, because 
re
member we had the 14th week in Q1. If I strip out the 14th week, I'd 
articulate it as units were seasonal. And you normally see a Q2 that's just 
little bit down from the first quarter.
 
Shawn Webster

Macquarie Research
 
And then on capital expenditures, hi
gh
-
level question is, if your outlook for 
PCs is coming down, I'm wondering why we didn't see CapEx be flat or 
maybe down some? And then maybe you could share with us your 
expectation for capital intensity. Do you expect it to get back to a historical, 
kin
d of 35% rate next year?
 
Stacy Smith
 
Remember the capital forecast that we put in place is in support of multiple 
generations. We don't buy capital in Q2 to support what we're doing in 2011. 
The capital we're buying is 22
-
nanometer peak. It's 
14
-
nanometer factories. 
You'll soon see us moving into the cycle of 40

UBS Investment Bank
 
Let me just ask you about Ultrabooks. Sean was quoted at the Computex as 
saying that this should be about 40% of the consumer mix by the end of 
next year. If one were to go back and compare t
his to CULV from a couple of 
years ago, what makes you more confident that this will achieve this level of 
success? Do you enjoy the form factor? I think CULV also had performance 
issues. So if you can talk about the level of confidence you have with 
Ultra
books, and how you see that ramping from now until next year to get to 
that 40%?
 
Paul Otellini
 
Well, as I look at this, I don't think that the Ultrabook strategy is anywhere 
near equal to the CULV strategy as you call it. That was really a kind of a 
point 
product. It was focused on form factor. We didn't really put a lot of 
engineering into it with our customers, and we didn't look at other features. 
If you will, it's kind of a trial run in hindsight is the way I would look at it. 
The Ultrabook project is m
uch more akin to Centrino. It's a very holistic 
approach to moving the entire market to a different kind of form factor, not 
just in terms of its thinness, but in terms of the feature set. I talked about 
always on, always connected. So the machine is alway
s aware of the 
networks around it. I talk about instant on, instant boot capability. We 
talked about building in integral touch into it, another feature set. So this is 
as much about the features around the skin, or inside the skin, as the shape 
of the ski
n. And as we look at this with our customers, we also see that 
there's a great deal of engineering that has to be done. Because one thing 
we know is that today, these feature sets cost more money. But we don't 
think that PC prices are going to go up over t
ime. So what we have to do is 
work with the ecosystem to cost engineer these features for high
-
volume 
price point displacement. And that's the only way you can achieve sort of a 
40% number as Shawn predicted in that timeframe is by doing price point 
replac
ements. And then looking forward a year later, into the next 
generation, silicon, it gets cheaper to do it so we could penetrate more of 
the market.

Another way to look at ASP resilience we've seen in your CPU business on 
th
e client side, how much of that is beyond just mix? How much of that is 
also, I believe, you can take more build up material share? And specifically, I 
just want to know if the things like graphic attach rates have changed within 
the configurations here, s
eeing and therefore, you're capturing all that 
value. Or is it a case of Intel taking advantage of the fact that components 
like memory are a lot softer and therefore there isn't much pressure to take 
CPU pricing down by your customer?
 
Paul Otellini
 
Well, 
it's really demand driven, that's the way I look at it. End customers are 
demanding a higher mix of product, which gets into the branding and 
feature set questions that came up earlier. In terms of bill of materials, we 
had a very strong position to integr
ate graphics prior to Sandy Bridge. That 
just got stronger for Sandy Bridge. It satisfies more and more of the market 
and customers are using it, particularly in smaller form factor machines 
because of the power advantage. So there's no compromise on pixel
s, as 
you get a significant advantage on battery life. And as a result, we're seeing 
a very strong utilization, both in desktops and notebooks for Sandy Bridge 
graphics.

Paul, I was wondering if you can just kind of take a step back and give us 
your latest thoughts on tablets, and ultimately what you think it will be and 
do to the PC market, what it means to Intel, and what sort of s
hare goals do 
you have in tablets?
 
Paul Otellini
 
Chris, my thoughts really haven't changed from April. Even after I saw the 
numbers yesterday from Apple and we get engaged in lots of Win8 and 
Android tablet design activity across the board. I believe this 
category is 
additive to computing. I don't think it's going to replace any one category. I 
think it may replace some discretionary sales at any point in time. And I 
think that's one of the reasons that netbooks down year
-
on
-
year is this 
tablet's strength t
o some extent. The netbooks are probably also down 
because of the very good value if you can get in low
-
end notebooks 
nowadays as compared to, say, a netbook. So there's a number of pressures 
on that particular segment. Going forward, I really don't see th
at. I think it's 
a device that some people will use as a standalone device, but many people 
use it as a companion device, and that's good for us, and that seems to be 
the model even if you look at the Apple numbers, it seems to be the model 
that's consiste
nt with their base.

And then as my follow
-
up, just some quick modeling questions. Going 
forward, what should we be thinking about share count and McAfee Flash 
and Infineon revenue?
 
Stacy Smith
 
So from a share count
 
standpoint, I think you know that something we're 
not going to comment on. I can kind of tieback our philosophy to our actions 
in Q2 if you think that's helpful to you. We articulated the philosophy in the 
May Investor Meeting, first investing in our busi
ness, no change there. 
Dividends, second, and we articulated that we wanted to allocate more of 
our free cash flow to the dividend, making that approximately 40% of our 
free cash flow, and then using the remainder of cash generation, one of the 
things we l
ook at there is the buyback. I think you can see that play out 
nicely in the second quarter. We kept our cash balances relatively flat. We 
increased the dividend 16%, we made significant investments in our 
business including the CapEx numbers. And we bough
t back $2 billion worth 
of stock with the free cash flow that we generated that was in excess of 
what we needed for those other uses. I think that's a nice model for us, and 
that's very consistent with our philosophy. In terms of McAfee and Infineon, 
what 
was your specific question there?
 
Christopher Danely

JP Morgan Chase & Co
 
I guess, what you guys think or what should we be thinking on the revenue 
going forward if there's any sort of seasonality there?
 
Stacy Smith
 
It doesn't change the seasonality for 
the company as far as I can tell. So I 
haven't seen anything there. If you look back 
--
 
I commented on this earlier, 
if you look back across the last decade, we see in every environment that 
second half revenue is 2 points higher than the first half revenu
e. And 
McAfee and Infineon don't change that pattern for us.

Paul, I'm curious, how will Intel be impacted by the launch of Windows 8? Is 
that a net positive or do you think that changes competitive landscape? Like 
what are the puts and takes that we should think about?
 
Paul Otellini
 
Well, we talked about this an awful lot at our Investor Meeting. So I'm not 
going to give you a lot more colo
r than we gave there, except to say, in 
general, I think it's good. I mean, whenever Microsoft has a new operating 
system, that's good for us. We've been working with Microsoft for several 
years now on the feature set of Win 8 and optimizing our silicon ar
ound it in 
PC space. I think the jury is out on how that will be received by the public in 
tablets, and we expect to be hypercompetitive for Win8 tablets. We're 
involved in the program as aggressively as any of the silicon vendors. And 
our job is to make s
ure that we can outperform, out battery, and out 
compatibility the ARM guys in Win8 tablets.

And just as a follow up on the near term, I think you mentioned 8% to 10% 
unit forecast. Slightly different than before. Could you 
talk about the fact 
that I think you mentioned the netbooks. But those have been weak for 
some time. Are there any other dynamics that plays at a macro issue, are 
there other factors we should think about?
 
Paul Otellini
 
The principal change is the netbook.
 
As I said earlier, our core, mainstream 
PC and Notebook and Desktop business is still forecasted for us at double 
digits. And we're very comfortable with that part of the product line. The 
biggest change from 6 months ago is a slower growth rate on netboo
ks. So 
still showing growth in netbooks, just at a slower rate. And that has impacts 
on ASP. It also has impacts on our overall volume.

Our next question comes from the line of Jim Covello with Goldman Sachs.

The question I would have is, is there a way to quantify the impact of unit 
growth next year on the capacity side? How much will unit capacity be up in 
2012 as a result of the CapEx in 2011?
 
Stacy Smith
 
I'm thinking about how to answer that question, Ji
m. As we've said, we're 
putting in capacity that's pretty consistent with the kind of TAM growth 
we've seen for the last several years. And we have some ability to flex up. 
So we're making sure we're putting in some factory space to go a little bit 
higher 
than that. And we have the ability that if things end up being softer 
than that as you saw us in 2009 to respond pretty quickly and bring down 
the CapEx number and just upgrade and bring in more capital at the leading 
edge node. So think of it as pretty co
nsistent with historical unit growth 
rates with some ability to go higher than that and some flexibility to respond 
if things end up being a little softer than that. And I think Andy did a great 
job of articulating that in the investor meeting. If you want
 
to refresh on 
that, we can take you through it.
 
James Covello 
-
 
Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
 
Yes, I remember he talked about how you can kind of shut it down pretty 
quickly. So to that end, if I can use my follow up on the same topic, if the PC 
unit forecast 
that you guys see keeps coming down, is there a number that 
we could think about that we could then expect you to kind of go more on 
the slower side on the CapEx as we head into next year? If it came down to 
5, which is where the third parties are, maybe t
he third parties aren't right. 
But if your forecast kept coming down, is the market number, the third
-
party number a number where we would expect the CapEx to slow a little 
bit?
 
Stacy Smith
 
Well, it would certainly be much less than what it would be if the
 
market 
growth is '12. But I realize that's not entirely helpful answer to you. But at 
this point in the year, that's as far as I'm going to go in terms of forecasting 
CapEx for next year. I mean, Andy also articulated, when we're building 
factories, and w
e're equipping those factories there tends to be a couple 
years cycle. So I gave you a strong hint to expect elevated CapEx next year 
relative to the historical trend line. If the unit growth is significantly less 
than we're anticipating, that number would
 
be less than what we're 
anticipating. If it's more, it's more. But that doesn't help you because we 
haven't told you the baseline.
 
Paul Otellini
 
There's a third factor, Jim, I'd throw into here, which is that, increasingly our 
product line is more and 
more modular. And as we move from Sandy Bridge 
to Ivy Bridge next year, we have the ability to mix and match cores, and mix 
and match graphics engines, much more so than we've ever done before. So 
if we end up in a quarter [ph] case that you're describing 
where the markets 
short
-
term is much smaller than our ability to supply it, we can up crank our 
products pretty substantially at very little marginal cost. And really have a 
much more across
-
the
-
board competitive offering than even we have today.
 
Stacy Smi
th
 
There's lots of tools. It's interesting. There's lots of tools here at our disposal 
that we haven't historically had. The forward use of our capacity gives us the 
ability to move capacity quickly to the leading edge. 5 years ago, it isn't a 
capability w
e had. As Paul said, the modularity of our architecture now gives 
us a lot of flexibility just kind of mix
-
and
-
match the capacity to the growth of 
the market.

Our final question comes from the line of David Wong with Wells Fargo.

Well
s Fargo Securities, LLC
 
Stacy, can you go through the gross margin puts and takes as we go from 
the September to the December quarter, please?
 
Stacy Smith
 
Sure. I won't do it at a level of detail any more than I said in terms of I 
expect to be kind of a bi
t higher than where we are and under the upper 
range of 65% that we put out there. When I think about the fourth quarter, I 
think we would benefit from startup costs coming down. A strong fourth 
quarter gives us a couple of other benefits. And then I think
 
the big variable 
for us there is we have a lot of product qualifications that are kind of teed up 
across the end of this year and the beginning of next year. And where are 
those product qualifications fall could dictate where the gross margin ends 
up. So 
in terms of variability, I think that's probably the biggest variable for 
Q4.
 
David Wong

Wells Fargo Securities, LLC
 
For my follow
-
up, Software and Services, it looks to me like the operating 
margin is still negative despite the full quarter of McAfee. Is that a 
normalized level of profitability, or are there special accounting effect that 
are still there that will go aw
ay over the next few quarters? And if so, can 
you give us some idea of the underlying operating margin you've got in this 
division at the moment?
 
Stacy Smith
 
Well, the revenue related accounting impact is in that segment. So you see 
that in the Software an
d Services Group segment. The amortization of 
acquisition
-
related intangibles is outside of that segment. So it's a little bit of 
a mix. That's sitting in the corporate line. I think what you're really seeing 
there 
--
 
so part of this will improve as we get
 
the deferred revenue back 
from the accounting impact, that should be sometime next year. And you 
can see us already building up that deferred revenue balance on our balance 
sheet. So it increases just kind of watch that line item, it's not something 
you'd
 
typically had to do with Intel. And then the other pieces, remember, 
there's still a lot of investment inside that Software and Services Group 
that's in support of tablets and in support of phones and things like that. So 
there's a lot of investment in th
ere that causes the overall segment results 
to be, as you say. McAfee, if you just isolated that, looks quite good.

4/28/17,Intel,"Good day, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the Quarter 3 2011 Intel 
Corporation's Earnings Conference Call. My name is Misty, and I'll be your 
coordinator for today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference 
is being recorded for replay 
purposes.
 
I would now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today's call, 
Mr. Kevin Sellers, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed, sir.
 
R. Kevin Sellers
 
Thank you, Misty, and welcome, everyone, to Intel's Third Quarter 
2011 
Earnings Conference Call. By now, you should have received a copy of our 
earnings release and the CFO commentary that goes along with that. If 
you've not received both documents, they're currently available on our 
Investor website, intc.com. I'm joine
d today by Paul Otellini, our President 
and CEO; and Stacy Smith, our Chief Financial Officer. In a moment, we'll 
hear brief remarks from both of them followed by the normal Q&A.
 
Before we begin, let me remind everyone that today's discussion contains 
forw
ard
-
looking statements based on the environment as we currently see it 
and, as such, does include risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our press 
release for more information on the specific risk factors that could cause 
actual results to differ materia
lly. Also if during this call we use any non
-
GAAP financial measures or references, we'll post the appropriate GAAP 
financial reconciliations to our website, intc.com.
 
So with that, now let me hand it over to Paul.
 
Paul S. Otellini
 
Thanks, Kevin, and good 
afternoon, everyone. I am very pleased to report 
another very strong quarter for the company with the highest quarterly 
revenue, earnings, earnings per share and microprocessor unit shipments in 
Intel's history. In particular, we were very pleased with the
 
momentum in 
our notebook PC business and consumer demand for our industry
-
leading 
second
-
generation Intel Core processor family. Relative to the third quarter 
of last year, our notebook business saw double
-
digit unit growth, leading to 
record microprocess
or unit volume and revenue.
 
Trends inside the quarter played out largely as we expected. While consumer 
demand in mature markets like Western Europe and North America 
remained soft, Enterprise PC demand remained strong and consumer 
demand in emerging marke
ts continued to rise year
-
over
-
year. China was 
up 12%, India 21%, Turkey 14% and Indonesia 23%.
 
The Global PC landscape is being reshaped. Emerging markets now 
represent 2 of the top 3 consumption PC markets in the world. China is now 
the #1 PC consumption
 
market in the world, while Brazil has become #3.
 
In total, we grew the business by 28%, adding more than $3 billion in 
quarterly revenue year
-
on
-
year. Even excluding the acquisitions of McAfee 
and Intel Mobile Communications, revenue grew by a full 18% ov
er our Q3 
2010 results, which were a record at the time. We have now had 6 
consecutive record revenue quarters, and our financial performance is 
allowing us to return significant cash to our owners via both dividends and 
buybacks. Our investments to expand
 
our capabilities and create long
-
term 
opportunities across the computing continuum are already paying off. Let me 
give you a few examples.
 
The Data Center continues to be a key source of growth, with revenues up 
15% year
-
on
-
year in Q3. During the third qu
arter, the Data Center business 
also set an all
-
time record for storage units. We also announced that our 
Sandy Bridge
-
based 2 socket server product, code
-
named Romley, is 
shipping for revenue. Demand for Romley is forecasted to be 20x that of 
Nehalem at t
he same point of its life cycle, and we expect to launch early 
next year with almost 2x the design wins Nehalem had at its launch. In 
addition, we closed our acquisition of Fulcrum Systems, an ethernet switch 
silicon provider. The deal advances our strateg
y to deliver comprehensive 
building blocks across the Data Center from servers to storage and 
networking.
 
Turning to mobile computing. At IDF, we were proud to announce an 
extension of the long
-
standing collaboration between Intel and Google, 
which will en
able time
-
to
-
market optimization of Android on Intel 
architecture. Work on Medfield
-
based smartphones and tablet designs 
continues, and we remain on track for Medfield
-
based devices to launch in 
the first half of next year.
 
I'd like to give a short update 
on our acquisitions. McAfee and Intel Mobile 
Communications, for example, contributed revenues of $1.1 billion in the 
third quarter. Sampling is imminent for Intel Mobile Communications' LTE 
product, and earlier today, McAfee launched Deep Defender. This 
g
roundbreaking new security product is the first fruit of the collaboration 
between Intel and McAfee.
 
In PCs, we are beginning to see the first generation of Ultrabooks come to 
market for the holiday selling season. Industry and consumer interest in 
Ultrabo
oks is high, and these early designs offer compelling, thin and light 
form factors with instant on capability, enhanced security and excellent 
battery life starting at less than $1,000. And yet, this is just the beginning. 
Over the next 2 generations, we e
xpect that Ultrabooks will evolve to include 
features like touch screens and an always
-
on, always
-
connected capability, 
all at mainstream price points, offering a truly exceptional PC experience. 
With more than 70 designs in the pipeline, we are excited ab
out the future 
of Ultrabooks.
 
During the third quarter, we began volume production of Ivy Bridge on our 
22 nanometer process technology. 22 nanometers will usher
-
in the era of 3
-
D transistors, which will pay dividends in power, performance and density for 
generations to come. The midpoint of our outlook for the quarter puts us on 
pace to deliver nearly $55 billion in revenue for 2011, after crossing $40 
billion for the first time in 2010, representing a year
-
over
-
year increase of 
26% or more than $11 billio
n.
 
In closing, we are very pleased with the results and accomplishments of this 
record
-
setting quarter and year
-
to
-
date. We remain very confident in our 
growth strategy and are excited about our new product pipeline.
 
With that, let me turn the meeting over
 
to Stacy.
 
Stacy J. Smith
 
Thanks, Paul. Revenue in the third quarter was a record, and it was our 
most profitable quarter ever. You can see the growth of our business by 
looking at a year
-
to
-
date comparison versus 2010. At the end of the third 
quarter, our
 
revenue of $40.1 billion is $7.9 billion higher than the 
corresponding first 3 quarters of last year.
 
Third quarter revenue of over $14 billion is up over $3 billion when 
compared to the third quarter of 2010, equating to 28% growth year
-
on
-
year. McAfee a
nd the Intel Mobile Communications Group contributed $1.1 
billion of the $3.1 billion increase from a year ago.
 
Intel
-
owned inventories were slightly down from the second quarter. As we 
look more broadly at the worldwide PC supply chain, we believe invento
ries 
stayed at healthy levels and continue to be tightly managed by our 
customers.
 
Gross margin in the third quarter was 63%, up nearly 3 points from the 
second quarter. As expected, gross margin benefited from seasonally higher 
volume, lower unit costs as
 
we ramped 32 nanometer factories, lower 
factory startup costs as we started 22 nanometer production and lower 
charges related to the Cougar Point product issue from earlier in the year.
 
Across all measures of profit, the third quarter was our best ever. O
perating 
income of $4.8 billion was 34% of revenue, up over 3 points from the 
second quarter. Third quarter net income of $3.5 billion and earnings per 
share of $0.65 are up 17% and 25% respectively from a year ago. After 
excluding acquisition
-
related acco
unting impacts, non
-
GAAP earnings per 
share of $0.69 was up 1/3 from a year ago.
 
In 2011, we have increased our employment by approximately 17,000 
people, driven by acquisitions and hiring in research and development and 
manufacturing. And while business l
evels remain strong, the uncertainty 
around 2012 GDP growth rates has caused us a slow hiring for the rest of 
this year. As a result of this, our R&D and MG&A for the third quarter came 
in $150 million lower than the outlook we gave in July, reducing our 
s
pending as a percent of revenue to 29%.
 
As we look forward to the fourth quarter of 2011, we are forecasting the 
midpoint of the revenue range of $14.7 billion. Year
-
over
-
year revenue 
growth is expected to remain strong, growing 28% from the fourth quarter
 
of 2010. The midpoint of the fourth quarter range is up 3% from the third 
quarter, lower than average historical seasonality based on concerns about 
economic growth in Europe.
 
We are forecasting the midpoint of the gross margin range to be up a couple 
of 
points from the third quarter at 65% as a result of higher volume, lower 
unit costs and lower startup costs. The fourth quarter gross margin forecast 
assumes a late quarter qualification for sale of Ivy Bridge, our first product 
on 22 nanometer.
 
The cash g
eneration of our business remains strong, and in fact, increased 
significantly in the third quarter, with record cash flow from operations of 
$6.3 billion. Over the course of the year, we have made both significant 
investments in our business and have syst
ematically increased the return of 
cash to our shareholders via increases in the amount of free cash flow we 
allocate to the dividend and via buybacks. Additionally, in the third quarter, 
we took advantage of record
-
low interest rates and borrowed $5 billi
on, 
primarily for the purpose of repurchasing stock. This was one of those rare 
opportunities where the weighted average after
-
tax cost of the debt was 
approximately 1/2 that of our dividend yield on the date of issuance.
 
Total cash investments ended 
the quarter at $15.2 billion, up $3.7 billion 
from the second quarter. So far this year, we have generated over $14 
billion in cash from operations, paid approximately $3 billion in dividends, 
purchased nearly $8 billion in capital assets and repurchased $
10 billion in 
stock.
 
Since restarting our share repurchase program in the fourth quarter of 2010, 
we have purchased over 500 million shares and reduced diluted shares 
outstanding by over 350 million shares. Additionally, we're announcing today 
that our Boa
rd of Directors has approved a $10 billion increase to the 
authorization limit for share repurchases.
 
The third quarter results illustrate several of the business drivers that we 
articulated at our investor meeting in May. Emerging markets are growing as 
a
 
result of increased affordability of the technology that we sell. Our 
Notebook business saw strong unit growth at a very healthy mix. Our 
enterprise business continues to grow rapidly and generate high returns as 
data centers are built to support the expl
osion of devices that are computing 
and connecting to the Internet. The integration of both the Intel Mobile 
Communications Group and McAfee went well. Each had strong quarters and 
offered new opportunities to differentiate our core business as well as gro
w 
in new areas. And lastly, we are generating increasing shareholder return via 
increases in our dividend and we are contributing to record earnings per 
share via our buybacks. These trends have us on track to achieve record 
revenue and record profit in 20
11.
 
And with that, let me turn it back over to Kevin.
 
R. Kevin Sellers
 
Okay. Thank you, Stacy and Paul. We'll now move to Q&A. [Operator 
Instructions] Before we poll our first questioner, Stacy has a brief 
announcement that he would like to make.
 
Paul S. O
tellini
 
Yes. Before we begin the Q&A, I want to announce the change in our 
Investor Relations team here at Intel. When Kevin started in the role of 
Director of Investor Relations nearly 5 years ago, I told him he couldn't 
leave until our revenue was over $
50 billion. Our revenue is on track to $55 
billion this year, so it's time to announce that Kevin will be moving into a 
new role in marketing, where he'll be responsible for global advertising, 
online marketing and corporate events for the company. Therefo
re, I'm 
pleased to announce that Mark Henninger is taking over the role of Director 
of Investor Relations. Mark is known by many of you already and brings over 
15 years of Intel experience with over 3 years of IR experience to the 
position. Of note, I'd li
ke to say that I plan to hold Mark to the same 
standard as Kevin, which means that he can't leave the role until we're up 
another 55% and hit $85 billion in revenue.
 
With that, I'd like to thank Kevin for his leadership and welcome Mark to the 
role. We wil
l now have Mark take us through the Q&A portion of the 
meeting.
 
Mark Henninger
 
Great. Thank you, Stacy. Operator, if you can go ahead and pool the line 
and introduce our first questioner.
 
Question
-
and
-
Answer Session
 
Operator
 
[Operator Instructions] Your fi
rst question comes from the line of Uche Orji 
with UBS.
 
Uche X. Orji 
-
 
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division
 
First of all, Paul, let me ask you, ASPs have been stable so far, and as you 
start to look to drive Ultrabooks, is there any likelihood that this 
might be 
something that may 
--
 
you might have concede on as a way to drive that 
market, and obviously because a pushback in Ultrabook [indiscernible] on 
pricing, even at $1,000, do you think that is enough demand to drive this or 
do you have to make some c
oncessions to drive the penetration?
 
Paul S. Otellini
 
Well, there are a couple of things. But the short answer to your question is 
that everything we envision for Ultrabook presumes that this happens at 
mainstream price points. Right? And so we don't think
 
that people are going 
to spend more money on average for computers tomorrow than they spend 
today. So that's built into our model. Having said that, when you look at 
where Ultrabooks are this holiday season, they're in the $899, to $1,000, 
maybe $1,100 at
 
the high end some of them. I think a year from now, you'll 
see them at, say, $699 and up. And at those price points, that there's plenty 
of room for Intel's Core Processor family to be in there. Second of all, as the 
form factor comes down, Intel's built
-
in materials in these Ultrabooks has a 
chance to go up, integrated graphics is used more often that not, solid
-
state 
drives will be used more often that not. And then the third point I'd make is 
around the ecosystem. Today, thin costs more. And so a lot of
 
the 
components, not necessarily chips, but other things like the touchscreens or 
the batteries or the low
-
profile hard drives or solid
-
state drives cost a little 
bit more. And so what Intel's $300 million Ultrabook fund is aimed at is 
really accelerating 
the volume price points through volume commitments 
and investments for those components such that the industry can't 
collectively hit those price points. So I think that we've really thought this 
through in terms of how to get volume and profitably at the 
same time.

Yes. This is Stacy, Uche. We don't think it's going to have an impact on th

Your next question comes from the line of Mark Lipacis with Jefferies.
 
Mark Lipacis

Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research

The question is most semiconductor companies are cutting their forecast and 
your 3Q is pretty close to seasonal, if not better. What do you think is going 
on? Are you gaining share from AMD? Are you gaining share of silicon 
content in the PC? Is t
his just what we should expect for an organic growth 
in PCs? Any clarification there would be helpful.
 
Stacy J. Smith
 
This is Stacy. I think it's really a continuation of the trends that we've been 
talking about. The emerging market demand was strong acros
s the board. 
The Enterprise segment of the business was strong and it offset slower sales 
in the mature market consumer segment of the market. To your question on 
share gain with AMD, we'll wait and see their results. Our sense is we may 
have picked up a l
ittle bit of revenue share at the end of the quarter. But 
just to quantify that, I think it was probably on the order of $50 million to 
$100 million of impact to our business. I think the broader impact there is 
the leading
-
edge process technology becomes 
more and more complex, and 
we believe, becomes more of a competitive differentiator going forward. And 
not just with AMD, we're seeing this across
-
the
-
board. We're solving these 
problems a full generation ahead of everybody else. They're very difficult 
pro
blems to solve. By being ahead of the rest in the industry, we can bring 
more features, more performance, bring cost down, be more power efficient. 
I think that has been a big driver of our business, and I think it will continue 
to be so.

That's a great set
-
up for the follow
-
up question, which is there's a debate 
about x86 versus ARM in mobile and notebook processors. And I guess, if 
you could just share with us your view on the importa
nt vectors to compare 
x86 or Medfield or whatever the proper processor name for you guys is 
versus ARM, and when should we expect to see you guys shipping x86 into 
volume handsets?
 
Paul S. Otellini
 
Sure. Well, the short answer to your question, the last pa
rt of your question, 
is what I said earlier, which is you'll see Intel
-
based phones in the first half 
of next year from a variety of suppliers. And we won't make any 
announcements until those phones are ready to be shown in public. But the 
other answer to 
your question is that there is 
--
 
just like there's no one ARM, 
there's no one version of Atom going into these devices. We have 
--
 
Intel 
has tailored Atom for low
-
end PCs, it's now tailoring it for tablets. We're 
tailoring different versions of it for han
dsets and cellphones, and other 
versions for embedded and automotive implementations. And the ARM guys 
have done a lot of that in the past with different derivatives of their 
products. As the need for computing performance goes up, both the Intel 
architect
ure and the ARM architectures face the same fundamental physics 
problems, which is more performance requires more transistors. So at the 
end of the day, to deliver multi
-
core performance, better graphics 
performance in a battery
-
constrained environment is 
going to be a function 
of the transistors more than the microarchitecture. And that's where Stacy's 
comments on our transistor advantage, today and going forward, become 
critically important in understanding how this will play out.
 
Stacy J. Smith
 
Okay. Mar
k, let me just 
--
 
let me also add to that. I hear this argument a lot 
about ARM coming into the PC segment of the market, and the way I hear it 
articulated from some of our competitors is they're talking about they're 
going to come into that segment of the
 
market, which is the low 
--
 
very low 
end of the PC market with a $30 processor to compete against our $100 
processor and therefore, they win. I think if you look at the low end of the 
market today, it's pretty instructive. We're there today with $30 proce
ssors 
where we make a very good product margin on, actually, $30 kits in that 
segment of the market. AMD, our prime competitor, is in there, well under 
our pricing. They're selling at a $20
-
kit pricing. We still win the lion share of 
that market, and we wi
n the lion share of that market because we bring 
more performance, we bring features, we're a reliable supplier, we have high 
quality levels. All of the benefits of doing business with Intel shine through 
there. It's going to be the same issue with ARM. Al
l of those advantages will 
be even more so against ARM. And with AMD, they're socket and application 
compatible. With ARM, they're not. And so the cost and the complexity to 
our consumers is quite a bit higher. So I'm really confident in our play in 
that s
pace. And as Paul said, at the end, it all comes down to we're solving 
these problems of physics 2 years ahead of the rest of the industry, that 
gives us a cause
-
to
-
performance a future advantage that become very 
difficult for people to match.

You
r next question comes from the line of C.J. Muse with Barclays Capital.
 
Christopher J. Muse

Barclays Capital, Research Division
 
I guess, first question, in terms of your revenue guide up 3% sequentially at 
the midpoint, can you help me understand kind of
 
the moving parts there? 
What's outperforming, what's underperforming within your various 
segments?
 
Stacy J. Smith
 
Sure. I'd be happy to. So first, I want to put that in perspective. It's 28% 
revenue growth year
-
on
-
year off of the back of a strong 2010. 20
10 was a 
strong year for us. But you would look at the 3% and say against a kind of 
wide range of seasonal outcomes, that's kind of at the lower end or below 
the seasonal average. When you deconstruct what's going on, I think that 
we're a little cautious o
n Q4 based on, as I said in my prepared remarks, 
just macroeconomic concerns, particularly in Europe. And you have to 
remember that Q4 is a very strong consumer quarter and that has been a 
section of the market that has been sluggish really all year. So th
at's one. 
We're hearing from our customers that they're going to manage inventory to 
very lean levels, supply chain inventory very lean levels. So that also is, I 
think, a little bit of a headwind, assuming that in
-
demand ends up where 
we're predicting it 
to be. And then third, our IMC business, Intel Mobile 
Communications group, is down a bit. We have one key customer that's 
moved to a multi
-
source strategy. By the way, we knew that when we did 
the deal, but it's now coming to fruition, and so they'll be d
own a couple of 
hundred million dollars as we go from very a strong Q3 to Q4.
 
Christopher J. Muse

Barclays Capital, Research Division
 
And I guess, as my follow
-
up, in terms of CapEx, your budget is unchanged 
this year, and I think you've made sort of som
e internal changes as you 
think about cutting your 1270, 1272 roadmaps. And I guess my question 
there is, are you pulling in the 1272 so that, that will actually come in 
faster? Is that still on track for where you thought it would be 6, 9 months 
ago?
 
Stac
y J. Smith
 
It's on track to where we thought it was 6 to 9 months ago. And remember, 
the capital we're spending this year is kind of 22 nanometer peak, it's the 
front edge of 14 nanometer, it's putting in place the space to support the 
fact that we're now 
a $55 billion business that's growing. So the kind of 
short
-
term movements don't really impact the capital budget. But to your 
question, 20 nanometer is similar to what we have believed all year.

Your next question comes from the line of John Pitz
er from Credit Suisse.
 
John Pitzer 
-
 
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division
 
And I guess as my first question, Paul, can you talk a little bit about DCG? A 
lot of buckets within that. What's been kind of outperforming versus kind of 
underperforming? And as you
 
think about maybe that maintaining at 15% 
top line year
-
over
-
year growth rate, you kind of had been flat here for the 
last couple of quarters. What's the drive to kind of the next leg of growth 
there?
 
Paul S. Otellini
 
Well, I think there's 3 elements of t
he business. There's the classic 
enterprise data center, which has been going through a sort of secular 
consolidation over several years now, starting with Nehalem, where people 
are moving from older generations of 1 and 2P servers to MP virtualized 
machin
es. And that, we've only begun to see the impact of that and some of 
the early hints on Romley that I talked about are indicative of the upside we 
still have in corporate enterprise data centers. The second big clump is in 
the Internet data centers. And th
ose 
--
 
that growth rate, which is basically 
tracking the cloud growth rate, is really quite strong. Those customers tend 
to buy in a more lumpy pattern, around our best technology. So you might 
imagine that some of those large customers may be waiting for 
our next 
generation products to be deployed, which are being shipped now, but they'll 
start deploying in the next several months. And then the third one is in 
things around servers in the data center, networking and enterprise, and 
those businesses have be
en quite strong. You saw EMC's announcement this 
morning and our announcement that we had a record quarter in storage. 
There's really no difference in that. People are adding storage capacity as 
fast as they're having cloud computing capacity because they 
go hand and 
glove. I think that the biggest issue relative to the quarterly trends is 
probably this lumpiness in the Internet data centers.
 
Stacy J. Smith
 
I was surprised when I looked at the data 
--
 
John just said, give a little more 
color on that, how qu
ickly these guys convert to our newest technology. We 
looked back at Westmere, and what we saw is in the first 90 days, they 
converted, that 90% of our sales to them we're on the new technology. And 
so as Paul said, I think we saw a little bit of a stall i
n Q3 as they were 
waiting for the Sandy Bridge version, and that's now telling for revenue and 
we're seeing acceleration in the business. So I think that skews those 
quarterly results somewhat.
 
John Pitzer

Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division
 
That's helpf
ul. And then as my follow
-
up, Stacy, you gave us ASPs at the 
platform level. I'm kind of curious when you look within the PC client group, 
with MPU revenue up 15% versus chipset up 6% sequentially, can you help 
me understand on the MPU side, what was unit 
driven versus ASP and are 
you benefiting as you're tucking in integrated graphics? And how do we think 
about that going forward?
 
Stacy J. Smith
 
Yes, so first of all, it becomes increasingly difficult, if not misleading to try to 
separate out the CPU from t
he chipset. We're selling this as a platform of 
capabilities. And so I think that the most intellectually honest way for us to 
talk about it is at a platform level. In terms of what drove the Q3 results, it 
was really all units. Quarter
-
on
-
quarter pricing 
was relatively flat. It was a 
unit
-
driven story. We saw double
-
digit growth across PC units, and 
notebooks were notably stronger than the average.

Christopher B. Danely

JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division
 
In terms of the Q4 forecast, how much of the below seasonal sales would 
you say is due to just an inventory drawdown versus
 
softening demand? And 
then any commentary from your customers on the demand environment 
would be great as well.
 
Stacy J. Smith
 
Yes, we don't think that there's an inventory drawdown. We ended Q3 lean 
and they all continue to be lean. So, I guess, what art
iculated is I think 
we're a bit below 
--
 
when I say we, the worldwide PC supply chain, kind of a 
bit below model today. It's healthy to lean, and we don't think that they're 
going to grow inventory levels in the fourth quarter.
 
Paul S. Otellini
 
Let me just
 
add on customers as a development. Let me add something you 
didn't ask, but wanted to color my comments, which is the shape of Q3. And 
as we went through Q3, we saw September being very strong. So we didn't 
see a tail off at all in the third quarter. In t
erms of customer forecast, it's 
really 
--
 
it's an interesting dynamic that they are, obviously, moving very 
rapidly around the enterprise sales, but everyone is cautious around 
consumer sales, particularly in the U.S. and Western Europe. And not less so 
ob
viously in emerging markets. The other dynamic that's here is that there 
seems to be an adequate supply of components to build, in particular, 
laptops. So screens, power supplies, hard drives, all the stuff that a quarter 
ago was a little empty because of 
the tsunami, seems to be in more than 
adequate supply. At the same time, for other reasons, macroeconomic 
reasons, it's now cheaper to ship by air than it was in prior quarters. So our 
customers have more flexibility on the upside for taking turns environm
ent 
should they see opportunity over the course of this quarter than we've seen 
in a couple of quarters. And so I think what you've got is them just staging 
to be cautious and not get caught on the downside with inventory, but to be 
ready to pounce on any 
upside opportunity.

JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division
 
And for my follow
-
up, I'll completely switch gears. This year, you guys have 
really made a statement through increasing the dividend and the buyback. If 
you could just mayb
e talk about sort of what drove that change? And then 
also any sort of metrics you look at as far as how you allocate cash either 
way and what is your sort of long
-
term goal for cash at Intel versus debt 
level? Anything like that would be helpful.
 
Stacy J.
 
Smith
 
Yes, I'll take a shot and forgive me in advance. We tend to not talk about 
the level of cash that we're targeting, nor do we talk about, on a prospective 
basis, buybacks. But I'll go back and talk about our strategy and put it in 
place. I think you'
re right. You have identified, we 
--
 
between Paul and I and 
the Board have had robust conversations, made a very conscious decision to 
prioritize and articulate the strategy of what we're going to do with cash. 
And as I've said before, it's first and forem
ost invest in our business. You 
can see we're doing that in areas where we think we get tremendous value, 
it's leading
-
edge process technology, it's buying companies like McAfee and 
IMC where we think we generate important differentiated capabilities. 
Seco
nd is the dividend. And I will try to be very explicit that we are 
allocating more of our free cash flow to the dividend, and what I said at the 
investor meeting is that I'm targeting something on the order of 40% of free 
cash flow via dividend payout. And
 
then we continue to use the buyback 
then as the third way that we return cash to shareholders and the 
combination of generating a lot of cash in 2011 and the fact that we were 
bringing down our cash balances sum from where they were to where they 
are, led
 
to a pretty significant buyback to date. And I'm sure it didn't escape 
your notice that we also announced today that the Board has authorized, at 
Paul's and my request, another $10 billion buyback authorization.

Citigroup Inc, Research Division
 
Now that emerging markets is becoming an increasing part of your business, 
can you talk about the changes we may expect to see in the next, call it, 4 
to 8 quarters in ter
ms of mix and form factor, but also in terms of new 
product uptake and the kind of visibility that you get from the emerging 
markets?
 
Paul S. Otellini
 
Well, there's about 3 variants of that. So in terms of mix and uptake of new 
products, in the last 4, 5 
years, the emerging markets, at least, have not 
behaved materially different than our mature markets. That is the Tier 1 
cities in China or Brazil tend to buy essentially the same products that you 
buy in Tier 1 cities of North America or Europe. And there
's a very rich mix 
of products. In fact, for a while China was actually a richer mix than the 
United States on average. But now we're seeing Tier 3, Tier 4 cities come 
on. So that's being mitigated a bit. In terms of being able to have visibility, I 
think 
the visibility is as good, if not better. In these markets, there is still a 
reasonably large amount of the business that is still desktop and that is 
distribution related. And that business, we have almost realtime a visibility 
into because we don't recog
nize revenue until a unit is sold out of 
distribution, which means it goes into a PC, being built that day basically. So 
I like our visibility in these markets, I like the buying pattern, and I like the 
rich mix and I like, obviously, the upside opportunit
y of new buyers.

Second question is on Ultrabook. The commentary often centers around 
what's ARM going to do to Intel next year. But by the same token, do you 
think that Ultrabook stimulates overall PC growth t
o maybe be above what 
we would have expected without Ultrabook and does that growth, even if 
ARM takes some share, offset any potential they may have?
 
Paul S. Otellini
 
Well, I would hope so. And I think there's a couple of things next year that 
are intrigu
ing. One is the growth of Ultrabook, and the other is a new release 
of Windows. And historically, a new release of Windows has benefited Intel 
nicely. I think that we 
--
 
while there is certainly some possibility of ARM 
incursion into PC space, I think it's
 
going to be minimal for the reasons that 
Stacy said earlier. I actually look at it the other way around, which is to 
date, our presence in tablets has not been that large. With Windows 8, you 
have a monolithic operating system across PCs and tablets that 
Intel can 
participate in and bring in the advantage of legacy support for applications 
and device drivers. And in that dynamic, I think we have, net, more upside 
than downside.

James Covello

Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division
 
In terms of the market, you guys have given us a great articulation of why 
your business is growing so much faster than the third
-
party data suggests, 
and I think a lot of that is the emergi
ng markets that you guys have been 
very helpful in, in allowing us to understand. What I don't understand as 
easily is your business versus the other component companies that 
theoretically should sell into those same emerging markets: DRAM, panels, 
power m
anagement, hard disk drives. I mean, all of those things also would 
sell into those same emerging markets. So can you give us a little bit of 
perspective on why your business is so much better than theirs?
 
Paul S. Otellini
 
At the end of the day, it can't b
e. For every laptop, there's a chip and a 
panel. There is a bit higher fraction of desktops in emerging markets, but 
not so much that we would throw the data off along the line that you're 
suggesting. My sense is that 
--
 
those industries are far less conce
ntrated. 
And so it's probably harder for the third
-
party to get their arms around the 
dynamics, particularly as there may be some differential quality going into 
parts selection to some of these markets. People may sell their off
-
spec 
panels into cheaper n
otebooks going into some of these markets, or off
-
spec 
memory and things like that. I don't know that that's a big factor, but it's 
the only thing that comes to mind in trying to explain that economy.
 
Stacy J. Smith
 
It might also be, and I'm speculating he
re, but we have seen people manage 
inventory levels on CPUs very low. And so it's possible that what you see as 
inventory builds up on something, there's a correction here, a correction 
there, whereas with CPUs because of hubs and the cost of the CPU relat
ive 
to the overall system, we get more realtime sales. But that's speculation, 
Jim. At the end of the day, as Paul said, over time, they have to match.

And just in sort of a related question, do you expect any additional startup 
cost as you start thinking about SoC's next year?
 
Stacy J. Smith
 
Yes. So let me just take you 
--
 
let me do the Q3 gross margin walk. It 
wasn't e
xactly as you stated. I caught several small things. But we had 
anticipated that we would get benefit from higher volume, lower unit cost, 
lower startup cost and less impact associated with the Cougar Point product 
issue that we've had in the first half. W
e got all of that. We got a point for 
volume, we got a point for unit cost, we got about 0.5 point for startup cost, 
0.5 point of having less Cougar Point. When I go back to the forecast I 
made, you probably had 3 things that moved in different directions.
 
We got 
a little more good news than I expected on product cost. I got a little less 
good news than I expected on startup costs and Cougar Point. None of those 
were equal to 0.5 point of gross margin. So they're all relatively small, and 
the combination of
 
them just caused me to round down. So it's kind of as 
simple as that. In terms of impact of 22 nanometer SoC startup cost, I 
struggle to answer that question a little bit. We have startup costs all the 
time. As I've shown in the past, we have a baseline o
f startup costs and then 
when we're launching a new process technology, which is for us odd years, 
you tend to see an elevation in those startup costs. So that hasn't changed. 
I'd expect startup costs to be less next year, and then they'll elevate again 
in
 
2013 as we're starting to bring 14 nanometer to the marketplace. And 
SoCs don't change that equation for me.

And operator, we'll take 2 more questions, please.

Your next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon with 
Stanford 
Bernstein.
 
Stacy A. Rasgon

A question on your guidance, particularly weakness in Europe. What does 
your European strength look like this quarter, at least from an end
-
market 
standpoint? I was a
ctually kind of surprised that your direct sales into 
Europe were up 16%. But I find it hard to believe, that I guess your total 
end
-
market demand in Europe was hugely strong this quarter. And do you 
expect it to be significantly weaker in Q4 versus Q3, wh
ich is driving, I 
guess, the full amount of the sub
-
seasonal guidance? Or what does this 
actually imply, I guess, for outlook in other regions, particularly areas where 
you're currently seeing strength?
 
Stacy J. Smith
 
So first, Stacy, you have to separate 
out what we report to you as billings 
versus the strength of end markets. And remember, our billings data, as 
Paul was talking about earlier, will capture typically the channel sales, which 
is more desktop
-
oriented 
--
 
actually it's almost all desktop
-
orien
ted, and it 
captures server builds, which sometimes are done inside the market. The 
rest are built by big MNCs, it tends to be build in either Taiwan or China, and 
then is shipped into Europe. And so our comment on weakness in Europe 
was more of an end
-
mar
ket comment based on mature market consumer 
that does intend to be built inside of Europe. I'll pause there and pause for 
your other questions.
 
Stacy A. Rasgon 
-
 
Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division
 
So what did your end
-
market demand in Euro
pe actually look like in Q3 and 
how do you expect that to be different in Q4? Was your end
-
market demand 
in Europe significantly strong in Q3?
 
Stacy J. Smith
 
No, it was 
--
 
again, it paralleled the high
-
level comments. It was, for EMEA, 
it was strong in the
 
emerging markets of EMEA. So central Eastern Europe, 
Middle East. For Enterprise, it was relatively good. We saw much slower 
growth in mature market consumer in EMEA and you'd say it was sub
-
seasonal growth in that segment. We would expect those trends to
 
continue 
into Q4. The difference is in Q4, it is the big consumer selling season in 
Europe, and so the impact on our business is going to be bigger.
 
Stacy A. Rasgon 
-
 
Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division
 
So you just had a stronger, I guess,
 
enterprise demand across, which gave 
you very strong results versus your guidance this quarter, and the enterprise 
lift eases in Q4 and you get exposed to consumer weaknesses. Is that how I 
ought to be thinking about this?
 
Paul S. Otellini
 
We saw strong e
merging markets and enterprise, we expect that to 
continue, so it doesn't lessen the differences, as Q4 is a much bigger 
consumer, mature market consumer selling season, which is why we're 
below season.

And for my follow
-
up, I just want to see if I can get a little color around your 
depreciation. So it looks like you took your depreciation guidance for the end 
of the year up from where it's been. And I would assume that is related to 
CapE
x and among other things. Can you give us some feeling for where you 
expect, I guess, depreciation run rates to go in 2012 versus where they've 
been running for much of 2011 and maybe where they're running versus 
Q4?
 
Stacy J. Smith
 
Yes, I don't think we to
ok our depreciation forecast up. I think we were 
right...
 
Stacy A. Rasgon 
-
 
Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division
 
Was it 1.4 versus 1.3 or 1.2 the quarter before?
 
Stacy J. Smith
 
We may have a round that caused it to round from 1.3 to 1.4. But
 
in 
essence, depreciation for the quarter and for the year is right on what we 
expected. And I'll provide a depreciation forecast for 2012 in January. I just 
looked at the data, there's no change, Stacy, to the depreciation forecast.

Your final question comes from the line of Ross Seymore with Deutsche 
Bank.
 
Ross Seymore

Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division
 
The first question, Paul, in 2011, the enterprise side of things and the 
demand 
was very strong, and the emerging markets were as well. As we 
look into 2012, especially giving Ultrabooks and potentially what Windows 8 
is going to do, how should we think about the enterprise versus the 
consumer in aggregate and what that may or may not
 
mean to Intel's mix, 
gross margin and ASPs?
 
Paul S. Otellini
 
Well, the overall pattern hasn't changed. Enterprise 
--
 
big business 
enterprise, as opposed to small, medium business, represents about 1/3 of 
our PC sales. And that hasn't changed. That's a lar
ge installed base. That 
installed base is not going to be an early adopter of Windows 8. Enterprise 
always adopts it after this first service pack is out, which will be sometime in 
2013. So I think we've got another year of conversion to Windows 7 ahead 
of
 
us. As you remember, it is still 
--
 
we're not even halfway through the XP 
and Windows 95 conversion to Win7 right now. So I think that will continue 
over the course of next year. People will buy machines that are, of course, 
Win8 ready in their buying pat
terns as they 
--
 
in enterprise next year. In 
terms of Ultrabook and Win 8, I just 
--
 
that really is a function of the health 
of the consumer market a year from now. And you've seen the same GDP 
forecast I have. I think it's too early to call that. I will p
oint out that we have 
been pleasantly 
--
 
we've enjoyed good unit growth and good revenue growth 
the last couple of years in the middle of difficult economic times. And that 
really speaks to the nature of what our products do for people and 
businesses. They
're tools of productivity. So even in bad times, we've done 
pretty well. So even if you have 
--
 
if you project another year of difficult GDP 
environment in the mature markets, I would think we could do equally as 
well, as we have the last couple of years h
ere.
 
Ross Seymore

Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division
 
And I guess then for my follow
-
up, changing gears completely, on the Atom 
side of things, down a bunch in this last quarter. How much of that is still 
Netbooks? And where should we think about that At
om revenue bottoming, 
and then how should we think about it going up as the embedded side of 
Atom starts to gain even further revenue traction versus the design win 
traction you've talked about before?
 
Stacy J. Smith
 
Yes, the quarter
-
on
-
quarter change is a
lmost all Netbooks. Actually it is, the 
downward change is all Netbooks. In terms of your question about 
embedded, like others that play in the industrial and automotive segment of 
that market, we saw weak results in the third quarter. It's pretty clear th
ere 
was an inventory overhang out there that people had to work through. When 
I dig in, in the Embedded business, the data we showed you in May, where 
we're looking at the design wins that we're engaged in, the design wins that 
have been won, the architect
ural conversions, if anything, it looks like we're 
accelerating in terms of conversions coming to us from MIPS or ARM to 
Atom. And so I think the long
-
term pieces of growth in that business is still 
intact.

December 16. Additionally, certain of our smaller business outlook items, the 
forecast for amortization of acquisition
-
related intangibles, 
impact of equity 
investments, interest and other and tax rate will be pulled from guidance at 
the close of business, October 25, and not subject to update by the company 
after that time. Our Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call is scheduled for

1/30/17,Intel,"Good day, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the Q1 2011 Intel 
Corporation's Earnings Conference Call. My name is Chastity, and I will be 
your coordinator for today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this 
conference is being recorded for replay 
purposes. I would now like to turn 
the presentation over to your host for today's call, Mr. Kevin Sellers, VP of 
Investor Relations. Please proceed, sir.
 
R. Sellers
 
Thank you, Chastity, and welcome, everyone, to Intel's First Quarter 2011 
Earnings 
Conference Call. By now, you should have received a copy of our 
earning release and the CFO commentary that goes along with that. If 
you've not received both documents, they're currently available on our 
Investor website, intc.com.
 
I'm joined today by Paul
 
Otellini, our President and CEO; and Stacy Smith, 
our Chief Financial Officer. We'll follow our normal practice by hearing brief 
prepared remarks from both Paul and Stacy, after which we'll be happy to 
take questions. By way of announcement, Intel will be
 
hosting our Annual 
Investor Day at our headquarters here in Santa Clara on Tuesday, May 17, 
2011, and we look forward to seeing many of you there.
 
Before we begin, let me remind everyone that today's discussion contains 
forward
-
looking statements based on
 
the environment as we currently see it 
and as such, does include risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our press 
release for more information on the specific risk factors that could cause 
actual results to differ materially.
 
Also if during this call we
 
use any non
-
GAAP financial measures or 
references, we will be posting the appropriate GAAP financial reconciliations 
to our website, intc.com.
 
So with that, let me now hand it over to Paul.
 
Paul Otellini
 
Thanks, Kevin. I am very pleased to report another 
record revenue quarter 
for the company. As anticipated, consumer demand in the U.S. and Western 
Europe was soft, but consumer sales and emerging markets, and demand for 
both enterprise servers and clients were better than expected.
 
The combination of a fea
ture
-
led product segmentation strategy and a 
simplified branding structure has been very effective in improving the 
purchasing process for buyers, and leading us to achieve our best product 
mix in many years. Additionally, the rapid recovery from Cougar Po
int 
chipset issues earlier in the quarter enabled a much faster ramp of Sandy 
Bridge products than we anticipated in January.
 
With regards to the tragic events in Japan, I want to first comment that all 
of our employees and their families are safe, for whi
ch we are very grateful. 
We did sustain some damage to our sales and marketing offices in Japan, 
but nothing major that would hinder our ability to service our customers. 
Our team on the ground is actively participating in relief efforts and we are 
deployi
ng our technology to help connect families that have been dislocated 
by the earthquake and tsunami.
 
As for our business, I want to note that we did not see any unusual changes 
or fluctuations to our backlog after the earthquake, nor do we anticipate any 
ma
jor disruptions to our supply lines moving forward.
 
Aggregate inventory levels of the PC supply chain remained healthy and well 
within normal operating ranges as we enter Q2. In Q1, our customers 
replenished approximately half of the inventory that was dep
leted in Q4 
primarily with new Sandy Bridge
-
based products. Compared to the first 
quarter of last year, which was a very good quarter for us, we achieved 
double
-
digit growth across every major product segment, and across every 
region in the world.
 
Revenue 
for the Data Center business was up 32% from a year ago, with 
operating profit improving nearly 50%. Our other businesses also showed 
solid growth. The Embedded business was up 33%, NAND flash was up 17%. 
And I'm pleased to note that 1 of our new business 
areas, the Digital Home 
Group, grew 129% from last year and is now shipping at a rate of over 
10,000 units per day into set
-
top boxes and smart TVs.
 
Our PC Client business remains strong and grew 17% from last year. What 
we are witnessing is an explosion o
f computing devices that connect to the 
Internet, and Intel is a big part of this trend. We not only participate through 
selling our products into these device categories, but we also profit from the 
wide array of products that we sell in the build out of 
the data center 
capacity required to serve all of these devices.
 
Turning to the Data Center Group specifically, the first quarter was another 
very strong quarter. DCG recorded Q1 revenue of $2.5 billion, putting us on 
a trajectory to reach $10 billion in r
evenue for this year across our server, 
storage and networking products. The cloud build out continues to be a 
major driver of growth for the company, with demand from China showing 
notable strength this quarter.
 
Within the Data Center Group, the Storage b
usiness increased 45% 
sequentially and was up 65% from a year ago. During the quarter, we 
launched Sandy Bridge Xeon platforms for the single socket market, and 
early demand for this product has been very strong.
 
Looking ahead, we are very bullish about ou
r Data Center business and 
expect it to be a major growth driver for years to come. This past quarter, 
we also launched Sandy Bridge for client PCs. As I stated before, I believe 
that this is the very best product Intel has ever delivered to our customers.
 
Early demand for Sandy Bridge has been outstanding. In fact, the ramp of 
Sandy Bridge in the channel is the fastest ramp we've ever seen, and sell 
through has been robust. The reviews of Sandy Bridge have been 
outstanding and we expect the ramp to continu
e on a very sharp growth 
trajectory.
 
We also launched Oak Trail just last week, which is a platform designed 
specifically for tablets. We are seeing very good design momentum with Oak 
Trail across multiple operating systems. Over the course of this year, I
ntel 
will have tablet platforms that run Windows, Android and MeeGo.
 
We remain committed to success in the Smartphone segment, and we're 
actively working with a large number of handset manufacturers and carriers 
around the world on met field
-
based designs.
 
Overall, we begin 2011 with great momentum. We've added McAfee and the 
Wireless Division of Infineon to our portfolio, and have ambitious plans for 
both acquisitions going forward. We are investing and developing new 
products for phones and tablets, and a
re turning our advantages in Moore's 
Law and computer technology into breakthrough products for these 
segments. All of our major product segments are growing, and these new 
segments are expected to add to that growth momentum.
 
We remain on track to begin p
roduction on our 22
-
nanometer silicon process 
technology by the end of this year. This revolutionary technology will further 
distance Intel from the competition across all segments of computing.
 
Let me make 2 final comments about demand and CapEx. Like man
y of you, 
I noted that some of the third
-
party research firms issued reduced forecasts 
for PCs in 2011. I want to be clear that our views differ from some of theirs. 
The PC business has evolved into a global industry that is approaching 400 
million units t
his year.
 
While some channels like PCs sold through consumer retail outlets and 
mature markets have deep visibility, other channels, especially in emerging 
markets, are not well reflected in the forecast of third
-
party firms until 
shipments from Intel and 
its competitors have been reconciled.
 
Over the last 5 years, we have put considerable effort into improving our 
visibility with systems like just
-
in
-
time inventory hubs for our major 
customers, as well as realtime metrics to monitor sales through all of ou
r 
worldwide channels. As a result, we were able to call the inflection in our 
business in Q1 of '09, as well as predicting 2010 growth to within 1 point of 
accuracy.
 
Our projections for PC segment growth in 2011 remain in the low double
-
digit range based o
n early sell
-
through strength we are seeing as we begin 
2011 and the great reception to Sandy Bridge in both Consumer and 
Enterprise segments. And while it's too early to call 2012 with an improving 
global economy, we see no reason for growth to be materia
lly different from 
what we see in 2011.
 
Secondly, we are increasing our forecast for CapEx spending this year. This 
reflects the widening of our process technology lead and the incremental 
opportunity that advantage will provide our business. The increased
 
CapEx is 
focused on both 22
-
 
and 14
-
nanometer capabilities.
 
As we tailor our product plans to meet the needs of emerging notebook, 
tablet and phone usages, we see a need for more platform features to be 
integrated into the microprocessor, taking 
advantage of our leading edge 
silicon capability for power management, performance and smaller, lighter 
devices.
 
These are high ROI investments and will be the foundation for significant 
growth opportunities ahead. With that, let me turn the call over to S
tacy.
 
Stacy Smith
 
Thanks, Paul. The first quarter of 2011 had several significant milestones. It 
was a record quarter in terms of revenue and earnings per share. We closed 
both the McAfee and Infineon Wireless Division acquisitions. Our customers 
launched 
our Sandy Bridge platforms, our fastest ramping product in the 
company's history.
 
In addition, the company identified, fixed and recovered from the Cougar 
Point chipset design issue, completely mitigating the $300 million revenue 
impact that was originally
 
forecasted. The factory network executed 
flawlessly, lowering throughput times and significantly increasing first 
quarter output of Cougar Point replacement parts, fully recovering to 
customer demand by the end of the quarter.
 
As a result of the acquisiti
ons of McAfee and the Infineon Wireless Division, 
we will be providing non
-
GAAP financial information in addition to GAAP for 
2011 to provide additional visibility into the operational results of the 
company.
 
Excluding the impacts of deferred revenue write
-
down and associated costs, 
amortization of acquisition
-
related intangibles and other acquisition
-
related 
accounting impacts, we achieved first quarter revenue of $12.9 billion, gross 
margin of 62% and earnings per share of $0.59. The rest of my comments 
w
ill use GAAP financials unless otherwise called out.
 
The first quarter ended up significantly better than our expectations. From a 
market standpoint, strength in emerging markets and enterprise offset the 
weakness that we expected and saw in the mature mar
ket Consumer 
segment. We continue to benefit from the strength of our product lineup 
across servers and clients. The introduction of Sandy Bridge extended our 
leadership and resulted in an increase in average selling prices.
 
The third quarter of last year 
was the first time where our revenue exceeded 
$11 billion. Revenue for the first quarter of 2011 was $12.8 billion, up $1.4 
billion from the fourth quarter, and up 25% year
-
on
-
year. The acquisitions of 
McAfee and the Infineon Wireless Division contributed 
approximately $500 
million of the $2.5 billion increase from a year ago.
 
Gross margin of $7.9 billion in the first quarter was a record, and the gross 
margin percentage was 61%. While gross margin benefited from higher 
average selling prices when compared 
to the fourth quarter, 22
-
nanometer 
start
-
up costs, higher unit costs, and the impact of the acquisitions brought 
gross margin down 3 points from the fourth quarter.
 
The Cougar Point impact to gross margin was approximately 3 points, 
consistent with the im
pact to the fourth quarter. R&D and MG&A, as a 
percent of revenue, dropped to 28.7%. Our plan for 2011 is to sustain the 
progress we've made in our productivity and our efficiency, while making 
some critical R&D investments in the core business and adjacen
cies such as 
tablets and phones, and software capability and in process technology.
 
Operating profit of $4.2 billion in the first quarter was up 21% year
-
on
-
year. 
Net income of $3.2 billion and earnings per share of $0.56 were up 29% and 
30%, respectively,
 
when compared to a year ago. Our philosophy of both 
investing in our business and returning cash to our shareholders was evident 
in the first quarter as we completed the acquisitions of McAfee and the 
Infineon Wireless Division, increased our capital spen
ding, completed a $4 
billion buyback and increased our dividend per share by 15%. The cash 
generation of our business remains strong with cash flow from operations of 
$4 billion in the first quarter.
 
As we look forward to the second quarter of 2011, we are
 
forecasting the 
midpoint of the revenue range at $12.8 billion, flat to the first quarter and in 
line with historical seasonality. We are forecasting the midpoint of the gross 
margin range to be flat to the first quarter at 61%. The first quarter was a 
gr
eat start to 2011 and puts us on track to exceed our financial goals for the 
year. Seasonal growth from the first quarter puts us on the path towards 
another year of double
-
digit unit growth, and revenue growth in excess of 
20% after the 24% growth we saw 
last year.
 
We are making some critical investments in our business, both in terms of 
research and development and in taking advantage of our process 
technology leadership. The cash generation of our business remains strong 
and the first quarter results put
 
us on track to another year of double
-
digit 
earnings growth.
 
With that, let me turn it back over to Kevin.
 
R. Sellers
 
Okay. Thanks both Stacy and Paul. We'll now move to Q&A. [Operator 
Instructions] So Chastity, please go ahead and introduce our first 
que
stioner.
 
Question
-
and
-
Answer Session
 
Operator
 
[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Glen Yeung 
with Citi.
 
Glen Yeung 
-
 
Citigroup Inc
 
First question is maybe just helping us understand the emerging markets for 
Intel, how big it i
s? And maybe, Paul, some of the characteristics of that 
market that are different and are sustaining the growth that we're not 
seeing elsewhere.
 
Stacy Smith
 
Yes, actually, let me take a shot, and just give you a 
--
 
I think we've talked 
about this before, G
len. This is Stacy. The emerging markets now are well 
over 50% of our total business level. And I think the dynamic that's going on 
there is really one of economics. The desirability of technology is high and 
the affordability of technology is now coming i
nto the range where when we 
look across markets like China, Latin America, Eastern Europe, you've got a 
couple of billion consumers that now the price point of a PC is within 1 to 2 
months of income and it's really driving our growth, and penetration rates
 
are still pretty low. So we think this is something that has legs and will drive 
our growth into the future.
 
Paul Otellini
 
And in terms of characteristics, Glen, I just point out that my comment on 
the channel strength for Sandy Bridge is principally emer
ging markets. Most 
--
 
something like 1/3 of all the PCs sold in emerging markets are not 
branded machines, their white boxes built by the channel through our 
distribution network worldwide. We saw strength on Sandy Bridge and even 
strengthened the Desktop 
business, which we haven't seen for some time 
based upon that product in those markets. And of course, those markets are 
still surging in terms of purchasing notebooks. It's not a low
-
end mix, I'd 
also add. It's a pretty average mix of products on a worldw
ide basis.
 
Glen Yeung

Citigroup Inc
 
As a follow
-
up, I wanted to ask something about 22
-
nanometer. Paul, you 
used the word revolutionary and I've heard people at Intel use that before 
with respect to 22. So I'm wondering if you can shed some light on what
 
that exactly that means. And then as part of the response, with $10.2 billion 
in CapEx, which is ostensively almost all geared towards 22
-
nanometer, is it 
really Intel putting their money where their revolutionary mouth is? Or is it 
really the money becau
se you're trying to manage the absolute amount of 
capacity that you have?
 
Stacy Smith
 
This is Stacy. I'll start with the second part of that, and then turn it back 
over to Paul. The CapEx number for us is really driven by a couple of things. 
It's driven by the unit growth and the mix that we're seeing and it protects 
our ability to meet dem
and at 22 and 14 nanometer. You didn't say 14 
nanometer, but that's an important part of this story. And it enables our 
strategy to integrate more features and functionality on to that leading
-
edge 
process technology, which as Paul said in his prepared rem
arks it gives us 
performance, cost and power efficiency advantages. Let me give you an 
example. Probably the biggest single chunk that's happening inside of this 
increase in CapEx is the fact that we've made the decision that for the 
development fab for 14
 
nanometer, we're going to make that fab bigger. 
That gives us the ability to actually, at the early stage of the ramp, move 
more products to 14 nanometer, take advantage of that process technology 
leadership, ramp it faster. So we're going to spend some c
onstruction dollars 
today to have that capability in place of 14 nanometer. But over the 14
-
nanometer life, it should save us money by going faster on that first factory. 
So those are the kinds of things that we're doing to both protect the ability 
to resp
ond to demand, and also make sure that we have the transistors 
available on the leading edge to give us the competitive advantage in the 
marketplace.
 
Paul Otellini
 
On the revolutionary comment, you're right. You picked that up, Glen. I 
actually thought I w

embargo [indiscernible] a few times already. Well, it's not inaccurate, but 
I'm afraid it's only meant to be a teaser today. We'll be disclosing that 
technology in early May before the Analyst Meeti
ng. We're having a separate 
press event around that. And I think when you hear that announcement, 
you'll understand why this phrase is appropriate.
 
Paul Otellini
 
Look forward to it. Thanks.
 
Operator
 
Our next question comes from the line of Tim Luke with Ba
rclays Capital.
 
Timothy Luke 
-
 
Barclays Capital
 
I was wondering, Stacy, if you might have been able to just give us some 
sense of how you're thinking about the shape of the year for the acquisitions 
in terms of I think you said you outlined that you expect
 
McAfee and IFX to 
double sequentially, but how would we think about seasonality there? And I 
was wondering on a broader level, how we should think about any of the 
seasonal trends for the second half of the year given all the different puts 
and takes on d
ata center and emerging market growth?
 
Stacy Smith
 
Sure. I'll be happy to do that. And by the way I understand this is your last 
call, so I think as a thank you for your years of following us, we'll let you ask 
a multipart question. We'll give you extra ti
me to do that.
 
Paul Otellini
 
We were a little disappointed. We thought you'll give us a 7
-
parter, Tim.
 
Stacy Smith
 
You can think of another part to this, if you want. In terms of McAfee and 
Infineon, we closed Infineon at the end of January. We closed McAf
ee at the 
end of February. The combination of those 2 acquisitions added $0.5 billion 
of revenue to Q1. And based on having a full quarter in Q2, they should add 
another $0.5 billion in Q2. In terms 
--
 
so now let me help you a little bit with 
Q2 map, becau
se you've got a couple of offsets. You got this incremental 
$0.5 billion for McAfee and Infineon. It's offset by the fact that we don't 
have the 14th week, those are roughly in line with each other. And so when 
you net those out, what you see is Q2's kind 
of flat on an ongoing business 
basis to Q1, which is in line with seasonal patterns we've seen over the last 
5 years. Going into the second half of the year, I'm not going to get as 
discrete as providing a forecast for each quarter, but we're not seeing 
an
ything that would cause it to be a different year. We see through all kinds 
of economic climates. The second half of the year tends to be 2 to 3 points 
higher than the first half in terms of revenue. That's consistent with our 
expectations as we work throu
gh the year.

Maybe just as a follow

up then, given the focus of investors on the tablet 
and smartphone side, you've obviously mean making some changes in your 
team associated with smartphones, there's a lot of product ramp i
n tablets. 
What do we see as the key milestones, for example, with respect to 
Computex, et cetera for these 2 areas?
 
Paul Otellini
 
Well, you'll see quite a bit of tablet demonstration to Computex. If you 
notice what we did at IDF in Beijing last week, that
 
was 
--
 
there were a lot 
of tablet
-
centric announcements there around MeeGo and Windows and 
Android. And so we're heads down on a number of designs on tablets on all 
3 of those operating systems where we see the Android code, Honeycomb 
version of Android s
ource code from Google, and we're actively doing the 
port on that and expect to be able to ramp those machines over the course 
of this year for a number of customers. In terms of phones, obviously, we 
lost Nokia, which took a lot of wind out of the sales f
or phones this year. 
We've redirected those resources onto a number of other major accounts, 
focusing on carriers who want their own devices and also on handset 
manufacturers. They're all based on Medfield, which is, I think, still the first 
32
-
nanometer p
hone apps processor in the industry. And quite frankly, the 
limit in terms of them getting to market is going to be the interoperability 
testing of the networks at this point in time. So I think I would be very 
disappointed if you didn't see Intel

based ph
ones for sale 12 months from

Off the total PC market. Because the PC data from first quarter...

They're all over the map. Right now, Gartner's at 11% for

I think, is at 6% or 7%. And I gave you our number, which is the low

up, please. The follow

up would be 
on the met field, Paul, what are some of the key metrics that are w
orking

that are getting the engagements with the key customers? Is it a 
combination of met field being on MeeGo as they open

source? Or as where 
people can differentiate? Or is it just the fact that you have been able to 
bring down Medfield performance 
down to the competitive arm architecture?

It's both. It's both. Early customer activity is on Android and on MeeGo. And 
we've got ports on both those operating systems. The product is very good 
in terms of performance, particularly in the are
a for media, so high depth

Paul, let me just begin a little bit on the Data Center Group. You called out 
storage of $0.45 sequentially. Can you talk about what's going on within the 
other subsegments of DCG, like IP 
--
 
for the IP Data 
Centers, Enterprise, 
Network and Service? So if you can, just tell us what's going on there. And 
we've seen this group grow significantly, faster than one would think servers 
are growing in terms of units. Can you talk about the trends of 
multiprocessor se
rvers as kind of what may be driving these ASPs, just so 
that we can get a comfort as to what the longer
-
term growth would be?
 
Paul Otellini
 
Sure, sure, Uche. First of all, we recognized this group has had pretty 
phenomenal growth across all of its various
 
product groups. So what we've 
decided to do for the Analyst Meeting is do a deep dive for all of you guys 
and we'll do a full, if you will, keynote session on that, breaking out all the 
detail on how we see the server market, the market for Xeon
-
class dev
ices 
today and tomorrow. But if you look at traditional servers, you're right. 
We're outgrowing the traditional enterprise server market by a factor of 2 or 
3. And as we look forward, by 2014 for example, we think half of the market 
for Xeon is high
-
perfor
mance computing and cloud. That's a dramatic change 
from 80% of the market being enterprise servers just a couple of years ago. 
So when you look at the rate of growth of HPC, of clouds, of the nominal 
growth in servers, and then the conversion of other par
ts of the data center, 
that is networking equipment and storage, from proprietary designs 
principally now to fundamentally Intel
-
based designs, you see an aggregate 
growth rate that is really representative of, I think, all the growth in the 
Internet. And 
all these devices connect to these servers or these network 
machines 1 way or another. And this is where we're benefiting quite well. So 
you see 
--
 
on 1 side you watch the growth of tablets and smartphones. This 
is where the rubber hits the road for those 
devices is in data centers around 
the world.

Thanks for that. Great, thanks for that. Let me just ask you on the Moore's 
Law transition you're making now from 22 to 14. I don't know if I should 
read that as being slightly mo
re aggressive than what we think is a typical 
ratio as you go from 32 to 22 or from 45 to 32. Is there anything that 
--
 
I 
know Glen asked this earlier when you talked about things being 
revolutionary at 22. But what is driving the speed now in terms of mov
ing to 
14? And in terms of what you're able to do at 14 vis
-
a
-
vis say 22 or 32, can 
you give us any idea as to what comes in here? I mean you talked about 
having mixed signals capabilities and all that. Is there anything else you can 
tell us, A as to what'
s driving this speed, and then also what we should 
expect?
 
Stacy Smith
 
This is Stacy. So I'm going to punt on the capability part of that question for 
another few weeks. You'll see that when we do our disclosures around 22 
nanometer and really start to tal
k about some of the secret sauce that's 
going to come out in that technology, so that will carry it forward into 14. In 
terms of the speed, we're still on a 2
-
year cadence. So that hasn't changed. 
That is our Moore's Law cadence, and we're driving that fas
ter than anybody 
else in the industry. So even at that 2
-
year cadence, we're extending our 
leadership over others. What we're realizing, though, is that competitive 
advantage is becoming more and more important to us. And we're getting 
--
 
we've always gott
en paid for it in terms of cost. We're now also getting paid 
for it in terms of differentiating our product line and getting paid in pricing. 
And so at an economical, where you can see it in our results over the last 6 
or 7 quarters, as we have extended ou
r leadership, our products have 
extended over the rest of the industry, we've segmented our product line 
and we're getting paid in a new way for that process technology leadership. 
As we get out to 22 nanometer, as we get out to 14 nanometer, what you're 
g
oing to see is we're going to bring capabilities to the process technology 
more quickly than we have historically. And so we'll intercept 22 nanometer 
with our smartphone roadmap, with our netbook roadmap earlier in the 
technology, we'll ramp our core busi
ness more quickly so we get into these 
kind of square wave transitions. And then get paid for that performance and 
cost by having the leadership over the rest of the industry.

First, can you just talk about where utilization rates are now and where you 
expect them to go in the second half of t
he year? And how much capacity 
you're adding? And could we run into some actual shortages coming up 
here?
 
Stacy Smith
 
Could we run into some shortages? We're running I'd call it in the healthy 
range of utilization. So as we said before, not too hot, not to
o cold. Certainly 
on the chipset side of the business as we had responded to the Cougar Point 
issue, we ramped very quickly there. But I'd say in general, we're not 
anticipating shortages. And I think we have the ability to respond. If demand 
ends up being
 
hotter, we can put the capacity in place. And frankly, if we 
end up in a situation where demand ends up being less, I think you saw in 
2009, we now have the tools to respond very quickly to that kind of 
environment. So I think we can respond to both sides
 
of that equation as we 
get into the second half and into 2012.

Could you give us an idea of what percent of microprocessor sales Sandy 
Bridge made up of in the March quarter, and what this percent might be in 
the June quarter?
 
Paul Otellini
 
I don't think we want to 
get into that level of granularity, David. I can tell 
you that unit shipments on Sandy Bridge will more than double from Q1 to 
Q2. And it is our fastest ramp ever for new processor family. And you'll see 
it move from the high
-
end throughout, sprinkling dow
n through all of our 
products families over the course of the year. It's a very, very rapid ramp.
 
Stacy Smith
 
And just to give you 1 other tidbit to give you a flavor, more than 50% of 
my CPU inventory now is Sandy Bridge. So you can 
--
 
that kind of gives 
you 
a sense of how fast we're replacing the older generation products with Sandy 
Bridge. And gives you a good indication of what things will look like over the 
next couple of quarters.
 
David Wong 
-
 
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC
 
And for my follow
-
up. Stacy, i
n your online comments, CFO comments, you 
have for your gross margin puts and takes, a hit of 1 percentage point from 
higher platform unit costs and another 0.5% from lower ASPs for the second 
quarter. Does Sandy Bridge have a higher platform cost and a lo
wer ASP? Or 
is there something else happening here on top of the ramp of Sandy Bridge?
 
Stacy Smith
 
No, it's something else. So as you do the walk from Q1 to Q2, I'll just take 
you through the full walk. So obviously, we got 3 points of benefit because 
we d
on't repeat the Cougar Point impact that's in Q1. We see about 1.5, 
then it offsets that because it will be the peak quarter in terms of our startup 
cost. If you think about the trends we've shown you over the years, Q2 is 
where 
--
 
Q2 of an odd
-
number of y
ears is where those startup costs will 
peak and then they come down. There's about a point as you pointed out in 
unit costs. There's really 2 things driving that. 1 is that we're seeing a little 
bit of an increase in some of our component costs, so think o
f substrates 
made in Japan where our supply lines got a little bit tight. So we're seeing a 
little bit of a pricing impact on those kinds of things. And then we're also 
again as a result of what happened with Cougar Point, we pulled in the ramp 
of our Chin
a factory pretty significantly. And so what you see is more 
chipsets coming out of a new factory that's ramping, and that's driving my 
weighted average cost up a little bit in Q2. And in the ASP pieces, and I 
realize I have a little bit of a credibility is
sue on forecasting ASP right now 
given it was up again in Q1, but we had a very rich mix in Q1. As Paul 
pointed out, the way Sandy Bridge ramped was at the higher parts of the 
pricing stack first. Over the course of Q2, we'll see Sandy Bridge flavors 
acros
s a much more representative series of price points. And I'd expect the 
Q2 mix to come down a bit and be more in line with what we would normally 
expect. It's not huge, it's 0.5 point of gross margin. But it does come down a 
little bit.

Paul, on the corporate side
, obviously, demand has been very strong. Just 
wondering what's driving that. Is it just the Windows 7 upgrade cycle? And if

Paul Otellini
 
I assume you mean corporate PCs, Srini. We're seeing 
--
 
obviously on the 
corporate side, we're seeing good growth in the data center. Yes, on the 
--
 
we saw, I think I said that sort of mid
-
last year, we started seeing the 
enterprise market start to recover from the recession timeframe. And the 
most recent data 
we have is that something like 75% of enterprise PCs are 
still running Win XP. And so if you think about a 3 to 4 year refresh cycle, 
we're probably not even halfway through that cycle yet. And I think that the 
adoption of Win7 seems to be pretty strong an
d the combination of the Win7 
SKUs with Sandy Bridge as we look forward into Q2 and Q3 look really good 
from our customers' perspective.

Stacy, on the start buybacks, looks like you were pretty

Stacy Smith
 
Well, we've articulated the priorities in terms of how we 
--
 
our cash priorities 
as first investing in our business. Second, the dividends. Third, using the 
buyback to return cash to shareholders and bring down the cash levels. I 
think you see that we've 
been very aggressive in terms of all of those in Q1. 
You do have to keep in mind we have brought down the cash balances quite 
a bit. But you could temper that by pointing to the fact that in the first 
quarter, we announced that the board authorized an incr
emental $10 billion 
of buyback and we're kind of just at the beginning of that authorization.

Our next question comes from the lin
e of Jim Covello with Goldman Sachs.
 
James Covello 
-
 
Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
 
I'm sorry to come back to this, but if I think about this third
-
party data 
situation that we're talking about, even if I assume a 5% ASP increase for 
the quarter, you guys would 
have out
-
shipped PC clients by 20% relative to 
the third
-
party data. So the idea that the third
-
party data is kind of off by 
20% and if that's the case, we haven't seen that kind of discrepancy up until 
now between your data and the third
-
party data. So wh
at's making that data 
more wrong this quarter than previous quarters?
 
Stacy Smith
 
I think what that analysis misses, Jim, is how much inventory levels came 
down in the fourth quarter. If you remember in the fourth quarter, we were 
significantly worse than 
seasonal, and what we saw in the fourth quarter 
was a significant bleeding off of inventory, some of which we believe was in 
anticipation of us bringing out Sandy Bridge. And so component inventories 
came down, you saw a little bit of a refill of those com
ponent inventories in 
the first quarter. So the amount that it came down, probably half of that 
went back in, which would be us being above seasonal. When we go out and 
do our looks across the channel, we see inventory levels being healthy. And 
I think it 
really points to the robustness of the supply chain. The people who 
make motherboards for notebooks brought their builds down. We saw some 
older generation inventory bleed up. It looks like they're starting to ramp up 
now they get into the back
-
to
-
school s
eason.
 
James Covello 
-
 
Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
 
I guess if I could just ask my follow
-
up on that then, that's a little bit 
different than the idea that just the third party data's wrong. Is it that the 
third
-
party data is just really off and that's why the
 
third
-
party data is so 
different from your shipments? Or is it that the supply chain drew down a 
whole bunch of stuff and it kind of rebuilt it during the quarter, which is 
pretty reasonable?
 
Paul Otellini
 
Well, let me back up, Jim. The comments that I ma
de relative to third
-
party 
data and ours were on an annual basis, looking at year
-
over
-
year, trying to 
set the granularity for the year. And I didn't comment on the specific 
comments that were written up recently on Q1, it was x% down from Q4, 
x% down year
-
on
-
year. Because that looks at consumption, and what Stacy 
was talking about is our billings. And there is a bit of a difference there, at 
least in the ramp up for Sandy Bridge. So really, it's apples and oranges. 
And I think what our experience is that o
n an annual basis, the numbers are 
closer. Our numbers are closer than theirs together. It's closer together. And 
that they correct over the course of the year to be aligned. You saw that 
happen last year as we were predicting 17%, 18% all year long, the 
n
umbers were all much lower than that. Then they came back in line as we 
got to the fourth quarter.
 
Stacy Smith
 
Jim, I left out 1 piece as you think about Q1. So what Paul said is exactly 
right. When I talk about Q1 and we're talking about the supply line i
mpact, 
you also can't lose sight of the fact that for us, Q1 was a 14
-
week quarter. 
That's a piece of our shipment numbers relative to what you may be seeing 
from other data sources.

Our next question comes from the line of Avik

Avik Bhattacharyya
 
Paul, a question on the Server and the Data Center business, obviously, very 
strong this quarter. Can you give us a sense of the mix between MP and DP 
servers? How is the transition progress towards We
stmere
-
X, and just in 
general, what's your assessment of the competition?
 
Paul Otellini
 
After we'd launched the new MP server chips, the mix came up a little bit. 
We're seeing a pretty robust growth in BP as well. A lot of the Internet data 
center growth i
s BP machines in some of those configurations. On the other 
hand, some of our largest IDC customers are using the biggest, beefiest 
parts we have. So it really is different. I haven't seen this ship dramatically 
in the last couple of years. There's just a 
nice consistent mix of DP versus 
MP. But the capability of all the devices really is stunning. The amount of 
compute power that we're delivering per core now is really what is delivering 
a lot of the value in a very power
-
efficient envelope. So the ROI on 
upgrading from old to new servers is really what is compelling both for 
enterprise and data center 
--
 
enterprise and Internet Data Center.
 
R. Sellers
 
Avik, this is Kevin. I would add because we made this public, too. What we 
have seen across UP, DP and MP 
has been a mix shift within those 
categories, so sort of Paul's point. That has been 1 of the drivers of the 
revenue growth is because the ROI is so good, we're finding the Data Center 
group 
--
 
or sorry the Data Center providers, what they're doing is they
're 
buying up in that stack for the ROI. So that's been a big driver. To the 
higher bin split.
 
Stacy Smith
 
A good example of that was this quarter we brought out UP versions of 
Sandy Bridge and that caused a pop up in that segment of our business.
 
Avik Bha
ttacharyya
 
And as a follow
-
up, I think it's obvious that 
--
 
1 investor question has been 
when will we start to see Intel make more tangible progress on the mobile 
side? And the question there is that first, when will we start to see that 
progress? What kin
d of metric should we track? And conceptually, what do 
you think will be x 86, the architectures differentiation versus the 
established on ecosystem, a lot of very strong players like QUALCOMM, DI, 
NVIDIA and others?
 
Paul Otellini
 
Well, I'm not going to gi
ve you more granularity on Mobile than I gave 
already in the earlier answer, Avik, so sorry to disappoint you there. Watch 
those things as they come out. Our customers will announce the design wins 
when they are through their interoperability testing or en
tering it when it 
becomes visible. And I don't want to add more to that. In terms of x86 
versus ARM, it is not just about the core as much as we would like it to be, 
and I guess as much as the ARM guys would like it to be. It's about the core, 
the overall 
capability of the system on Chip, the things you put around it, 
the graphics, the com subsystems, the media processing subsystems and 
the overall power envelope relative to the performance that you can deliver 
of the SoC. So the Intel advantage that we see
 
going forward is the 
combination of very robust computer architecture that can scale, the ability 
to bring on very high performance graphics and media processing, and now 
a wide array of comps architectures that we can bring in, and taking 
advantage of th
e world's best silicon. When you add those together, I think 
it gives us a very strong value proposition in this market. I'd also point out 
that all of the major operating systems in phones and smartphones are 
written at a high
-
level such as they're cross
-
platform and portable. And so it 
is easier for people to move from ARM to Intel or ARM to ARM than it has 
been in the past in the Windows.

Paul Otellini
 
I think it's a little 
bit of everything, plus you mentioned Win7 saturation for 
consumers, the tablet things and macroeconomics. I think it's a little bit of 
each of those, John. But I'll add 1 more, which I think is a big one. 
Remember in 2009 in the first half of '10, during 
the depths of the recession, 
the consumer notebook market worldwide, particularly in the U.S. and 
Western Europe, was very strong and it was strong contrary to GDP at the 
time. Remember GDP was going south and consumer sales were going 
north. And I think w
hat happened is that people bought a lot of machines in 
that timeframe and we're still just early in the cycle. So those machines are 
1.5 years old or less. And so seeing a consumer refresh right now probably 
isn't, on average, what you're going to see in 
mature markets. Because this 
is not like emerging markets where people are buying their first machine. 
This is a mature environment where people are buying a new machine when 
they decide that they need to upgrade or whatever. Now clearly some tablet 
cannib
alization is impacting that, but I think the bigger 1 is that 
macroeconomics and the prior cycle.

And, Paul, as my follow
-
up. Talking about the enterprise client market, that's 
been a relatively strong market. If you had to 
characterize what inning you 
thought we were in for the enterprise upgrade, what would you say it? And I 
guess at what point do we have to start worrying about that refresh being 
done?

Our next question comes from Shawn Webster with Macquarie.
 
Shawn Webster

Macquarie Research
 
In terms
 
of the Client business, I was wondering if you could give us a flavor 
of what your units did sequentially parsing out between desktop and 
notebook growth sequentially. And what your outlook is for Q2?
 
Stacy Smith
 
Certainly not at the level of granularity 
you're asking the question, but I can 
give you a sense. From the standpoint of client shipments, you'd say slightly 
above seasonal, once you net out the 14th week. And again, it comes back 
to my answer to Jim Covello's question, which is what we saw was an
 
inventory burn in Q4, and a partial refilling in Q1. And that led to units being 
slightly above seasonal. Going into Q2, you kind of net out the impact of a 
full quarter of acquisitions with the lack of the 14th week, and you'd say Q2 
looks pretty seasona
l.

And then given the CapEx growth that you're seeing, I was wondering if you 
can give us a sense of what you expect your total wafer production globally 
to grow in calendar '11, calendar '12. Is it consistent with your P
C outlook, 
or is it something that's different from that?
 
Stacy Smith
 
Wafers, over time, in generation will grow a little bit faster than the TAM 
because of the phenomena where I said we're moving more capabilities to 
end. And so 
--
 
and then I think your f
ollow
-
up question to that should be, 
""So okay, what happens if we get that wrong?"" If we're wrong on the 
demand, how do we respond to the market? And I point back to what 
--
 
the 
capability we have to very quickly roll forward capacity from 1 generation to 
the next. And I think you saw that from us in 2009 when the bottom fell out 
of the market, we were able to bring our CapEx number way down, offset 
over half of the 32
-
nanometer investment by repurposing equipment we'd 
already purchased for 45 nanometer. So
 
if we overestimate, we can respond 
within a couple of quarters and get gross margins back up into the healthy 
range pretty quickly. The flipside is if we underestimate, it takes us 2 years 
to recover. And that's a devastating financial impact on us. So we
 
look at 
this as being a pretty 
--
 
it's a high ROI investment for us, and we have the 
tools to modulate it, if it comes to that.

Our next question comes from the line of Craig Ellis with Carris and 
Com
pany.

Caris & Company
 
Paul, are you expecting any change in the developed country PC outlook in 
the low double
-
digit PC growth that you have for this year or next?
 
Paul Otellini
 
In the developed 
--
 
in the mature markets?
 
Craig Ellis 
-
 
Caris & Company
 
Yes.
 
Paul Otellini
 
I don't think it has to happen. Our forecast that we're building the year 
around assumes that we have a seasonal year from the point we're out in 
Q1. So it doesn't assume that there's a big change at this point in time. 
C
ould we handle 1 on the upside? Absolutely. But we don't need this 
--
 
we 
aren't building that into our numbers.
 
Craig Ellis 
-
 
Caris & Company
 
Okay, that's helpful. And then the follow
-
up. In the past, you've sometimes 
quantified the number of tablet design
 
wins that the company has. Can you 
be specific in that regard? And related to that, is there a particular OS flavor, 
whether it's MeeGo, Android, or Windows, where you think you'll be 
particularly successful, at least with your initial wave of launches?
 
P
aul Otellini
 
I don't have an update, simply because I didn't hear the final number from 
IDF, and we'll do another number count at Computex. Actually, we'll do 
another number count on May 17 for the Analyst Meeting 
--
 
it's 35 or so. It's 
in that range, it h
asn't changed. My sense is the bulk of the unit, the SKUs 
this year will be Android.

And our final question comes from the line of Sumit Dhanda with Citadel 
Securities.

First question, Stacy. Your comment on the unit cost in Q2 going up because 
of substrates and the pull
-
in in the ramp of the China factory. Is that 
transient relative to the chart you put up at your Analyst Day? Where you 
exp
ecting a bump down initially in Q2, and then a bigger bump down in Q3? 
How does that chart change?
 
Stacy Smith
 
Q2 is clearly elevated from what I put up in the Analyst Day, and then you'll 
see a pretty rapid decline back towards trend over Q3 and Q4. And y
ou can 
kind of see that, I mean if you look at just gross margin trend, we're 61 61. 
This is on a GAAP basis. The annual number is 63. And so that would 
suggest that the second half is back up towards the mid
-
60s, 65%. And you 
got a couple of tailwinds the
re, 1 is the abatement of startup cost. We start 
on the trend where they start falling off stream in Q3, and our costs get a 
little bit better as we go into the second half of this year consistent with 
what I showed at the Investor Meeting.
 
Sumit Dhanda 
-
 
Citadel Securities, LLC
 
And then my follow
-
up question was in startup costs. So it was a 1.5 impact 
in Q1, and then a similar impact in Q2. I guess my question is, is the impact 
a little similar in Q2 because it was lower in Q1? Because again, I think the 
profile was up in Q1 and Q2 per your initial expectations, but I thought that 
the increase into Q2 was going to be more modest relative to Q1, if my facts 
in the Analyst Day chart are correct.
 
Stacy Smith
 
Yes, I'm trying to triangulate it in my head. It ha
sn't changed for the year. 
When I started the year, I was expecting to be about 3 points. It's still about 
3 points on the year. So yes, I think what you're seeing is it was a little less 
in Q1, a little more in Q2. And then it starts coming down. You can 
see it's 
down 1.5 by the time we get to Q2. A little higher in Q1, and yes, so what 
you said was correct.

Thank you, Jamie and 

conference call. By now you should have received a copy of our earnings 
release and the CFO commentary that goes along with that. If you have not 
received both documents, they are currently available currentl

Investor website, intc.com. I am joined today by Brian Krzanich, our CEO 
and Stacy Smith, our Chief Financial Officer. In a moment, we will hear brief 
remarks from both of them followed by Q&A.
 

discussions contain 
forward

looking statements based on the environment as we currently see it 
and as such, it does include risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our press 
release for more information on the specific risk factors that could cause 
actual
 
results to differ materially. Also if during this call, we use any non

T
hanks Mark. Q4 was a solid finish to a year of transition both for the 
computing market and for Intel. We spent the year of building a foundation 
in important growing segments of computing and as a result we are better 
positioned to enter 2014. Importantly
, the big way of innovation inside the 
company has also improved.
 
I will touch on each of these things, but I would like to start with our results. 

payout. The PC Client Group was down
 
4% for the year, but the business 
began and stabilized and actually grew a bit in the fourth quarter achieving 
all
-
time records of i5 and i7 unit shipments. The desktop business was 
particularly strong in Q4 growing 11% over last year. In the data center,
 
we 
finished the year up 7% with record solar unit and revenue. Cloud was up 
35%. Storage was up 24%. And high performance computing was up 18%. 
Enterprise, however, fell short of our expectations for the fourth quarter and 
the year as we overestimated the
 
rate of recovery among corporate buyers. 
In our other businesses the intelligent systems business we saw a growth of 
21% in retail up 16% and transportation up 21% in the year. Networking 
grew 31% for the year and rounding out the list, our NAND and 
(indi
scernible) businesses grew 15% and 4% respectively both achieving 
record revenue.
 
When I spoke with you in November I shared my vision. If a device 
computes it does it with Intel from the internet of things to the data center. 
I outlined the areas that are
 
changing to make that vision a reality. Among 
the changes was a shift towards a more outside in view of our industry and 
an intense focus on bringing innovation to market quickly. Last week at CES 
there was evidence of our progress as we demonstrated tech
nologies that 
were on our road map just six months ago. Technologies that we expect will 
be available this year. We showed you Edison, an Intel based platform for 
internet of things in the form of an SD card. We unveiled several innovative 
wearable solutio
n and we announced Intel device for technology to hardened 
IA based Android (indiscernible).
 
Our disclosure in November of a new smartphone and tablet road map that 
will include SoFIA our first IA SSD with integrated comps later this year is 
further eviden

faster pace. Looking ahead 2014 will be an exciting year as we build further 
on this new foundation. We have established a goal to grow our tablet 
volumes to more than 40 million units. Within an e
mphasis on the value 


 
We also exit the year having made important strides on our 14
-
nanometer 
process technology. Yields improved si
gnificant in Q4 putting it squarely on 
track with the Broadwell production later this quarter. Our customers and 
partners also continue to evolve the computing exercise. By the time we 
enter the back to school selling season we have nearly 70 unique 2
-
in
-
1
 
designs with outstanding battery life and performance across a range of 
price points in those markets. And later this quarter we will launch Ivy 
Bridge
-
EX which will bring the largest generation to generation improvement 
in MT Server performance in 2010. 
Our work to improve our velocity and 
position the company for the future is containing isn't done. But our recent 

those aspects to bear. We are building on a foundation upon which we w
ill 

than we have been last year.
 
With that let me turn the call over to Stacy Smith.
 
Stacy Smith
 
Thanks Brian. The fourth quarter came in consistent with expectations with 
the ret
urns of financial growth and was a solid ending to a challenging year. 
For the fourth quarter revenue came in at $13.8 billion up 3% from a year 
ago. PC Client Group revenue was flat from year ago. Our data center group 
grew 8% from the year ago and relati
ve to our expectations at the beginning 
of the quarter we saw higher PC Client Group revenue partially offset by 
lower growth than our data center group. Gross margin of 62% was flat till 
third quarter and one point above our guidance.
 
Operating income for
 
the fourth quarter was $3.5 billion up 12% from a year 
ago. Earnings per share was $0.51 up 6% from the year ago. For full year 
2013 revenue was $52.7 billion, gross margin was 60%, operating income 
was $12.3 billion, net income was $9.6 billion and earni
ngs per share was 
$1.89. Well the PC market was down on the year, we saw the market 
stabilize in the back half of the year with fourth quarter PC units up from a 
year ago. Additionally we saw strong tablet growth in the back half of the 
year and inclusive 
of PC and tablets are unit growth in the fourth quarter 
was up almost 10% from a year ago. We decreased inventory levels by 
almost $400 million in the fourth quarter and across the worldwide supply 
chain, inventory levels continue to be whole.
 
Gross margin
 
of approximately 60% in 2013 is down two points from 2012 
driven by higher 14
-
nanometer factory startup cost. Spending and R&D and 
MG&A was $18.7 billion in 2013, 35% to revenues down from the forecasted 
at the beginning of the year at higher than our lon
g term model. Operating 
income was $12.3 billion down 16% year
-
over
-
year.
 
Earnings per share was $1.89 down 11% from a year ago. The business 
continued to generate significant cash with almost $21 billion of cash from 
operations in 2013. Total cash balance
 
at the end of the year was roughly 
$20 billion, up approximately $2 billion from a year ago. We purchased $11 
billion in capital assets, paid $4.5 billion in dividends and repurchased over 
$2 billion of stock.
 
As we look forward to the first quarter of 20
14, we are forecasting the 
midpoint of the revenue range at $12.8 billion, down 7% from the fourth 
quarter. This forecast is in line with the average seasonal decline for the first 
quarter. We are forecasting the midpoint of the gross margin range for the 
first quarter to be 59%. The 3 point decline from the fourth quarter is 
primarily driven by higher platform write
-
offs as we started pre
-
production 
builds of Broadwell and 14
-
nanometer and overall lower platform volumes in 
line with seasonal trends.
 
Turnin
g to 2014, we are planning for revenues to be approximately flat. We 
expect the Data Center Group revenue to be up in the low double
-
digits and 
PC Client Group revenue to be down in the mid
-
single
-
digits. We are 
forecasting the midpoint of our gross margin
 
range at 60% flat to 2013. We 
expect startup cost to decline partially offset by the impact of tablets as we 
ramp our volume and provide contra revenue support to our customers. And 
we are forecasting spending for the year at $18.6 billion and expect capi
tal 
spending of $11 billion both of which are approximately flat to 2013. Within 
the flat spending, we are advancing the strategy of the company by shifting 
investments towards the data center, tablets and low
-
power SoCs.
 
The fourth quarter was a solid fin
ish to a challenging year. Financially, the 
fourth quarter of 2013 was better than the fourth quarter of 2012. More 
importantly, we are making changes that continue to improve our 
competitive position. For devices that compute, our vision is if it computes
, it 
does the best with Intel. Towards that end, we are well on our way to 
reinventing the personal computer. With all
-
in
-
ones, 2
-
in
-
1s, convertibles 
and detachables, the amount of innovation in the PC market is 
unprecedented. Building on this leadership, 
we will start production of wafers 
on Broadwell, a 14
-
nanometer product targeting these form factors in the 
first quarter. In the tablet market, we launched the Bay Trail SoC and have 
started to expand our footprint and market signature in this growing mar
ket. 
And in the internet of things market, we are bringing new architectures like 
internet of thing to build on our current leadership position. We are uniquely 
situated to benefit from the other end of the compute continuum as the 
infrastructure that supp
orts all these devices expands.
 
Our data center business continues to see robust growth as a result of the 
build out of the cloud and the exposure of devices that compute and connect 
to the internet. From 2013, we extended our leadership at the high end of
 
the data center with the launch of the Ivy Bridge
-
based Xeon product line. 
And at the low end of the data center, we extended our leadership with the 
launch of Avoton targeting the micro
-
server market. We are planning to 
build on the foundation as we laun
ched the Haswell
-
based Xeon family in 
2014. At the foundation of this innovation, we continue to enhance more 

performance and lowest power transistors and will result in a growi
ng cost 
advantage over time.
 
With that, let me turn it back over to Mark.
 
Mark Henninger
 
Alright. Thank you, Brian and Stacy. As we move on to the Q&A, as is our 
normal practice, we would ask each participant to ask one question and just 
one follow
-
up if y
ou have one. Jamie, please go ahead and introduce our 
first questioner.
 
Question
-
and
-
Answer Session
 
Operator
 
(Operator Instructions) The first question comes from Mark Lipacis from 
Jefferies.
 
Mark Lipacis

Jefferies
 
Thanks for taking my question. At 
the Analyst Day, you addressed your view 
on transistor density and your expectation for leadership on that vector, but 
I have to say this discussing that idea with investors is a consensus view 
that seems to be that Intel has an inherent wafer cost disadva
ntage that 
relative to TSSC that neutralizes or more than neutralizes your transistor 
density advantage and the argument is that TSSC ships more wafers and 
therefore has more better purchasing power than you and its lower labor 
cost, so net
-
net, they have 
just a big huge advantage of wafer cost that you 
should have a hard to, too hard of a time to overcome. So my question is do 

the wafer cost and how you think you can compare? An
y kind of help that 
you give us on the cost dimension would be extremely helpful. Thank you.
 
Brian Krzanich
 
You know I think the first thing to remember is that what really counts in all 
of this is transistor cost and what we really talk about in our Moore

Curves and when we talk about transistor density is driving a consistent cost 

going to comment on you know (indiscernible) wafer cost versus our wafer 
cost but we feel
 
confident that our relative level of scaling and our internal 
wafer cost are such that we believe we have a leadership position in 
transistor cost.

earable or internet of things or high

node and so 
the more cost effective those transistors are whether it's 500 million or 3 

and why we focus on transistor cost. So I think we stand by our what we 
said at the inve
stor meeting.
 
Mark Lipacis

Jefferies
 
Thank you and if I could have a follow
-
up, there has been some news report 


 
Brian Krzanich
 
Sur
e I will start and then Stacy can talk to you about the financial discussion 
of it. You know you start these construction projects, we talked about in the 
past, yes it starts three years roughly in advance. They are very complex, 
some of the most complex i
f not the most complex construction projects you 

ready for operation. We started this one about three years ago, if you go 
back and look three years ago our view of the PC Industry and
 
PC growth it 
was you know much more robust than what has played out and is our 
forecast today and so what we have done as we have brought it online as we 
have been very conservative with our how we manage the project, we 
brought it up and so the shell is 
complete and facilitating from a construction 
standpoint and we have held back putting equipment in and so we see the 


ears. You 

have done with Fab 42 as well. We have held it back until the demand 
requirement comes about.
 
Stacy Smith
 

nancial 
impact of this is actually pretty minimal. As Brian said we have built a shell 

use it to the economic cost is just time value of the money which is pretty 
modest cost and th
is is pretty normal for us since, we actually always want 
to have some preposition space to grow into as the market grows. As Brian 
said it's three years to construct one of these things so it's economically 
quite detrimental to get cut short and the cost 
of having all those extra 

margin.
 
Operator
 
The next question comes from Ross Seymore from Deutsche Bank.
 
Ross Seymore 
-
 
Deutsche Bank
 
I guess the first one is on DCG. Can you give us 
a little more color what 
happened in the fourth quarter especially given the confidence that you had 
as recently as November and the growth there and also what gives you 
confidence given the fourth quarter miss in forecasting still a low digit 
growth in 20
14?
 
Stacy Smith
 
So if you look at the trends in the fourth quarter I think the trends actually 
reinforce the growth rate among cloud, high performance computing, 
networking storage they all came in consistent with what we thought Brian 
went through a lot o
n the year
-
over
-
year growth rates there so very robust 
growth rate. So it actually increased our confidence in that. What we saw 
very specific to the enterprise was we did return to growth, it was a little bit 
less growth than what we had thought as we ent
ered the quarter. As we 
kind of step back and look at what happened there, we think there is two 
elements that hit us. One was we had a pretty robust growth rate in Q3. As 
we entered Q4, we saw that we had there is more inventory out in the world 
than we k
new when we started the quarter so that had to be burned off. And 
then secondly, we saw a tapering off in order patterns across certain 
customers in certain segments at the end of the quarter and we think that, 
that was driven by the government shutdown an
d the uncertainty around 

pretty clearly in those segments. We had a range around growth rates for 
2014 in the investor meeting with 10% to 15% based on a slower growth in 
enterprise
 
in Q4 and maybe a slower recovery in enterprise over the course 
of 2014, I would say we are now at the lower end of that range. So we are 
more at the 10% range than the 15% part of that range.
 
Ross Seymore 
-
 
Deutsche Bank
 
Great. And I guess as my follow
-
o
n switching gears a little bit to the OpEx 
side, you guided sequentially flat, but it looks like if you just hold R&D as 
part of that sequentially flat, for the full year, it seems to imply that R&D as 
a singular expense will be coming down as the year pro
gresses, is that math 

 
Brian Krzanich
 
Yes, that math is correct. So I think Q1 will be the high point in terms of 
quarterly spending, it will come down quarter by quarter. We will be bringin
g 
employment down over the course of the year. And beyond that, as we 
talked about at the investor meeting, we are going to be making some 
significant new investments and things like the data center tablets, low 
power SoCs those kinds of things. So even be
yond the headline number, 
there was going to be kind of a significant shift in investments over the 

just shifting on projects than bringing down employment over the course of 
2014.
 
Ross Seymore

Deutsche Bank
 
Okay, thank you.
 
Brian Krzanich
 
Thanks Ross.

Your next question comes from Glen Yeung from Citi.
 
Glen Yeung 
-
 
Citi
 
Alright, thanks. Brian or Stacy either one, to what extent could you be 
misreading the 
enterprise server market in the sense that the virtualization 

enterprise server with the economy that one might normally see?
 
Brian Krzanich
 
Okay. I think we would say there is some impact.
 
To answer, we are 
showing a kind of long
-

was three years ago. I think as you said there was some impact associated 

that
 
we think that there is growth in the enterprise segment. We have just 
changed our view for 2014. We think the recovery just plays out a bit slower 
than we would have thought a quarter ago.
 
Glen Yeung 
-
 
Citi
 
Okay. And then kind of similar question on the P
C side, to what extent do 
you think that the strength you are seeing, relative strength you are seeing 
in PCs today, is it a function of the software transition at Microsoft and does 
it therefore end in April or do you think this is a more sustainable reco
very?
 
Brian Krzanich
 
So as we said in our script that what drove a lot of it was desktop and we 
are seeing the mature markets enterprise is the strongest with the emerging 
markets still flat to slightly down. So our view that if you look out from a PC 
pers
pective was that we forecast with a relatively cautious and careful view 
looking out. We compared against the third parties. We think we are in line 
with what third
-
parties have forecasted as well. Some of the contributions of 
fourth quarter was the XP tra
nsition, which is really what you are talking 


 
lot of 
the growth came from desktop, but the desktop was largely enterprise in the 
mature markets. That really we think has to do with a l
ot of great form 
factors that are coming in the all
-
in
-

in there. We saw some of the highest units of i5 and i7 in the enthusiast 
area. I think those are some great gamming platforms. So we think there is 
a lot more 
to the desktop growth. We also introduced the Haswell
-
based 
NUC, which is a smallest form factor desktop machine that you can have. So 

and more than the software transition.

understan
d. See you just basically took your data center guidance down for 





you take the full year revenue guidance down?
 
Stacy Smith
 

approximately fl

a little bit up, a little bit down. If you think about the data center being $10 

range that we put out here you changed
 
the full year on a $50 billion plus 
business by a few $100 million.
 
Stacy Rasgon

Sanford C. Bernstein & Co
 
So is the bias like more to a little bit down versus a little bit up at least more 
than it was in November?
 
Stacy Smith
 

 
assuming a level of precision that I think isn't 

the next 12 months. Yeah we had a positive data point on PCs, we had a 
little bit of a negative data point on one element of the en
terprise, our tablet 
momentum looks good, so you just kind of look at it and I would say our 
view is pretty consistent with what it was back in November.

The next question comes from Christopher Danely from JPMorgan.
 
Christopher Danely 

 
JPMorgan
 
My first question is on gross margin so you gave us the Q1 and the full year 
guidance, can you just talk about how things are supposed to trend after Q1 
and then maybe also talk about some of the levers on gross margins up or 
down?
 
Stacy Smith
 
Well I will 
anchor it on Q1 and then give you a sense of how I see it pulling 
out over the course of the year since we provided specific guidance for Q1. 
We have guided Q1 at 59% coming down from Q4 it was 62% in Q4 so down 
to 59. The elements that bring us down we ha
ve about a 1.5 down 
associated with the start of production on Broadwell prior to it's qualification 

reserved out and so we have reached the formal qualification day. And then 

bout a point down in Q1 as a result of it just being like seasonally 
lower quarter and so yeah I think you kind of understand and expect both of 
those, 60% for the year or so, algebra would say an improving gross margin 
over the course of the year. I think
 
when we get into the back half of the 
year we have a gross margin back into the low 60s. But I think about the 
headwinds and tailwinds to that you know the tailwinds are that we expect 
that we will see a falling off 14
-
nanometer startup cost. We talked ab
out 

would expect from us. We see volume and unit cost getting better over the 
course of the year and reserve will get a bit better as we progress through 
the year. Again we have these
 
Broadwell reserve in the first quarter.
 

of contra revenue dollars for tablets. We also talked about it in some depth 

 
the first quarter, 
they really build over the course of the year so we have the positives that I 
outlined and then you will see that offset as a result of you know there is 

we take 
our tablets product volume kind of broadly through the different 
OSs and price points.
 
Christopher Danely 

 
JPMorgan
 
Great and for my follow
-
up I guess it's kind of on that question. So on the 

to be a 1.5 



commitment is i

the year?
 
Brian Krzanich
 
Sure. This isn't a price reduction as normal price reduction would be; it's not 
where you are just simply reducing. It's truly a BOM cost equalizer and 
remember a 

Bay Trail was originally designed for Avoton
-
based PC segments and the 

delta relative to the, what the mid and lower e
nd tablets require. And so 
those are things like Bay Trail may require more layers of a printed circuit 
board for the board itself, more components on the board and tighter power 
management controls and things like that. We have a whole program to 
reduce t
hose throughout the year. So that gives us confidence that as we go 


to happen, but I am confident it will

And so the spending on that contra would be reduced equivalently.
 
Stacy Smith
 
And I would just add as Brian said we are doing a lot of enabling across the 
industry to take the BOM cast out in equivalent. These a
re costs at the 
system level not at our chip level and it will vary a lot by SKU, but to give 
you a sense for a Bay Trail platform from the beginning of the year to the 
end of the year we think that, that BOM penalty drops by more than half. 
And so it kind
 
of gets better out in time. And then when we get to the 

 
Brian Krzanich
 
Yes, both Broxton and SoFIA are just specifically designed to eliminate that 
delta.

Hi good afternoon. If we look at tablets and smartphone, what type of units

gross margin from is 10 points higher utilization rates and excluding the 

 
Brian Krzanich
 
You were asking tablets and phones?
 
Tristan Gerra 
-
 
Baird
 
Yes. So just l
ooking at the 40 million units target for this year, what type of 
volume do you need to get in order for gross margin to start appreciating 
from the west of the business if you exclude the contra revenue impact?
 
Brian Krzanich
 

, I will bridge back to our strategy here. Our 
strategy is that we are going to use our process technology leads. We will 
have leadership products that also are competitive or maybe even leadership 
in terms of cost and I showed some data at the investor me
eting that just 
kind of showed the die size as we progress from Bay Trail to Broxton to 
SoFIA and so you can get a sense of the kinds of cost structure that we are 

basis. Yes, I can


 
I am not envisioning if this causes the gross margin 
percentage to go up, but you can definitely get to a space once we get 
through these contra enabling dollars where every unit we sell is accretive 

factories that we have in 

standpoint.
 
Tristan Gerra

Okay. And then a quick follow up, you talked about enterprise desktop being 
strong, any color that you can provide in n

right in line with expectation and whether was it more driven by consumer 
or enterprise?
 
Brian Krzanich
 

on the notebook side result, 
overall PC units a little bit higher and that was 
really desktop and that was as Brian said broad
-
based across desktops. So 
all

in

on the desktop side.

The next question comes from John Pitzer from Credit Suisse.
 
John Pitzer

Credit Suisse
 
Yes, good afternoon guys. Congratulations on solid result. Brian, I guess my 
first question relative to the seasonal guide for the March 
quarter, is there 
any sort of granularity you can give us between sort of the PC Group, the 
Data Center Group and kind of other IA and I guess the reason why I am 
asking the question is I get in the absence of knowing just guiding the 
seasonal makes sense,
 
but you do have Bay Trail Android tablets in Q1 that 

the PC Group, you obviously have a lot better availability of kind of the 
SKUs, I think people like in Q1 versus Q4, both of 
which would kind of argue 
for better seasonality. So maybe you can give us a little granularity that will 
be helpful?
 
Brian Krzanich
 
Sure. Let me try and if you can add some of the financial detail. Part of it is, 

 
on Q4 right? So a stronger Q4. So 


lot of the 2
-
in
-
1s come in but also Q1 is just you know there i
s not a lot of 
events that happen that can drive upsides like holidays and things like that. 
Now in one of your comments you said we will start seeing Bay Trail Android 
tablets. Most of the Bay Trail Android tablets really start showing up more in 
Q2 than 

an original program for Bay Trail was all Windows. As we came into the 
midpoint of the year we sandbox [ph] shift and make it Windows and 
Android and so you know our OEM partners as well are 
targeting more 
towards Q2 and it's just when you do you go and start putting back in that 
back to school event which is a next seasonal place where upside usually 
occur.
 
Stacy Smith
 
The only thing I would add to that, sorry, I guess I would say I certainly
 

in the world to respond to that. So that is a being good answer. The thing 
you might want to keep in mind is you work through seasonality over the 
course of the year as that th

to the customers for a tablet enabling, that will come off of revenue so it's a 
gross margin hit but it will also be a decrement to revenue while we support 
them. So it's not so much a key to issue but to get
 
into the back half it's 
going to be one of the minuses out there.

November you talked about your expectation for enterprise kind of being I 
believe a 7% o

question around virtualization you answered that. I guess my question is 
have you taken into account sort of cloud and enterprise is kind of offloading 
infrastructure into the cloud. I know at the Analy
st Day we talked about two 
thirds of cloud growth being consumer and not business if you start to lose 
dollars in enterprise to cloud is it kind of a one to one loss if you lose in 
enterprise, you will just make it up in cloud or how do I think about that 
dynamic?
 
Stacy Smith
 


of the phenomenon that we have seen is that we have seen the mix in the 
cloud actu
ally moving up so if you look at the ASP impact inside of servers 
John, it's more driven by cloud than anything else right now and so they are 

pretty close if you start to see an offlo
ad that way and utilization rates inside 
the enterprise tend to be pretty high on the kinds of things that they move

Is there any evidence within your build and your ODM build into the server

growing very well. Lot of the clo
ud growth is driven out of Asia. You know 
we absolutely see Asia as a growth area for the data center in general.

Asia is just that the tablet penetration rate incre

Thanks for taking my question. So first on the smartphone or on tablet 
space, I think it is true that Intel has a manufacturing lead, but do you think 

progressed faster than the A
SP declines in the space. In other words, do you 
think Intel can be sustainably profitable in the mobile space which is 
maturing?
 
Brian Krzanich
 
Yes, we absolutely do. You saw at the investor meeting products like SoFIA, 
which really are going to be put on
 
to 14
-
nanometer are fully integrated all 
the way through with the 3G option or an LTE option and that LTE is with 
carrier aggregation. Those kinds of products we believe are very, very cost 
competitive in fact leading from a cost position. In addition, we
 

lot about, but we are already in that low cost Asia market. We are inch and 

innovations coming out of for some of these cost reductions on tablets and 
where we are gettin
g the cost reduction ideas. So we are in that market 
now. We sold out of that Shenzhen low cost market in Q4. We will continue 
though it 

 
through 2014 and with products like SoFIA on leading edge 
technology, we are very comfortable that we can get into th
ose very low 
price points.

Thanks Brian. And as for my follow

up, there seems to be these ways to 
provide 64

bit capability and application processor, then I think you guys 
have always had 64

bit support with that and like in f
act all your products. 
So the question is what do you think is a value proposition of 64
-
bit and how 
can you leverage your 64
-
bit capabilities to win market share a little bit?
 
Brian Krzanich
 
Sure, you are right. All of our products have always been 64
-
bit
 
including 
Atom. And so OEMs who build with our products now can already go out and 
start to utilize 64
-
bit. We are out there working with the OSs, all of the OSs 
and the OEMs to go enable that. The real usages and the values are going to 
be in those high 
compute areas, things like video, things like media, transfer 
media manipulation. All the classic things around computing that you saw 
drive the compute cycles on PC and people are doing more and more with 
tablets and phones or that will be the same things
 
that drive 64
-
bit 
utilization on these mobile devices. I think you will also see it in insecurity. 
All of those things are going to drive a desire for 64

bit.

Mike McConnell

Pacific Crest
 
Thanks. I wanted to ask about again going back to enterprise and DCG, 
since you said that some of the fall
-
off late in the quarter was due to some 
of the government issues shutdown and debt ceiling, etc
etera and now that 
the debt deal has been reached, have you gotten any feedback from some of 
these enterprise customers that they are feeling more comfortable now with 
respect to re
-
spend?
 
Stacy Smith
 
We will watch it over the first quarter. I think the he
adline here is that the 
first half of the year we saw an enterprise market that was declining and we 
got into the back half of the year, it was growing. It was just growing a little 
less fast than we thought and the recovery was a little less fast than we 
thought. My expectation is we will see that segment kind of pop back to the 
normal rate. I would also think that we were just a bit ahead of ourselves in 
terms of how fast the enterprise market was going to recover and grow. So 
we have a little bit more of
 
a cautious view of that as we progressed through 


probably just a little overheated in Q4.
 
Mike McConnell

Pac
ific Crest
 
I understand. And then my follow
-
up would be just, Stacy, can you remind 
us about linearity in DCG, I guess, would we have to wait till the second half 

growth in the fir
st half of the year? Thanks.
 
Stacy Smith
 
No. I think you will see, I think you will see year
-
on
-
year growth. I mean 
remember DCG is, the order pattern particularly with some of these big 
cloud customers can be very lumpy but when you step back and look it 
on a 
year
-
on
-
year basis I think we will see year
-
on
-
year growth rates. It's kind of 
progressed through the year.
 
Mike McConnell

Stacy Smith
 
Sequentially it will be more based on kind of abnormal season
ality but again 
for DCG you might be (indiscernible) sense it's always year

year growth 
rates tends to be more meaningful indicator.

heard a lot of data on year
-
on

year growth rates across cloud, networking, 
high

piece it was grow
th, it was just the lower level of growth than we thought. 
So it's pretty, if you go back to the investor meeting stuff and then take 
what Brian showed you what you will see is for all those other segments was 
very consistent with how we modeled it. Enterp
rise growth a little bit less

corporate refresh but obviously some of it was. Is there any chance that you 
know enterprise just had a fixed budget and some more of it went to the 
corporate refresh in
 
the fourth quarter and so you know they had a little bit 
less to spend on the data center and you know that could account for some 
of the delta there?
 
Brian Krzanich
 

heard from the OE
Ms and the customers is more around like Stacy said a 
little bit of inventory coming into Q3 and in the Q4 and then the government 
shutdown and if you looked at the order pattern it will kind of follow that 
from what we can tell on the, from our position a
s well.
 
Stacy Smith
 
And I would just add to that as Brian said earlier we have had record 
shipments in the desktop on the core i7, we know that SKU is not an 

was consumer was stron
g, all

in

uggest that was

up on the tablet, could you give

Jim Covello

Goldman Sachs
 
No sure, maybe just percentag
es or something.
 
Brian Krzanich
 
But I would say the majority of the projects that we have in 2014 use some 
level of contra revenue to bring their BOMs, their Bill of Materials or actually 

 
parity 
and so it's really is very SKU by SKU dependent. It's not a fixed number out 

going to work this out over the next year or so. We work with each OEM 
depending on what you know ar
e they try getting a high end SKU or 
midrange SKU or low level SKU? What type of display and graphics and all of 
those things they want to put in that system. We have a delta involved that 

literally 
at that level, SKU by SKU.

7/21/16,Intel,"Good day, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the Quarter 4 2011 Intel 
Corporation Earnings Conference Call. My name is Misty, and I will be your 
coordinator for today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference 
is being recorded for replay 
purposes. I would now like to turn the 
presentation over to your host for today's call, Mark Henninger, Director of 
Investor Relations. Please proceed, sir.
 
Mark Henninger
 
Thank you, Misty, and welcome, everyone to Intel's Fourth Quarter 2011 
Earnings Conference Call. By now, you should have received a copy of our 
earnings release and the CFO commentary that goes along with that. If 
you've not received both documents, they are currently available on our 
investor website, intc.com.
 
I'm joined to
day by Paul Otellini, our President and CEO; and Stacy Smith, 
our Chief Financial Officer. In a moment, we'll hear a brief remarks from 
both of them followed by Q&A.
 
By way of announcement, we'll be hosting our annual Investor Day at our 
headquarters in Sa
nta Clara on Thursday, May 10, and we look forward to 
seeing many of you there.
 
Before we begin, let me remind everyone that today's discussion contains 
forward
-
looking statements based on the environment as we currently see 
it, and as such, does include r
isks and uncertainties. Please refer to our 
press release for more information on the specific risk factors that could 
cause actual results to differ materially. Also if during this call, we use any 
non
-
GAAP financial measures or references, we will post t
he appropriate 
GAAP financial reconciliations to our website intc.com. So with that, let me 
hand it over to Paul.
 
Paul S. Otellini
 
Thanks, Mark, and good afternoon everyone. 2011 was a year of records, 
milestones and breakthroughs. I want to begin by highl
ighting a few of the 
most significant. We reinvented the transistor with our 3
-
D Tri
-
Gate 
technology. We unveiled a new generation of personal computers, the 
Ultrabook. We closed 2 large acquisitions: McAfee and Infineon Wireless 
Solutions. We broke ground
 
on the world's first 14
-
nanometer fabs, D1X in 
Oregon and Fab 42 in Arizona. And our 2011 revenue and earnings were the 
best in Intel's history.
 
We surpassed $50 billion in revenue for the first time, after crossing $40 
billion for the first time just las
t year. This was our second consecutive year 
of more than 20% revenue growth. Since 2009, we have added $19 billion 
to the top line. The investments we've made to innovate and to expand our 
capabilities are paying off. Let me highlight a few examples.
 
As t
he volume of traffic crossing the Internet continues to explode, this has 
left companies and individuals searching for simple ways to store, manage 
and access this flood of information. This mega trend led to a fantastic year 
for our Data Center Group, wit
h revenue up 17% on record microprocessor 
units, exceeding $10 billion for the first time. But this wasn't just servers. 
Storage revenue was up 42% to a new record high, and our Embedded 
Communications Infrastructure business was up 18%, also to a new reco
rd 
high.
 
Volume shipments of our Sandy Bridge server product, code
-
named Romley, 
have begun. We also demonstrated Knights Corner, the first single
-
chip 
coprocessor capable of delivering a teraflop of computing power.
 
Turning now to our PC business. We saw 
record notebook microprocessor 
units in 2011, as the PC Client Group grew 17%, fueled by demand in the 
enterprise and emerging markets, and PC users' appetites for higher 
performance and more energy
-
efficient computing. The result was a second 
consecutive 
year of rising ASPs, as our mix of core CPUs increased to nearly 
70%. Sandy Bridge microprocessors accounted for approximately 40% of 
the company's total revenue.
 
Emerging markets now account for 2 out of every 3 incremental units of PC 
demand, a shift tha
t's rewarding Intel and the PC companies that have a 
long
-
standing, deep presence in these markets.
 
Looking back at the last 12 months of reported data, emerging markets like 
India and Indonesia grew 22% and 37%, respectively. China, now the 
largest PC mar
ket in the world, represents 20% of all PC demand, and grew 
a remarkable 15%. Even with that, China has a household penetration rate 
of just 35%, versus almost 90% in the U.S. China is the world's largest 
market for mobile phones with more than 950 million
 
subscribers. It's also at 
the forefront of the smartphone boom and will be the home of the world's 
first 32
-
nanometer smartphone.
 
Last week at CES, Lenovo announced the K800 smartphone based on our 
Medfield SoC. The K800 will be available on the China Uni
com network in 
Q2, and will showcase Intel architecture in a phone with very competitive 
battery life and outstanding performance.
 
2011 was also a year in which we completed several important acquisitions. 
In the first quarter, we completed the purchase of
 
McAfee and Intel Mobile 
Communications, formerly the Infineon Wireless division. Together, McAfee 
and IMC added $3.6 billion in revenue and new strategic capabilities in 
security and connectivity that will allow us to extend our strategies across 
the cont
inuum of computing. McAfee has already announced the Deep Safe 
platform, around which we are building a family of products to take 
advantage of the combination of McAfee software and Intel silicon to deliver 
first
-
of
-
its
-
kind protection against day 0 threa
ts.
 
Lastly, in the fourth quarter, we announced the acquisition of Telmap, whose 
location
-
based search and navigation expertise will allow us to add 
differentiated services to Intel architecture
-
based devices from Ultrabooks to 
smartphones. As many of you 
know, we made several important 
announcements at CES last week. In addition to the Lenovo K800, we 
announced the Medfield
-
based smartphone reference design that boasts a 
sleek form factor, 8 hours of talk time, 6 hours of 1080p video playback and 
14 days o
f standby power, clearly demonstrating the low
-
power, high
-
performance capabilities of Intel architecture. Yet as the performance of this 
device that really showcases what's possible when you combine advanced 
process technology and the world's most popular
 
computer architecture. 
Though Medfield is our very first smartphone SoC, independent testers 
appointed to benchmarks to place Medfield reference design among the very 
best in the markets.
 
It was this differentiated performance and exceptional roadmap and 
exciting 
new usage models that led to our multiyear, multi
-
device strategic 
relationship with Motorola Mobility. The first of these Intel architecture
-
based devices will go through carrier certification this summer with 
commercial availability shortly ther
eafter. And while the Lenovo and 
Motorola designs are exciting first steps, we're not done making 
announcements in the smartphone space.
 
In the months ahead, we're looking forward to sharing with you a range of 
exciting new products. Let me highlight just 
a few. We'll launch Romley for 
servers in the first quarter. We'll launch Ivy Bridge, our first 22
-
nanometer 
product, in early spring. Ivy Bridge will improve on the graphics performance 
of Sandy Bridge by more than 70%. The industry will bring more than 7
0 
new Ultrabook designs to market this year. And when Windows 8 launches, 
we'll be ready with both PCs and tablets.
 
In summary, 2011 was an outstanding year for Intel. As we look to 2012, 
we're excited about bringing more Intel innovations to the market. W
ith 
that, let me turn the meeting over to Stacy.
 
Stacy J. Smith
 
Thanks, Paul. 2011 was our most profitable year and a year of record 
revenues. Revenue of $54 billion was up over $10 billion or 24% from a year 
ago and was our second year in a row with busin
ess growing greater than 
20%. Our PC Client Group and our Data Center Group both grew at 17% 
year
-
on
-
year. In addition, we closed on the acquisitions of McAfee and the 
Infineon Wireless division in 2011 which contributed $3.6 billion to our 
revenue growth.
 
Gross margin of 62.5% in 2011 was at the high
-
end of our historical range, 
as our investments in industry
-
leading manufacturing process technology 
continued to enable leadership products, which drove a richer mix across 
client and server. Spending, as a p
ercent of revenue, was approximately flat 
at 29.7%. Operating income, net income and earnings per share were all 
records.
 
Non
-
GAAP operating income of $18.4 billion was up 18% year
-
on
-
year, and 
non
-
GAAP earnings per share was up 25% from a year ago.
 
For th
e year, we generated a record $21 billion of cash from operations. We 
invested over $8 billion in research and development, $10.8 billion in capital 
assets, primarily building and equipping leading
-
edge factories; and spent 
$8.7 billion on acquisitions. Ad
ditionally, we paid $4.1 billion in dividends, 
increasing the annualized dividend per share by 33% and increasing our 
dividend payout ratio to 40% of free cash flow. Lastly, we used our stock 
repurchase program to return over $14 billion of cash to shareho
lders in 
2011, reducing diluted shares outstanding from a year ago by roughly 450 
million shares.
 
Total cash investments ended the year at $14.8 billion, down approximately 
$6.7 billion from a year ago. Fourth quarter revenue finished at $13.9 billion, 
up 
$2.4 billion and 21% from the fourth quarter of 2010.
 
As we announced in December, revenue in the fourth quarter was negatively 
impacted by the floods in Thailand and the resulting hard disk drive supply 
shortage. As a result of the hard disk drive shortag
e, we saw a reduction of 
orders for microprocessors as customers reduced inventories across the 
supply chain. Despite this reduction in inventory levels, it is our belief that 
the shortage did not impact the actual sales of personal computers in the 
fourth
 
quarter, with demand trends playing out as expected.
 
Gross margin improved to 64.5% from the third quarter, with lower factory 
start
-
up costs as we qualified for sale our first product on 22
-
nanometer 
process technology and lower unit costs. Non
-
GAAP oper
ating income of 
$4.8 billion was up 20% from a year ago and non
-
GAAP earnings per share 
of $0.68 was up 21% from a year ago.
 
As we look forward to the first quarter of 2012, we are forecasting the 
midpoint of the revenue range at $12.8 billion, down 8% from the fourth 
quarter. This decline is slightly more than the average seasonal decline as 
we expect the shortage of hard disk 
drives to continue to impact our 
business in the first quarter. We are forecasting the midpoint of the gross 
margin range for the first quarter to be down 1.5 points to 63%, but 
manufacturing costs going up as we begin to sell our first 22
-
nanometer 
produc
t, Ivy Bridge, and ship lower volumes, when compared to the fourth 
quarter.
 
Turning to 2012. We are planning on another strong year, with revenue 
growth in the high single
-
digits and gross margin at the high end of our 
historical range, at 64%. Importantly
, we will continue to invest in our 
business in 2012. We are forecasting an increase in capital spending to 
$12.5 billion as we build the world's first high
-
volume manufacturing 
factories for 14
-
nanometer process technology. We are also forecasting an 
incr
ease in investment in research and development of $1.8 billion. We are 
making critical investments in R&D for Ultrabooks, data centers, phones and 
tablets. In addition, we are making R&D investments in core capabilities like 
security, SoCs and extending ou
r process technology leadership.
 
The trends that we discussed in May drove our performance in 2011, and we 
expect will drive our financial performance in 2012. We expect continued 
strength in emerging markets as rising incomes increase the affordability of
 
personal computers. We will continue to benefit from the explosion of 
devices that compute and connect to the Internet as they've drive the build
-
out of the cloud infrastructure and as we expect to generate more sales in 
storage, communications and networ
king products for this segment.
 
Our process technology and manufacturing advantage will continue to 
extend in 2012, enabling a leadership product portfolio, not just in PCs and 
servers, but also in low
-
power products for phones, tablets and embedded 
system
s. With that, let me turn it back over to Mark.
 
Mark Henninger
 
All right. Thank you, Stacy and Paul. We'll now move to Q&A. [Operator 
Instructions] Misty, please go ahead and introduce our first questioner.
 
Question
-
and
-
Answer Session
 
Operator
 
Your first q
uestion comes from the line of Glen Yeung with Citi.
 
Glen Yeung 
-
 
Citigroup Inc, Research Division
 
I guess, the first one is, Stacy, in your forecast for gross margins, I think 
you have 50 basis points in there for higher revenues. And I hear your point 
ab
out higher 
--
 
high single
-
digit revenue growth for the year. What's your 
PC forecast assumption that underlies that?
 
Stacy J. Smith
 
You're talking for the year, Glen? Or are you talking...
 
Glen Yeung 
-
 
Citigroup Inc, Research Division
 
Yes, for 2012.
 
Stacy 
J. Smith
 
For 2012. It will play out, we believe, pretty similar to this year. There'll be 
some unit growth, but I believe we'll also benefit from the fact that we have 
a very strong product portfolio and we'll benefit from a rich mix. You've seen 
that over
 
the last couple of years. And if I can just take a second here, just 
to put the high single
-
digit revenue growth in perspective. If you go back to 
2011 and you strip out the acquisitions and the fact that we had a 53rd 
week, you're left with an underlying
 
growth rate for what I'll call the existing 
core business, of about 15%. You compare that to the high single
-
digit 
forecast for 2012, you see. We do expect it to come down some, that's 
because we expect GDP growth rates to come down a little bit and we do
 
correlate to GDP growth rates. But still, the same kind of drivers in '12 that 
we saw in '11.
 
Glen Yeung 
-
 
Citigroup Inc, Research Division
 
Okay. The other question I have is on unit costs. And again, in your written 
comments, it suggests that they'll be 
up for the quarter end for the year. 
And I wonder if you could just walk us through the puts and takes on unit 
costs in particular. And I guess, I'm kind of wondering if more Ivy Bridge 
ultimately results in reduced unit costs at some point.
 
Stacy J. Smith
 
Yes. The unit cost increase that we're seeing in Q1 and over the course of 
'12 is a normal phenomenon, as we're ramping new factories and new 
process technologies. If you go back 2 years, and you have to offset it for a 
different quarter, but if you go ba
ck and you look at the first 32
-
nanometer 
products, what you see is, as we're just starting to ramp those big factories, 
the first products are coming out, those tend to be pretty expensive 
products, and then the cost kind of comes down over the course of 
the year. 
It's a consistent phenomenon that we've seen before.
 
Operator
 
Your next question comes from the line of Mark Lipacis with Jefferies.
 
Mark Lipacis 
-
 
Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division
 
In thinking about, as you guys get more success in th
e smartphone and 
tablet markets, comparing the strategy there to your PC market 
--
 
PC 
microprocessor market, in PCs, you're up and down the stack, you're 
everywhere. And I'm wondering if that's your intention in the handset and 
tablet market? And whether o
r not that necessarily means that there's a 
different business model for that business versus your core business.
 
Paul S. Otellini
 
Let me take that one, Mark. Our intention is to participate broadly in all 3 of 
those markets. In tablets, I think we'll be a
ble to do that from day one, as 
you see the Android tablets coming out and Windows 8 tablets coming out. 
And you'll see us well
-
positioned in multiple price point on those. And who 
knows where those prices go over time, but our intention would be to use 
th
e advanced silicon integration capability we have to be able to drive the 
build material cost down, integration up in tablet space, which I think is 
going to be a sweet spot for Intel. On phones, our strategy is a little bit 
different. We're coming in at t
he top of the smartphone market. Our value 
proposition initially is aimed at best performance and very competitive 
feature sets and very good battery life. Over 
--
 
and then let me say on the 
other end of the market, the Infineon acquisition has given us a 
very strong 
position in basic phones and feature phones. They shipped 400 million 
modems this year into the cell phone business. So over time, what we'll 
want to do is grow that capability up by integrating the apps processor and 
the comm processors onto t
he same chip, while we drive our initial positions 
in apps processors from the top down.
 
Mark Lipacis 
-
 
Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division
 
And does that mean that 
--
 
are those businesses 
--
 
are they 
--
 
do they 
inherently carry a 
different profitability than your core PC microprocessor 
business? Or is that too early to say?
 
Paul S. Otellini
 
Well, the pattern today of the vendors in that space is that the margin is 
--
 
their margins are lower than ours. Now if you remember, their mar
gins only 
reflect half of the equation. Most of 
--
 
virtually all of them use a foundry. So 
as we enter this business, we intend to get paid twice. We get paid a 
foundry margin while optimizing our product on our silicon, and then the 
architectural margin.
 
Stacy J. Smith
 
If I can just add to that, Mark. As I look out over the next few years, we'll 
have success in these devices. I think they'll start to grow earnings for us 
out in time. It doesn't change my intermediate view of long
-
term gross 
margins. And if
 
we end up in a situation where we're seeing a lot more 
success in those businesses and we're growing earnings but it causes gross 
margins to come down a little bit, that's a trade
-
off that we'll gladly make at 
that time.
 
Mark Lipacis 
-
 
Jefferies & Company
, Inc., Research Division
 
Fair enough, and if I could ask a follow
-
up on the...
 
Mark Henninger
 
Mark, I want to try and make sure we get as many callers as we can, so 
we'll move on.
 
Operator
 
Your next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of 
America 
Merrill Lynch.
 
Vivek Arya 
-
 
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division
 
My first question is on Ultrabooks. So a number of announcements at CES. 
Conceptually, do you expect this to expand the category? Or do you think 
it's just going to cannibalize noteb
ook sales that you might have had 
anyway? How has the feedback been from your early customers?
 
Paul S. Otellini
 
Well, let me just say, I'm not seeing this level of excitement in our customer 
base since, even before Centrino, which is 2003. People are very 
excited 
about the feature set and having the PC reenergized. I think initially, what 
you're going to see is that this will be replacement of existing notebook sales 
and customers and so forth. People will trade up for it. It's a very exciting 
new product. 
As we go through the course of 2012, particularly as 
--
 
and 
into '13, as Windows 8 machines rollout, you have the possibility, and then 
as I look at our design wins, the probability of many of those machines 
incorporating touch. At that point, it's hard to
 
tell what the market impact is 
going to be because the PC now has the characteristics of the best of all 
tablets and very high performance
-
capable machine 
--
 
notebooks. So I don't 
know that we know how that plays out. No one knows how that plays out. 
What
 
I know is that we'll be well positioned for it in any direction.
 
Vivek Arya 
-
 
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division
 
Got it. And one on 
--
 
follow
-
up on CapEx this time. So you obviously decided 
to raise the CapEx for this year. And 
--
 
Intel has always had 
a very strong 
lead versus competitors, 1 or 2
-
year lead. So I'm curious, what are the 
criteria that you use to decide to accelerate CapEx? Like what is the 
incremental benefit that this provides you? And I know that in the past year 
you said that you expec
t to get paid for it, but over what time frame? And 
I'm just curious as to how you make those decisions.
 
Stacy J. Smith
 
Yes, it's a good question. So I just want to come back and clarify something. 
The CapEx that we're spending doesn't increase our cadence
 
of Moore's Law. 
We're still on a 2
-
year cadence, and as we have shown you in investor 
meetings, we would go faster if we could but we don't think the industry can 
keep up with us. Your point, though, is still valid and that based on 
everything we see from
 
other people that are building factories, they're 
struggling to solve some of the same problems that the cadence that we 
solved. So I think our process technology lead is extending. The way we get 
paid for that is simple. We can put more features, more pe
rformance and 
bring power envelopes down faster than the competition can. I think if you 
look historically, we've gotten paid for that by driving cost down at a curve, 
and we're going to still use cost as one of the ways that we get paid here. 
But increasi
ngly, if you look at the last 2
-
plus years, we've also gotten paid 
by bringing out these really capable products and driving a richer mix. And 
that's really been the story over the last couple of years, is by integrating 
the graphics transistors to end 
--
 
to our leading
-
edge process technology, 
we're creating much more capable products, we're putting other features on 
those products, things like WiDi and things that differentiate us from the 
market, and we get paid in a richer mix. And so that's where our s
trategy 
going forward is we'll have cost
-
reduced products, and we'll have then also a 
portfolio of really capable products where we drive a sell up.

Your next question comes from the line of Alex Gauna with JMP Securities.
 
Alex Gauna 
-
 
JMP Securit
ies LLC, Research Division
 
Paul, I know you don't guide by segment, but can you talk about what's in 
the down March quarter? What's happening on the Data Center side of 
things? And what's your sense on how market demand is holding up ahead 
of the Romley re
fresh? When do we really see those numbers coming 
through and how strong will they be?
 
Stacy J. Smith
 
Yes, let me do kind of a higher level of what we're seeing by segment and 

headin
g. If you step back and look at the Data Center Group in 2011, it grew 
revenue 17%. And if you think back to the investor meeting, we told you our 
plan was to grow 15% at the top line and consistent on the bottom line. We 
did that in '11. Based on everythi
ng we see for '12, we have high confidence 
that we can continue to grow at that kind of a rate. We're not going to get 
into a quarter

And let me address the Romley one, in particular, A
lex. We're seeing right 
now, stronger demand for Romley than we did from the Nehalem at the 
same point of its life sort of 2 years ago. The product is in high
-
volume 
production now getting ready for our customers assistance launches later 
this quarter and 
into early Q2. It provides an outstanding value proposition 
and a good ROI for CIOs to evaluate. I think, though, that this is not

initially it will not drive that kind of replacement cycle that we saw for 
Nehalem because it's still relatively new machi
nes. On the other hand, I 
think people will embrace this machine for high

capacity needs. We talked 
earlier about the build

out of Internet data centers, about storage and other 
segments in this type of Data Center and I think this product is probably the 
most well

Bank.
 
Ross Seymore

Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division
 
Paul, congrats on a very strong year. Overall, as we look at the flood impact 
that 
you mentioned in your guidance, how should we think about that 
snapping back and maybe just within your guidance of being up 8% for the 
entire year of high single
-
digits, how should we think about seasonality 
considering the floods snapback, multiple discr
ete items like Ivy Bridge 
coming out, Romley, Windows 8, Ultrabook, et cetera?
 
Paul S. Otellini
 
You're absolutely right. There's probably more moving pieces as I look out 
over the next 11.5 months than I can recall for a long time, Ross. So let me 
start wi
th the flood first. Our view and the view from our customers, and I 
talked to everybody at CES, from OEMs to OEMs, it's very consistent, is that 
the industry seems to be hitting the bottom of their output trough in the 
January, February time frame and then
 
it starts recovering from there. 
Everything we've seen so far suggests that anyone on Earth who wanted to 
buy a PC has been able to buy a PC. There's not 
--
 
there may be some spot 
stockouts of a particular SKU at a particular store, but all of our channel
s are 
still showing pretty good sales outgrowth and that seems a strong indicator 
as we go through this underlying demand. I think that you will see 
--
 
we 
have seen a compression of the supply chain that hit us very dramatically in 
the fourth quarter and w
as the result of the driver for our pre
-
announcement. And it's also the driver, as Stacy said, for our being under 
seasonality in Q1. We think that there's likely to be some refilling of those 
pipes in the second quarter, early third quarter, as the supply
 
lines come 
back in normalcy. On the other hand, it's very possible that people just 
learned to live with leaner inventories, which is always very good for us. As 
a result, we see a more nonlinear, more second half loaded year this year 
than we've seen for
 
quite some time, in terms of CPU shipments, not 
necessarily for a PC shipments.
 
Ross Seymore

Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division
 
Great, and I guess as the one follow
-
up switching to Stacy on the gross 
margin line, ASP has been a lot of a tailwind for yo
ur goodness in the gross 
margin line over the last 2 years. What's the expectation for ASPs in 2012? 
And do they need to rise again for your gross margin guidance
 
of 64% to be attained?
 
Stacy J. Smith
 
I'm predicting growth of ASPs to be what I'll call pret
ty benign in 2012. We 

maintaining that is probably a pretty likely case. And then what we're 
watching is with Ultrabooks, as they ramp into the 
--
 
a much higher 
percentage of the consumer ma
rket in the back half of the year, that could 
give us a little bit of an oomph, but I'm not counting on that 
--
 
my gross 
margin forecast, but it certainly one of the things we'd like to see happen. 
You also have to keep in mind that one of the less bright 
spots for us in 
2011 was that netbooks were way down. And so I'm going to see kind of a 
natural mixing up as I go from '10 to '11 and '11 to '12 with less netbooks 
and a large percentage of the total being Core.

James Covello

Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division
 
I guess my main question is: What is the incremental growth in capacity as 
a result of last year's CapEx and this year's CapEx? And how does that 
capacity ki
nd of layer on over the course of the year? And then the follow
-
up 
part and parcel of that, so that we can just kill everything at once, is what is 
the assumption around factory loadings as that capacity growth ramps over 
the course of the year?
 
Stacy J. S
mith
 
I'll be 
--
 
I have to be a little long
-
winded I think, to get to both of those. So 
first, let's talk about what's driving the capital spending. And I'll be the first 
to admit when I see numbers like the $10.8 billion in 2011 and $12.5 billion 
for 2012,
 
those are big numbers. I have to step back and look at it against 
the context of how much our business has grown. We were up 25% from '09 
to '10, we're up 24% from '10 to '11, so it's more than 50% growth in 2 
years. Put another way, it's almost $20 billi
on of incremental revenue over 
the course of that time period. When you look at that in that context, it 
makes sense. And just to give you one other data point that at least helps 
me be comfortable here, I think my depreciation as a percent of revenue in 
2
012 stays in a healthy range. So I think that gives me some comfort. In 
terms of the makeup of the specific capital in '12, it's more heavily weighted 
than what we've historically seen to building buildings. And Andy told you in 
the investor meeting that w
e've kind a 
--
 
it's a 2
-
year cycle and we're 
building buildings. So we're seeing that it's more than 1/3 of the total capital 
in '12. I think that piece starts to come down in '13. And remember, that 
piece has a much longer useful life which means we depre
ciated over a 
much longer period of time. The equipment piece actually comes down from 
'11 to '12, and that's a little more 
--
 
it's heavily weighted towards 14
-
nanometer equipment that we're putting in place. So that's kind of the 
makeup of the capital. In
 
terms of utilizations, we're running full out today. 
We're just at the beginning edge of 22
-
nanometer. Every unit that we can 
get out there, we can sell. So we're running the new stuff full out. We did 
take a little bit of advantage in Q4 based on the har
d disk drive shortage. 
We took some older generation capacity off
-
line to avoid putting some older 
generation product in inventory and we utilize that equipment, as you've 
seen us do before, to offset 
--
 
to go a little faster on 22
-
nanometer. So 
those are 
responsive things that we do. But I think we're running full out 
today, and I think will be nicely loaded over the course of 2012.

Stacy, can I just start off by asking you about gross margins? Your full year 
gross margin guidance is about 1 point higher than Q1. Is there any way for 
us to think about it typically not in Q4? How that should play out through the 
year?
 
Stacy J. Smith
 
It
's a hard year to talk about normal seasonality. But you should, based on 
what Paul told you in terms of how we're viewing the impact of the hard disk 
drive shortage, it says we have a back
-
end
-
loaded year from a unit 
standpoint that will clearly give us a
 
little bit of a tailwind. You also have to 
remember that those first wafers that come off the line for 22
-
nanometer, 
these are big factories, the very first products are coming off the line now. 
Those tend to be pretty expensive and that cost comes down o
ver the 
course of the year as well. So those are things that give you a tailwind into 
the back half of the year 
--
 
give me tailwind over the back half of the year.
 
Uche X. Orji 
-
 
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division
 
All right. Can I just go back to the q
uestion of channel inventory? I mean, 
you described it as historically lean. And Paul, you said people might just be 
willing to leave with 
--
 
they may choose to leave with these levels of 
inventory. But let's assume that we get to the hard disk drive issue
 
and 
inventory were to go back to normal levels. Where are we now? Can you 
quantify where these historically low levels are? And if we went back to 
normal, how much more weeks of inventory do you think your distributors 
need to carry to sustain what should
 
be a fairly robust second half of the 
year?
 
Paul S. Otellini
 
I think we're talking about less 
--
 
I mean, remember, we ship kind of a 1 
million unit today as an industry. So we're talking about something 

 
a 
correction, that's in the order of a week, 

worth of inventory. And really, as much as that can get compensated for, in 
either direction, by the decisions of OEMs to put things on boats versus 
airplanes. And so I think while there's still a shortage of drives, y
ou're going 
to see more use of planes, shipping things from Asia to the end markets. 
And depending on how things, how fast things recover, you may see people 
go back to boats, which puts a bit more buffer into the system. It's on the 
order of a week, not i
n the order of a month.
 
Stacy J. Smith
 
Yes, and it probably comes down a little bit more 
--
 
and it doesn't probably. 
It almost certainly comes down more in Q1 and our view is in that that's the 
level of inventory that they can live with. They just 
--
 
they 
may not go all 
the way back up to the previews inventory levels. We see that as these 
things play out. And as Paul said, over time, leaner inventory levels in the 
supply chain and then the kind of things we can do to be just in time, they 
actually make the
 
supply chains much more efficient. They benefit our 
business over time.

Your next question comes from the line of John Pitzer with Crédit Suisse.
 
John Pitzer

Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division
 
I guess, Paul, my first question on 
Ultrabooks. Are there any sort of 
milestones that you can share with us as far as percent of notebooks exiting 
the year that you would expect to be on Ultrabook? And I guess, as you 
think about kind of ASP versus unit growth this year for you guys in PCG, 
how important is getting Ultrabook up in the curve as a percentage of 
notebooks to kind of the mix story this year?
 
Paul S. Otellini
 
Well, let me start with the mix and work backwards, John. I said that core is 
approximately 70% of our mix already and I do
n't know that that's going to 
go 90%, and there's no way it's going likely down to 50%. So I think we're 
sort of in 
--
 
it's historically high for our premium brand, but I think we're in 
the sweet spot for what we're going to see, certainly the bulk of 2012
 
because the Ultrabooks are going to be Core
-
centric. And what we can't yet 
predict is the mix between i3, i5 and i7. Right now, the stuff that's sold in 
Christmas and into January were a very good mix of i5s and i7s, but the 
price points were $8.99, $9.99
. As we move towards the second half of the 
year, and price points come down maybe as low as $6.99, the mix may 
come down a bit to i3s. But I still think you're going to see people position 
this as a premium product. Their industry is enjoying a little sel
l
-
up around 
it. In terms of a target, what we said before is that our goal this year will be 
to exit the year at about 40% of consumer notebooks being Ultrabook.

And then guys, as my follow

up, Stacy, just 
a follow
-
up to Uche's question 
on gross margins, the 63% for Q1 versus the 64% for the full year on a high 
9 
--
 
high single
-
digit revenue growth, I would have thought you would have 
seen more margin expansion. Is this conservatism? Or is this kind of the 
p
enalty you're paying as depreciation grows relative to the CapEx spending?
 
Stacy J. Smith
 
I don't think it's either. I don't think I'm being overly conservative, although 
I certainly hope so. And it's not a higher depreciation cost. Again, my 
depreciation 
as a percent of revenue, looks like it stays in a nice, healthy 
range. It's the unit cost penalty associated with the ramping 4 big 22
-
nanometer factories. Again, those are big factories and the first wafers off 
the line are pretty expensive. And so that w
ill cause a little bit of an offset to 
the good news that I expect that we're going to see based on start
-
up costs 
and the higher platform revenue.

Christopher B. Danely 
-
 
JP Mo
rgan Chase & Co, Research Division
 
Just one more question on revenues. So if I try and get to the high single
-
digit revenue growth that you guys have guided for this year, even assuming 
some of that inventory correction comes back into sales, it's still, I
 
think, like 
several billion dollar jump above normal seasonality in the second half. So I 
mean do you 
--
 
how do we get there? Do you guys expect tablets and 
phones? Do you expect further price increases? Can you just maybe take us 
through that?
 
Stacy J. S
mith
 
Yes, I know. So I think if you're pointing to that we have a nonseasonal unit 
forecasting, the answer is yes, for the reasons Paul said. And again, based 
on what we've seen so far, sales of PCs look to be pretty seasonal. We think 
what's going to happ
en is the industry is going have to go through some 
kind of extraordinary measures to make sure PCs are getting to the right 
place to be sold, with very low inventory levels out there, and that pipeline 
starts to refill in Q2 and causes us to have more of 
our units in the back half. 
This isn't predicated on us magically winning half of the phone market. We're 
super excited to get those first products in the market, as Paul said, they 
have critical acclaim, but they don't move the needle from the standpoint 
of 
revenue or profit this the year. This is a year where we're going to get on 
there and fight and win designs.

JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division

up, just on spending, both R&D and CapEx, it is 
going u
p more than sales growth this year. Do you think that formalizes in 
2013, i.e., it comes back in line? Or is this something that we should maybe 
get used to?
 
Stacy J. Smith
 
You're going to ask if Paul and I are going to spend like drunken sailors or

Christopher B. Danely 
-
 
JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division
 
On spending, yes. So spending as a percen
t of revenue will come up in 2012 
and we expect it'll come down over time. If you deconstruct what we're 
doing in 2012, my opinion is we're making some significant but prudent 
incremental investments in some critical areas. We made a lot of progress in 
ter
ms of where we are with Ultrabooks, where we are with phones and 
tablets. We're going to make some investments there. In addition, we're 
making some investments in our Server business. You've seen us moving 
our product line from just focusing on servers to
 
broader products in the 
Data Center that are focused on storage and communications and 
networking. You're going to see us continue to do that. And then underlying 
that, there's some core capabilities for the company around SoC integration, 
communications 
technology, security, process technology. We're going to 
make some investments there. So I think we'll come down from here. But 
this is an investment here for us in some areas where I think we got long

Okay. And as 
follow up, Paul, Android tablets sales seems like they are a 
disappointment last year, relative to what some were thinking at the 
beginning of 2011. And I'm just curious what you think the issue was last 
year and if there's reasons to be more optimistic ab
out tablet sell
-
through 
this year?
 
Paul S. Otellini
 
Well, actually, they were about where I thought they would be, but I was 
well below what many of you had. I think the thing is, tablets are a little bit 
about hardware and an awful lot about software. And
 
I think that until you 
get to Ice Cream Sandwich, the offering isn't as powerful as what's out there 
with Apple. And as the Ice Cream Sandwich tablets start shipping, I think 
you'll start seeing a little bit better receptivity, Google just added the music
 
store, the videos are better, everything got a little bit better bit ICS. And so 
I think the better test is year 2 here, in terms of is there anyone that can 
compete with the iPad? And then the other part of that test, of course, is the 
Windows 8 tablets 
that are being queued up for production. So I don't know 
that the whole tablet thing is settled down by any stretch, and I do have a 
lot of interest in, if you heard me at CES about these hybrid and convertible 
designs as they apply to clamshells, where th
ere's a significant blurring 
between what people do with tablets and what people do with PCs. So the 
jury is out on I think the long

term segmentation by form factor. But I do 
think you'll see more progress on the Android side as a result of ICS.

If I look at the incremental revenues you've guided to at high single

digits in 
your commentary about servers, I guess, made 
double

low single

digit unit growth. It would suggest roughly $1 billion, $1.5 billion 
of incremental revenues from non

BCG, non

walk through what that the key contributors will be to that kind of growth.
 
Stacy J. Smith

terms of what we expect from the standpoint of the different businesses. I'm 
not going to get more granular than that.
 
Christopher J. Muse

Barclays Capital, Resear
ch Division
 
All right. I guess, in terms of Server business, if you could walk through, I 
guess, linearity there. Are you seeing softness in Q1, given the Romley 
launch? And if so, how should we think about that through the year? Should 
that track similar 
to PCs in terms of back half loaded? Or should that see a 
nice bump up in Q2?
 
Stacy J. Smith
 
Again, I'm not going to get to that level of granularity on a prospective 
basis. We didn't see softness in the Server business in Q4. It may have 
jumped out at you
 
that the year
-
over
-
year comp was down a little bit, it was 
8% versus higher comps but if you go back to Q4 of last year, we had a Q4 
of '10, we had an extraordinary strong quarter there. If I recall right, it was 
almost 30% growth from Q3 to Q4 of '10. So
 
we're still seeing a nice, 
secular growth trend in servers and that's what we saw in Q4 and that's 
what we expect...
 
Paul S. Otellini
 
I would just add, CJ, that the Data Center business we have today is not 
your grandmother Server business that we had for
 
many years, right? 
There's other elements in there around storage and networking equipment. 
And the other big element of that is the sales to the large Internet data 
centers that are being built up around the world. I think Stacy talked about 
that last qu
arter. Those sales were lumpy. They tend to be a function of 
when Facebook or Google or Amazon decides to turn on a new Data Center 
and they buy x 100,000 units. Or there's a new generation and they want to 
have a quick complete swap out. And as a result, 
we're seeing a change to 
the historical linearity that we saw in this 
--
 
in the enterprise Data Center 
business for many years. So I think you should probably get used to a little 
bit more lumpiness here and look at the overall year

Paul, couple of questions on the mobile side. You said as you enter the 
smartphone market more broadly, as you moved on to mid
-
end and low
-
end 
smartphones, you mentioned that it makes sense to integrate Medfield with 
the bas
eband that you had with Infineon. I'm just wondering what should we 
be thinking in terms of the timeframe for that solution. And also, as a follow
-
up, I'm just curious, given that all the smartphones also have Wi
-
Fi, 
Bluetooth and GPS and then [ph]. Do you
 
have that capability today 
internally? If not, what's your strategy for those components?
 
Paul S. Otellini
 
Yes, we've got the multi
-
comm capability in

house. A lot of that came with 
the acquisition from the Infineon group. And that's got 2G, 3G, they have
 
an 
LTE solution underway. We've had Wi
-
Fi forever, and we've had Bluetooth 
for many years. So all of those are being integrated into our comms 
capabilities. In fact, we've integrated those business units now into a single 
unit to be able to accelerate tha
t. I did not say, I want to be very clear, I did 
not say that our intent would be to integrate Medfield to baseband. I said 
over time, you'll see us move from the low

only business in 
the feature phones and value phones to having it a more int
egrated 
capability. I didn't say when and what generation. I'm really not at liberty to

Caris & Company, Inc., Research Division
 
Stacy, if you have the high
-
class problem, better units this year than PC 
Client in last 
year. What are the implications for CapEx?
 
Stacy J. Smith
 
So I hinted at it I think in the previous answer. If you look at the spending of 
CapEx for 2012, and this is consistent with what we said last year. It's a big 
component of it, but historically larg
e component of it, is actually building 
the facilities, these 4 factory model that we've been talking about. We've got 
big construction projects underway. They start to taper off. From here, our 
CapEx, really, will be a function of 2 things: it's the unit 
growth that we see 
going forward, and it's the speed at which we bring capabilities to that 
leading
-
edge process technology. And I think graphics has been the classic 
example of that. As we move that to the process edged to the leading
-
edge 
process technol
ogy, it did drive an increase in CapEx but it also drove a 
really capable product line that we got paid for. So we balance off those 
decisions as we go forward. A big increase in units would say that we'll 
continue to spend CapEx to support those units. If
 
it's less than that, then 
CapEx is less. It becomes a pretty 
--
 
a more traditional relationship going 
forward.
 
Craig A. Ellis

Caris & Company, Inc., Research Division
 
Okay. That's helpful. And then secondly, as we look at the balance sheet and 
the capit
al structure, you've taken on some debt in the fourth quarter. Can 
you frame for us, is that about the right level, a comfortable level for you? 
Are you capable of taking on more debt? Did you look for potentially 
flexibility to buy back more stock, et cet
era, in 2012?
 
Stacy J. Smith
 
Well, let me separate out those quarters. At the end of this, I'm not going to 
make a prospective statement on buybacks or debt. But our balance sheet 
certainly supports us taking on more debt. We have a relatively low amount 
o
f debt for a company of our size. So if we had a strategic need or decided 
that we wanted to take on more debt to buy back stock and recapitalize the 
company, we certainly have the capability of doing so. I'll come back to our 
capital structure philosophy.
 
We've said in the past that our first priority is 
investing in our business. I think if you look at 2011, it's a perfect example 
of that, we've made some significant investments in research and 
development in CapEx. We bought it, we bought back and we bou
ght the 
Infineon Wireless division that we believe bring really important capabilities, 
as well as nice business models into the company. Second priority is the 
dividend. We had a pretty significant increase in the dividend in 2011, and 
we've increased the
 
amount of dividend as a percent of free cash flow in 
terms of our target. And we're kind of right in there now. And then third is 
buying back stock and you saw us do a pretty significant amount of stock 
buyback. We did take advantage in 2011 of fairly low
 
interest rates and high 
dividend yields to accelerate that some, and it probably didn't escape you 
noticed that we bought back $4.1 billion in the fourth quarter, which I think 
is probably our largest quarter of buybacks ever. So all that's true. I'm not 
going to talk prospectively, though, about more debt or the size of the 
buyback. That's not how we do it.

Paul Otellini
 
Thanks, Mark, and good afternoon. As you know, I have a month left in my 
career at Intel, and this will be my last 

doing these calls since 1993, and have done approximately 80 calls with 
you. I want to take a departure from my traditional remarks during this, my 

 
perspective on the company and on our industry, drawing from my career 

 
I came to Intel nearly 40 years ago, eager to join the team of extraordinarily 
smart, creative, and driven engineers and the legendary team of f
ounders, 
some of the greatest minds in technology. In 1974, Intel was still a startup, 
with revenues of $134 million and a culture built on relentless innovation 
and designed to thrive on change.
 
A revolution in computing had just begun, but it would take 
us another 
decade before we realized how dramatically it would change our business 
and the world. Amid all that change and reinvention, there has, however, 
been a constant. From the early days of DRAM to the era of the first 
microprocessor, from one archit
ectural battle to the next, and across 
generations of form factors and operating systems, Intel has grown and 
thrived.
 
Naturally, constant change and reinvention creates plenty of room for both 
opportunity and skepticism. As the industry and the company ev
olved, risk 

architectural innovation, manufacturing expertise, and intense drive allowed 
it to create and capitalize on the opportunity over the long haul.
 
In May of 2005, I became CEO and over 

executed a broad strategy to reposition the company to participate in all 
segments of computing by capitalizing on all of our considerable strengths.
 
We implemented the Tick
-
Tock model, which set the pace of innovation and 
has b
ecome an industry benchmark of execution. We developed the Atom 
microarchitecture to address low power and low cost market segments.
 

invested in strategic capabilities like baseband 
technology and security that 
position us to deliver important new capabilities and compete across an even 

manufacturing breakthroughs that are allowing us to deliver on the promise 
and competiti

 
Never in the history of our company has our ability to participate across the 
spectrum of computing been greater. From industrial machines that are 
increasingly connected to the internet to the smallest battery powered 
devices, 
from traditional PCs to ultrabooks, and from high performance 
servers to microservers, storage, and networking equipment, we now 
compete wherever there is computing.
 

semiconductor ind
ustry than ever before. In the first quarter, we shipped 
our 100 millionth 22 nanometer processor, using our revolutionary 3D 
transistor technology, while the rest of the industry works to ship its first 
unit.
 
That breakthrough is just one in a long histor
y of materials science firsts, 
following innovations like string silicon and high
-
K metal gate. This 
leadership in materials science and manufacturing technology is the 

lowest powe
r and lowest cost transistors.
 
But even as I prepare to pass the baton to a new generation of leadership, I 

what lies ahead for Intel. The company has a historically broad portfolio o
f 
products, spanning the spectrum of computing and price points, and as we 
begin to transition to 14 nanometer technology later this year, our 
architectural and [processor] technology investments and innovations will 
become increasingly apparent and valuab
le for our customers, and to the 
market.
 

and around the world. That creativity and drive that first attracted me to 
Intel almost four decades ago has never been higher. The company

architectural and manufacturing strength have never been more valuable, 
and the opportunity presented by the evolution and expansion of the 
computing industry has never been greater.
 

e to invent, 
grow, thrive, and deliver the best technology to a world increasingly hungry 
for the products of the microprocessor revolution. With that, let me turn the 
meeting over to Stacy.
 
Stacy Smith
 


each of the segments of our business and our expectations as we look 
forward to the rest of the year. Starting with the PC client group. PC client 
volumes were down seasonally in the first quarter, consistent with our 
expectations. I
n addition, we believe the worldwide PC supply chain saw a 
continued reduction in inventory levels in the first quarter as customers 
decreased inventory of older generation PCs.
 
In the second quarter, we will launch Haswell, enabling a new wave of ultra
-
sl
eek designs across multiple form factors by our customers. We believe the 
combination of an improving macroeconomic environment, Haswell coming 
to the market; ultramobile form factors like ultrabooks, convertibles, and 
tablets; and touch
-
enabled devices le
ads to a return to growth in the second 
half of the year.
 
Moving to the data center group, data center group revenue in the first 
quarter grew 7% from a year ago. On a year on year basis, we saw 
significant growth in both the cloud and high
-
performance com
puting 
segments of the market. We continue to refresh our product line to expand 
our offerings across all ranges of performance, performance per watt, and 
performance per watt per dollar.
 
At IDF Beijing last week, we announced that our next
-
generation Atom
 
processor for the microserver segment of the market, code named Avoton, 
and our Ivy Bridge product for Xeon [cloud] servers, will be shipping in the 
second half. These leadership products, coupled with our leading
-
edge 
[process] technology and the secular
 
growth trends of the data [center] 
markets, give us confidence in double digit revenue growth for the year.
 
We are making significant progress in tablets and phones. First quarter 
tablet volume more than doubled from the fourth quarter, and we expect it 
t
o double again in the second quarter. We have shipping designs across both 
Windows 8 and Android operating systems. In the second half, we will 
launch Bay Trail, which will further extend our product line across screen 
sizes and price points.
 
In the phone 
segment, we had a good first quarter in our baseband 
business. We are shipping LTE versions today, and are on track to ship 
multimode voice and data LTE baseband solutions by the end of this year. 
We are winning designs with our new Clover Trail+ apps proc
essor, where 
customers and third parties are highlighting both the performance and 
power efficiency of our architecture and are on track to ship our next
-
generation product, code named Merrifield, by the end of this year.
 
In other important 
segments of our business, we saw year on year growth in 
both our software and services group and our NAND business.
 
Turning to our financials, first quarter revenue finished at $12.6 billion, in 
line with our expectations. We are forecasting revenue of $12
.9 billion for 
the second quarter, which is slightly higher than the average seasonal 
increase, as we expect some pipeline inventory replenishment as we launch 
Haswell and in anticipation of a stronger second half.
 
Gross margin of 56% was down 2 points fro
m expectations. Increased 
demand from our customers allowed us to increase production of Haswell 
products prior to qualification for sale. The result of this was a higher than 
anticipated inventory writeoff, which we expect to get back throughout the 
rest 
of the year as the product is expected to qualify for sale in the second 
quarter.
 
In addition, we saw higher than expected excess capacity charges in older 
generation process technologies. We are taking advantage of the excess 
capacity on older generation 
process technologies to take capacity offline 
and reuse more equipment and space for 14 nanometer and beyond.
 
The results of these actions allow us to lower our capital spending forecast 
for the year by $1 billion, down to $12 billion. In addition, our inv
entories 
decreased almost $400 million from the fourth quarter. For the second 
quarter, we expect gross margin to increase 2 points to 58%, and the gross 
margin forecast for the year remains 60%, with gross margins in the second 
half back into the low 60s.
 
Operating income for the first quarter was $2.5 billion, with earnings per 
share of $0.40. Taking a look at the balance sheet, total cash investments 
ended the quarter at $17.1 billion, down $1.1 billion from the fourth quarter. 
The reduction in cash was 
the result of shifting almost $1 billion from short 
term to longer term investments.
 
In the first quarter, we generated approximately $4 billion in cash from 
operations, paid approximately $1 billion in dividends, purchased a little over 
$2 billion in capi
tal assets, and repurchased $500 million in stock.
 
As Paul said, our manufacturing leadership is extending, and gives us the 

shipped our first silicon to a foundry customer, and we 
announced a 
significant foundry design win with Altera, who will move their leading edge 
products to our 14 nanometer process technology.
 
Building on this leadership, we are on track to start production on 14 
nanometer process technology in the back half o
f this year. The combination 
of an improving macroeconomic environment and new products coming to 
the market over the course of the year to take advantage of our 
manufacturing leadership increases our confidence in being able to achieve 
financial growth in
 
the second half of 2013.
 
With that, let me turn it back over to Mark.
 
Mark Henninger
 
Thank you, Paul and Stacy. Before we begin the Q&A, I do recognize that 
there are questions about the upcoming CEO transition. The selection 
process is on track, and the 

the time Paul retires at the annual shareholder meeting in May. Beyond this, 

or the candidates today.
 
Moving on to the Q&A, as is our lo
ng practice, we would ask each participant 
to ask one question and just one follow up if you have one. With that, 
operator, please go ahead and introduce our first questioner.

comes from Sumit Dhanda of ISI

ISI Group
 
Two questions for you. Stacy, it seems like notebook ASPs were up a little 
bit sequentially based on the data that you provided in the CFO 
commentary. Could you help us 
understand what that was due to? Was it 
enterprise versus consumer mix? Or was there a bigger proportion of touch 
that was shipped in the quarter?
 
Stacy Smith
 

ASPs. I would just c
haracterize it as a fairly benign pricing environment. The 
way we characterized it at the beginning of the year is that we have, I think, 
a strong product position really across different form factors in the market, 

 
characterize that as just not a lot of 
change from the way we saw things a quarter ago.
 
Sumit Dhanda

ISI Group
 
And then for my follow up, just on the server piece, the last couple of 
quarters units were pretty flat, and then volumes were down [6%] in th
e 
calendar first quarter. I would have thought that would be easy comps. You 
might have seen a slightly better volume pickup in that business. Anything 
you could talk to with respect to why that did not occur?
 
Stacy Smith
 
On a year over year comparison, un
its were up, and ASP was up a little bit in 

saw in the fourth quarter in the enterprise segment of the data center. And 
then we continue to see very robust growth rates across th
e high

performance computing and the big [IT] data centers that support the cloud. 

in the enterprise segment. And as I think forward to the back half of the 
year, my suspicion
 

just based on macroeconomic improvement.

Our next question comes from Ambrish Srivastava of BMO Capital Markets. 
Your line is now open.
 
Ambrish Srivastava

BMO Capital Markets
 
A couple o
f questions. My first one is Stacy, if you could please talk about 
the capacity. How much of the capex can be moderated lower, if the PC 
industry continues to be weaker than probably what you thought going into 
the year?
 
Stacy Smith
 

really well
-
positioned right now from a factory and utilization 
standpoint. And let me just realign what we did in the first quarter. We saw 
that units were a little bit weaker than we expected and our expectations 
came down a bit. That allowed us to bring
 
utilization down on some older 
generation process technology.
 
You can see we brought our inventory levels down pretty significantly, and 
actually a little bit more than I thought when I started the quarter. And we 
took $1 billion out of capex by rolling f
orward some older generation 
technologies to offset things that we needed to buy for 14 nanometer and 
new process technologies.
 

example of how we can be responsive in a very tactic
al time horizon to 
changes in demand. And as I look forward across the year, the prediction 

starting the quarter at that utilization rate. I think inventories will continue 
to
 
be healthy.
 
If demand turns out to be stronger, we have some white space that we can 
grow into, so we can respond up. If demand ends up being a little weaker 
than we thought, you saw the playbook in Q1. We can pretty quickly react 
and bring capex down if

And then my follow up on the foundry strategy, maybe for Paul or for you, 

then looking out ahead, what implication does tha
t have for business mix 
and also for the long term margin structure for the company?
 
Paul Otellini
 


act

and there are some other customers that we still have not yet publicly 
announced.
 
In terms of the business, as Stacy said I think last quarter, it will not have a 
significant revenue 

design cycle for these products. And in the case of someone like Altera, the 
products tend to run for quite some time. So think of that as something that 
will start two
-
plus years from now and run fo
r quite a number of years 
thereafter on several generations of technology.
 
The business model that we have for the foundry assumes value based 
pricing. The people that we are soliciting and people that are attracted to us 
are those who see the advantages o
f our technology as it manifests itself in 

healthy business for us.

Our next question comes from John Pitzer of Credit Suisse. Your line is now

First, just relative to what your units did in PCG versus some third
-
party 
data and kind of your commentary that you thought that the PC supply chain 
went through an inventory reduction. There seems to be a little bit of a 
mismatch, where you guys have
 
outperformed. To what extend is that just 
netbooks not being classified in your PC group and being classified in third
-
party data, and to what extent is that emerging market strength perhaps 
picking up that the third
-

 
St
acy Smith
 


they view the year. And so you start with the traditional PC segment of the 
market, we do
 
expect that to be down. We expect netbooks to be down 

getting close to zero. That category is coming to the end of its life.
 
And then we see some of the new form factors of computi
ng are growing 
significantly. Gartner would call those ultramobile devices, so things like 


Windows 8 and Andro
id. And with Bay Trail coming out and Merrifield behind 
that, we start to participate in a much broader set of screen sizes and price 
points than we are today.
 
And so when you net all of this up, and you look broadly at the market for 
computing, you see so
me of the traditional form factors down. You see 
growth in these new form factors. We get to kind of very slight unit growth 

viewing the year.
 
John Pitzer

Credit Suisse
 
And then Sta
cy, as my follow on, just the operating profitability of DCG was 


broaden out into new areas like networki
ng and storage? Is that a gross 
margin problem? Can you help me understand the profitability? And when do 
we get back to that 50% op margin that we saw maybe five quarters ago, if 
ever?
 
Stacy Smith
 


PCG. As we said at the beginning of the quarter, we had significant excess 
capacity charges that hit both PCG and DCG, and we had a big increase in 
startup costs as you kind of expect, based on where we are in the 14 
nanometer ramp, and 
those two business units are the ones that really drive 

 


 
the 

DCG.

Our next question comes from Chris Danely with JP Morgan. Your line is now 
open.
 
Chris Danely

JP Morgan
 
I guess my first question is on the foundry business. 
Paul, you said the 


competitor to yourself in the PC or the handset arena. Has that stance 
changed at all?
 
Paul 
Otellini
 

was looking at. One would be value
-
based pricing, to take advantage of our 
technology. The second is that we would not enable a chip competitor. And 
the third, that w
e have not mentioned on the call yet today, is that it would 
be great if we could form a strategic relationship with a customer so that it 
went beyond just a single foundry transaction.
 
Chris Danely 
-
 
JP Morgan
 
And then for my follow up, if you look at the
 
sequentials for Q1/Q2 this year, 

half of last year. Could you just maybe compare and contrast, and what 

in the 
second half of the year for sales?
 
Stacy Smith
 
What gives me confidence in the second half of 2013 really comes down to 
two things. One, we do expect that the macro environment will improve. 

sts now. That 
could be a repeat to what we thought last year. I think the world was 

materialize. So that is my believe right now.
 
That will directly impact our data center business. There

that business that really is correlated to GDP growth when you look at it 
over a long period of time.
 
And then secondly is our product portfolio, and we now participate across a 
broad range of devices, tablets and convertibles and attac
hables, and 

And so we can embrace this broad market for computing now, and wherever 
the demand increases, we can participate in it.
 
And a year ago, we were in the middle of that tra
nsition, and so as tablets 
ramped, and in particular as [unintelligible] tablets ramped, we really 

 
Paul Otellini
 
I had a third thing, Chris, which I think is as the OEMs start looking at
 
new 
form factors that they can design around our new chips, Haswell in 
particular, and maybe Bay Trail, and Windows 8, enabling touch, the 
explosion in form factors and the competitiveness of that platform is going 
to be substantially different, at price 
points down into the $300 to $400 

prime selling season with new products, new technologies, new form factors, 
and new capabilities that, up to now, were unapproachable price points.

My first question, moving on to the DCG side, again, I know you said, Stacy, 

-
digit growth for the year an
d that macro is a 
big part of it. Is there any sort of granularity you can give us to get us 
across that bridge from what seemed to be a relatively weak start to the 
year, whether by the end markets within that segment or new products? 
Anything you can hel
p us with would be great.
 
Stacy Smith
 


enterprise segment of the market on a year over year basis, a
s I said 



 
And then we continu
e to see very high rates of growth in things like the 
cloud and high
-
performance computing. And when I say high rates of 
growth, think of things that are in the 20%, 30%, 40% year on year unit 
growth rates in those segments of the market. I think that seco
nd piece is 

internet, driving the [unintelligible] out of the cloud. And then the first piece, 
I think, is improving and will likely improve into the second half.

eutsche Bank
 
I guess for my follow up, thinking a little bit about inventory and how it 
plays along into utilization. You guys over the last two quarters have taken 
the better part of $1 billion out of your inventory. A year ago at this time, 
you started r
amping that back up, then obviously demand was a problem 
and you had to go back to the underutilization side of things.
 
Are you going to be a bit more cautious on the pace of utilization and 
inventory build this year, or are some of the things macro
-
wise a
nd product

wise that are giving you confidence in the back half demand is going to lead 
you to the same behavior or just as aggressive as a year ago?
 
Stacy Smith
 

what we have today
 

all learning how to operate more efficiently. Now, it may go up a little bit in 
the second quarter as the various versions of Haswell qualify, which is part 
of the story for the Q1 margin miss. And it

was less than $1 billion. It was $981 million. The full year cape

capex for the rest of the year. Why do you need that much capacity when 
units are at the same levels as then?
 
Stacy Smith
 
Let me put capex in maybe a broader context. First, if you take out the 450 

Pretty significant reduction. And if you just look at our capital spending as a 
percent of revenue relative to
 


of in the range.
 
And you compare that against some of the people we compare against, a 

ignificant multiple of capex 

amount. I think we can be responsive if the market ends up a little bit 
weaker. I think we have the ability to flex up if the market ends up being 
strong

 
And as I just discussed with Ross, the operational indicators look really 


, and I expect 
both of those to continue through the year.

I absolutely appreciate the perspective around the numbers, but it still

Just to clarify some of the numbers, you mentioned the 450 mm spending. 
Is that still assumed to be about $2 billion for this year and

down from $11 billion last year? Is that the way the numbers work?

refreshing our product line there. When you net all that out, you get to some 
very modest unit growth across all of those devices.

expectations relative to your last earnings call. So what specifically in 
Haswell can help turn it around? And can you give us a sense of how your

performance goes up, 
graphics performance goes up, as well as the integer 

Bridge. Point one. Point two, the power envelope, or the batter life for that 
level of performance, is exceptionally better than
 
Ivy Bridge.
 
Third, it gets into the form factor innovation and the integration with touch 
as I spoke about earlier, which I think is really part of the recipe required for 

and it 
is a better Windows than Windows 7 in the desktop mode, when you 
implement the touch and the touch

And as my follow up, Stacy, the buyback slowed down to I think about a 
$500 million in the last quarter. You were above $1 billion in prior 
quarters. 
How should we think about buyback activity for this year? How should we 
think about overall users of cash for this year.

with the buyback, just as a matter of
 
policy. What I can share with you is

You spoke before about your increased confidence now versus last year. But 

 
months, we have weaker results in Q1,

to be 

which would belie that increased confidence some.

For my follow up, I wanted to dig a little bit into the trajectory of your fab 
output. It sounds to me like your current [time] to loading is similar to what 
you had last quarter, which I think was full fabs on the second hal
f. It almost 
sounds like you may be running close to full right now.
 
What does that mean for your expectations for how much your fab output 
may grow in 2014, year over year. I would think you anticipate running full 
in 2014, and we were pretty lean in the 
first part of 2013. Would double 
digit upside be the right way to think about that in terms of fab output? And 
how much of that increase might be inventory replenishment versus demand 
upside?
 
Stacy Smith
 

 
We have the ability to 

put on more capacity. If it ends up being closer to a bust, we can play the 

 
Paul Otellini
 

the 14 nanometers. 
[unintelligible] a first order, all of our spending is focused on 14 
nanometers , which gives us a fairly significant ramp capability. If demand 
for older products exceeds what we could build on 14, we could still build 22 
for quite some
 
time. So I really think it depends on whatever demand 
scenario you see out there. In any event, the most important thing for us is 
to make that transition to 14 and continue to have the leading edge.

14 nanometers and capex, just on a rough basis, how much are we talking

In the past, when you looked at Intel you were successful because your 

ception that 
the PC ecosystem is really not in the greatest state of health. What is it that 
you think Intel can do to try to make your customers more successful in the 
marketplace?
 
Paul Otellini
 
I think continue to give them the tools to innovate. And I w

entire customer base with the same brush that you just did. Certainly if you 
looked at the last quarter, even inside the PC space, Lenovo outperformed 
everybody else, and actually had a very good year on year set of numbers, 
in a down yea
r. Apple continues to do well.
 
Subsets of customers in different segments are also doing very well in terms 
of, say, those. Those providing products into the internet data centers. What 
I see when we look out is a tremendous amount of innovation, particula
rly at 
the ODM and Taiwanese OEM side, where the ability to miniaturize and bring 
things into extremely thin form factors is as revolutionary as the amount of 

 
And so I think what we can do is give them the pro
ducts, like Haswell and 
Bay Trail to innovate around. We can help them with other feature sets like 
voice and speech that go around them, and just help them build better 
products.

egically, that is 
investing in things outside of what we call core PC, how do I try to quantify 

box or in the foundry efforts or other areas of revenue that the company is 
seeking?
 
Paul Otellini
 

the investment is really going to be taking advantage, at least near term, 

place. That d

extra capacity for a foundry customer or a foundry business, but today, up 

 

l media, in the 
grand scheme of things, is not a lot of spending. So the real issue is inside of 

now where roughly half of our spending is focused on system on chip, inside 
the microp
rocessor world.
 
And the system on chip environment is really a lot of the ultramobile 


not the same monolithi

Our next question comes from Joseph Moore of Morgan Stanley. Your line is 
now open.

My 
question is on the commentary that the pipeline inventory replenishment 
will be a driver for slightly higher than seasonal Q2. Can you put some 
perspective on that? It seems like you normally have new products in Q2, 
and you normally have strength in Q3. I
s the current inventory level lean, or 
how should we view that inventory replenishment comment?
 
Stacy Smith
 
I think inventory levels generally are lean everywhere we look. We saw an 
inventory burn in the broader pipeline in Q1. And our inventory levels are
 
down more than I expected when I started the quarter, and down pretty 
significantly. So I think inventory levels are lean.
 

Being up 3% quarter on quarter is kind of well within Q
1 the Q2 seasonality. 

in place some Haswell based systems in anticipation of the second half 
selling season, just as they burned inventory on some of the older 
generation syst
ems in the first quarter.

And then in terms of ultrabook, last year you had given pretty precise 
targets on where you wanted that to come out as a percentage of consumer 

ut it, can you give us 
any kind of qualitative assessment of where you think those penetration 
numbers will go this year, and any kind of goals or targets that you may 
have?
 
Stacy Smith
 

 
you 


thin and light notebooks relative to the total notebook market that are kind 
of on the order of a 
third of the market. And I think that grows from here as 
we hit price points.
 
So I think the reinvention of the form factor is well underway. Some of those 
are going to be more premium ultrabooks with touch and then new form 
factors of convertibles and det
achables. A big chunk of that is going to be 
that wedge of volume behind that, which are thin and light touch enabled

Our final question comes from Timothy Arcuri of Cowen
 
& Company. Your 
line is now open.
 
Timothy Arcuri

Cowen & Company
 
I wanted to ask a question about the mix between bricks and mortar and 
equipment spending. You had said before, when you had guided core capex 

id the equipment portion 
would be up pretty sizably year over year. So since you cut $1 billion out of 
that, will the equipment portion still be up? Or is it now down?
 
Stacy Smith
 

spent about 40% of our capex in 2012 on equipment. That percentage came 
down in 2013. More of the cut to capex was equipment than realignment of 

something we share with you in the Nove
mber investor meeting, to just kind 
of give you a sense of where is the capex going and then some color 
commentary over the next couple of years.
 
Timothy Arcuri

Cowen & Company
 
And then just second thing, you just gave some price points for touch
-
enabled
 
notebooks that I look back at my notes and you were previously 
saying $599 to $799 for touch
-
enabled notebooks, and now from what you 



did something change? Because at those price points, you get a much 
different demand profile.
 
Paul Otellini
 
Separate ultrabook versus notebook.
 
Stacy Smith
 
These are touch
-
enabled notebooks.
 
Paul Otellini
 
We have a certain spec
 
for ultrabooks, and that is the product that Stacy 
said is going to be centered at as low as $599 with some [diverse] SKUs to 
$499. If you look at touch
-
enabled Intel based notebooks that are ultrathin 
and light using non
-
core processors, those prices are
 
going to be down to as 
low as $200 probably.

spent the majority of my time meeting with customers, employees, and my 
executive team. I have heard a wide variety of views about our industry and 

trong and where we can improve. 
I have the opportunity to share my vision and strategy for our Company and 
lay out my expectation as we move into the new era with an updated set of 
priorities.
 
Those conversations lead me more enthusiastic and more confiden
t than 
ever about our opportunity as a Company. Intel has unmatched assets in 
process technology and architecture. A powerful brand and talented 
employees that are producing some remarkable results.
 
Let me give you a few highlights from the second quarter.
 
There were 
several significant milestones in mobility. First, we unveil details about our 
next generation atom architecture, code named Silvermont. The Silvermont 
architecture will deliver up to 5x reduction in power at the same level 
performance or up to
 
a 3x improvement in performance over our prior 
generation of architecture.
 

computing. From ultra
-
mobile devices to the datacenter. And it supports 
both windows and android. The Silverm
ont platform were underpinned 

 
are 
underpinned our products for tablets, two in ones and desktops, as well as 
our phones and microserver products for the datacenter. The products will 
be Bay Trail, Merrifield and Avonton respectively.
 
Then at Computex, we
 
launched the Haswell family of processors, which 

no comprises, high performance, two
-
in
-
one devices that make 

 
that all 
day battery life a reality. Haswell along with Bay Trail 
will power more than 
50 different two
-
in
-
one devices in the pipeline, including the very first 
fanless Core design.
 
During the same week at Computex, we also announced the landmark tablet 
design in the Samsung Galaxy Tab 3. The Galaxy Tab 3 will use an ato
m SoC 
and our LTE solution, signaling important progress in the tablet space. The 
datacenter strategy is continuing to pay dividends.
 
Our cloud storage 

 
cloud and storage business each grew their revenue 
more than 40% year
-
over
-
year. Networking grew more 
than 20% and high 
performance computing business were 98% of all new systems entering the 
top 500 list. In fact, the number one system on the top 500 was all Intel for 

Phi accelera
tor.
 
And finally our investments and expertise in process technology continue to 
be the foundation of our industry leadership. With 22 nanometer defect 
density and throughput times at record low levels and 14 nanometer on

that we have set for ourselves. Intel was slow to respond to the 
ultra
-
mobile PC trend. The importance of that can be seen in the current 
market dynamics. The traditional PC market segment is down from our 
expectations at the beginning of the year while u

tablets are up.
 

job to continue to scan for emerging trends, unlocking, participating in, and 
shaping these nascent markets. Doing that will require some ch
anges at 
Intel, which we have begun.
 
Just a few weeks ago, I announced a significant reorganization. The changes 

contribute to a culture of even greater accountability. These elements a
re 
critical in the fast paced ultra
-
mobile environment.
 
In addition to the organizational changes, we have made several strategy 
and priority changes that will allow us to focus and win in that environment. 
These changes will drive a greater emphasis on At
om
-
based products 
bringing the full weight of our process and architectural leadership to the 
Atom family.
 
We will move Atom even faster to our leading
-
edge silicon technology and 
focus on the SOC integration of key components like graphics, 
communications
 
and other devices. This does not mean we will lessen the 
value or leadership of our Core product family, but rather make Atom an 
equal player in technology leadership for the ultra
-
mobile space. Both 
product lines will be driving Intel's future.
 
Some of t
he changes we're making are subtle and some are more 
transformational. In general, you're likely to see us making moves and 
adjustments in the market before you hear us talking about them. But we'll 
of course have a substantive update for you at the invest
or meeting in 
November.
 
What I can say now is that all of the changes are focused on value creation. 
Our company has a strong record of cash flow generation and returning that 
cash to our owners. I recognize that we are the stewards of our owners' 
capital 
and that tradition will continue. I'm excited about what lies ahead.
 
Intel is a company with extraordinary assets at its disposal and I'm looking 
forward to making the most of those assets in an environment where the 
pace of innovation and market trends fo
rce transformation is faster than it's 
ever been.
 
With that, let me turn it over to Stacy.
 
Stacy J. Smith
 
Thanks, Brian. I'd like to take a few minutes to walk through our second 
quarter financials and our expectations as we head into the back half of the 
year. Then we can get right into Q&A.
 
The second quarter results came in as expected. Second quarter revenue 
came in at $12.8 billion, up 2% from the first quarter. The Core business 
came in as expected but we saw some softness in our baseband 
business. At 
a segment level, the PC group grew 1% sequentially and the data center 
group grew 6%.
 
As expected inventory levels across the worldwide PC supply chain grew 
slightly as customers began building Haswell based PCs, but inventory levels 
are still
 
being managed well below historical averages based on uncertainty 
heading into the back half of the year.
 
For the third quarter of 2013, we are forecasting the midpoint of the revenue 
range at $13.5 billion, up 5% from the second quarter which is at the l
ower 
end of the historical range as a result of our expectation that our customers 
will continue to operate with lean inventory levels exiting the third quarter.
 
Moving to gross margin, second quarter gross margin of 58% was in line 
with our guidance and u
p 2 points from the first quarter as a result of the 
qualification for sale of additional Haswell products and higher volume. As 
expected, the reduction in excess capacity charges in the second quarter 
was offset by an increase in 14 nanometer start
-
up cos
ts.
 
For the third quarter, we expect gross margin to increase 3 points to 61% as 
we qualify our Bay Trail product line for sale, increase our volume, and start 
to see factory start
-
up costs come down.
 
For the second quarter, spending was in line with expec
tations at $4.7 
billion. For the third quarter, we're forecasting an increase to total spending 
of $100 million. The reclassification spending on process engineers from 
across the sales to R&D increases our spending but we expect this will be 
mostly offset
 
by spending reductions across the company. These spending 
reductions allow us to reduce our spending forecast for the year to $18.7 
billion.
 
Operating income for the second quarter was $2.7 billion with earnings per 
share of $0.39. Taking a look at the ba
lance sheet, total cash investments 
ended the quarter at $17.4 billion, up slightly from the first quarter. In the 
second quarter, we generated approximately $5 billion in cash from 
operations, paid approximately $1 billion in dividends, purchased almost $
3 
billion in capital assets and repurchased over $0.5 billion in stock.
 
While our first half financials played out as expected, the overall PC market 
segment for 2013 is expected to be weaker than we forecast at the 
beginning of the year. Our expectation i
s now that revenue will be 
approximately flat to last year. As a result, our gross margin forecast for the 
year is now 59% versus the prior forecast of 60%. Additionally, we have 
reduced our forecast for capital spending by $1 billion to $11 billion.
 
We ha
ve an unprecedented lineup of products coming to market in the 
second half of this year across all the segments of our business. Haswell 
delivers a historical increase in battery life across a diverse line up of ultra
-
mobile form factors like 2
-
in
-
1 conver
tibles, tablets and other touch
-
enabled 
devices. In the second half, we will launch Bay Trail which will further extend 
our product line across screen sizes and price points in both tablets and PCs.
 
In our phone business, we are on track to ship multimode 
data and voice 
LTE baseline solutions as well as our next generation applications processor 
codename Merrifield by the end of the year. In the data center, we have new 
microserver and Xeon [class] products coming to market in the second half.
 
This leadersh
ip product portfolio is built on an extending manufacturing lead 
which gives us the world's highest performing, lowest cost and lowest power 
transistors. Building on its leadership further, we are on track to start 
production on our 14 nanometer process te
chnology in the back half of this 
year.
 
With that, let me turn it back over to Mark.

All right. Thank you, Brian and Stacy. Moving on to the Q&A, as is our 
normal practice, we'll ask each participant to ask one question and a follow

up if yo
u have one. Also, we are experiencing some network interference, so 
I'll ask all the participants to speak slowly and clearly and if we're not able to 
hear you, we will ask you to repeat the question.
 
Jamie, if you could go ahead and introduce our first qu
estioner.

Thanks for letting me ask a question. The first one is on the second half of 
the year and your outlook t
here. If I look at your guidance for the year and 
your guidance for Q3, the implication is 7% sequential growth in revenues 
for the fourth quarter and I wonder 

 
that's obviously high relative to 
historical norms, kind of like numbers we saw back in the ea
rly part of the 
last decade and I wonder what gives you the confidence there? Is there 
something about the mix 

 
obviously new products but is there also 
something about the mix maybe between data center and client?
 
Stacy J. Smith
 
Hi, Glen. This is Stacy. 
I would characterize 

 
I guess I'd say it's a little early 
to get that specific about Q4. At this point, I'd expect seasonal which is a 
little less than what you said but still got this into that kind of flat year
-
on
-
year revenue growth. And I think the ta
il for us will really be written in the 
back half of Q3 when we start to see how our customers are putting in place 
inventory in anticipation of that fourth quarter selling season. And right now 
our view on that is just fairly cautious. We expect that they
'll continue to run 
lean inventory levels but the reality is we won't know that until we get into 
late August, early September. That's when you normally start to see them 
putting in the supply line that also aligns with other things in the industry 
and so 
we think that's when we're likely to really get a sense of Q3 and the 
momentum into Q4.

All right, makes sense. Okay. And the next question is for Brian. First of all, 
Brian, congratulations on your new role. The question is now that
 
you're in 
that role for a couple of months and as you say you talk to customers. 
Today, Intel has very good products in mobile and tomorrow we'll have 
arguably the best products in mobile even [they do today]. But I wonder in 
your discussions with custome
rs if you think that that's enough? If the 
customer base is now open to accepting an x86 based processor in what has 
traditionally been an arm market or does it matter?
 
Brian M. Krzanich
 
Okay. As Mark said, it was a little hard to hear you on our side. We'
re having 
some network issues but let me try to answer your question. The question is 
can x86 go into these ultra
-
mobile markets and how do the customers view 
that? And my answer would be they are more than willing to accept it. The 
fact that x86 works on 
both Android and Windows is a real advantage to our 
OEM base. They look at that and say that they can have one architectural 
design, one set of products and use both operating systems. So it's a unique 
feature that we are able to provide. It's more been in
 
focus by Intel of 
actually going in and designing for those markets and moving our products 
in there. You really see that with Haswell and Bay Trail. Haswell on the Core 
side and Bay Trail on the Atom side really being designed for those ultra
-
mobile prod
ucts. We talked about Haswell producing the first stainless Core 
products out there in the market in any kind of real volume. And then Bay 
Trail really being designed for the much lower price points that you see 
these tablets and even down to the entry lev
el of tablets. And so the fact 

both Android and Windows on our product now.

Thanks for taking my question. Brian, first of all how should we think about 
ASP trend in the PC segment; I think you outlined 3% sequential declines in 
Q2 and you got into another 5
0 point gross margin head from lower ASPs in 
Q3, why are you not seeing more of an uplift from the rollout of Haswell?
 
Stacy J. Smith
 

that I put out. You should think of it as mi
x shift for us and share win at the 

we came in pretty much in line with what we thought, but during a time 
where the [TAM] was somewhat weaker than we thought. I think the offs
et 
there, the plug is that we gained some share at the low end and so we have 
bit more mix at the lower end and then due to share win in that particular 
segment of the market.
 
Vivek Arya

Bank of America Merrill Lynch
 
Thanks, Stacy. And as a follow
-
up, wh
y are we not seeing more benefits 
from the decrease in 14 nanometer startup cost, like when I look at the 

in prior cycles then when the startup costs have decreased and I think yo
ur 
guidance implies a sequential gross margin decline in Q4. If you could just 
walk us through the puts and takes, I would appreciate that.
 
Stacy J. Smith
 

I got your question. If yo

of the startup cost trend relative to prior and what are the puts and take for 
Q4, is that what your question is?
 
Vivek Arya

Bank of America Merrill Lynch
 

 
S
tacy J. Smith
 
Relative to gross margin shift. So the startup cost trend is directionally the 


startup cost in the 


half of next year, so it's a comparable trend. In the fourth quarter the puts 

ression across the year we 

points of increase in the third quarter to 61%. And then as, if I think about 

so
me. We should get some good news associated with startup cost, and then 
the offset in Q4 is going to be, we should be well into the build of broad well. 

have an increase in inventor
y write
-

offset some of those good news. Net of all that I expect gross margin in the 
fourth quarter to be at or maybe a little bit higher than where we're in Q3 

ost in code names. 
That product is our lead product on 14 nanometer, so that kind of aligned 
with being in manufacturing in the back half of the year on 14 nanometer.

u
p so you guys are guiding for some 
decent growth here in the second half of this year. If we go back to last year 
you were essentially flat in the second half. So can you just give us your 
sense of why, what's driving the confidence that things are going t
o be 
better for you guys in the second half of this year versus the second half of 
last year?
 
Stacy J. Smith
 

Q3 is sub
-
seasonal growth, so it's off of an okay Q2 but not a game buster 

that I see first and
 
foremost is the product cycle. Haswell is a great product 
for ultrabooks in two end runs and as Brian said with Bay Trail coming to the 




of our first big tablet wins out in the market place and with Bay Trail we 
think again we enable other designs to come to market at price points tha
t 
are going to be I think nicer in consumer price points. The second tailwind 


first half the U.S. was a l
ittle bit stronger than we have thought starting the 

macroeconomic environment in the back half.

Good afternoon guys, thanks for letting me ask the question. Brian, although 

positive, a

with whether or not Bay Trail is going to be so good that it starts to 

can segment the market properly, to what ext

to market forces and to what extent do you think you can bring applications 
that are MIPS attentive into the ecosystem and secure the Core business 
even as you try to get more aggressive in Bay Trail and Atom?
 
Brian M. Krzan
ich
 

believe it will be cannibalistic in that nature. We believe what it really does it 

And that as Stacy 
said are these sub $400, sub $300 in some case, 
clamshells and touch enabled convertibles in two in one devices, and tablets 

below that as we go through the holiday season. So Bay Trail
 
really first and 
foremost we believe gives solid performance, solid battery life relative to the 
competition in price points and markets that were simply not in, in a big way 

a
s a point is Haswell as we said is the largest battery life improvement in 

has core level of performance that will be fan less for the first time. So we 
still believe that there i
s a strong drive for performance in segments of this 
market that look for high
-
definition video performance, gaming. All of the 
things that if you actually look at a lot of the tablet usage even, people are 
doing more and more and definitely in these two i
n one and convertible 
devices people look for that kind of application. So we believe that Haswell 
allowing us to go down into those better price points and lower powers will 
give us the performance option to keep people up into those regions.
 
Stacy J. Smi
th
 
If I can just add a couple of data points on that in terms of what we've seen 
over the last few years. First off is to reinforce what Brian said. There still is 
a big gap in terms of performance and features between the best in Bay Trail 
and the Core i3
, i5 or i7 segment of our product line. And if you look at the 
last three years even in a time where the market's been relatively weak, the 
Core i5, i7 volumes have been very healthy and if anything we've seen a 
larger mix overall to Core over that time pe
riod. So there still is a healthy 
segmentation in the marketplace where Bay Trail will play 

 
it will start to 
expand this into markets where we don't play today. And because of the 
cost structure we think we can do it with more dollars per unit than we 
wo
uld be able to do if we were going after that segment today with Celeron 
or even with some of the low end of the Pentium roadmap. So it's a powerful 
product from that perspective, John.
 
Brian M. Krzanich
 
At the end of the day, the market will go where the 
market goes and better 
to have a product like Bay Trail that we can play no matter where it goes 
rather than miss that market which if you look over the past was more than 
it is.
 
John Pitzer

Credit Suisse
 
Helpful guys. And then just my follow
-
on Stacy. S
everal years back, you put 
out a long
-
term gross margin target of sort of 55% to 65% and I think for 
most of the time since you've put that target out, you've been operating 
near the higher end of that range. I'm just kind of curious as you start 
bringing 
Bay Trail, Merrifield, put a renewed effort into the Atom space, 
should we think that the next three years that that range is going to be 
more directed towards the lower half or are there other puts and takes 
within that gross margin range?
 
Stacy J. Smith
 
As you probably anticipate I'm not going to get pinned down inside the 
range. I'm still very comfortable with the 55% to 65%. I think the second 
half is a great proof point. We're going to be 

 
from Q1 to Q3 we're going to 
quadruple our tablet volume. We'r
e running a 61% gross margin at the 
company level. As Brian said, the market's going to go where it's going to 
go. We've got some great products to give us a cost structure to go after 
them profitably and I'm still confident on that gross margin range and 
we'll 
talk more about the specific segments when we get to the investor meeting.

The next question comes from Stacy Rasgon from Sanford Bernstein.
 
Stacy Rasgon 
-
 
Sanford 
Bernstein
 
Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. First on the annual revenue 
guidance. Your prior guidance had total revenues up in the low single digits 
as well as total units up in the low single digits. With the new guidance of 
relatively flat revenue
, does that essentially imply flat total units? And if so, 
how important is the Bay Trail launch and Bay Trail volumes to actually 
achieving that type of a unit target?
 
Stacy J. Smith
 
Apology, Stacy, let me restate your question to make sure I'm 
answering 
because that was a little garbled in the middle and it's not your fault. We're 
just having some issues on our part. I think what you're asking me is kind of 
defend my flat revenue forecast and give you a sense of what's going on in 
client versus 
other segments of the business and in particular what's going 
on with units? Is that where you were going?
 
Stacy Rasgon 
-
 
Sanford Bernstein
 
Yeah, that's it. And if the guidance does actually imply flat units correlated 
with your revenue, how important is g
aining Bay Trail volume in the back 
half to achieving that type of a unit outlook?
 
Stacy J. Smith
 
Yeah, okay. Let me go there. So first I'd say we would actually expect that 
overall computer units, so tablets up to PCs will be down from this year. And 
that
's consistent with a flat revenue forecast for the company, so let me just 
kind of walk you through them and I'll just start with what you've seen from 
Gartner and IDC is their view of the year. We're pretty aligned with those 
numbers in terms of our view 
of the classic PC market. But to get to then 
our units you have to make some adjustments to that. So first off, in their 
class view of PCs that will not include some of the ultra
-
mobile devices, i.e. 
the Microsoft Surface Pro. So you'd add that in to get t
o our PC Client group 
units. We think we're gaining some share in tablets, so that's a little bit of an 
offset. Netbooks for us is declining pretty significantly. That's not in the PC 
Client groups segment. That's in the other IAG segment. And then as I sa
id 
earlier in my prepared remarks, we think we're gaining some share so that 
also gives us a little bit of help. But when you net all that out, you'd say our 
units and our revenue for the PC Client group is down over year
-
over
-
year. 
It's just not down as m
uch as the headline number that you see from 
Gartner. So you start there. And then the offset to that the places where 
we're growing is data center group which we think grows in the low double 
digits. If you do 

 
manage your ramp on that it's 20% of our re
venue. So 
that adds a couple of points of growth to the company. NAND is probably 
worth a point on its own is they look to be having a good year. Some other 
smaller things but you kind of net that out against the PC Client group that's 
down a bit and you g
et to flat for the year. So just kind of a rough map on 
viewing the different segments. Does that answer your question?
 
Stacy Rasgon 
-
 
Sanford Bernstein
 
No, that's very helpful. And as my follow
-
up, if I could carve into the data 
center a little bit. So yo
u are still 

 
looks like it's still looking for low double 
digits growth in this business that seems to be unchanged from the last 
couple of quarters. Does that not imply a very significant ramp both quarter
-
over
-
quarter and year
-
over
-
year? I mean in the b
allpark of 15% to 20% 
sequentially as well as year
-
over
-
year in the second half. Can you give us 
some, I guess, where you're confidence comes from that you're going to get 
that kind of growth in the data center in the second half? Is it all macro or is 
it 
something else? What drives that?
 
Brian M. Krzanich
 
Sure. This is Brian. I'll answer that one. Yeah, so we're still confident in the 
second half growth of our data center business overall. As we mentioned, 
we're seeing strong growth in the cloud, the high 
performance computing, 
our networking and our storage. We think those continue through the 
second half of this year. What was down as Stacy mentioned was 

 
the 
enterprise data centers were down a bit in the first half. We think as the 
macroeconomics contin
ue to improve through this year that picks up a bit. 
When you put that all together, we believe that 

 
absolutely our view is that 
we can continue through this year with that low double digit growth.
 
Stacy Rasgon 
-
 
Sanford Bernstein
 
The enterprise had to h
ave been down more than that, right? You said that 
the hard drive or storage and networking, all this other stuff was up 20% to 
40%. I think your total data center business in the first half year
-
over
-
year 
is just flat to up a little bit. So that enterpris
e piece had to have been down 
quite a bit year
-
over
-
year in the second. So you're saying you're going to 
see a very significant reversal of that trend in the second half?
 
Stacy J. Smith
 
Yeah. And from a [wonky] finance standpoint, realize there's also 
kind of 
prior period comparisons been going on in the first half of last year. We were 
in the steep part of the ramp for Romley. In the second half of this year, 
we'll be launching other versions of Ivy versions of the data center. So the 
short answer to y
our question is yes, I would expect some pretty steep 
quarter
-
on
-
quarter and year
-
on
-
year comps in the back half of this year. 
That is what we're planning for.

Deutsche Bank
 
Great.
 
First question is for Brian. That focus on the ultra
-
mobility side of 
things, can you talk a little bit about what that implies for the OpEx for 
Intel? The OpEx is elevated as a percentage of sales versus where it's been 
historically mainly on the R&D sid
e. My understanding is the majority of that 
spending is for the mobile effort. Is your efforts to expedite that process 
likely to mean more OpEx to deliver those better results? And maybe a 
follow
-
on to that is when do we get either results on the top line
 
happening 
or you rationalize some of that OpEx? Thank you.
 
Brian M. Krzanich
 
Sure. Let me start. The simple answer is no. We're not going to increase our 
OpEx spending and in fact, what we've really been focusing on is managing 
that as well. What 
you're going to see and remember, as we move our 
architecture more and more toward SOC, a lot of the work we do bridges 
between Core and Atom and as we pull Atom forward onto the leading
-
edge 
technology, again, that allows a lot of the architectural work t
o be in 
alignment and be shared amongst the two products. So, we believe that we 
can move faster on Atom and into this ultra
-
mobility space without having to 
change or increase our OpEx. So absolutely that's the current model that 
we're working under. From
 
when will you start to see it? Some of these 
changes have been started a while back and you see Bay Trail coming out 
towards the end of this year. It's a product that is on that Atom/Core that is 
truly industry leading. We talked earlier about there are a
 
lot of the 
benchmarks coming out showing it very strong against the competition if not 

start to see some of this just naturally over the next six months as Bay Trail 
ramps up an
d gets into production, but we have a series of products after 


pushing of the accelerator down and the thing just
 
gets faster and faster as 


and say well it's obviously that the Atom line has truly become strong and 
the

If I could just add to that, maybe I can give you a little bit of sense of where

down a few points
 
between where we were in Q2 in the end of the year in 
terms of spending as a percent of revenue and the expectation is we can 
come down more next year.

that, my answer for why OpEx won't go up. If you just take a look at what 

in 
both the reorganization that we did and flattening and decision making, and 

the OpEx and the CapEx that you saw. We expect that same level of 
efficiency to keep moving forward 
even as we make this transition. So to me 
those are not separated. Those go hand in hand actually as you become 
more efficient.

ah, I do. Switching gears again for BK but on the foundry side of things. I 


given your prior job. Can
 
you give us some benchmarks that we should 
watch for to being the success or lack there of that Intel plans to have and in 
generally speaking can you explain how your strategy and foundry maybe 
any different than the prior CEO?
 
Brian M. Krzanich
 
Sure. You
 
have to remember that even when you signup a foundry customer 
it's 18 to 24 or sometimes even longer 30 months before that foundry 
customer is able to start producing product, especially when they move from 
one foundry to another as they do go through the
ir design cycle and their 
product qualification. So you should think that even the customers that 




same timeline. I think again, Paul said it right, you want to kind of crawl, 

manage it. It's more 
--
 
you really want to
 
make sure that the systems and 
the customer support models that you have are in place to handle the 

business all our life we wanted to go and make sure we really knew what we 
were do

the walk space. I think that the philosophy we have moving forward is that 

talk to us about foundry opportunity in
dividually and look at them from a 
strategic standpoint, what size of business they bring and whether their 
products can really take advantage of our process leadership. And so we 

--
 


taking each customer individually and looking at them as an opportunity and 
what is the right thing for the shareholders from 

 
bringing value to the 
shareholders with this technology that we have.

Specific on the 450, is that the 450 question Jim?
 
James Covello

Well, yes that shell that you guys had articulated, there were sort of an 
extra $2 billion in the CapEx that was related to that 450 shell.
 
Stacy J. Smith
 
That one
 
is down a little bit, but not a lot. It does change my round. I was 


that large of a driver. I thi
nk its interesting when you deconstruct those 


 
at current run rate. You take out the 450, you can take out some of the 
capital has been spend not necessarily for our current pro
duction, but things 

in place and you get down to a run rate of CapEx kind of in support of the 

that ran
ge. That is I think a nice healthy level, nice sustainable level and I 
can run at that level and generate a 60% gross margin. So, it feels pretty 

the CapEx relative to the busines
s size.
 
James Covello 
-
 
Goldman Sachs
 
Sure. And if I 

 
I will use my follow
-


half spending is 409, so that would still imply pretty far bel

Obviously that shell 

 
may be a little more that shell comes in the back half, 
so that would be some of the increase in the back half CapEx. But can we 

some downside too
?
 
Stacy J. Smith
 
No. So first, the linearity actually, the more of that shell, most of that shell 
frankly is in the back half of the year, that shifts the linearity and you also 

bac

right balance between capital and demand, but I want to stress when you 
really deconstruct our CapEx at kind of $7 billion to $8 billion of capital being 
spent to support a busin
ess that's in the mid
-
$50 billion in revenue, it's the 
right level of CapEx. I'm very comfortable with that. It's not putting in a 
bunch of incremental capacity and it's a level that I can sustain, gross 
margin that's in that range as I've been talking abo
ut and kind of right at 
60%.

Robert W. Baird
 
Hi. Good afternoon. Years ago when Atom first 
launched, I think you had 
mentioned that Atom was slightly lower gross margin, but same or slightly 
higher operating margin than the corporate average. Is that view still 
holding with the new products that you're launching?
 
Stacy J. Smith
 
This is probably 
a better conversation for the investor meeting and keep in 
mind that Atom spans from servers to the PC segment of the market. Now 
we're enabling these 299 price points to phones, to tablets, right? So it's 
worthwhile to have a deeper discussion about the d
ifferent segments. As we 
articulated earlier, generally when you're looking at the predominance of our 
volume, the Core business, when Atom is price point replacing Celeron or 
Pentium, we're doing it at a better margin dollars per unit than we were 
selling
 
Celeron into that space and we're enabling lower price points. So 
from that perspective, it's a great product. It lets us kind of fight on the 
front foot and go after markets profitably that we had trouble to go after 
before. I'll save the rest probably u
ntil the investor meeting.

books obviously 
hasn't been enough to bring back PC unit growth this year. Should we have 
the view that PC is basically past the peak, continues to decline and if not, 
what catalysts do you see going forward and why 

 
what hasn't worked so 
far
 
could work later in revitalizing PC growth going forward?

So let me 

 
we had a hard time hearing that one because of the break and 
the networking problems we're having on this end. Let me try and repeat it 
and make sure 

 
I think probabl
y your question 

 
or the basic of your 
question was PCs have continued to decline. You've introduced Haswell. 
You're still forecasting a back half decline. What gives us confidence that 
we'll be able to turn that around or make any change in that? Did I ca
pture 
your question correctly?

Yes, that's correct. Thank you.

I'll answer first and Stacy can jump in. My answer would be simply Haswell 
has been not a single product launch. So let me first start with Has
well. We 
launched the Quad Core products in the second quarter. As we go into the 
third quarter, the Dual Core products, which go more into those lower price 
point region is actually going out to the market. So it's a staggered launch, 
which is a little bi
t different than we've done with some other product. So 
we're just now really starting to see the ramp of Haswell into the consumers' 
hands. So I think it's really way too early to say here's where Haswell is. And 
you're just going to see as we move into t
he second half some fan
-
less 
devices with Haswell. As we move forward, Bay Trail and 14
-
nanometer as 
we move into next year, well you can imagine we'll drive prices and battery 
life and the number of fan
-
less devices up even more. So that will be my 
first 
answer.
 
The second answer I'd tell you what's different moving forward, again we've 
kind of talked about this is Bay Trail. Bay Trail is going into some of these 
same classic PC devices that you see today. The clamshells where they've 
got touch
-
enabled cla
mshells coming down into the $300 range. You're 
going to see convertible clamshells where you can detach or flip and it 
access both a tablet or a PC in the sub
-
$400 range, right around $400. As 
we move into next year, those price points will continue to dr
op. So the fact 
that PCs especially with Bay Trail are going to move down into this, let's call 
it $200 to $400 range, is going to shift that market we believe as well and 
that's different than what's been out over the last few years. So you've got 
fan
-
les
s Haswell. You've got Bay Trail coming in. All of those things allowing 
devices that haven't been allowed in the past with our designs.

Thanks, Mark. During the thi
rd quarter, our revenue grew 5% sequentially 
and was flat versus the third quarter of 2012. Year
-
over
-
year PC CPU 
volume declines slowed and were offset by solid growth in the data center 
and enterprise. While consumer demand in emerging markets was sluggi
sh, 
we started to see early signs of improvement in North America and Western 
Europe. I see our performance in this environment as evidence of an 
increasingly broad and diverse product portfolio. I would like to highlight a 
few of the most important result
s from the quarter.
 
Following the launch of Ivy Bridge EP and the Atom
-
based Avoton SoCs, the 
Data Center group delivered all
-
time record revenue. DCG saw strength 
across its lines of business and geographies. Cloud revenue was up 40% 
year
-
over
-
year, stora
ge was up 20%, and high performance computing was 
up 27%. Even traditional enterprise servers were up a bit over the last year 
on the strength of our MP product line.
 
While the Data Center Group's results demonstrate some of Intel's core 
capabilities, we s
aw strong performance beyond DCG. Our embedded 
business grew 21% year
-
over
-
year, reaching an all
-
time record for revenue 
driven by communications infrastructure, transportation, the internet of 
things, and retail. Embedded revenue is well on its way to a d
ouble
-
digit 
growth year.
 
Just a few weeks ago, we announced our newest product family, Quark, an 
ultra
-
low power and low
-
cost architecture. And while any significant revenue 
impact is some time away, the architecture and the speed with which we are 
bringin
g it to market are evidence of the changes we are making to ensure 
we are in a better position to lead and define technology trends moving 
forward.
 
Finally, our NAND business grew 20% over last year. As enterprise and data 
center customers increasing use o
f high
-
performance SSDs have put this 
segment on a path to double
-
digit growth for the year. We continue to make 
progress with the industry's first 14 
-
nanometer manufacturing process and 
our second
-
generation 3D transistors. Broadwell, the first product o
n 14 
nanometers is up and running as we demonstrated at the Intel Developer 
Forum last month.
 
While we are comfortable with where we are at with yields, from a timing 
standpoint, we are about a quarter behind our projections. As a result, we 
are now planni
ng to begin production in the first quarter of next year.
 
In the Wireless business, I was pleased with our progress on LTE. Our 
multimode data modem is now available in the Samsung Galaxy Tab 3. By 
the end of the year, we expect to have voice
-
over
-
LTE vers
ions available for 
customers and our second generation of voice
-
over
-
LTE product with carrier 
aggregation will be available in the first half of next year.
 
Over the past couple of months, we have also launched 15 new 22
-
nanometer Atom SoCs. These products 
are designed for markets ranging 
from consumer tablets to cloud data centers. During the holiday selling 
season, you will see Atom SoCs and tablets as low as $99, and in 2
-
in
-
1 
systems as low as $349.
 
At the same time, you will also find Haswell Systems wi
th outstanding 
performance and 50% better battery life using Windows 8, Mac OS, and 
Chrome as low as $299. Together, Bay Trail and Haswell are making possible 
a range of innovative new form factors at breakthrough price points.
 
The past few years have seen
 
dramatic changes in the way consumers use 
and interact with technology, and those trends aren't slowing down. While 

appetite for computing has continued to grow.
 
We are going int
o the fourth quarter with the broadest portfolio in Intel's 
history, positioned to fully participate in all of that growth.
 
With that, let me turn the call over to Stacy.
 
Stacy Smith
 
Thanks, Brian. The third quarter revenue came in as expected and gross 
ma
rgin was slightly better than the mid
-
point of the forecasted range. Third 
quarter revenue came in at $13.5 billion, up 5% from the second quarter. At 
the segment level, the PC Client Group grew 4%, sequentially, and the Data 
Center Group grew 6%. The Data
 
Center Group returned to double
-
digit 
year
-
on
-
year growth in the third quarter growing 12% from a year ago. As 
expected, inventory levels across the worldwide PC supply chain grew 
slightly as customers built Haswell
-
based PCs, but inventory levels are sti
ll 
being managed well below historical averages.
 
For the fourth quarter of 2013, we are forecasting the mid
-
point of the 
revenue range at $13.7 billion, up 2% from the third quarter. Relative to the 
historical seasonal increase, the fourth quarter forecast
 
reflects the orders 
we are receiving from our customers and their desire to keep inventory 
levels lean.
 
Moving to gross margin, third quarter gross margin of 62% was up 4 points 
from the second quarter and up 1 point from our guidance. The increase 
from t
he second quarter was as a result of lower platform unit costs, higher 
platform revenue, and lower write
-
offs. In addition, factory start
-
up costs 
came down in the third quarter as spending on process engineers was 
reclassified from cost of sales to R&D.
 
F
or the fourth quarter, we expect gross margin to decrease by 1 point to 
61% as we increase factory spending on 14 nanometer. For the third 
quarter, spending was down $100 million from expectations and flat from 
the second quarter at $4.7 billion. The $100 
million decrease from 
expectations was as a result of a lot of small actions across the company to 
reduce spending. For the fourth quarter, we are forecasting spending 
consistent with the third quarter at $4.7 billion.
 
In order to better align resources wi
th our priorities, during the third quarter 
we approved and communicated several restructuring actions. Restructuring 
charges in the third quarter were just north of $100 million and we expect 
restructuring in the fourth quarter to be roughly flat. Operati
ng income for 
the third quarter was $3.5 billion with earnings per share of $0.58.
 
Taking a look at the balance sheet, total cash investments ended the quarter 
at $19.1 billion, up $1.8 billion from the second quarter. In the third quarter, 
we generated ap
proximately $6 billion in cash from operations, paid 
approximately $1 billion in dividends, purchased almost $3 billion in capital 
assets, and repurchased over $0.5 billion in stock.
 
Inventories were flat from the second quarter. The fourth quarter revenue
 
forecast of up 2% reflects the caution we are seeing from our customers due 
to weak consumer end markets for the PC segment of our business. That 
said, we are seeing some important positive trends. The enterprise market 
for PCs strengthened in the third q
uarter and the consumer markets in the 
U.S. and Europe appear to have bottomed out. Our Data Center business 
returned to double digit year
-
on
-
year growth based on a resumption of 
growth in the enterprise market segment and continued robust growth in 
cloud,
 
high
-
performance computing, and storage.
 
From a product perspective, we have an unprecedented line

also starting to see our customers come to market with Bay Trail based 
designs that will further extend our product line across screen sizes and 
price p
oints in both tablets and PCs. This extension of our product lineup 
across devices, price points, and operating systems positions us to grow our 
business across a broad range of compute devices.
 
With that, let me turn it back over to Mark.
 
Mark Henninger
 
A
lright. Thank you, Brian and Stacy. Moving on to Q&A, as is our normal 
practice we would ask each participant to ask one question and just one 
follow

up, if you have one. Nova, would you like to go ahead and introduce 
our first question please?

of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
 
Joe Moore

Morgan Stanley
 
Great, thank you. Can you talk about the future client market, if you look a 
the IDC dat
a, they actually showed sequential growth was a little higher 
than yours. So I know you have got tired of us asking all the time why you 
guys were above them when they were negative, just any reconciliation that 
you could give us on 

 
they looked like they
 
showed 8% sequential growth, 
a reconciliation of their numbers to yours.
 
Stacy Smith
 
Joy, I think when you get into the quarter
-
on
-
quarter movements, its hard 
to tie out. When we look at their view of the year and our view of the year, it 
still is roughly
 
in line. So it could come down to just what's happening in the 
inventory pipeline, sometime differences come down to what's happening in 
China. But I think we are pretty aligned with their view. Remember, our unit 
growth will be a little higher than what 
they show in their headline PC 
number because our unit growth will include things like tablets and 2
-
in
-

and things like that.
 
Joe Moore

Morgan Stanley
 
Great, and then the comment that inventories in the PC supply chain built 
slightly sequentially, bu
t it is still below normal. Can you characterize what's 
going on there and where do you expect that to go over the course for the 
rest of this year?
 
Stacy Smith
 
Yes, I think it's a continuation, Joe, of what we have seen over the last four 
or five quarters
 
that our customers are managing the worldwide inventory of 
PC supply to lean levels. I think it's a reflection of just how dynamic the 
industry is and in some of the markets how volatile it is, so they are keeping 
inventory levels low. That was true in Q2
. It's true in Q3, and the 
expectation in Q4 is that people will continue to manage things lean. I would 
say for our own inventory levels, you know, we have taken $1 billion
-
plus 
out of our aggregate inventory, it was relatively flat quarter
-
on
-
quarter. 
Ag
ain, as I think about Q4, I think we will keep our inventory levels flat
-
to
-
down from this.

Our next question comes from the line of Blayne Curtis of Barclays. Your line 
is open.
 
Blayne Curtis

Barclays
 
If you could just provide some general colo
r on when you look at your 
outlook of plus
-
2 within desktops, notebooks, and servers, did you expect all 
three segments to grow into December? Thanks.
 
Brian Krzanich
 
Sure. This is Brian. We don't see those as varying greatly amongst them, so 
we see all of 
those segments growing as we move into the fourth quarter. As 
we said in our prepared statements, what we saw in the third quarter and 
we believe will move into the fourth quarter as well is stabilization in what I 
will call the mature markets, the U.S., W
estern Europe, and with Asia and 
especially China still remains relatively volatile, and that's where we see the 
growth as well as in mature and emerging Western Europe and U.S. 
markets.
 
Stacy Smith
 
If I can get some color on the server portion, Brian, was
 
talking about the 
clients there. In the server market, we saw nice unit growth in Q3, and I 
would actually expect that unit growth on a year
-
over
-
year basis to 
accelerate in Q4, so I think we will have an acceleration of server, DCG 
revenue growth when we
 
get into the fourth quarter and that will be 
significantly above the corporate average.
 
Blayne Curtis 
-
 
Barclays
 
Thanks for that. Then maybe a little early on Bay Trail, but if you could just 
talk about the customer adoption and then any early indications
 
of sales of 
those products, and then as you look at just kind of touch
-
enabled device, 
have those expectations of adoption of that progressed through the year and 
as you look into the holiday season?
 
Brian Krzanich
 
Sure. This is again, Brian. Remember, Ba
y Trail has always been a second 
half and really a late second half introduction product and that was a pull
-
in, 

adoption. We have over 50 design wins with about half of those being 2
-
in
-
1 

other place Bay Trail is going into is tablets. We think that by Black Friday, 
you will see 8 to 10 SKUs on shelf, so that's the last thing we had hoped for, 
but that still shows 

 
the 50 design win shows really strong adoption.
 
The second part of your question was around touch, which is a broader 
question. We continue to see touch adoption growing month
-
by
-
month as 
the price points come down, and the price points at are now is below
 
$50. 
We have put touch as a requirement for the fourth
-
generation Core 
Ultrabooks, and you are seeing Bay Trail clamshells with touch enabled at 
$299, which is a new real price point for touch
-
enabled devices, so we see it 
continuing to grow as we enter n
ext year.
 
Operator
 
Our next question comes from the line of Patrick Wang of Evercore. Your line 
is open.
 
Patrick Wang 
-
 
Evercore
 
Great. Thanks a lot. You guys talked a lot about traction in your low
-
priced 
tablets, Chromebooks, handset, handset. Even 
you talked about Avoton and 
low power server. Your notebook ASP, I think, was also down slightly year
-
over
-
year. Can you give us some perspective on the trajectory of your ASPs 
longer term, and then 
--
 
I mean is there something that really concerns you 
guy
s?
 
Stacy Smith
 
ASP for us will really be a function of mix. I think, we have a very strong 
competitive position. When you think about the server segment of our 
business, the core segment of our product line, I think the pricing within the 
bands in those ma

even at that time period where our ASP increases has just been a function of 
mix. If I think out the next couple years, what is think often is is you will see 
those higher end price bands were driv
ing for some low level of growth. You 
will see faster growth at the low end price bands and then you will see faster 
growth in the server segment of our business. And how it plays out to the 
average is going to be a function of mix.
 
The thing you don't wan
t to lose here though, and we have talked about 
before is that we have very different cost structures among the different 

necessarily a bad thing relative to a Celeron, but it 
also has a much better 
cost structure relative to the Celeron.
 
Patrick Wang 
-
 
Evercore
 
I understand. Okay, thanks very much for that and then also, I think you 
talked about delays of Broadwell production by quarter. If you had ramped it 
this quarter, what 
would the impact have been to gross margins? I guess, in 
other words, what is some of the things we should think about when that 
production actually ramps?
 
Stacy Smith
 
So, no impact to Q3 gross margin. I think you are going to see that on 
reconciliation. A
nd no impact to Q4 gross margin from what we are 
expecting. As I kind of telegraphed on the call last time, 14
-
nanometer 
spending was projected and will increase quarter
-
on
-
quarter. That will be 
about 0.5 point decrement to gross margin, but that's the sam
e decrement. 
It will probably hit us in different buckets, but it's the same impact in gross 
margin.
 
Patrick Wang 
-
 
Evercore
 
Okay, and nothing different in the first quarter?
 
Stacy Smith
 
Yes, I also would give you the same answer as I think about 2014. Rou
ghly 
speaking, the spending on 14
-
nanometer is going to be the same, which 
means that the gross margin impact over the course of 2014 will be the 
same as it was. Again, it may hit in different buckets, but it will be the same 
gross margin impact.
 
Operator
 
Our next question comes from the line of Doug Freedman of RBC Capital.
 
Doug Freedman

RBC Capital
 
Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. And Stacy, if I could just build on 
that a little bit going through. Can you give us an idea of what type of 
startup
 
charges we are going to weather next year?
 
Stacy Smith
 

month. I will start to give some of the puts and takes in 2014 gross margin 
and how we are viewing the business. But it 
is related back to the question 
that was just asked on the 14
-
nanometer push. So let me walk you through 
a little bit about the categorization in Q4, which may give you some insight 
into how this could play out.
 
As I said and as Brian said, we are moving p
roduction on 14 nanometer out 
about a quarter. We are seeing an increase in 14 nanometer spending in Q4 
as we would have expected. What we thought a quarter ago and what I 
telegraphed on the call is, that as that spending increases and we start 
production,
 
we move cost from startup to production costs, but then we 
reserve it out. And if you remember last quarter on the call, I said expect 
some headwinds in Q4 to gross margin because we would have an increase 
in reserves. Well, as we push the production date
, what you will see is the 
same impact on gross margin but in Q4 there is likely to be a little bit of an 
increase in startup cost and then you won't see the reserve impact that we 
had expected a quarter ago. So slightly different buckets. I still expect n
ext 
year you will see a reduction in startup cost. It maybe a little less than what 
we have seen in other even number years but then you will see an offset on 
the other side of that of reserves, and so the same gross margin impact over 
the course of the ye
ar.
 
Doug Freedman 
-
 
RBC Capital
 
Great. So my follow
-
up, Brian, could you give us an idea of your first couple 
of quarters here and we have noticed clearly, with Quark and your move to 
try to make the company move a little quicker, we are now having 
restruc
turing charges. What are those restructuring charges targeted at and 
what might be some the trigger points that you have to make you move the 
shift in a different direction? Is the slowdown in PCs or notebooks? Is there a 
trigger point that makes you chang
e the way in which you attack some of 
these businesses?
 
Brian Krzanich
 
Sure. So first I would separate a bit the restructuring charges from our 
desire to move quicker and into broader markets. Restructuring charges 
were mostly around the shutdown of the Hu
dson, Massachusetts factory. 
That was really talking about a factory, that was our last 200 millimeter 
factory on 130 nanometer. That factory had just finished its life as factory 
and it couldn't be upgraded to 14
-
nanometers, so that what most of that 
was.
 
In general, restructuring charges aren't necessarily driven by how you 
move an organization like this into innovative new areas.
 
For me, the way I look at this is, this is really about pushing our architecture 
in both directions. It's moving down and movi
ng Atom to be more 
integrated, more capable with higher graphics and higher connectivity. Then 
moving up on the data center side with more robust products there, more 
integration up there and more unique products by customers and by 
workload to target thos
e areas that can utilize our core technology.
 
The trigger pose for me as we move through these is really around how fast 
the organization able to adapt, so we have a process coming where we want 
to be able to adjust products, because we believe these marke
ts haven't 
been changing up until the last minute before you shipped something, so 
three or four months before product is going to shipped, we want to get to a 
point where we could make changes in the characteristics of those products 
and we are always awa
y from that maybe a year, year
-
and
-
a
-
half, but we 
believe we can get to a place where we have to kind of flexibility and IT 
configuration that we can do that.
 
Stacy Smith
 
I think that I will give Brian a little more credit revenue he is giving 
himself. 
He is right there in the restructuring piece, the asset impairment is almost 
entirely driven by the factory. The larger portion of that is the people 
movement piece of it and I think Brian and Renee are both, moving fast in 
terms of picking areas 
where they want to make investment, picking areas 
where we are going to invest less and so that's the lion share of that 
particularly line item and in almost all of the Q4 number is just as we are 
looking to move people from one part of the company to make
 
investments 
in area where we think we are going to get an enhanced return.

Our next question comes from the line of John Pitzer of Credit Suisse. Your 
line is open, sir.
 
John Pitzer

Credit Suisse
 
Brian just a follow
-
up on the Broadwell. I am ju
st kind of curious why the 
push out? Can you elaborate a little bit? Is this is technical issue and if it is, 
why are you confident you overcame it or is this really a market issue? I.e. 
there's a little bit excessive Ivy Bridge inventory which is pushing 
out 
Haswell, which is the ramp, which is pushing Broadwell. If you could 
elaborate on that that would be great.
 
Brian Krzanich
 
Sure. It's absolutely not the latter. It was simply a defect density issue. This 
was on the issue 
--
 
as we develop these technolo
gies, what you are doing? 
You are continually improving the defect densities and those resulted in the 
yield, the number of die per wafer that you get out of the product and what 
happened as you insert a set of fixes in groups, you will put four or five, 
m
aybe sometimes six or seven fixes into a process and group it together, 
run it through and you will expect an improvement rate occasionally as you 
go through that. The fixes don't deliver all of the improvements [stock], we 
had one of those.
 
Why do I have 
confidence? Because, we have got back now and added 
additional fixes, gotten back onto that curve, so we have confidence that the 
problem is fixed, because we have actually data and defects and so that 
gives us the confidence that we are to keep moving for
ward now and that 
happens sometimes in these development phases like this, so that's why we 
are going to over it a quarter.
 
Member of Broadwell and Haswell are incompatible for the unit for the most 
part these will slide into existing systems and it delive
rs the next generation 
of the low
-
power Broadwell. Why? Which is you give even more capability for 
fanless core products, so we and our OEM partners have a strong desire to 
get Broadwell to the market, so if I could there would be nothing slowing 
down. Thi
s is a small blip in schedule and we will continue on from here.
 
John Pitzer 
-
 
Credit Suisse
 
Perfect. That's helpful, Brian. As my follow
-
up, Stacy, the last couple of 
quarters relative to the gross margin bridge or puts and takes you have kind 
of given AS
P as a potential allowance on the downside and I guess I didn't 
see that in Q4, which it kind of confuses me a little bit given that that's the 
Bay Trail quarter ramp and so 
-
 
or are you just getting more confidence as 
you are mixing lower that that ASP is
 
not a factor in gross margin and how 
should I think about that.
 
Stacy Smith
 
Well, I think it goes back to the question I asked earlier, so as we are 
successful with Bay Trail, it will cause the average ASP to come down in the 
client group but keep in mind
, we are forecasting a very robust growth rate 
in the data center. So you have the highest end of the Intel product family 
growing significantly faster than the rest.
 
John Pitzer 
-
 
Credit Suisse
 
Okay, thank you.
 
Stacy Smith
 
By the way, I think it is also n
otable in Q3. Our AFP was up a measure. 
There was about 0.5 point of gross margin good news which was better than 
I expected.

Our next question comes from the line of Romit Shah of Nomura. Your line is 
open.
 
Romit Shah 
-
 
Nomura
 
Great, thank you. O
n DCG, you guys have been talking about double digit 
annual growth target for the year. and just based on my math, you would 
need to grow data center plus 20% in the fourth quarter to get there. So 
could you talk a little bit about near
-
term momentum? Then
 
as a follow
-
up, I 
just wanted to ask about the Federal shut down. It seems like its dragging 
on. I am wondering if you are seeing any impact here, broader enterprise 
business?
 
Stacy Smith
 
This is Stacy. I will take those and Brian can editorialize on our 
elective 
representatives. On the data center, don't pin me down to exactly 10% 
growth but we are going to be within spitting distance of that for the year. 
That does imply a growth rate that's significantly accelerated from the 12% 
that we had in Q3 and th
at's what I expect and that's what Brian expects 
and GM of that business. Generally what we are seeing, and Brian talked 
about the really robust growth rates we are seeing in the cloud, high
-
performance computing, storage and we have seen a resumption of s
ome 
growth rate in the enterprise which has been the headwind that we have 
been facing in that business.
 
To your question on the debt deal and debate, I would say, we have not 
seen any impacts in our business. I think generally the financial markets 
have b
een pretty tame in their reaction to this. It is, in U.S. is going to make 
good on its debt applications.

Citi
 
Brian, I probably heard this one but just wanted to clarify. You made a 
reference earlier to MacOS. Were you suggesting that you would see Bay 
Trail devices in the MacOS?
 
Brian Krzanich
 
No, I said that we would have products across 
the board. It's Haswell.
 
Glen Yeung 
-
 
Citi
 
Okay, very good. Just wanted to clarify.
 
Brian Krzanich
 
That was a group thing. I think that comment was around Bay Trail and 
Haswell and all OS forms.
 
Glen Yeung 
-
 
Citi
 
Okay, glad we clarified that then. As a 
follow
-
up, I did want a little more 
color, if you would on what you are seeing in enterprise? It's just did what I 
have been seeing in the quarter as well but what I don't understand and 
hopefully you may have more color on it. Is the fact that as enterpri
se 
suggest they are back at maybe a more sustainable trend than we would 
otherwise see? And do you see any underlying reasons to why enterprise is 
maybe getting there?
 
Brian Krzanich
 
Well, so you are talking about the classic enterprise? I think this is a 
case 
where the restuff until recent times, especially in the U.S. as companies 
became more comfortable with what the spending horizon was going to be 
and what their projections for the rest of the year were, they started to 
unleash IT budgets and so we sta
rted to see an uptick in that, especially 
Western Europe and the U.S. started to grow again slightly. Do we think it 
will be continually at least through the fourth quarter? We are not making 
any projections yet for 2014. We will talk about those at our in
vestor 
meeting. But you can imagine that given where we are with cloud and 
networking and storage and the enterprise, we are seeing the same kind of 
projections.

Our next question comes from the line of Christopher Roland of FBR. Your 
line is open
.
 
Christopher Roland 
-
 
FBR
 
Guys, thanks for the question. I thought maybe you guys could give us a 
little more granularity into what's going on with the other IA operating loss. 
Do we think that this is about as large as it gets as Bay Trail ramps? How do 
we think about that on an ongoing basis? Is this a good run rate, or how do 
you guys sort of forecast that going forward?
 
Stacy Smith
 
I think, I can [anecdotally] say for right now it is not a good run rate. We 
don't enter businesses to lose money, so our 
intent is to improve it. I think 
it's probably worthwhile to talk about what's happening year
-
over
-
year, 
quarter
-
on
-
quarter, probably year
-
over
-
year is the more illustrative portion 
of that.
 
What you see going on in other IA is, first and foremost the embe
dded or 
the Intelligent Systems Group had a very good quarter, record revenues, 
robust growth rate, very profitable, offsetting that is really three things that 
impact the operating profit. First, netbooks are coming to the end of their 
life as category. W
e are down to some single
-
digit millions of revenue from 
netbooks. A year ago, that was pretty robust and those were pretty 
profitable products.
 
A year ago, if you recall, we were talking about a buying pattern from one 
particular customer in modem space t
hat didn't repeat this year, so you get 
a little bit of a year
-
on
-
year comp and then the other impact is this is a place 
where we have been making significant investments. The things that we 
have been talking about here of having products SoCs that span ac
ross price 
points, across operating systems. Those are places where we are making 
investments. We believe that investment is really important to the future of 
the company and we believe that investment gives us a differentiated 
competitive advantage out in
 
time and lets us bring the best products to the 
market out in time.
 
Christopher Roland 
-
 
FBR
 
Okay. Great. Thank you for that. Also on the Broadwell quarter push out, do 
we make up for that at some point in the future, or would this also push 
Skylake?
 
Bria
n Krzanich
 
We do not think it will push Skylake, so this is just 
-
 
and in fact will even 
make up in total volume within a quarter or two after the one quarter push, 
so we tend to make these up very quickly. The two are independent. The 
early learning that'
s going on during the process development has no impact 
on Skylake's ability to come to market.

Stifel, Nicolaus & Company
 
Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted few more details on the data 
center some of the moving parts. Stacy, you said that you expected unit 
growth to accelerate fourth quarter. Would that be because of the Avoton, or 
do you expect the ASPs to go up a
lso. Is that the mix shift going to higher 
performance servers?
 
Stacy Smith
 
Before you give an [inch], I think I am not going to get more granular than I 
got. I would expect that unit growth accelerates from what we saw in Q3 
and revenue growth accelerates
 
from the 12% year
-
over
-
year growth we 
saw in Q3. Can I get more granular than that?
 
Kevin Cassidy 
-
 
Stifel, Nicolaus & Company
 
Okay. Maybe if you could just tell us about the third quarter with ASPs up 
2%, was that mostly driven by the introduction of E5 
or is it an overall shift 
towards higher performance computing?
 
Stacy Smith
 
Yes. I would say it was probably more tied to the fact that the Enterprise 
segment went from decline to some single
-
digit growth and that is tied to 
the E5. It's a combination of t
hose two things, but the enterprise tends to 
buy pretty rich mix of MP that's why it's such an important segment for us 
and so single
-
digit growth there is pretty helpful.

Our next question comes from the line of Ambrish Srivastava from BMO. 
Your 
line is open.
 
Ambrish Srivastava

BMO
 
Thank you very much. My first question is on the guidance, Brian, and you 
told us that your guidance is based on what you are seeing, the order 
patterns that you are seeing. Just wanted a little bit more color as to i
n 
terms of form factors from your OEM customers as well as from you. There 
seems to be more out there, so in your opinion, what is it? Is it not the right 
form factor from OEMs, which is causing 
-
 
we wanted to understand the 
macro is pretty anemic, but in 
the contest of new products that are coming 
on, it has to be disappointing for you to see the order pattern, so what is in 
your opinion that's causing that and I had a quick follow
-
up after that 
please.
 
Brian Krzanich
 
I am not sure I can fully understand y
our question. If you question is around 
the number and variety of form factors, we are actually pretty excited about 
the rate of innovation we are seeing in 2
-
in
-
1s, in convertibles, in OS forms, 
Android, chromebooks and Win8, 8.1. So we have been pretty e
nthusiastic 
about what we are seeing. In fact we have been meeting with most of our 
customers and OEMs and looking at their Q1 lineup with them and I have 
been astonished by the amount of innovation and creative designs that are 
coming.
 
I think when you ta
lk about just the market in general how we see it, we are 
trying to bring innovation to the PC but we are also trying to move into 
these markets that are growing already like tablets and phones. So our view 
is that at the end of the day, the customers are 
going to choose their form 
factors.
 
Tablets are absolutely here to stay and we plan to participate in those and 
that's why you see us in tablets from $99 to $350. Our job is try and 
innovate and actually drive capabilities into the tablet space that nobody
 
else 
could deliver and bring that valuation and drive up in those markets.
 
Across PCs, we believe that as 2
-
in
-
1s, especially Haswell based 2
-
in
-
1s with 
all
-
day battery come to life, we are already seeing some signs of tablet 
market share win back as thes
e 2
-
in
-
1 devices, especially in enterprise and 
the business side hit the market and people see the value of having both 
devices. The best of both devices, a tablet and a PC, all
-
in
-
one.
 
So we believe that as we go through the fourth quarter and we get more
 
of 
these devices out there, we will see how this plays out over time now.
 
Ambrish Srivastava

BMO
 
Okay, that's helpful. Then on the pricing front. Stacy, you highlighted, yes, 
pricing could be lower on the mix but then cost is lower for Bay Trail. But I 
am just looking at the dichotomy in desktop and notebook and maybe there 
is a very simple explanation. Desktop volume is down year
-
over
-
year, ASP is 
up, notebook is the reverse on the ASP front, their ASP is down year
-
over
-
year but volume is down as well. 
So could you just help me understand why 
the difference in the two trends? Thank you.
 
Stacy Smith
 
Well, I think what we are seeing is, we have seen notebook pricing coming 
down over time as that becomes a broader and broader market. So I think 
its as simpl
e as that. I think the desktop piece is really interesting. What we 
are seeing in the desktop, again I am kind of zooming out and taking a two
-
year view. You have seen a segment that's been relatively slow growth
 
I think of it as a single
-
digit percent gro
wth but a lot of segmentation 
happening within the category. So it has gone from the desktop business 
being primarily these beige boxes to all
-
in
-

performance devices that are doing gaming as well as these 
ver
y cost

effective machines for first

time buyers in emerging markets. So 
you are seeing this hyper segmentation as a category and more stability in 
the pricing as a result because we have these different segments.
 
I think we are on the verge of seeing that 
kind of segmentation play out now 
in the notebook segment with what we are seeing with 2

1s and 
ultrabooks and detachables and convertibles. So it will be interesting to 
watch that play out.

Thank you. First question is on CapEx. Stacy, is the cut due mostly to 450. 
You had said before 
that there was no push out in the timing but some of 
the companies selling equipment are saying that there has been some push 
outs. So I am just wondering where that cut is coming from? Thanks.
 
Stacy Smith
 
You are talking about the $200 million. No, there 
is actually no cut in there. 
We are just refining our forecast as we get down to one quarter left in the 
year.
 
Timothy Arcuri

Cowen and Company
 
Got it, great. So just to be specific on the timing on 450, nothing has 
changed there?
 
Brian Krzanich
 
So let m
e answer that one. We have not changed our timing. We are still 
targeting the second, latter half of this decade. We continue to see great 
value in 450. It brings tremendous economic value to everybody who 
participates in it. We continue to work with our p
artners. We are here part of 
the joint development program in New York, continuing to work on 450. We 
continue to work with our partners, especially TSMC and Samsung and we 
are still targeting the back half of this decade. This is a long 10
-
year 
program wh
en you really take a look at it. So I think you will get mixed 
signals throughout those 10 years, take a look at the long
-
term trend and 
then really start to understand the economic value here and you will see we 
will get there in the end.

Thanks very much. Bay Trail. If I'm not mistaken there are Android tablets 
using Clover Trail+ the currently available, when might we expect Android 
ta
blets using Bay Trail in the market?
 
Brian Krzanich
 
You are absolutely right there, several tablets out there currently today with 
Clover Trail+ using Android. What I told you was, there are about 50 designs 
on Bay Trail, about 20 of those are 2
-
in
-
1s, pro
bably 25, 20 of them are Bay 
Trail tablets on Android, there is going to be about eight systems on shelf, 
eight to 10 systems on shelf, we believe, by the say Black Friday timeframe. 
Most of those will be Android tablets.
 
David Wong

Wells Fargo
 
Okay. Gre
at. Could you 
-
knocking on what proportion of your core family 
sales will be Haswell in the December quarter and are you seeing Haswell, 
why being extensively adopted in tablets or is it primarily the regular 
Haswell that goes into tablets in 2
-
in
-
1s?
 
Stac
y Smith
 
Yes. We don't give to that level of granularity to break out our sales by 
product family. I think, Brian gave you some good insight into the number of 
systems that we see coming to the market, a lot of which will be there 
before Black Friday and th
en even more of that kind of build out over the 
course of Q1. I'll let Brian answer the Haswell
-
Y.
 
Brian Krzanich
 
You asked Haswell
-
Y versus [Haswell]. First, most of the tablets we are 
building with OEM partners are Bay Trail or as you said Clover Trail+ 
based. 
There are some that are being based on core; most of those are being based 
on the standard core product. Haswell
-
Ys are going into the fanless systems 
or extremely low powered 2

1s.
 
Mark Henninger
 
Operator, we would like to go ahead and take two 
more questions, please?
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jim Covello, Goldman 
Sachs. Your line is open.
 
Jim Covello

Goldman Sachs
 
Great. Thanks so much for taking the question. Stacy, something you had 
alluded to in your prese
ntation at the Developer Forum. I wonder where you 
think die sizes are headed on average for the company given some of the 
moves into these different markets that you talked about.
 
Stacy Smith
 
Again, it's going to be similar to the ASP question. When you a
re talking 
average die size, it's really going to be a function of mix, so it becomes hard 
to answer. I think when you look at it by segment, we are improving our 
cost structure in each of the segments of the business. The die size is going 
to get better a
nd the core family, it's going to get better and Bay Trail. It's 
going to get better in the tablet segment of the business, but the mix will 
really dictate the average. I don't know Brian, if you want to add anything to 
that.
 
Brian Krzanich
 
Yes. I 
would agree with Stacy. Each of one of the families of the products we 
have roadmaps even with integration, but because of Moore's Law we are 
able to continually drive down the die size. It's going to be mix dependent, 
we think if you look at the average m
ix, it will be down slightly, but it's not a 
dramatic drop at least. Again, it will be mix
-
driven.
 
Jim Covello 
-
 
Goldman Sachs
 
Okay. That's helpful. Then if I could ask for my follow
-
up, in terms of the 
mobile market, the handset market in particular, how 
important do you think 
connectivity in the other surrounding pieces around the processor are for 
Intel to be successful in this market? How do you feel you are positioned in 
those complementary pieces around the processor?
 
Brian Krzanich
 
Sure. The connecti
vity and comps both are very important. We had Wi
-
Fi for 
12
-
plus years, so our position in Wi
-
Fi is good. We have made acquisitions in 
GPS and GNSS lately to add to our portfolio. We talked about in the 
prepared statements about our progress on LTE and we 
actually believe we 
are making great progress in LTE.
 
We added LTE data now, LTE data and voice by the end of the year, LTE with 
carrier aggregation first half of next year. That's very good progress in our 
mind on LTE. I want to remind you though, but it'
s really when you take a 
look at these SoC products, it's about all of the IPs.
 
So you have got to get the graphics right. You have got to get the 
connectivity right. You have got to get the comps right. We really have a 
drive to both our individual IPs co
rrectly there and then to integrate them 
into the silicon. That's kind of the order that you have to do with it. You have 
to go get the IP correct. That's why you see our LTE products are standalone 
now. Then you integrate them in once you get the capabili
ty in a standalone 
product. We will be working on that next year.

Our final question comes from the line of Vivek Arya from BoA/Merrill Lynch. 
Your line is open.
 
Vivek Arya

BoA/Merrill Lynch
 
Thanks for taking my question. Brian, my first question is, within DCG can 
you help us quantify traditional enterprise versus some of the growth 
categories in cloud storage and networking? And where I am going with that 
is, when does th
is latter growth part start dominating and what are the 
implications on ASP when that happens?
 
Brian Krzanich
 
I have never done a calculation on when they would overtake enterprise. If 
you take a look at it, we said that cloud, storage, networking, we are 
growing plus 20%. But I would have to go back and take a look. We can 
have that discussion maybe at the Investor Meeting on how those 
percentages of the business change over time.
 
Stacy Smith
 
Vivek, if you go back and look at last year's Investor Meeting, 
you will see 
something presented by Diane that actually very explicitly breaks out the 
size of the different segments and the growth rate and what you will see 
there is enterprise is 40%, 50% of the overall enterprise segment. These 
other segments in aggre
gate are overtaking it, kind of as we speak and 
growing really fast. We will talk a lot more about that in a month.
 
Vivek Arya

BoA/Merrill Lynch
 
Got it, and then as my follow
-
up. I wanted to just get a sense for how much 
of a leapfrog advantage will 14 n
anometer provide in the mobile market 
because recently we saw very impressive benchmarks from Apple on their 
A7 SoC. I understand that they optimized a lot of things within their system 
that other customers may not be able to do but they were able to show 
very 
impressive benchmarks on 28 nanometer silicon. I am wondering as you 
think about your 14 nanometer products and the fact that you will really 
need to leapfrog to get major share in mobile how should we think about 
how big those advantages will be, lik
e what the discussion with customer 
have been so far?
 
Brian Krzanich
 
Sure. So, let's make sure, I mean you just kind of used the generic word of 
benchmarks and there are lot of different ones that are out there. So I am 
not sure exactly which ones you are 
talking about. But if you just take a look 
at our products and all of our products are 64
-
bit. So we have had that for 
an extended period of time and products that we are shipping today are 
already 64
-
bit. If you take a look at things like transistor densi
ty and you 
compare, pardon the pun, apples
-
to
-
apples and you compare, say, the A7 to 
our Bay Trail, which is the high density 22 nanometer technology then our 
transistor density is higher or more dense than the A7 is. So it's a good 
product. I am not in an
y way trying to deface that, but we do see the 
Moore's Law advantage from 28 to 22 nanometer as an example, when you 
compare dense technologies to dense technologies.
 
We believe 14 nanometer it just an another extension of Moore's Law. So it 
will have that
 
same roughly twice density that you will see between 28 and 
22 nanometer. You will see that same kind of increase or improvements as 
you move to 14. It is a true 14 nanometer technology. Did I answer your 
question?
 
Vivek Arya 
-
 
BoA/Merrill Lynch
 
Yes. So B
rian, maybe what I was trying to get to was, as you look at the 
kind of Android customers or Chrome customers that you might engage with 
14 nanometer. How is that changing from the engagement that you have 
with Bay Trail? Basically the question is, is the 
level of engagement 
accelerating as they look at your 14 nanometer progress?
 
Brian Krzanich
 
So, yes. From that perspective, they see a roadmap now. I think more 
importantly than just 14 nanometer. What they see is a roadmap from us 
around the Atom SoC. The
y see Bay Trail as a great first step and great 
product. You have seen some of the performance benchmarks out there. We 
just talked about the transistor density. Stacy has talked about our cost and 
ability to hit these lower prices points. It has got good 
graphics performance. 
As I said we are able to provide a 64
-
bit solution across all OS options as 
well.
 
So they look at that and then they look at our roadmap, and say okay, they 
have got LTE, they have got connectivity, they have got a standalone, they 
ha
ve plans to integrate those technologies in, in a basic SoC. They are 
starting to build confidence in our roadmap along with us. That's, I think, 
what they really look at this as they see our Atom roadmap that's highly 
competitive.

Thank you and welcome, eve
ryone, to Intel's second quarter 2016 earnings 
conference call.
 
By now you should have received a copy of our earnings release and the 
CFO commentary that goes along with it. If you've not received both 
documents, they're available on our investor website,
 
intc.com. I'm joined 
today by Brian Krzanich, our CEO, and Stacy Smith, our Chief Financial 
Officer. In a moment, we'll hear brief remarks from both of them, followed 
by the Q&A.
 
Before we begin, let me remind everyone that today's discussion contains 
for
ward
-
looking statements based on the environment as we currently see 
it, and as such, does include risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our 
press release for more information on the specific risk factors that could 
cause actual results to differ materi
ally.
 
Also, if during this call we use any non
-
GAAP financial measures or 
references, we'll post the appropriate GAAP financial reconciliation to our 
website, intc.com.
 
So with that, let me hand it over to Brian.
 
Brian M. Krzanich

& Director
 
Thanks, Mark.
 
Our top line results for the quarter came in right in line with outlook, and 
profitability this quarter exceeded our expectations. Year
-
over
-
year growth 
this quarter was 3% overall, as we transform Intel into a company that 
powers
 
the cloud and billions of smart connected devices.
 
We continue to focus on growth in line with this transformation, as 
evidenced by results in the data center, IoT, and Programmable Solutions 
business this quarter. I'd like to take a few minutes to walk t
hrough these 
results and their implications.
 
I'll start with the Client Computing Group, where we saw a 3% decline in 
revenue year over year this quarter, while operating margin was up 19%. 
These results were a little better than we expected, as the PC sup
ply chain 
reduced inventories at a slightly slower rate, while the 2
-
in
-
1 and enthusiast 
product lines continued to grow. We also started shipping our seventh 
generation Core microprocessor, formerly known as Kaby Lake, and our 
latest LTE modem, known as 7
360.
 
Next, the data center, where revenue grew 5% year over year, cloud 
services providers grew 9%, comm service providers grew 10%, and 
enterprise was down 1%. We achieved some critical milestones in the 
quarter that give us confidence in our growing mome
ntum as we enter the 
second half of the year.
 
In the data center, we're seeing an ongoing preference for performance up 
and down the pricing stack. Average selling prices increased year over year 
in every microprocessor product segment from Atom and Xeon D
 
SOCs at 
the low end, up through Xeon and Xeon Phi at the high end. We continued to 
gain share in Network Infrastructure throughout the entire segment, as Intel 
architecture becomes the solution of choice for the transformation of the 
network to SDN, NFV, 
and 5G. The significant share gains at the low end of 
the Network Infrastructure segment resulted in an overall 1% decline in data 
center CPU average selling prices.
 
Progress in the data center extended beyond our CPU product lines. Our 
latest Xeon Phi acc
elerator, formerly known as Knights Landing, continued to 
ramp after shipping the first limited production units in December of last 
year. Xeon Phi revenue grew 8x in the first six months of this year versus all 
of 2015, gaining share in the supercomputing
 
and machine learning 
segments.
 
Omni
-
Path, our high
-
performance computing fabric, was launched earlier 
this year and has already achieved 30% market segment share of the 100
-
gig fabric market. In June's Top 500 Supercomputing list, Omni
-
Path was 
deployed i
n half of the new 100
-
gig systems, pointing to the performance 
that this technology brings to the market.
 
This quarter, we also shipped our first silicon photonics products for 
revenue, the industry's only fully integrated solution. We expect DCG's 
adjacen
t product lines, including Omni
-
Path, silicon photonics, and Ethernet, 
to collectively grow more than 20% for the full year and this quarter make 
up 12% of DCG's revenue.
 
The Internet of Things business was up 2% over last year, coming in below 
our expecta
tions. We saw growth in the industrial and video verticals, offset 
by an inventory burn after a very strong first quarter. We continue to see 
tremendous potential in this business.
 
A great example was demonstrated earlier this month when we announced 
our a
utonomous driving collaboration with BMW and Mobileye, marking a 
significant step for the auto industry as we work together to establish an 
industry standard open platform for autonomous driving. In addition, we are 
bringing Indian computing technology to 
power the next generation of 
BMW's highly autonomous and fully autonomous products, from the door 
locks to the data center.
 
Our Memory business was down 20% over last year and fell short of our 
expectations as a result of a more competitive pricing environ
ment. While 
we acknowledge the cyclical and competitive nature of this business, we 
remain confident in our long
-
term growth prospects as a result of the new 
technologies we are bringing to this market.
 
Fab 68 in Dalian, China, started its initial 3D NAND 
wafers late in the second 
quarter, but ahead of schedule. We also remain on track to ship 3D XPoint 
SSDs, branded Optane, by the end of the year, and look forward to 
delivering this exciting new breakthrough in memory to the industry.
 
The Programmable Solu
tions Group, formerly known as Altera, delivered 
great results. PSG grew 12% over Altera's results last year on strength in 
comms, infrastructure, and the channel. PSG is on track to ship 14
-
nanometer Stratix 10 samples this year, and I'm very pleased with
 
both the 
integration of this business and their strong execution.
 
Our Security business was up 10%, as the restructuring the team completed 
last year and their focused execution continues to deliver results.
 
And finally, our restructuring initiative that 
we began last quarter is solidly 
on track. This program is changing where and how we invest in everything 
from research and development to sales and marketing. In April, we 
announced some important changes to our roadmaps in areas like SOCs and 
perceptual 
computing. These changes are accelerating our transformation to 
a company that powers the cloud and the billions of smart connected 
computing devices while increasing the profitability in our client business. In 
total, we expect this initiative will drive 
net run rate OpEx savings of $1.4 
billion by mid
-
2017.
 
Looking ahead, I'm very excited about the growing momentum heading into 
the second half of the year. While we remain cautious about the PC segment 
and continue to expect a decline in the high single di
gits this year, we're 
expecting our businesses outside of CCG to collectively deliver double
-
digit 
growth in the third quarter.
 
We are seeing clear signs that our strategy is working, laying a solid 
foundation for growth built on the data center and the In
ternet of Things 
business, reinforced by the combination of memory and FPGAs and bound 
together by connectivity.
 
With that, let me turn it over to Stacy.
 
Stacy J. Smith 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
 
Thanks, Brian.
 
In the second 
quarter, we met our financial commitments and made good 
progress towards our restructuring goals. Our forecast reflects growing 
momentum as we enter the back half of 2016.
 
Revenue for the second quarter was $13.5 billion, in line with expectations 
and up 3
% year over year. Gross margin for the quarter of 62% was 
approximately a point higher than our expectations, primarily driven by 
lower platform unit costs.
 
Spending on R&D and MG&A was $5.2 billion, in line with our expectations. 
We are on track to the re
structuring announced on the last earnings call, 
with a reduction of about 6,000 employees in the second quarter.
 
Operating income of $3.2 billion was down 2% from a year ago. The 
effective tax rate for the quarter was 20%. Earnings per share at $0.59 was 
down $0.03 from a year ago.
 
The Client Computing Group had revenue of $7.3 billion, down 3% year over 
year. Client Computing Group operating profit was $1.9 billion, up 19% from 
a year ago. This improvement is driven by lower overall spending and 
margin im
provements in our mobile products and higher ASPs in the PC 
segment. The worldwide PC supply chain inventory levels came down a bit in 
the second quarter, and as we enter the second half they are at healthy 
levels.
 
Data Center revenue was $4 billion, up 5%
 
year over year. The Data Center 
Group had operating profit of $1.8 billion, down 4% year over year, 
primarily driven by increased costs as we ramp 14
-
nanometer data center 
products. As we enter the second half, we expect the enterprise segment of 
the busi
ness to stabilize and the cloud segment growth rate to accelerate. In 
addition, we expect increasing ASPs as we ramp our Broadwell
-
based server 
products.
 
Our Internet of Things segment achieved revenue of $572 million, with year
-
over
-
year growth of 2%. Our
 
security business had revenue of $537 million, 
up 10% year over year. Our memory business had revenue of $554 million, 
down 20% year over year. This segment had an operating loss of $224 
million as a result of continued pricing pressures, higher startup c
osts as we 
ramp 3D NAND in our China factory, and increased 3D XPoint spending.
 
The Programmable Solutions Group had revenue of $465 million, up 12% 
year over year when compared to Altera's results from a year ago. Operating 
profit was negative $62 million
. This includes about $160 million in non
-
cash 
charges for inventory adjustments. Excluding these charges would result in 
about $100 million in positive operating profit.
 
Total cash balance at the end of the quarter was roughly $17.7 billion, up 
$2.6 billi
on from the first quarter. Our total debt is $28.6 billion. Our net 
cash balance, total cash less debt and inclusive of our other longer
-
term 
investments, is negative $5.7 billion. We are projecting to improve this net 
cash balance over the second half of 
the year.
 
We are generating healthy levels of free cash flow, which enable us to invest 
in our business and return cash to shareholders. This is demonstrated our 
Q2 results, as we generated $3.8 billion of cash from operations in the 
second quarter, purcha
sed $2.3 billion in capital assets, and repurchased 
approximately $800 million of stock. In the second quarter, we also paid 
$1.2 billion in dividends. And as of yesterday's close of market, our dividend 
yield was about 3%.
 
As we look forward to the third 
quarter of 2016, we are forecasting the 
midpoint of the revenue range of $14.9 billion. This forecast is at the high 
end of the average seasonal increase for the third quarter. We are 
forecasting the midpoint of the gross margin range to be 62%.
 
Turning to
 
the full year 2016, we expect revenue growth in the mid
-
single 
digits. We continue to expect the overall PC market to be down in the high 
single digits, and we expect to achieve low double
-
digit growth in our Data 
Center business. Gross margin for the ful
l year of 2016 is expected to be 
62%, consistent with our prior outlook.
 
You can see our strategy playing out in our first half results and our 
expectations for the second half. We expect above
-
seasonal growth in the 
back half of the year, led by strong gr
owth in the Data Center, Internet of 
Things, and Memory businesses. And for the year we expect that growth in 
those businesses will offset the PC market decline, and with the addition of 
the Programmable Solutions Group, will result in mid
-
single
-
digit rev
enue 
growth.
 
Additionally, we are executing to our restructuring program, which allows us 
to increase investments in strategically important areas, generate financial 
returns for our owners, and build the foundation for future financial growth.
 
With that, 
let me turn it back over to Mark.

Okay, thank you, Brian and Stacy. Moving on now to the Q&A, as is our 
normal practice, we would ask each participant to ask one question and one 
follow
-
up if you hav
e one. Operator, please go ahead and introduce our first 
questioner.
 
Question
-
and
-
Answer Session
 
Operator
 
Our first question comes from the line of Chris Danely of Citigroup. Your line 
is now open.
 
Christopher B. Danely

Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Br
oker)
 
Hey, thanks, guys, just a question on the server expectations for the second 
half. What's giving you the confidence that things are going to bounce back 
so nicely?
 
Brian M. Krzanich 
-
 
Chief Executive Officer & Director
 
Sure, I'll start and then Stacy
 
can add. This is Brian, Chris. I think it's really 
a mix of a couple of things. One, we saw in the second quarter and we 
project out into the second half a bit of stabilization of the enterprise side of 
the market. The enterprise side was down only about 
1%, which is a bit 
more stable than it has been. Second thing is we are ramping our Broadwell 
E server in the second half of the year, and so we expect strong demand. 
And we typically see an ASP uplift as people by up in the stack with these 
new server sys
tems coming out. And we have customer signals that just 
indicate that there's a second half seasonal buying pattern kicking in a bit as 
well. So those three things are the second half keys.
 
And if you take a look at a broader view of this or just overall, 
our view of 
the data center and really the cloud continues to be that the cloud is going 
to continue to expand. It's going to be driven by the many, many machines 
that connect to the cloud that drive orders of magnitude more data than 
what the average huma
n creates today, and that's getting to the cloud. So 
there's the short versus the longer
-
term point of view. I don't know, Stacy, if 
there's anything you want to add.
 
Stacy J. Smith 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
 
Perfect.
 
Christopher B. Danely 
-
 
Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)
 
And for my follow
-
up, you mentioned you started shipping the 7360. Was 
that material to Q2 or will it be material to the second half, and any 
comments on profitability there?
 
Stacy J. Smith 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
 
I'm not going to talk specifically about the 7360 because our policy is to let 
our customers announce any design wins that they want to announce when 
they want to announce them.
 
In terms of the overall imp
act on financials, when I look at the second half, 
you'll note that we have an above
-
seasonal growth rate in there. The biggest 
driver of that is what Brian just talked about in the data center, so that's the 
biggest driver. We were below the average annua
l growth rate in the first 
half. We expect to be above that, low double digits, in back half, driven by 
the three things he talked about, in particular the cloud buying patterns that 
we've identified with some of those large customers. And then behind that
, 
we see an improvement in revenue in Memory and an improvement in 
revenue in IoT. And so those are the big drivers as we go into the back half.
 
Christopher B. Danely

Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)
 
Thanks, guys.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. And our next 
question comes from the line of John Pitzer of 
Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.
 
John William Pitzer

Credit Suisse Securities (

) LLC (Broker)
 
Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for letting me ask a que
stion. Stacy, you did a 
nice job relative to the full year guidance giving us your expectation for PC 
demand for the year. I'm just curious. As you look into the third quarter, the 
guide is the high end of normal seasonality, as you talked about. How would
 
you characterize your view of the PC business going into Q3? And to the 
extent that it's still a subdued view, is this really confidence in data center, 
or what other parts of the business would drive above
-
seasonal 

 
or high 
end of seasonal, sorry?
 
Brian
 
M. Krzanich 
-
 
Chief Executive Officer & Director
 
Hey, John, how about if I start on just the view of the PC, especially into the 
third quarter, and then Stacy can get into where is the above
-
seasonal 
numbers coming from and all? I think if you look at the
 
second half, we 
already said that Q2 ended up being a little bit better than what we had 
anticipated, and we had built the year at the high single digits. And if you 
take a look at Q2, it ended up coming at the mid
-
single
-
digit decline. We've 
tried to be 
relatively cautious as we look out into the rest of this year and 
built the year and the forecast around that high single
-
digit number set for 
decline of the PC. We are carrying momentum out of Q2, so there's still data 
that needs to be collected on how it
 
looks. But right now we've maintained 
our cautious view of high single digits.
 
Stacy J. Smith 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
 
So just to translate that into seasonality against the backdrop of what Brian 
just said, which is high singl
e
-
digit decline in the PC business, we're 
expecting that segment to play out more or less seasonally, John. We tend 
to do a little bit better than that because of mix and ASP, but from a unit 
standpoint should be fairly seasonal. And then the driver is wha
t I just 
talked about. The data center growth rate as we move into the back half 
should be significantly higher than what we saw in the first half based on 
stabilization in enterprise, what we see with the cloud customers, and then 
some ASP uplift as we ra
mp Broadwell server 

 
14
-
nanometer Broadwell 
servers into the product mix.
 
John William Pitzer 
-
 
Credit Suisse Securities (
USA
) LLC (Broker)
 
That's helpful, guys. And then maybe for my follow
-
up, just loo
king at the 
Memory businesses, as you guys characterized, tough quarter in the June 
quarter. If you annualize the operating loss, it's a fairly large number. I'm 
just curious. Have startup costs there peaked, or do we have another couple 
of quarters of sta
rtup costs going up in Memory? And I guess more 
importantly, as Dalian ramps and you think about XPoint, how should we 
think about your profitability goals longer term and what the fall
-
through on 
that business looks like as revenue does start to accelerat
e?
 
Stacy J. Smith 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
 
So there's a short
-
term and a long
-
term component to this. So in the short 
term, as I think about the second half, in rough math I'd expect a consistent 
loss in the second half to what 
we saw in the first half. I think startup costs 
will be slightly higher. We'll see the first production costs play through on 3D 
XPoint, which as you know from watching us over the years, those first 
production costs tend to be fairly high in any factory w
hen you're starting it 
up. Offset by the underlying existing NAND business, I think it's a bit better 
as we go into the back half. So that's the short
-
term answer.
 
To your longer
-
term question, and I'll turn this over to Brian to talk about 
the technology,
 
but I think the combination of 3D NAND and the cost 
structure we're going to achieve and then the disruptive nature of 3D XPoint, 
we should have a very good value proposition and a very good overall profit 
position for the business.
 
Brian M. Krzanich 
-
 
Ch
ief Executive Officer & Director
 
Yeah, John, I would just echo what Stacy said. We're just now starting to 
ramp our 3D NAND. So as we go through this back half of this year and into 
next year, it's really starting to ramp up. We think large cost advantages
 
and good performance position there. And then as we said, 3D XPoint SSDs 
start to ship at the end of this year, 3D XPoint DIMMs next year. And so 
these investments that we're making this year, which we've talked about, 
are really playing forward those two
 
technologies. So we're still very bullish 
on the long
-
term prospects. The units and the gigabytes continue to grow. 
Our cost structure gets better and better as we go through the back half and 
into next year. And then 3D XPoint, as we said, will really in
 
our minds 
change the whole memory storage architecture.

Thank you.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Joe M
oore of 
Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.
 
Joseph L. Moore 
-
 
Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
 
Great, thank you so much. I wonder if you could talk about first the data 
center. The growth 

 
your mid
-
single
-
digit growth for about three 
consecutive 
quarters, and I know you had higher expectations for that a few 
quarters ago. Can you talk about 

 
is that entirely an enterprise 
phenomenon, or is that a timing issue around cloud? Just how should we 
think about the last few quarters of DCG?
 
Stacy J. Smit
h

Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
 
Yeah, I'd say 

 
so overall, relative to the expectations we had at the 
beginning of the year, let's say, it's primarily enterprise driven. And then 
there's some 

 
what we commonly use as lumpiness quar
ter on quarter. So 
to how you ask the question, we actually weren't surprised by the Q2 
results. In fact, they came in right in line, actually just a hair above what our 
internal forecast was. We have I think pretty good insight into the large 
cloud custom
ers, and so we had some good insight into the buying patterns 
as those customers went from Q1 to Q2. And now as we look at the back 
half, we see several purchasing cycles kicking in for some of the large guys. 
So we expect that the cloud piece will acceler
ate as we get into the back 
half.

Great, that's helpful. Thank you. And then with regards to the balance sheet, 
I noticed both days sales outstanding and days of inventory bumped up a 
little bit, and I hadn't expe
cted that. Can you just talk about what drove 
that?
 
Stacy J. Smith 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
 
Yeah, those are two different things. I'll just start with the easy one, days 
sales outstanding. I'm not seeing anything unusual there, 
it's just the 
amount of net billing at the end of the quarter. The average day paid and all 
of that still looks really healthy, so I'm not seeing anything unusual there.
 
On the inventory side, as I talked to you last quarter, we ended Q1 higher 
than where 
I wanted to be. Our yields got better in Q1. Frankly, they got a 
lot better in Q2 as well. And we under
-
shipped a little bit in Q1 relative the 
units that we were expecting. So we took some actions in the second quarter 
to start bringing inventory levels d
own. What you see inside of inventory 
was 

 
it was flattish, right in line with what we expected Q1 to Q2. There 
was a remixing, so you see some more expensive server parts and some 
Skylake parts going up. And then you see some of the older
-
generation 
CPUs
 
going down. And as we get into the back half, we would expect 
inventory to click down and be down pretty meaningfully by the time we get 
to Q4.

Good afternoon and thanks for taking my question. PC gaming has be
en a 
bright spot for the team, with growth in the double
-
digits year
-
over
-
year 
range for the past number of quarters; your desktop ASPs were up again in 
Q2, maybe due to the strength here. It seems like the graphics guys are 
rolling out some new products. 
There appears to be a good pipeline of new 
games for the second half. So I guess the question is, did the PC gaming 
segment continue to drive double
-
digits growth for the team in Q2, and how 
do you see that trending into the second half?
 
Brian M. Krzanich 
-
 
Chief Executive Officer & Director
 
Sure. If you take a look at it, there were three
-
ish, maybe four
-
ish major 
segments of the PC that did better and continue to do better than the rest of 
the segment and just overall. Laptops, mobile PCs continue to do b
etter. 
They did better in the second quarter. 2
-
in
-
1 devices specifically are doing 
very well and continue to grow in double digits. And then as you said, we 
often call the enthusiast gaming, you see our K SKUs in there, and then you 
saw us also announce t
he X SKU, which is our new 10
-
core system that has 
been selling much, much better than what even we anticipated. And so yes, 
gaming and enthusiast continues to grow at a double
-
digit rate.
 
Harlan Sur 
-
 
JPMorgan Securities LLC
 
Great, thanks for the insights
 
there. And then on the deceleration in the IoT 
business in June, you talked about an inventory burn. Sorry if I missed this, 
but what vertical was that focused on? And does the team expect 
reacceleration on a year
-
over
-
year basis as you move into the seco
nd half of 
the year? And if so, what verticals are going to be driving the growth?
 
Stacy J. Smith 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
 
Let me take the revenue question, and I'll let Brian take what we see in the 
verticals part. It was not o
ne vertical. If you just look at it, I think our 
customers got out a little ahead of their skis in the first quarter. If you 
remember, I think we had a 21% or 22% year
-
on
-
year growth rate in Q1. 
There was a little more inventory out there than we anticipat
ed, and that 
took some of the 

 
that was a bit of headwind as we started Q2.
 
To your question on the back half, we do expect a reacceleration. So I had 
said at the investor meeting that we expect double
-
digit growth in excess of 
what we had achieved last y
ear. We still expect that. We had a strong Q1, 
an inventory burn in Q2, and we expect a strong Q3 and Q4.
 
Brian M. Krzanich 
-
 
Chief Executive Officer & Director
 
And from which verticals? The verticals that have been the strongest 
growing for us, especially
 
in recent, has been industrial and in the security 
video type applications. Those have been the two real growers. We have a 
lot of I'll call it longer
-
term growth vectors. Retail is a longer
-
term growth 
vector. And then you saw, as we mentioned on the cal
l, the automotive 
ADAS section in the announcement with BMW. There are several other 
programs in that space as well.

Stacy Aaron Rasgon

Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC
 
Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to verify. On the DCG 
I guess growth target into the back half, it sounds like you need enterprise 
to keep
 
getting better into the second half as well as for I guess the cloud 
and comm side of DCG to significantly reaccelerate to get there. Cloud was 
up 9% year over year, and it's good but that's a significant deceleration. Can 
you give us a feeling for what y
ou need for enterprise into the back half and 
what drove the deceleration in the high
-
growth parts of this business into 
Q2?
 
Stacy J. Smith 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
 
So I'd say 

 
I'd characterize enterprise in the back half consi
stent with what 
we saw in Q2. If it stabilizes at that rate, that gives us the ability to grow to 
the levels that we're projecting. And then for the cloud, yes, you're right. It's 
what I said earlier. We had actually forecasted a pause in purchasing based 
on what we knew of the customer 

 
the big cloud players' ordering patterns. 
And based on the signals we're seeing from them, we do expect a 
reacceleration in the back to something more consistent with what we're 
seeing through the last couple years.
 
Stacy 
Aaron Rasgon 
-
 
Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC
 
So what gives you confidence that enterprise will continue to stabilize and 
that what we saw in Q1 is not a one
-
quarter blip, given it's been down pretty 
meaningfully for the last few years pretty consistently?
 
Stacy J. Smith 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
 
It's what we saw in Q2.
 
Stacy Aaron Rasgon 
-
 
Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC
 
In Q2, I mean.
 
Stacy J. Smith 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
 
Yes, we saw it down slightly
. And again, it's just what we see of the big 
enterprise customers' signals to us in terms of what they want to purchase.

Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.
 
Ross C. Seymore

Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
 
Hi, guys. Thanks for letting me ask a question. Given that dynamic in the 
cloud and the enterprise side within DCG, do you still expect a crossover 
in 
the percentage of revenues that those two generate the back half of this 
year, or is it pulled forward a little bit 

 
or pushed out, given the dynamics 
that you've described so far?
 
Stacy J. Smith 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
 
Sor
ry, crossover from what to what, Ross?
 
Ross C. Seymore 
-
 
Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
 
When you said 

 
I believe at your last analyst meeting you talked about the 
cloud revenue, the percentage of DCG would be somewhere in the mid
-
30%, 
and that would cross
 
over the enterprise
-
generated revenue in that. And 
that was therefore viewed as a point of acceleration for the entire group. I'm 
wondering, given the slower growth year to date in that business, if that 
crossover is going to be achieved in the time you e
xpected.
 
Stacy J. Smith 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
 
I'll be honest. I haven't looked at the data from that lens. But what I said 

 
let me just take you back to the answer that I gave 

 
I think it was to Joe's 
question earlier, that
 
if you look to the expectations we had at the beginning 
of the year, the enterprise is a bit weaker than we thought overall for the 
year. And I think cloud will be in line with what we thought. So my guess is 
that's still true. Which quarter it happens ma
y be a jump ball, but my guess 
is it's still true. But I'd like the opportunity to actually go look at the data 
and I can give you a crisper answer next time we talk.
 
Ross C. Seymore 
-
 
Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
 
Okay. I guess as my follow
-
up question, 
sticking with DCG then, is on the 
gross margin side. It sounds like you're expecting some pretty significant 
growth, not only on the unit side of the equation in DCG but also on the ASP 
side. And then you also talked about some of the ASP benefits that mig
ht 
happen in CCG, at least in the PC portion of it. If I put that all together, I'm 
a little surprised that either mix or ASPs, neither of those are mentioned in 
your gross margin reconciliation for it to go to 62% in the third quarter. Can 
you talk a litt
le bit about how those dynamics fit into your gross margin?
 
Stacy J. Smith 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
 
Sure, so first let me start with your question on data center. There's a lot in 
there. So I do expect an operating margin 
improvement in the data center 
as we work through this year. I think we were around mid
-
40% in the 
second quarter, and our historical range has been closer to 50%. As I expect 
it, that picks up some as we move into the back half. The big driver there is 
co
sts. And so the early production on the Broadwell server is fairly 
expensive. Costs come down as we get into the back half. And as you said, 
we do expect some ASP uplift in the back half.
 
Overall for the company, what we're seeing, so I'll just Q3 as the a
nchor 
point. We're seeing some good news in Q3 associated with higher volumes. 
And then the big offset there is we're seeing 10
-
nanometer startup costs 
going up pretty significantly in the back half. So that may be the piece that 
you're missing in the equa
tion in Q3. That continues into Q4, by the way. We 
see a little bit more startup costs. If you do your algebra, you're probably 
coming up with a gross margin for Q4 that's about 62%. So think of that as 
some good things happen, but we have again an increas
e in startup costs 
and we have some of the Dalian costs with the first production of 3D XPoint 
that also kick in a bit more in Q4.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Caso of CLSA. 
Your line is now open.
 
Christopher Caso

CLSA Americas LLC
 
Yes, thank you, ju
st a clarification on some of your earlier comments on 
inventory in PC. You talked about the customers taking down the inventory a 
little bit less than you had expected in Q2. Can you clarify why they chose to 
do that? And I guess with the inventory levels
 
right now, where do they 
stand relative to where you'd expect them to be into the third quarter?
 
Stacy J. Smith 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
 
So overall we continue to see inventory levels as being very healthy. I think 
that the PC,
 
the worldwide PC supply chain has moved towards a stance of 
being fairly lean and fairly cautious, and we see that continuing. You would 
typically see an inventory burn in the second quarter. It was a little bit less 
of an inventory burn then what we expe
cted. I think it goes back to Brian's 
comments that he made at the beginning of the call that from their 
perspective, the PC market was a little better in Q2, so I think they probably 
just brought down inventory levels a little bit less.
 
Christopher Caso 
-
 
CLSA Americas LLC
 
Okay. As a follow
-
on to that, maybe you can clarify what you consider to be 
normal PC seasonality in the third quarter because I think that's been 
changing over the past several years. Last year, the build into the third 
quarter was a li
ttle stronger. Obviously, there were some product launches 
there. How do you characterize the build this year relative to what we've 
seen last year and the year before?
 
Stacy J. Smith 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
 
So I would say for 
the company, you would expect to see the seasonality of 
revenue, seasonality for us that's in the high single digits as we go from Q2 
to Q3. Our guide is a little higher than that for the reasons that we've been 
talking about. The PC market is probably in 
line with that, maybe just a 
pinch higher in terms of the overall PC TAM.

Matth

Canaccord Genuity, Inc.
 
Yes, thank you very much. Good afternoon and thanks for taking my 
question. I guess it's a follow
-
on to the DCG question that Ross had brought 
up in terms of margin. The DCG business is obviously going to diversify it
self 
some going forward with some of the new products that you're introducing 
and the networking business taking off. The operating margin percentage is 
down fairly sharply year over year, and I would expect that to ramp back up 
some as revenue reaccelerat
es. But maybe, Stacy, you could talk about 
what the long
-
term margin structure looks like from an operating margin 
perspective in DCG as the business diversifies some. Thanks.
 
Stacy J. Smith 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
 
Sure. So we'
ll talk about that in more depth at the investor meeting, but I'll 
give you some off
-
the
-
cuff comments here. First, to just put it in 
perspective, the operating margin percent decline that we saw in Q2 had 
nothing to do with the new products, or the new pr
oducts weren't driving it. 
It was the 14
-
nanometer costs of Broadwell server. And when we get into 
the back half, we're going to see an ASP impact associated with that 
because we think that the performance of that product enables customers to 
get a better 
value proposition by buying a richer mix. So that's why I'm 
pretty confident when we get in the back half, we see the margins snapping 
back towards that 50% that we've articulated as our long
-
term goal.
 
We'll talk more about the mix of products and whatnot
 
at the investor 
meeting, but the one thing I'd point you to is, remember something like 
networking, which is an Atom
-
based server product that's going in, while it 
does have a lower ASP than the average within DCG, it has an ASP that's 
actually been going
 
up and has a very different cost structure then a Xeon 
does. So I wouldn't just immediately assume that because it's a lower priced 
segment of the market that it's a margin
-
hindered segment of the market 
because that's not the case.
 
Matthew D. 
Ramsay 
-
 
Canaccord Genuity, Inc.
 
Great, thank you. That's really helpful. And then I guess to follow up on that, 
sticking on margin, maybe you could talk a little bit about how adding the 
third chip on 14
-
nanometer may affect margins going into 2017 in the
 
PC 
business to offset some of the 10
-
nanometer ramp costs you had talked 
about. I think it's a little bit of a different dynamic than we've seen with the 
business traditionally with a tick
-
tock approach. So any broader comments 
you can give there about ma
rgins would be really helpful. I appreciate it, 
thanks.
 
Stacy J. Smith 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
 
Let me take the margin side, and then I'll let Brian come in over the top to 
talk a little bit about the roadmap and how we think ab
out that from the 
customer's perspective. So first off, we haven't forecast 2017 margins, so 
we'll give you the first glimpse of that when we get to the investor meeting, 
and then we'll put a formal stake in the ground when we get to next 
January. But I wo
uld say that there's nothing that I'm seeing in the overall 
roadmap that for me is a significant headwind as we go in 2017. So we'll 
give you a lot more insight on that in a few months, but I'm not seeing 
anything that has me worried as we go into 2017.
 
Br
ian M. Krzanich

Chief Executive Officer & Director
 
I guess what I would talk about is Kaby Lake. So one of the things we've 
learned on 14 nanometers is how to make meaningful performance 
improvements both in the silicon and then with the silicon 
combined with the 
architecture. So we said we already started shipping Kaby Lake to our 
customers and OEMs. We're seeing meaningful performance across all of the 
various SKUs of Kaby Lake relative to Skylake. Kaby Lake is built off a 
Skylake core. And as a
 
result, the die size doesn't significantly grow. So you 
don't see 

 
there's no driver in the silicon itself to shift the margin structure 
of this product. We're able to get the performance and feature 
enhancements with relatively small silicon increases b
ut good improvement 
on the raw silicon technology itself. So there's not an intrinsic driver that 
should say die size got twice as big so margins are cut. There's nothing like 
that.
 
Stacy J. Smith 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
 
And it
 
comes in on a process technology that's mature with healthy yields 
and a healthy cost structure. So from that perspective, you get a nice 
performance boost at a good cost structure.

Yes, thanks. Brian, I 
know that you remain cautious overall in the PC 
market. But when you look at some of the third
-
party data, it definitely 
seems like North America was better; Asia, Latin America a little mixed. I'm 
wondering, has your view, at least on a regional basis, ch
anged at all?
 
Brian M. Krzanich 
-
 
Chief Executive Officer & Director
 
So my regional view would say that certain of the 

 
so North America and 
Western Europe has been stronger for us for some period of time, and it 
continues to be the stronger segment for u
s. As you said, South America 

 
Latin America continues to be weak. We see weakness in Asia, but it did get 
a little bit better than in the past, and that combined with North America 
were the two drivers that made Q2 perform better than what we had 
modeled
 
in our high single digits. And as I said, I'm being relatively cautious 
in this and making sure that we put an estimate out there that we are very 
comfortable with, and that's why we have gone with 

 
stuck with our high 
single
-
digit view of the year.

The other thing that's been reported is that commercial models have seen

ian M. Krzanich

Yes, and we're hearing that same thing from our customers. And as we go 
out and talk to CIOs, we're hearing the same thing. Those cycles, though, 
can sometimes take 

 
you'll hear of them, and they someti
mes can take 
some time to really kick in. So again, we've built that into the cautiousness 
of the second half and making sure that we know what we're going into the 
second half with. But we are hearing similar things around the enterprise 
conversion. It's 
comfort with Windows 10, ability to make that transition, 
and wanting to do it on new hardware.

Good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. I guess first question on 
XPoint. You talked about stronger growth expectations looking out over the 
next couple years. I'm just curious if you coul
d share what conversations 
you've had with customers, what use cases you've uncovered, and any 
thoughts in terms of sizing the market.
 
Brian M. Krzanich 
-
 
Chief Executive Officer & Director
 
So we haven't really tried to 

 
we have pretty 
widespread guesstimates and 
models right now on sizing the market because we're still really learning. 
We've actually started to ship some sample units to customers already to let 
them try out and start to learn. Those are to the big, call it service 
provi
ders, is mostly who we're sending those to. You're going to see it enter 
as SSDs. You'll see those SSDs, both enterprise
-
class SSDs and also 
commercial consumer type SSDs, we demonstrated in several live 
demonstrations anywhere from 5x to 7x, 8x, 9x, 10x i
mprovement in 
performance depending on the workload through those SSDs. So you're 
going to see those be the first implications.
 
When I think about where the big volume will come from, I think it will come 
in that DIMM form factor. You're going to see it in
 
cloud applications, 
everything from machine learning, big data. Anyplace where you have 
memory
-
intensive and where you can do in
-
memory applications, the 3D 
XPoint is going to be nicely configured for that. It allows you to bring large 
amounts of storage
-
like data into a memory
-
like performance. And that's the 
real key here.
 
I also believe you'll see it in consumer devices. You'll see laptops and 
devices like that. Gaming machines, we think it will have gaming 
applications where you can preload in a cache
-
like environment the next 
level of your game, and so it loads almost instantly as you transition within 
the game. So there's going to be a variety of those. And actually the more 
we go and start to play with it, start to give it out to customers, the more 
types of applications and workloads we're finding that it can be used for.
 
C.J. Muse 
-
 
Evercore Group LLC
 
That's very helpful. And I guess as a quick follow
-
up, Stacy, can you provide 
an update on your targeted capital structure here, and at what point wit
h 
net leverage 

 
net cash we should start to see more aggressive buybacks?
 
Stacy J. Smith 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
 
Sure. As I communicated I think at the investor meeting or in the last six 
months, our goal is to get back to net
 
cash zero. At one point I predicted 
that that would happen in the back half of this year. The combination of 
business levels being lower from what we thought at the beginning of the 
year as well as some pretty significant restructuring charges will push t
hat 
out, so that will happen sometime in 2017, although I do think we'll make 
good progress towards net cash zero as we move into the back half. Today, 
our net debt level is right around $5 billion, so we'll take a big chunk out of 
that as we move into the
 
back half.
 
In terms of then 

 
now that said, we're still generating excess free cash 
flow. You can see that even in the first half, even inclusive of the 
restructuring charges we did. And so you can see we did I think $1.6 billion 
of buybacks in the first
 
half, and we have a dividend yield that as of 
yesterday was about 3%. So I think you see us executing to the priorities 
that we had articulated.

Thanks for taking my question. For my first one, Brian, I'm curious. There 
are
 
expectations of Intel becoming successful with your 4G modems in the

growth in the business and just the timing as to when you can bring those 
products from foundry to your own
 
fabs?
 
Brian M. Krzanich 
-
 
Chief Executive Officer & Director
 
Sure, so let's just talk about modems. Really to stay on a leading
-
edge 
modem, you need to have a yearly cadence of modem technology. And so 
we have just that, a yearly cadence laid out. We had 
the 7260 last year, we 
have the 7360 this year. We have a series of modems out. We've got them 
built out and planned for the next several years. We haven't publicly stated 
when we'll bring it inside, but clearly we plan to. We'll do that when the right 
poi
nt of intercepting the roadmap and getting the right performance off the 
14
-
nanometer is required. Right now, I'm more concerned about getting the 
leading
-
edge momentum going for us with the 7360 and then the follow
-
on 
in 2017 and really showing that we ar
e a world

All right. And as my follow
-
up, staying on the DCG team, are you still 
comfortable this can be a double
-
digit growth business over the longer term? 
And I guess as part of that, what 
role does competition play into it with all 
the recent noise around SoftBank buying ARM and presumably putting more 
resources into it? I understand there are no near
-
term implications. But just 
longer term, how do you think about growth and competition in 
DCG? Thank 
you.

Sure, so let me try and talk about why I am so confident in growth. We can 
talk about competition, and then we'll see if that does not answer your 
question. When I think of the cloud, t
he cloud that we have today is really 
built on the backs of people. It's your Facebook data, it's your Salesforce 
data, it's your Twitter data. It's all data that is really across the devices that 
we pretty much handle day to day. The current estimates are
, if you look out 
into 2020, that average person will generate about 1.5 gigabytes a day of 
data off those devices, and those are going to be all your posts and pictures 
and all that kind of information.
 
If you take a look at the average autonomous car in 
2020, the estimates 
right now are it will throw off about 40 gigabytes a minute of data. If you 
take a look at the average autonomous drone doing some kind of scan, 
looking for somebody lost in the forest or scanning a mine, it's going to 
throw off about 2
0 gigabytes a minute. If you take something like our replay 
technology that is filming in virtual reality, a basketball game or a football 
game, it's throwing off 200 gigabytes a minute right now. And as we 
continue to refine the accuracy of that, that num
ber will likely just grow. So 
it's that growth in data and the need to both process it at the edge and then 
through the data center and into the cloud, to be able to store it, to be able 
to apply machine learning to all of those applications. Those all tel
l me that 
the cloud is going to continue to grow.
 
It's going to be lumpy. These guys don't build out their data centers in a 
linear fashion. They build out a big chunk of overcapacity so that they can go 
and then sell that and have expansion space, and the
y don't build for a 
while. And so I know people worry about is it slowing down? But these 
trends in data that tell me no, it's not slowing down over the long term, and 
what you're really going to see is just the buying patterns and the build
-
outs 
of the va
rious structures that are going up.
 
As far as competition, there's always going to be competition in this market. 
I expect it. That's okay. We think of ourselves as competition, in fact. We 
are built on a model that says we have to build a continuous impro
vement of 
our products such that we are replacing ourselves with a better cost
-
per
-
performance model over time. And so we know that just even if there was 
no competition, the competition is we've got to build a product that's better 
and drives replacement 
as well as growth. And so I look at the competition 
as it's welcome. It keeps us better. It's always been out there. There will 
always be somebody out there. But really what we have to do is build 
products that are so competitive that people want to replac
e our products 
with our new product. That then is one of the best models to use for making 
sure you stay ahead.

Thanks very much. Just following up from the earlier round, can you give us 
some feel for your attitude to total amount of debt? You have a goal of net 
cash neutrality, but you have an upper limit on the total amount of debt 
you're willing to carry. Might 
you choose at some point to repatriate 
overseas cash to bring down debt or pay dividends and stock purchases?

Wow, so there certainly is a limit to the amount of overall debt that I feel 
c
omfortable with, but it's not something that we've articulated externally, 
and it will vary by the size of the company and the cash flow. To my 
philosophy, just generally I'm not a believer in taking on debt to do stock 
buybacks. You really have not seen u
s do that. Obviously, it's a board 
decision, but I'm just sharing with you my view of it. I wouldn't take on debt 
in order to do buybacks or to do a special dividend or anything like that.

Brian Krzanich
 
Thanks Mark. Q3 was an o
utstanding quarter which produced records in a 
number of product lines and serves as evidence of our transformation to a 
company that powers the cloud of billions of smart connected devices. As a 
great proof point, third quarter revenue grew 9% over the la
st year to an 
all
-
time record of $15.8 billion on broad
-
based strength across our 
businesses.
 

start with the Client Computing Group, which had a stellar quarter. This 
team is foc
used on delivering an annual cadence of innovative new products, 
improving product cost and driving operational efficiencies contributed to a 
remarkable 37% growth in CCG operating margins.
 

ust as 
importantly CCG is playing in a direct and impactful role in our 
transformation.
 
In the Data Center Group, revenue grew 10% year
-
over
-
year to a record 
$4.5 billion. We saw the growth segments of the Data Center Group 
accelerating at a rate above our
 
forecast. The Cloud Service Provider 
segment was up 32%. And the comp service provider segment, we 
continued to grow at a faster rate than the market, 16% growth as the 
market converts of NFE and STN and demand for our products increased.
 
In addition, non
-
CPU adjacencies across DCG grew an impressive 34%. This 
category includes our new omni
-
path high
-
performance fabric which is 
leading in performance and gaining design win momentum. It includes our 
Silicon Photonics and our Xeon Phi, all of which began to 
ramp this year.
 
However, enterprise revenue was down 3%, trending below our expectations 
of a roughly flat year
-
over
-
year. As a result, DCG revenue growth for the 
full
-
year will likely be in the high
-
single digits.
 
Another key growth opportunity for Intel,
 
our Internet
-
of
-
Things business 
grew 19% over last year, setting an all
-
time revenue record of nearly $700 
million. We saw strength across the board in retail, video and transportation 
segments.
 
Revenue in our memory business was approximately flat year
-
o
ver
-
year. 3D 
NAND production at the Dalian factory is ramping ahead of schedule with 
yields matching those of our other production facilities. We continue to see 
industry enthusiasm building for our groundbreaking new memory 

making steady progress towards bringing it 
into production.
 


with the integration of Altera into Intel. We continue
 
to execute against our 
deal thesis. And PST has produced three consecutive quarters of year
-
over
-

related accounting charges.
 
In the third quarter we began sampling our Stratix 10 pro


and only 14
-

-
packaged parts for 
the data center and are continuing to see opportunities for design wins with 
PST produc

tremendous progress and execution.
 
The Intel Security business was up 6% over last year. Last month we 
announced that we will sell 51% of Intel Security to private equity first TPG 
and establish 
a jointly owned independent cyber security company named 
McAfee. This transaction will position McAfee to invest as an independent 

and growth.
 

tructuring program that we announced 

doing to accelerate our strategy. A change of this magnitude is hard. And 
going through it has again reinforced just how talented, committed and 
resilient this team is.

rter. 
We introduced exciting new products, delivered strong financials and 

leaves me increasingly confident in our transformation.
 
With that, let me turn the call over to Stacy.
 
S
tacy Smith
 
Thanks Brian. In the third quarter we achieved record revenue of $15.8 
billion and also achieved $5.1 billion in operating income.
 
Revenue growth of 9% year
-
over
-
year is driven by solid growth across the 
Client Computing, Data Center and 
Internet
-
of
-
Things groups.
 
Gross margin at 64.8% was higher than expected and up 3 points from the 
second quarter. Operating income grew 18% from a year ago. Earnings per 
share of $0.80 were up $0.14 from a year ago. The Client Computing Group 
had revenue 
of $8.9 billion up 5% year
-
over
-
year. During the third quarter, 
we saw strengthening of demand and an inventory
-
build in the world
-
wide 
PC supply
-
chain.
 
This segment had another quarter of significant profit growth with operating 
profit growing 37% from a 
year ago, as revenue increased, cost came down 
and investment levels declined.
 
The Data Center Group had record revenue of $4.5 billion up 10% year
-
over
-
year. In the third quarter we continued to see robust growth in the 
cloud segment of the business, whic
h grew over 30% year
-
over
-
year, 
partially offset by a 3% decline in the enterprise segment over the same 
horizon.
 
The Data Center Group had operating profit of $2.1 billion down 1% year
-
over
-
year as we increase investments and ramp Broadwell, the first 14
-
nanometer server product.
 
Our Internet
-
of
-
Things business achieved revenue of $689 million, growing 
19% year
-
over
-
year, driven by strength in our retail, video and 
transportation segments. Operating profit for the business was $191 million 
up 27% year
-
over
-
year. Our memory business had revenue of $649 million 
down 1% year
-
over
-
year. This segment had an operating loss of $134 
million as a result of start
-
up cost for China factory and costs associated 
with 3D XPoint.
 
The Programmable Solutions Group had reven
ue of $425 million up 6% 

million. Our security business had revenue of $537 million up 6% from a 
year ago. In the third quarter, we announced a newly formed jointly owned 
independe
nt cyber security company called McAfee.
 
The transaction values the business at approximately $4.2 billion and a deal
-
close we expect to realize a pre
-
tax gain on the sale of roughly $500 million 
when the transaction closes in the second quarter of 2017. T
he costs 
associated with the transaction are factored into our restructuring and 
spending guidance. Post deal
-
close we will own 49% of the new company.
 
We are generating healthy levels of free cash flow, which enables us to 
invest in our business and retur
n cash to shareholders. This has 
demonstrated in our third quarter results as we generated $5.8 billion cash 
from operations, purchased $2.5 billion in capital assets, repaid $1 billion in 
commercial paper, repurchased approximately $500 million of stock a
nd paid 
$1.2 billion in dividends.
 
As we look forward to the fourth quarter of 2016, we are forecasting the 
mid
-
point of the revenue range at $15.7 billion, roughly flat to the third 
quarter. This is below the average seasonal increase for the fourth quart
er 
as we expect the worldwide PC supply
-
chain to reduce the inventory.
 
Since the last earnings call, our view of second half 2016 revenue has 
increased as a result of strength in the client computing and Internet
-
of
-
Things Groups, partially offset by weakn
ess in the enterprise segment of the 

-
point of the fourth quarter gross 
margin to be 63%.
 
Spending is expected to be approximately $5.2 billion. Intel is in the midst of 

 
on being more efficient,

In addition, the deal involving the Intel Security Group, which was 
announced in the third quarter, w
ill result in additional restructuring 
charges, a pre
-
tax gain and reduced spending levels in 2017. As a result of 
those restructuring charges and the increased mix of retirements and

restructuring charges will be realized between now and the middle of 2017.
 

core strategic areas. This is all
owing incremental investments in critical 
areas like the Data Center, Internet

of

Things and memory.
 
The overall impact of the announced reductions Intel Security Group 
transaction and reinvestment as we expect our 2016 spending as a percent 
of revenue to 
be down almost 1 point versus 2015 and we expect to achieve 
another 1 point reduction in 2017 as we accelerate our transformation.
 
In the third quarter we achieved record revenue and strong operating 
profits. But since this is my last earnings call, I woul
d like to take the 
opportunity to provide some historical perspective and how the company has 

really think shows the transformation of our business.
 
10 years ago, virtually the entire
ty of our business was tied to the PC 
market. Today, we have a diversified portfolio of growing businesses, with 
roughly half of our profits coming from the Data Center and Internet

ok 
financially. 10 years ago, our revenue was approximately $35 billion with a 
gross margin of 52%.
 


from $0.40 pe

Looking forward, Intel is positioned with technology leadership and amazing 
workforce and significant market opportunity as we power the cloud at the 
heart of all of these smart 


leadership experience and continued focus on driving long

value that Bob will bring as CFO.
 
With that, let me turn it ov

With that, let me turn the call over to Mark.
 
Mark Henninger
 
Okay. Thank you Brian, Stacy and Bob. Moving on now to the Q&A as is our 
normal practice we would ask each participant 
to ask one question and a 
follow
-
up if you have one. Jonathan, please go ahead and introduce our first 
questioner.
 
Question
-
and
-
Answer Session
 
Operator
 
Certainly. Our first questioner comes from the line of C.J, Muse from 
Evercore. Your question 
please.
 
C.J. Muse
 
Good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. I guess, first question on 
DCG, you took the number down for Q4. Curious how we should think about 
contribution from enterprise looking into 2017, when you think that could 
stabilize. And 
then as you start to think about greater contributions from 
hyperscale and networking, is that 10% to 15% sustainable or should we be 
thinking high single digits going forward? Thank you.
 
Stacy Smith
 
Hi C.J. this is Stacy. So, let me take the first part of
 
that question. So, yes, I 

very strong growth rates in the cloud, very strong growth rates in 
networking and storage as those areas become virtualized and our products 
extending to t
hose areas.
 


-
off on providing a 
forecast for 2017 at this time. We would normally provide that to you in 
January and then have a much m
ore in
-
depth conversation in the investor 
meeting in February.
 
C.J. Muse
 
Okay, very helpful. And I guess on the PC front, given the volatility there, I 

completely stabilized. But curious what
 
trends you can speak to in terms of 
growth, perhaps, I guess in emerging markets and what that speaks to in 
terms of the trajectory for unit demand from here?
 
Brian Krzanich
 

is g
ood again. But if you take a look at this quarter, what we saw was kind 
of an increased strength in the areas that have been strong in the past. So, 
definitely the mature markets were a bit stronger. The one that was 
probably a little bit of a shift is Chi
na, was a little bit better than we had 
forecasted as well.
 

where we consider it where we would like to see the consumer side. And it 
was a good mix between desktop and mobile prod
ucts, laptops and devices 

really what drove the growth for this quarter.
 
Mark Henninger
 
Operator, please go ahead and introduce our next questioner.
 
Operator
 
Certainly. Your next 
question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon from 
Bernstein Research. Your question please.
 
Stacy Rasgon
 
Hi guys. Thanks for taking my questions. First, DCG revenue was up 10% 
year
-
over
-
year, operating profit down year
-
over
-
year. I know you had sort 
of hig
hlighted some increased investments. But we also have cloud growth 
in networking and some of the other non
-

well. How should we think about that change in the growth drivers in terms 
of impacting the margins over the last ye
ar? And how should we think about 
the likely margin trends for the business as we go into next year?
 
Stacy Smith
 

-

 
really are 
the two issues. We have been very consciously increasing investment there, 
we see tremendous long
-


ramping their first 14
-
nano
meter server product which is Broadwell for the 
server market and those first products coming out on that product
-
line are 
fairly expensive.
 

would expect. We have very strong produ
ct margins across the portfolio of 
server products and the enterprise or in the Data Center ranging from 
enterprise to storage to networking. And in fact when we look at the server 
ASPs, we actually saw ASPs up kind of across the board in every one of our 
server categories, so MP, DP, and so it really is a mix impact of what you see 

stronger in places like networking.
 
Brian Krzanich
 
Yes, and Stacy maybe this is Brian, maybe let
 
me help you just think about 
the data center from a larger perspective right. As Stacy said, what you 
have to really take a look here is, the growth areas that we said we were 
going to continue to grow and the cloud service provider, the Telco, 
networking
 
and storage, networking specifically is, was the more our fastest 
growing areas of the data center.
 
And in the adjacencies which are all new emerging markets for us around 
things like Silicon Photonics and omni
-
path fabric and all. All of those are 
growin
g at or above what we had forecasted and doing quite well.
 
And as Stacy said, across each of those, our ASPs are both increasing and if 
you take a look at that, even if you go down to like an Atom server, the 
Atom
-
based server, yes, their ASPs are lower bu
t the margins are still quite 
healthy down there, because their costs are quite a bit lower. So you got to 
keep all of that into perspective as you look at the mix that goes across 
these.
 
What happens quarter is that we anticipate the enterprise to go from
 
that 
low
-
single
-



-
term 
path of those growth 
areas that we described are going to be what drives 
the data center.
 
Stacy Rasgon
 
Thank you. For my follow
-

made. So enterprise is, like you said was disappointed this quarter. But I 

terprise has been in decline for years. Why would it 
stabilize, why would it start growing, why is the 
-
 


enterprise with this indicative of that cloud growth, I 
just 
-
 

understand why we should expect that business to ever turn around? Can 
you give us some color on that?
 
Brian Krzanich
 
Sure. I think there is two parts to this. A certain amount of the enterprise 
weakness right that has occurred over the 
last few years is certainly driven 


product performance standpoint whether it goes, those applications go to 
t
he cloud or whether they stay in the enterprise.
 
That said, there is several enterprises that we are in talks with it that all 


s more, the customer 

side with their own private clouds will continue to see some improvement. 

Stacy that t
his is going to be a growth segment.
 



 
St
acy Smith
 
And just on a tactical basis, Stacy, to reinforce. Our forecast now for the 
data center for Q4 also is not including improvement in this segment of the 
business.
 
Brian Krzanich
 
Thanks Stacy.
 
Stacy Rasgon
 
Thanks guys.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next 
question comes from the line of Vivek Arya from Bank 
of America Merrill Lynch. Your question please.
 
Vivek Arya
 
Thanks for taking my question. And before I forget, thanks and good luck to 
Stacy in his new role.
 
Stacy Smith
 
Thank you.
 
Vivek Arya
 
So, first q
uestion is again staying on the data center theme. Can you 
quantify the enterprise mix in DCG now and is that required to be flat in 
order to maintain the double
-
digit growth in DCG or can it actually start 
growing double
-
digit if the growth in other areas
 
remains at this current 
pace just because of the mix
-
effect?
 
Stacy Smith
 

Brian talked about this bullishness on the long
-
term for the data center but 

-
off on specific
 
CAGRs in 2017 forecast to both Earnings and then 
the Investor Meeting.
 
On the, I think you were referring back to what I showed a year ago which 
was the size of the enterprise versus the size of the data center 
-
 
or size of 
the cloud for the server segmen
t of DCG and that we were heading towards 

February.
 

recurring in the cloud so, again this quarter over 30% and our we
aker than 
expected enterprise I think that cross
-
over point pulls in. And then I think 
you have a phenomenon that says the cloud portion of the enterprise 
becomes so big and continues to grow at a fast pace that we can certainly 
maintain a robust growth ra
te even if the enterprise segment is not growing 
to slightly weak.
 
Vivek Arya
 
And as my follow
-
up, a longer
-
term question, I think there is a debate in the 
industry that computation is becoming parallel with this growth in deep 
learning and machine learnin
g which benefits products like GPUs more than 

parallel computing market is incremental or cannibalistic for Intel? Thank 
you.
 
Brian Krzanich
 
Sure. So, firstly 
-
 
to your first question I 10
0% agree with what Stacy said. 


decade.
 

ake a 
look at GPUs and things like deep learning, the first thing you have to 
separate out is things like are you talking about the deep learning on the 
learning portion or the scoring portion.
 

 
you still have 
to have a Xeon System with those when you go to, actually do the 
implementation of the deep learning applications.
 
The second thing we tell you is that we actually had worked over the last 
two years or so to really implement a much broader collection of 
accelerators when you think about these. If you want to think about kind of 
the rates of performance of each one of t
hese, you have FPGAs which are 
accelerators and we see those accelerators go into everything from 
networking devices to machine learning applications. Those have high levels 
of flexibility that can be programmed on the fly but maybe not quite the 
performan
ce.
 
Then you have GPUs, GPUs do have as we say, good accelerating 
performance in certain linear algorithms. Those are quite good and we have 
our Xeon Phi in that space. And then the highest performance area, are ASIC 

igned around the algorithm 
specifically. And you saw our applications of Nirvana; we also did an 
acquisition of Movidius earlier this quarter. Those are all very specific 
workloads around machine learning that are basic driven and even give 
higher performa
nce.
 
So, we look at those accelerators as being enhancing this growth. You sell a 

believe we have the widest really offerings of these accelerators from FPGAs 
through the Xeon Phi and 
then into basic driven devices.
 
Vivek Arya
 
Thank you.
 
Stacy Smith
 
Thank you.
 
Operator
 
Our next question comes from the line of Toshiya Hari from Goldman Sachs. 
Your question please.
 
Toshiya Hari
 
Thanks for taking my questions. My first one is on gross marg
ins. In your Q4 
guide, you have memory and higher factory start
-
up cost on 10
-
nanometer 
working against you. But I was curious when you would expect these items 
to fade and potentially provide a tailwind to gross margins?
 
Stacy Smith
 
Yes, so, this is Stacy

start
-
up costs, you would expect that 10
-
nanometer costs go up in the back 

quarters of next year and then they start to fal
l
-
off in the back half of next 

the kind of start
-

 

st
art
-
up cost associated with Dalian China factory for memory and then 


quarter but it should become a tailwind 
as we get kind of into 2017.
 
Toshiya Hari
 
Okay, great. As my follow

up I have a question on CapEx as well. Based on 
your annual guide, I think the implied Q4 number is close to $3.5 billion 
which is clearly a pretty big number. Should we take this as a new
 
normal 
for Intel or is this a one
-

both the core business and a memory and that the quarterly run rate going 
forward should revert to somewhere in the $2 billion to $2.5 billion range? 
Thank you.
 
Stacy Smit
h
 
Yes, I think if you go back to the guide, I think we probably talked about 
sometime prior April that I pointed to Q4 as probably being a pretty high 

first production that for 10
-
nan


rate that out.
 
Brian Krzanich
 
Yes, this is Brian. I mean just having managed CapEx in this Company for 
years, you really have to take a loo
k at our annual guidance because literally 
within the quarter
-
to
-


-
time kind of up
-
side things come together. So we expect our annualized run ra
te for this 

quarterly run rate to be indicative of Q4.
 
Toshiya Hari
 
Very helpful. Thank you so much.
 
Brian Krzanich
 
Thanks Toshiya.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question comes 
from the line of John Pitzer from Credit 
Suisse. Your question please.
 
John Pitzer
 
Hi guys, thanks for letting me ask the question. I guess my first question is 


tle bit more difficult to kind of track because of CCG including 
the mobile. And if you kind of looking at the volume growth in the 
September quarter, it was clearly above normal seasonal trends for the core 
PC businesses. So, how much below seasonal do yo
u think PCs will be in the 
calendar fourth quarter and how are you guys thinking about sort of the 
inventory channel management in Q4?
 
Stacy Smith
 

-


that Brian and I both talked about which is, we 
saw some strengthening of demand in the third quarter, we saw some 
refilling of the pipeline which was kind of lean coming in. And then in Q4, 

-
demand but some depletion of 
inventory 


supply chain it was measured in days or certainly less than a week of 
inventory that kind of shif
ts around.
 
John Pitzer
 
And then guys, and as my follow
-
up, all year long you guys have sort of 


the PC vo

quarter I guess I understand the headwinds coming from memory and 10
-
nanometer startups. But what about some of the tailwinds from 14
-




another quarter of conservative guide on the gross margin line?
 
Stacy Smith
 
I guess I can 

margin than I have done. I highlighted for you the two big items from Q3 to 

in 10
-
nanometer start
-
up cost and wha
t we see going on in the memory 
business for the elements that I saw.
 

-
nanometer, I 
also think will be down a little bit in terms of PC volume but those are all 
relatively small impacts to the gr
oss margin forecast.
 
John Pitzer
 
Thanks guys.
 
Brian Krzanich
 
Thanks John.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ross Seymore from 
Deutsche Bank. Your question please.
 
Ross Seymore
 
Hi guys, my first question is on the CCG side of thin
gs. And specifically in the 
third quarter you talked about the ASPs year
-
over
-
year and desktops and 
notebooks and overall. I think the ASPs were up 6% in CCG but the desktop 
and notebook side were both well below that. Is that just the counter 
revenue stil
l in there or is there anything we can read through on to the 
mobile business given those differences?
 
Stacy Smith
 


ively 
small but it has a fairly big impact on the averages that within the phone 
and tablet products we saw relatively less volume in Q4 so we got our Q3, 
we got the mix effect. And that ASP is up dramatically on a year
-
on
-
year 
basis as a result of the aba
tement of the counter
-

the missing piece you need to get to the overall platform ASP math.
 
Ross Seymore
 
So, I guess as a follow
-
up switching over to the OpEx side of things, Stacy, 
in your script you mentioned about the OpEx to re
venue improving by about 
a point this year year
-
over
-
year and then again another point next year. Can 
you just walk us through a little bit about what that means either from a 
linearity perspective or an absolute dollar perspective? Any more color would 
be
 
appreciated?
 
Stacy Smith
 

back to, because I think this gets very confusing because we obviously had 
the restructuring program in place. We now have the spin
-
out or the 
divestiture
 
excuse me, the Intel Security business, the timing of those things 
will play out differently over the course of next year. So I just thought it was 
best to clean all of this, up and give you one metric for the year that 
summarizes everything.
 
And so, star



the fact that profits and revenue is up and w
e have some profit and revenue 
dependent spending.
 

$700 million, you can take of it as an annualized run rate of a little north of 
$1 billion of savings that then rolls into next year


make some reinvestments as we talk about some of the areas that are 
important, think of data center and IoT and memory.
 
And so, when you add all that up, it wou
ld just give you an all
-
in number 


down on the order of another point next year in 2017 with all of this a
ll
-
in, 
the restructuring, McAfee and the reinvestment. I hope that helped?
 
Ross Seymore
 
Yes, it did. Thank you. And congrats on your new gig.
 
Stacy Smith
 
Thank you, sir.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Danely from 
Citigroup. Your question please.
 
Chris Danely
 
Thanks guys. Just on the PCU, you guys were pretty much first to call the 
inventory burn in Q1 of this year. In terms of your call for inventory burn in 
the PC channel for Q4, is this reflected in your order bo
ok, is this what your 
customers and channel partners are telling you or is this kind of you guys 
think that, things were little too good in Q3 so thereafter ease up little bit in 
Q4?
 
Brian Krzanich
 

e of our partners 

watching the sell
-
through as it goes all the way through the OEMs and out 
into the retail sectors.
 

f that 
dataset that is what the OEMs tell us what we see in retail and our 
discussions with retail and even just our own, we go out and collect that 

population density at a place like 
best
-
buy, how many people are out there, 
buying PC versus something else on the store.
 


days, about 
a couple of days when you ship a million units a day is a big 
number, when you take a look at the ASPs and a million units a day. So, it 

couple of days.
 
Stacy Smith
 
And I would say, th
e order book is much less meaningful than it used to be 

location. The cancellation policy is such that they only pull demand when 

ing false 

some indication of what they want, it can change on a daily basis.
 
Chris Danely
 
Got it, great, and then for my follow
-
up a question on inventory. So sales 
were up over $2 bi
llion but your inventory only went down a little bit. Can 
you just comment on why that happened and where utilization rates are 
going? What you feel comfortable as far as inventory levels go, does it worry 
you at all?
 
Stacy Smith
 
Yes, it came in pretty muc
h right where I was expecting Chris. What we saw 
is a reduction in CPU inventory in the third quarter. And even within that a 
pretty sizeable reduction in first generation 14
-
nanometer products being 
replaced by second generation 14
-
nanometer products. So,
 
that played out 
as expected. And then we saw some increases in other areas in inventory 
kind of non
-
CPU areas.
 


s and 

what I signaled on the last call.
 
Chris Danely
 
Great. Thanks.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Blayne Curtis from 
Barclays. Your question please.
 
Blayne Curtis
 
Hi, thanks for taking my question. I just want to circle back on DCG. Just 
when you look at the way September played out and as we look into 

trying to understand you 
talked about a mix of networking, was there any 
difference and you had also talked about some lumpiness in cloud. Did that 
all play out as you expected?
 
Brian Krzanich
 
Yes, it absolutely did. We tried to talk about the numbers in the preview at 
the start j
ust showing you five segments there, cloud, Telco, Networking and 
Storage, and then the adjacencies, they all grew at or above our forecast. 
Those are still, as we talked about earlier in one of the questions, growing in 
percentage of our overall data cent

to offset 3
-
percentage decline in the enterprise side. But absolutely that was 
the story for the quarter.
 

growth is holding. When we go out 
and talk to our partners and customers 

storage requirements, out in time we start to look at devices like 
autonomous cars and the IoT network in general. All of those things are 
dr
iving large requirements into those data centers in those growth 

continue. And our forecasts are holding in those spaces.
 
Blayne Curtis
 
Thanks for that. And just on the non
-
volatile group
 

lot of money another big CapEx in Q4 here. Can you just talk about when 
the capacity additions could lead to revenue and then as you look at the 
operating margin of that business when could it be a positive contributor?
 
Brian Krzani
ch
 

Absolutely as we said and I think Stacy said a couple of minutes ago as well, 
in our Dalian China Factory, we are now running wafers, the yields are quite 


ramp through the first half roughly of next year and as most of that 
spending will occur in that same timeframe as far as adding the equipment 
to facilitate that ramp.
 

purely just running the volume and continuing 

have a cost performance that is quite good relative to the rest of the market.
 
The 3D XPoint we are in the process of shipping samples n
ow to customers 




it again, the revenue and hence the cost go down on 3D XPoint 
as we go into next year as well.
 
Stacy Smith
 
Yes, let me 
-
 

-
out to the 
China factory team, I was just out there and I was being a little humbl
e. The 
yields on their first production material matched the yields on the mature 

doing quite well.
 
In terms of the overall margin if you look at, just focus on Q3, what we saw 
in Q
3 is an improvement in the underlying NAND business being offset by 
increased start
-
up cost associated with Dalian China and some increased 
costs associated with 3D XPoint. As Brian said, when we get into the first 
half of next year, those products are ram
ping and so we should start to see 
pretty significant improvements in the overall P&L because that headwind if 
you will goes away and we have a very competitive very cost competitive 

 
Brian Krzanich
 
Just a corr
ection, the team here just caught me on. I think I had my ears 
off. So, on the 3D XPoint it will be qualified at the end of this quarter. And 


s quarter. And it ramps in 2017, I 


thousands in the fourth quarter and qualified at the end of the quarter. Sor
ry 
for that confusion.
 
Blayne Curtis
 
Thanks.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Rolland from 
Susquehanna. Your question please.
 
Chris Rolland
 

PC number.
 
Do you guys think that there is some cannibalization here of 
Broadwell from those waiting for the release of the Purley platform next 
year? And also, how do you guys view the value prop for Purley? You guys 
have a faster interface there, more pins than IO

some killer feature there that makes Purley much stronger than typical 
platform ramp?
 
Brian Krzanich
 
Sure, so, I think I heard all of your questions. But I think your question is in, 
you can correct me if I got it wrong. How much
 
of the enterprise slowdown 
that we saw is being driven by cannibalization basically of people waiting for 
Purley a.k.a. SkyLake platform and then what are the real features that 

 
Chris
 
Rolland
 

around Purley.
 
Brian Krzanich
 

Broadwell, the Broadwell platform, the performance is quite good. Wha
t we 
find is that each one of these generations as long as you stay on this cost 
performance curve, people are willing to go buy those that are running these 
cloud platforms quite quickly.
 

oviders, 


real high
-
level performance sectors first actually I would think.
 

 

sample those products already to some of the leading edge customers. And 

typically see with each one of these but this also continues our 
integration of 
things like the omni
-
path fabric, it has more integration of the silicon 

will get more and better as we go through each one of these, there will be a 
second gene
ration of Purley that includes 3D XPoint.
 
It allows pooling of memory and then there will be future ones that will allow 
additional pooling of things like FPGA. So, each one of these now add some 
additional features across the rack that really helps in the
 
overall system 
performance.
 
Chris Rolland
 

channel recently have been fairly positive around PC ASP increases next 
year. And part of this is the mix towards enterprise as consumer
 
mix down. 
But others are pointing to sort of an inflection in ultrabooks, thin and light. 

something like that. What kind of fall
-
through would we expect for CPU 
ASPs?
 
Brian Krza
nich
 
100% of that. Firstly I do want to recognize that our OEM partners are 


hesitant to this. But typ
ically Stacy is right, if ASPs go up across the board at 
the system level, it tends to float all boats. So our OEM partners would see 

infrastructure would see.
 
We really more think of our pr
icing though as value base. So as we bring out 
new products and bring out new features we make sure that the value
-
based 
pricing is there and that people are either getting more value for the same 
price or quite a bit more for slightly increased price.
 
So,
 


that ASP to our end
-

new features. If it happens
 
with 10
-

features then we do have those. So we do it based on what value we provide 
to the end user and our OEM partners.
 
Stacy Smith
 
And if I can just add, the way we would see that is actually with a mixing 
app, we 

of high
-
end notebook, ultrathin like, we would see a mixing up of our overall 


creating a differentiated product line. And 


 
Brian Krzanich
 
And probably the best example of that is the gaining space right. We 
continue to 
see, we put out the case skew, 12
-
core monster and we wonder 



t do pricing based on value and 
features that we bring.
 
Chris Rolland
 
Great. Thanks for the detail.
 
Mark Henninger
 
And operator I think we got time for two more questions.
 
Operator
 
Certainly. Our next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri from 
Cowen & Company. Your question please.
 
Timothy Arcuri
 
Thank you very much. I guess, my first question is, I think you had said at 
the spring analyst meeting that the enterprise would be a little bit less than 
half of DCG this year, revenue
-
wise. So, can yo
u right
-
size us sort of on 
what enterprise will be as a percentage of DCG just in the fourth quarter?
 
Stacy Smith
 
Yes, so, this is Stacy, and I think I took a stab at this earlier but let me just 
reiterate what I said. And to be clear, I was talking CPUs. 
And so if you take 



-
over points.
 

ew percentage and that would be 
something that we would logically talk about when we give the longer
-
term 
perspective to the market in this coming February investor meeting.
 
Timothy Arcuri
 
Got it. Okay. And then I want to ask a question on the mobile losse
s. I know 

about feeling good about this $800 million improvement in losses this year. 
So, I guess, that would get you to roughly a loss of $2.2 billion to $2.3 
billion in the former MC
G. Can you talk in light of the iPhone win, can you 
talk maybe how you think about the degree to which you could get further 
improvement in that number next year? Thanks.
 
Stacy Smith
 
Sure. So first
-

talk 
about our customer, what technology they use inside their products in this 

take you back to the mobile last year. So, as you got right, we no longer 
have a mobile segment we 

 
We had articulated that in 2015 we expected to improve the loss by $800 
million we actually ended up closer to $1 billion. We said everything we 

improvements and a


 

-
track or exceeding that 

some further disinve
stments, as you just heard earlier, our volumes were 
little lower, our counter revenue is looking a little lower, the product margins 
all look good.
 

bigger in terms of the over

impossible for us to detangle it going forward.
 
So, where you really feel is in the CCG operating results. And as we started 
this call, they had phenomenal operating margins this quarter. And 
everything wen
t right, revenue growth, they saw unit cost coming down, 

all that up they become a real kind of cash and profit driver for the 
company.
 
Timothy Arcuri
 
Thank you.
 
Stacy Smith
 
Thank you
.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our final question then comes from the line of Harlan Sur from 
JPMorgan. Your question please.
 
Harlan Sur
 

good to see the reacceleration in growth. Can you 
just talk about the 
sustainability of the double
-
digits year
-
over
-
year growth trends and the 
sustainability of the 20%
-
plus operating margins on a go
-
forward basis? I 
know you mentioned broad
-
based strength across the verticals. Maybe you 
can just also tal
k about some of the product segments that are powering this 
growth?
 
Brian Krzanich
 

asking. Can we sustain the double
-
digit growth? We absolutely believe that 

ed that with our deals that we see on plate going 

product road
-

Atlas Peak and Atlas Peak 2 that are coming that are Broxton
-
ba
sed 
products that are quite strong and quite capable in this segment and priced 
and designed right for that.
 
But the segments are going to continue to believe, we believe the video 
analytics segment that continues to go well, there are other segments of th
e 
industrial segment that we believe will continue to grow on machine 
automation, machine factory automation think of this as factory automation.
 
The retail segment will continue to be an area where it continues to grow. 
And then automotive, and you saw us
 
make deals for example this quarter 


OEMs that are a mix of everything from autonomous driving programs
 
to in
-
vehicle infotainment type systems.
 



 
Photonics for 
moving the infotainment, basically the graphics video around the system. 
They use FPGAs for accelerators like we talked about earlier.
 
So, when we look across those segments, and we test it out, we do believe 
we could continue that. Those ar

gives us the confidence in the margin functions as well. They tend to reuse a 
lot of our intellectual property from the PC segment and carry that down 

egrated device 
manufacturing kind of business model.
 
And so, the amount of investment required to bring those to market are less 

what gives us the confidence in the margin space as
 
well.
 
Harlan Sur
 
Great, and then thanks for the insights there. On the cellular modem front, 
obviously the team is driving good success here with the 7360 this year. 
Looks like you guys are continuing to drive the road maps. I notice that your 
next
-
genera
tion platform, the 7480, was just qualified at AT&T just this 
month. This was actually about the same time last year that you guys 
qualified the 7360 at AT&T.
 

expect 7480 to show u
p in mobile devices? Would this be 2017, and any 

qualified this new chipset with?
 
Brian Krzanich
 
Sure. So, I think you really want to think the modem space as really an 
annual cad



We typically go then out and aro

same places that the 7360 got qualified, in Europe, in China, other parts of 
Southeast Asia. So those will be ongoing now.
 

advancements on a
n annual basis. And typically right, they get qualified in 
the third and fourth quarter of the year before and then customers start to 
roll
-
out those devices, typically more towards the second half of the 
following year. So you should see these things star
t to show up in devices in 
the second half of 2017.
 
And you should just think about that from this business from here on. We 
should come out with another series next year at this year with the 2018 

he modems moving 
forward.

Thanks, Tre
y. And thank you all for joining our call.
 
Amid a very challenging environment, cloud and network infrastructure and 
PC capabilities have been vital in allowing businesses and people to continue 
to work, learn, stay connected, and provide critical goods an
d services. 
Those trends contributed to a very strong quarter in which we generated 
$19.7 billion in revenue, and delivered $1.23 in earnings per share. We 
exceeded our guidance by $1.2 billion on the top line and $0.13 on the 
bottom

I continue to be amazed by our employees and supply chain partners who 
have diligently worked to keep our business operating at a high level d
uring 
this unprecedented challenge. COVID
-
19 has driven redesigned workflows 
and added additional environmental stress that I know has strained 
employees and ecosystem partners as they try to maintain productivity in 
this new world. I want to thank our emp
loyees and partners for their 
incredible contributions. Our primary focus continues to be ensuring the 
safety and well
-
being of our global workforce, delivering for our customers 
and helping the communities in which we operate.
 
On each earnings call, I giv
e updates about our progress against three key 
priorities: Accelerating the growth of the Company; improving our 
execution; and continuing to thoughtfully deploy your capital. Let me give 
you a few thoughts on each.
 

rate growth. That means not just 
playing defense but positioning our business to grow share in the largest 

key technology inflections such as cloud, AI, 5G, and the intelligent and 
autonomous edge. We see a world where everything increasingly looks like a 
computer, including our homes, our cars, our cities, our hospitals, our 
factories and now even our schools. In this new world, our opportunity set 
becomes more than just the CPU; it

more and more computers, so we can have a larger impact on our 


 
AI use cases ar
e becoming pervasive, and we are embedding AI capability 
into all our products. Our Xeon platform is foundational for data center AI, 
with value, scalability, built
-
in AI acceleration and inference leadership. This 
quarter, we launched our third
-
generation
 
Intel Xeon Scalable processor 
Cooper Lake, which is the first mainstream server CPU bfloat16 support, 
which increases AI throughput by reducing the amount of data required for 
the same accuracy. Developers can use and test the latest Intel
-
optimized 
versi
ons of TensorFlow and PyTorch to train their models using bfloat16, and 
the Intel distribution of OpenVINO to deploy optimized inference from cloud 
to edge.
 
In Q2, both our cloud and comms service provider businesses grew more 
than 40% year

delivered applications continued to 
scale and 5G build
-
outs accelerated. Leading cloud service providers, 
including Alibaba, Baidu, Facebook and Tencent, announced they are 
adopting our third

gen Intel Xeon Scalable processors into their 
infra
structure and services.
 
Also this quarter, Azure introduced several new Xeon Scalable instances, 
including general purpose and memory

powered by Intel processors and FPGAs from the radio access network to the 
5G

ready mobile core.
 
Compute capabilit
ies are moving from the cloud to the edge and catalyzing a 
vast array of new usages and market opportunities. The largest opportunity 
we see at the edge is the $230 billion 2030 TAM for ADAS, data and 
mobility

The mo
st important demonstration of the power of our technologies is the 
commitment of our customers, and we were excited this week to announce a 
significant design win with Ford. Design wins to date in 2020 include multiple 
new ADAS production programs represen
ting cumulative volume of over 20 
million units.
 

spectrum of PC use cases. This quarter, we introduced three new additions 
to our 10th gen processor family, extending our leadership i
n gaming and 
business. The Core S and H series processors for desktop and mobile gaming 
deliver speeds out of the box reaching up to 5.3 gigahertz, making them the 

processors delivered
 
uncompromised productivity and hardware
-
based 
security for commercial PCs. Q2 also marked the launch of Lakefield, 
featuring our new Intel Hybrid Technology, which is a hybrid CPU 
architecture for power and performance scalability.
 
We also continue to wor
k on improving our execution. Intel employees and 
our supply chain partners have role
-
modeled teamwork in navigating difficult 
conditions while working to support customer upsides during this crisis. We 
have made significant progress in increasing our capa
city and improving our 
supply, while delivering $2 billion above our plans through the first six 

inventory as we work through the second half of the year.
 
Acceleration of our next
-
gen
eration products continues. We now expect to 
increase our 10
-
nanometer
-
based product shipments for the year by more 
than 20% versus our January expectations. Customer demand for our family 
of 10
-
nanometer 
-
based SoCs for 5G base station designs is also ver
y 
strong. We delivered a full node of performance improvement within our 14
-
nanometer
-
based products by optimizing our product and process together, 
and the power of our intranode improvements continues with our next
-
generation 10
-
nanometer
-
based client pr
oduct, Tiger Lake. Tiger Lake 
delivers breakthrough performance in CPU, graphics and AI, and will be 
shipping to customers in a matter of weeks. We are also targeting initial 
production shipments of our first 10
-
nanometer
-
based Xeon Scalable 
product, Ice L
ake, for the end of the year. And we have a pipeline of exciting 
new product architectures for 2021, led by Alder Lake for client and Sapphire 
Rapids for server. Both products will start initial production shipments in the 
second half of 2021.
 
Let me provi
de some updates on our technology roadmap. We continue to 
demonstrate proof points of our breakthrough advanced packaging 
technologies. Our Lakefield product, which I mentioned earlier, delivers scale 
production of our 3D packaging technology, Foveros, com
bining both 10
-
nanometer and 22
-
nanometer capabilities in a disaggregated architecture. 
This quarter also marked a significant milestone in our data center GPU 
technology. We successfully powered on a petaflop
-
scale GPU with high 
bandwidth memory using our
 
advanced embedded multi
-
die interconnect 
bridge or EMIB 2D packaging technology.
 
Turning to our 7
-
nanometer technology. We are seeing an approximate six
-
month shift in our 7
-
nanometer 
-
based CPU product timing relative to prior 
expectations. The primary d
river is the yield of our 7
-
nanometer process, 
which based on recent data, is now trending approximately 12 months 
behind our internal target. We have identified a defect mode in our 7
-

-
caused
 
the 
issue and believe there are no fundamental roadblocks, but we have also 
invested in contingency plans to hedge against further schedule uncertainty. 

by leveraging improvements i
n design methodology such as die 
disaggregation and advanced packaging. We have learned from the 
challenges in our 10
-
nanometer transition and have a milestone
-
driven 
approach to ensure our product competitiveness is not impacted by our 
process technology 
roadmap.
 
Our overarching priority is to deliver product leadership for our customers, 
and we are taking the right steps to produce a strong lineup of leadership 
products. We will continue to invest in our future process technology 
roadmap, but we will be p
ragmatic and objective in deploying the process 
technology that delivers the most predictability and performance for our 
customers, whether that be in our process, external foundry process or a 
combination of both. Our advanced packaging technologies combi
ned with 
our disaggregated architecture give us tremendous flexibility to use the 
process technology that best serves our customers. As an example, our data 
center GPU design, Ponte Vecchio, will now be released in late 2021 or early 
2022, utilizing extern
al and internal process technologies combined with our 
world
-
leading packaging technologies.
 
We now expect to see initial production shipments of our first Intel
-
based 7
-
nanometer product, a client CPU in late 2022 or early 2023. We are also 
focused on mai
ntaining an annual cadence of significant product 
improvements independent of our process roadmap, including the holiday 
refresh window of 2022. In addition, we expect to see initial production 
shipments of our first Intel
-
based 7
-
nanometer data center CPU
 
design in 
the first half of 2023.
 
Finally, while process technology is very important, it is only one of the six 
technology pillars of innovation that drive differentiation in our products. You 
will hear more about advances across all six technology pilla
rs, process; 
packaging; architecture; memory; interconnect; and security/software at the 
upcoming Intel Architecture Day.
 
Last, we are focused on the thoughtful allocation of your capital. We are 
investing to grow our capabilities even as we deliver 
significant free cash 
flow this year. Since 2015, we have grown R&D spending by more than $1 
billion while divesting non
-
core assets and reducing overall spending as a 
percentage of revenue by 9 points. We also look for opportunities to 
augment our product
 
lines and speed the pace at which we can grow the 
Company.
 
As discussed earlier, we acquired Moovit this quarter, investing 
approximately $900 million to dramatically accelerate our capability to 
capitalize on the $160 billion mobility
-
as
-
a

service opport
unity. We also 
announced a $250 million investment in Jio Platforms, a high
-
speed wireless 
connectivity and digital services provider, to help fuel digital transformation 
in India.
 
Our purpose to deliver world

changing technology that enriches the lives of
 
every person on earth has never been more essential. But the global

In closing, I want to thank all our employees who are working through this 
challenging time to 
deliver our purpose and support our customers.

Thanks, Bob and good afternoon, everyone.
 
The atypical seasonal effects of COVID
-
related demand for mobility products 
and data center infrastructure continued in Q2, resulting in record Q2 
revenue
 
for CCG, DCG and memory. Revenue came in at $19.7 billion, up 
20% year
-
on
-
year and $1.2 billion higher than guide. Data
-
centric revenue 
of $10.2 billion, up 34% year
-
on
-
year, represented 52% of our total 
revenue, an
-
all time high. Strong demand for NAND a
nd 5G networking 
solutions and richer server mix drove most of the upside versus our 
expectations. Q2 PC
-
centric revenue was $9.5 billion, up 7% year
-
on
-
year 
on strong notebook PC sales, enabled through increase manufacturing 
supply on capacity additions o
ver the past year.
 
Gross margin for the quarter was 55%, slightly below expectations on higher 
product costs from faster uptake of our 5G ASIC products, which are margin 
dilutive relative to the Company average and also continued acceleration of 
10
-
nanomet
er products overall, partially offset by a shift of costs from cost 
of sales to R&D related to 7
-
nanometer product timing. As a reminder, we 
expected an approximate 3
-
point reduction in gross margin in the second 
quarter on the effect of pre
-
PRQ reserves f
or our Tiger Lake client product. 
This is largely a timing item with respect to the full year as we benefit from 
the zero dollar units in our initial sales of product, which will begin this 
quarter.
 
Operating margin of 31% in the quarter was approximately 
flat versus last 
year as spending efficiency offset lower gross margin. Q2 EPS was $1.23, 
$0.13 above our guide as stronger than expected operating results from 
notebook, memory and a richer mix of server products, along with higher 
gains in our trading as
set portfolios, offset increased costs from our 10
-
nanometer acceleration and the effects of a discrete foreign tax item.
 
In Q2, we generated $11.2 billion in operating cash flow, and invested $3.4 
billion in CapEx with $7.7 billion of free cash flow, up 9
2% year
-
over
-
year. 
We returned $1.4 billion to shareholders via dividends. As a reminder, we 
paused our share repurchase program in Q1 as we felt it was prudent to do 
so in the current economic environment. We expect to complete the balance 
of our $20 bill
ion share repurchase program and return to our historical 
capital return practices when market dynamics stabilize.
 
Moving to segment performance in Q2. Data Center Group revenue of $7.1 
billion was up 43% from the prior year, coming in higher than expectat
ions 
with strength across our customer segments. Year

year platform 
volumes in ASPs were up 29% and 5% respectively. DCG adjacencies also

Our other data

centric businesses were up 14% year

year, primarily on 
the NAND dynamics in Q2, despite significant COVID headwinds impacting 
d
emand in our more GDP sensitive businesses, IOTG and Mobileye. IOTG 
revenue and operating income declined 32% and 76% respectively, primarily 
on lower revenue from industrial, retail and vision segments. Mobileye 
revenue was down 27% and operating income t
urned to a modest loss as 
the decline in global auto sales more than offset continued ADAS penetration 
and new IQ program launches.

pricing. Q2 was an 
all time record for quarterly revenue for our memory business. The business 
also returned to profitability this quarter, generating approximately $300 
million in operating income. PSG revenue grew 2% year

over
-
year on cloud 
strength, whi
ch was partially offset by weaker demand from embedded and 
communications segments.
 
Operating income was up 54% on richer product mix and improved unit 
costs. CCG revenue was $9.5 billion in Q2, up 7% year
-
over
-
year, driven by 
notebook demand and higher mo
dem and Wi
-
Fi sales, which more than 
offset lower desktop volumes. PC unit volumes were up 2% year
-
over
-
year 
on higher notebook demand and increased supply.
 
We expect our share to improve throughout the remainder of the year as we 
begin to recover unit sha
re in notebooks utilizing our smaller Core products, 
which we have not been able to fully serve given the strength of demand for 
our large Core products. Operating margin was 30%, down 12 points year

on
-
year as higher unit costs associated with the ramp of
 
10
-
nanometer 
products and the pre
-
PRQ reserves ahead of our Q3 Tiger Lake launch more 
than offset the benefits of higher revenue.
 
Moving now to our third quarter outlook. Based on demand signals from our 
customers, we expect continued strength in cloud an
d comms infrastructure 
and consumer notebook PCs in Q3. But we expect that the weak economic 
environment will impact our commercial PC business, particularly the 
desktop form factor, and also drive lower demand for the enterprise and 
government segment in 
DCG and in IOTG and Mobileye. As a result, we 
expect total revenue of $18.2 billion with PC

centric and data
-
centric 
businesses down mid

single digits year

over
-
year. In Q3, we expect the PC 
TAM to be down high single digits year

draw
-
down softer desktop demand and the effects of the global recession.
 
Gross margin is expected to be approximately 57%, down 3.5 points year
-
over
-
year as accelerated ramp of 10
-
nanometer products and lower platform 
revenue more than offset NAND margin 
improvement.
 
We are expecting a tax rate of approximately 15.5% in Q3. This is 
approximately 2 to 2.5 points above our previous expectations, primarily 
due to a lower FDII [ph] benefit in the year, a temporary reduction in R&D 
tax credits in California, an
d the effect of a push
-
out of a foreign grant.
 
The higher tax rate is reducing our EPS in the quarter by approximately 
$0.03 versus our prior rate expectation. As a result, Q3 EPS is expected to 
be approximately $1.10 per share.
 

providing full year guidance although visibility 
remains somewhat limited into the fourth quarter. Still, we do expect some 

estimate for full year revenue. We are now forecasting reven
ue of $75 billion 
and EPS of approximately $4.85. We expect our PC
-
centric business to be 
flat to slightly down against the PC TAM that is down mid
-
single
-
digits year
-
over
-
year. Following a very strong first half of the year, we expect demand 
trends to mod
erate in the second half as weaker global GDP and the 
maturing Win 10 commercial refresh drive a lower PC TAM. Again, we also 
expect to increase our market segment share as we have greater supply for 
entry PC designs. Additionally, we are forecasting lower
 
modem revenue in 
the second half.
 
We expect revenue from our data
-
centric businesses to be up approximately 
10% for the full year on strong cloud demand and increased 5G buildouts. 
After significant cloud expansion in the first half and into Q3, we expect
 

also planning for an increasingly competitive environment as we move into 
the second half. We expect continued global GDP
-
related impacts to our 
IOTG and Mobileye businesses in the se
cond half of the year.
 
Overall, our implied first half, second half revenue contribution is an 
anomalous 53% to 47%, as opposed to a more typical year with 
underserved seasonal buying patterns of 46% and 54%, respectively. Gross 
margin is expected to be 58
% for the year, down 1 point versus our 
reasonable expectations for the year and 2 points lower year
-
over
-

change is being largely driven by higher costs from higher than expected 
demand for our 10

nanometer products, and the push out of a govern
ment 
grant for our memory business. These effects coupled with softness in our 
IoT businesses, more than offset the stronger overall demand, improved mix 
in DCG, and the shift in some spending between OpEx and cost of sales 
related to the product timing de
lays Bob discussed earlier.
 
Spending for the year is expected to be approximately $19.7 billion or 26% 
of revenue, down one point year

our January expectations on higher R&D expenditures, including the 
previously di
scussed shift between OpEx and cost of sales, and costs related 
to COVID, partially offsetting the cost reductions on the modem exit and 
other portfolio actions, as well as ongoing SG&A productivity gains. The

The tax rate is expected to be 14.5%, reflecting the impact of discrete items

[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Vivek Arya with Bank 
of America.
 
Vivek Arya
 
Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to dig into the competitive and the 
financial implications of the 7
-
nanometer delays that Bob you mentioned. 
So, on th
e competitive side, by the time you come up with 7, TSMC is 
planning to be on the 3
-
nanometer, so will still be a generation ahead. So, 


implications, and even 
pricing implications if you stay on 10
-
nanometer longer next year? And I 
guess, the bigger question that a lot of investors would have is, at what 
point Intel should just consider outsourcing a lot more to foundries, so that 
you can 
keep in line with the state
-
of
-
the
-
art and manufacturing 
technologies?
 
Bob Swan
 

delivering leadership, an annual cadence of leadership products each and 
every year for our custo
mers in a predictable manner. So, what we talked 
about today is a strong lineup for 2020, 2021, 2022 for both client and 
server. And we feel very good about that lineup. And our expectation on 10
-

-
nanometer i
s to get 
another node of performance within that 
--
 
within 10
-
nanometer in and of 
itself. So, we feel very good about our product roadmap through 2022.
 
That being said, as we think about that next generation of products in late 

eed to make sure that we continue to deliver 
strong performance. And our priority in the ideal world is leadership products 
on our process technology, so we capture the economic benefits of IDM. But, 
the focus will be leadership products. So, to the extent
 
that we need to use 


the economic implications in the event that we decide to move to somebody 

oundry, and with our scale, how do you get ASPs in line with our 
costs, continue to deliver leadership products, so we capture attractive ASPs, 
and reduce the amount of capital that we have to deploy to build a foundry 
on an older node, or on a last gen ki
nd of process node. So, in the 
aggregate, for the last couple of years with the real focus on product 


technologies
, so that we have much more flexibility to decide if when we will

Yes. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. I guess, a follow

nanometer delay. I guess, curious, how should we think 
about the implications for CapEx and required capacity adds at 10

nanometer and 14

and not be built internally at Intel? Thank you.

full array of 10

nanometer product, the expectation is, all else equal, little 
more 10

nanometer spend and less 7

nanometers spend, provided we 
decide to continue to do all of our 
production inside. In the event we decide

Thank you. Our next question comes from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. 
Your line is now op
en.
 
John Pitzer
 
Yes. Hi, guys. Thanks for letting me ask a question. Sticking on the same 
topic of 7
-
nanometer. Bob, if you could just help me understand yields are 
12 months behind where you would expect them but the product ramp is 
only 6. If you could s

importantly, you had multiple sort of push

outs of 10

identifying this 7

nanometer push
-
out today. What confidence level do you 

rn in to a 
repeat of 10 where you kind of had multiple periods of push
-
outs?
 
Bob Swan
 
Thanks, John. I mean, first, product schedule slippage of roughly two 
quarters while process we expect now to be roughly four quarters. The 
difference of the gap is drive
n by a couple of things. One, a buffer and our 

--
 

mentioned in the prepared remarks, die disaggregation and advance
d 
packaging gives us the ability for a given SoC to do some stuff inside and 
some stuff outside, and therefore further compress the product delivery in 

a six
-
month products slip,
 
even though process was moving out 12 months.
 
In terms of 
--
 

before, maybe. And I think, the important of our many lessons coming out of 
10
-
nanometer. One of them was how do we ensure that we h
ave 
contingency plans, in the event that our advancements in process 
technology, as it gets increasingly complicated, do not play out the way we 
hope, how do we make sure that we can continue to deliver leadership 
products for our customers on that annual 
cadence?
 


pretty pragmatic about if and when we should be making stuff inside or 
making outside and making
 
sure that we have optionality to build internally, 
mix and match, inside and outside or go outside in its entirety, if we need 


 
absolutely sure with 
advanced contingency planning, and real milestones that we can switch the 
best we can to leverage somebody else and not slip product schedules in 
light of process complexities.

t 
seems like contingency plan three years down the road is how the external 
option is being treated. I think investors are frustrated with how long this 
execution on manufacturing has happened. Are there steps where instead of 
being a contingency plan, you
 
actually start making the external side the 
primary source before 2023? Obviously on the design side, more than the 
revenue side. And maybe a follow
-
up, if three to five years down the road, 
the 20
-
80, 20 external, 80 internal mix, do you think that chang
es?
 
Bob Swan
 

talking about, as we expand our capacity, evaluating more holistically, when 
do we use third
-
party foundries, rather than do everything ourselves. And 
we call that engagi
ng in the ecosystem in much more holistic ways for a 

as the capital associated with each node becomes a bit higher. So, in 

ngaging with the 
ecosystem much more. And all else equal, I would expect that roughly 28% 
to be a little bit higher as we focus on growing the business.
 
Your first question in terms of planning then, we feel like we have a real 
solid product roadmap, again
 


-

than we expected, it yields in line with what we expected. So, for the near
-
term, we think we got a great lineup of products and we 
expect to fight and 
protect our share, while standing the role we play in a variety of different 
places in the industry.
 

light of where we are, where we think the industries, the co
mpetition or third 

we can deliver an annual cadence of product leadership for our customers. 

decisions, based o
n the information that we have along the way, will be 

capacity we need to put in place or decisions about how do we leverage 

tories, so that 
we can get real good incremental returns on capital deployed.

Our next question comes from Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research.
 
Stacy Rasgon
 
I want to ask about the acceleration in 10
-
nanometer. Is this really because 
yields are g

trying to offset the 7
-


versus where you thought they were going
 
to be in January. So, how do we 
think about the drivers of that 7

nanometer acceleration in light of the 7

or 10

nanometer acceleration in light of the 7
-
nanometer delay, given 

 
George Davis
 
Hey Stacy, this is George. Maybe
 

picture for the year. So, this clearly 
--
 


than we expected in 2020 and where part of that growth 
is a higher mix on 
the PC side and I would say on the comms and 5G ASIC side, higher demand 
for products that are on 10
-
nanometer than we have forecast for the year. 

-
through on revenue than we 
would have expe


-

 
Stacy Rasgon
 
Wait a minute. If I look at your annual guidance now versus [Technical 

 
the second half versus what you 
had implied when you first gave the annual guidance six months ago. How 

actually lowered the second half?
 
George Davis
 

-
nanomet
er products within the mix of our overall 
revenue space.
 
Bob Swan
 

the beginning of the year is our guidance is up by $1.5 billion in revenue.
 
Stacy Rasgon
 

 
Bo
b Swan
 

give me a chance to answer it. So, full year demand to the Company is 
higher. Secondly, the yields for 10
-

with what we expected c
oming into the year through the first six months. 
And we feel pretty good about where we are on yields. Third, the overall 
demand for our products on PC side and for the 5G SoC in the comms sector 
is higher than we expected. That is part of the contributio
n to the $1.5 
billion of higher revenue for the year. And as we accelerate 10 faster, both 
because customers are demanding it more, the implications are that our 
margins all else equal, will be lower. And George kind of highlighted those 
are the primary dr
ivers of a 1 point decline. 10
-
nanometer products are 
ramping faster and our 5G comms business in the data center group is 
growing much quicker than we had anticipated.
 
I put that 
--
 
I put ramping of 10
-
nanometer faster in the good category. We 
feel 
--
 
we 
know margins are lower when we start a new node versus exit an 
old node. 10
-
nanometer margins are lower than 14 at this stage of the 


d anticipated. All else equal 

the year. Higher growth in a more challenging market, more demand for our 
10
-

--
 
ramping yields as we 
e
xpected with more volume all else equal will have a modest impact on our 
gross margin for the full year. Thank you.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question comes from Timothy Arcuri with UBS. Your 
line is now open.
 
Timothy Arcuri
 
Hi, thanks. I wanted to ask 
also on the same manufacturing topic. So, I 
think, Bob, when you were talking about Ponte Vecchio, I think you said that 

an external foundry contingency, even for this first GPU pr
oduct. I guess, my 
question is, did I read that right? And also, I wanted to ask George, what the 
long
-

this do to your 57% to 63% long
-
term gross margin? And how does it 
impact free cash 
flow? I mean, obviously, it saves you on CapEx but can it 
be accretive to free cash flow?
 
Bob Swan
 
Yes. On Ponte Vecchio, originally the architecture of Ponte Vecchio includes 
an IO based die, connectivity, a GPU and some memory tiles, all kind of 

beginning, we would do some of those tiles inside and some of those tiles 
outside, and again leverage the packaging technology as a proof point of 
how do we mix and match different desi
gns into one package. So, that was 
the design from the beginning. And again, when we talk about 
disaggregation, more flexibility, optionality in our designs, use some stuff 
inside some stuff outside, Ponte Vecchio is really 
--
 
Ponte Vecchio on the 
data cen
ter side and Lakefield on the client side, were kind of our test 
products, both 
--
 

development. So, that design disaggregation gives us lots of flexibility.
 
As we go forward now, we can think about whe
ther we introduce Ponte 
Vecchio with 
--
 
I think, I said some of those tiles are inside and outside from 
the beginning. Now, as we go forward, we can assess whether we swap out 
one of our tiles for a third
-

value of this change and design methodology that gives us much more 

something rather than make it all ourselves.
 
George Davis
 
And with respect to the long
-
term outlook, first
 
off, our long
-
term margin 

But in terms of as we dynamically move, potentially move product 
depending on where it is best provided, I think that certainly gives us more 
flexibility 
to optimize our capital spend, get a higher return on that capital 
spend. And it should be accretive to free cash flow. So, we talked a little bit 

balancing some of our activity extern
ally is going to be important as we look 
to improving returns over time.

Our next question comes from Weston Twigg with KeyBanc Capital Markets.
 
Weston Twigg
 
I wanted to ask about the data
-
centric revenue heading into Q3. The mid
-
single
-
digit decl
ine year
-
over
-
year implies a pretty big decline from Q2. You 

understand the reason for that big quarterly drop. And kind of as an aside, 
you also mentioned increased competition
 

just wondering what exactly you were referring to on that side?
 
George Davis
 
As you look at the data

play. Obviously, year

over

he fall of

is, we think we peaked on cloud in the second quarter, and it was an all time

peak there.
 

step down from a very strong Q2 and probably continues down on cloud and 
comms as our current outlook. Does that help?
 
Weston Twigg
 

he comment on increased competition in DCG 
in second half?
 
George Davis
 

would see increasing competition in the second half of this year. We also 
thought 
--
 

ntly surprised in the strength of the 


competitively in the second half as we had thought. And as I said on 
PC, we 

 
Bob Swan
 
When we guided back in January, in the context of our guidance, we made 
that statement. So, George is just reiterating that we see a more 

 
we factored that 
into our outlook for the second half of the year.
 
Trey Campbell
 

the call back over to Bob to wrap things up.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. And our final question comes 
from Srini Pajjuri with SMBC Nikko.
 
Srini Pajjuri
 
Thank you, George. I have a question about your guidance for the full year. 
I think, it implies DCG declining again in Q4, pretty much in double
-
digit 
sequentially. So, just trying to understand, I mean is 
it primarily because of 
digestion that you talked about? And also, if you can talk about to what 
extent do you have visibility into Q4 or are you just taking a conservative 

 
George Davis
 
I think,
 
as I said on the last question that we have a reasonable view that 
spending is going to be coming down in the cloud and in enterprise and even 
comms, off very
-
high levels. And we expect that we continue into Q4. And 
so, again, I think, when we look at the
 
full year, stronger than expected 
overall. This would be 
--
 

forecast as we were given all of the things going on in the world. But again, 

ter 
--
 
excuse me, the second quarter, peaking for comms in the second quarter, 

expect.
 
Srini Pajjuri
 
Thank you.
 
Bob Swan
 
Yes. Let me just kind of close out and end where we 
began. First, over the 


technologies like 5G, AI and intelligence at the edge. And we feel pretty 
good about
 


Obviously, this year has been an incredibly challenging year on multiple 

 
best year in our 

than we expected in January at a time when the market is worse than we 
expected. So, competitively, we feel stronger as we exit 2020.
 

 
execution is improved. Capacity and supply is in 

-
nanometer products across our portfolio. 
We are ramping 10 faster than we had planned. And we have a strong 
pipeline over the next several years. And we believe we can deli
ver another 
node of performance on 10
-
nanometer itself.
 
Fourth point, at the same time, our 7
-
nanometer products will be delayed. 
We pushed out the timing of the 7
-
nanometer node. But along the way, we 
have taken steps, die disaggregation, advanced packagi
ng, deeper 
engagement with the ecosystem and contingency planning as a sign of 
strength, not as a sign of weakness that gives us much more flexibility to 

deliver that annual cade
nce of leadership for our customers. And we feel 

with our 7
-
nanometer process performance. But, as we sit here today, six 

 
for our 
customers. The communities we operate in are better as a result of our 
presence and the passion of our employees for making a difference. And 

-
changing technologies that conti
nue to enrich the lives of every person on 
earth.

Bob Swan
 
Thanks Mark. And thanks to Navin and Murthy who will participate in the 
Q&A later in the call. Before I get into the results, I'll take a minute to 
address what I expect is a top of mind question, the status of Intel's CEO 
search. The Board continues to evaluate candidates for what I believe is the 
biggest and best open job on
 
the planet. They are proceeding with a sense 
of urgency while also ensuring that they make the right choice for this great 
company. Meanwhile, Murthy, Navin, the entire management team and the 
107,000 employees have come together as a team to continue dri
ving Intel's 
transformation to a data centric company. Our 2018 results demonstrate the 
progress we've made, and I'd like to share those results with you now.
 
2018 marked Intel's golden anniversary. It was a truly remarkable year for a 
remarkable company. 
Full
-
year revenue grew 13% and crossed the $70 
billion mark for the first time, setting an all time revenue record for the third 
consecutive year. Our data center, Internet of Things, programmable 
solutions, memory, mobile eye and modem business businesses
 
each set all 
time full year revenue record.
 
2018 was also a pivotal year in Intel's transformation to become a data 
centric company pursuing an expanded greater than $300 billion market 
opportunity. Intel's collection of data center businesses grew 20% in
 
2018 
after adjusting for McAfee. The largest of our data centric businesses, the 
Data Center Group, delivered record annual revenue of $23 billion, up 21% 
year
-
over
-
year on strong cloud demand and growing share with 
communication service provider customer
s.
 
Our PC centric business achieved 9% growth in 2018, as the PC market 
stabilized and we gained share in modem. While 2018 was a record year, we 
expected a stronger finish. Fourth quarter revenue of $18.7 billion was up 
9% but short of our expectations as
 
a result of a dramatically weakening 
modem demand, lower overall growth in China, cloud service providers 
absorbing capacity and a weakening NAND pricing environment. While 
revenue fell short, we exceeded our EPS outlook by $0.06 or about 5%.
 
We continued
 
to deliver outstanding new products for our customers and 
previewed new innovations that positions Intel to compete and win for years 
to come. And we also made significant progress in growth areas like AI, 
Autonomous Driving and 5G. I'll take a few minute
s to give some specifics 
before we dive into the financial results.
 
Over the course of the quarter and culminating at CES, we highlighted 
breakthrough innovations that will be central to our product leadership for 
years to come. We outlined our product des
ign philosophy, which combine 
six pillars of innovation, process technology, architecture, memory, 
interconnect, security features and software to consistently and reliably 
deliver leadership products that solve our customers' most challenging 
problems.
 
On
e example of this designed philosophy in action is our unique Foveros 3D 
packaging technology. Foveros enables active stacking of logic chiplets for 
the first time in the industry's history, and left those mix
-
and
-
match process 
technologies and architectur
es to deliver breakthrough products. The first 
such product Lakefield is slated for production in 2019. Lakefield features a 
10
-
nanometer hybrid CPU architecture combining a Sunny Cove CPU core, 
four low
-
power Atom CPU cores, Gen 11 graphics and more in a 
dime sized 
product that enables the smallest PC motherboard ever possible.
 
Foveros business tremendous design flexibility and pace away for a myriad 
of devices and systems combining high
-
performance, high density and low
-
power silicon process technologies.
 
In the datacenter, we began shipping the 
new Cascade Lake family of high
-
performance EM processors with DL boots 
for accelerated AI performance, hardware
-
based security mitigations and the 
first implementation of Optane DC persistent memory. Many of our 
d
atacenter OEMs and cloud customers are now offering early trials with Intel 
Optane DC persistent memory, which is enabling entirely new usage models 
and improved system performance.
 
In client computing, we launched our new 9th gen Intel Core desktop 
produc
t line up for gaming and content creation, growth segments that 
demand Intel performance. We also previewed our upcoming 10 nanometer 
Ice Lake client CPUs, which will deliver unprecedented levels of integration, 
including DL Boost inference acceleration, W
i
-
Fi 6, thunderbolt 3 and Gen 11 
graphics, our first integrated GPU with a full teraflop of performance.
 
Our 10 nanometer yields continue to improve and Ice Lake remains on track 
to be in volume systems on retail shelves for the 2019 holiday selling 
season
. In Q4, we also made important progress in AI, 5G and autonomous 
driving. For artificial intelligence, we saw accelerating adoption of 
OpenVINO, our open source toolkit for neural network optimization and the 
rapid deployment of AI based computer vision.
 
In addition to the strong adoption of OpenVINO by the developer 
community, we also launched several new products during the year, 
including our third generation vision processing unit. Our partners created a 
catalog and AI based vision accelerator cards wi
th our VPU you and FPGA 
product. While digital video was once a vertical within the IoT business, AI 
based machine vision is becoming a critical horizontal capability that cuts 
across all IoTG verticals. And our leadership portfolio, both hardware and 
soft
ware solutions, is removing the barriers to deployment and accelerating 
IoTG's growth.
 
We also highlighted a new AI product on our roadmap, the Nervana neural 
network processor for inference or NNPI, which is designed to accelerate 
inference workloads and 
achieve the highest performance per watt in the 
industry. We expect NNPI to be in production this year. 5G is another big 
opportunity for both our PC centric and data centric businesses. At CES, we 
unveiled the new 10 nanometer based network system on chip
, codename 
Snow Ridge developed specifically for 5G wireless access and edge 
computing. Snow Ridge will bring Intel architecture into wireless access base 
stations, and allow more computing functions to be distributed out at the 
edge of the network. We exp
ect to be in production on Snow Ridge in the 
second half of this year, which is also when we'll deliver our first 5G modem, 
the Intel XMN 8165 5G.
 
In autonomous driving and ADAS, Mobileye's efforts to lead this revolution 
continues to build momentum with 2
8 new design wins and 78 vehicle model 
launches in 2018. In the fourth quarter, we announced plans to 
commercialize mobility
-
as
-
a
-
service in Israel with Volkswagen and Champion 
Motors, making Mobileye's rest of products, technologies and services 
unmatched
 
in the industry. Mobileye's products now span from open ADAS 
and AB compute platforms to turnkey vehicle retrofits to ultimately mobility
-
as
-
a
-
service. And they are enabled by the industry's best vision algorithms 
and driving policy software. The groundbr
eaking RSS model for AV safety 
and REM real
-
time crowdsourced maps.
 
At CES, we announced important progress for both RFS and REM. IPS, 
China's leading industry organization for transportation standards approved 
a proposal to standardize RFS for the China m
arket. We also completed the 
mapping of Japan's Highway system, 25,000 kilometers of roads using data 
harvested from a customer fleet of vehicles outfitted with EyeQ4 in just 24 
hours.
 
This is a path that would have previously required thousands of hours o
f 
driving and scanning using specialized vehicles. This sort of breakthrough is 
possible only with Mobileye's combination of technology and massive market 
scale, and it positions Mobileye to monetize ADAS and AV technology long 
before level four and five a
utonomy are deployed at scale. And REM will be 
monetized in areas beyond autonomous vehicles. We just announced the 
partnership with ordnance survey to use data collected via consumer 
vehicles outfitted with EyeQ4 to help utilities manage infrastructure.
 
L
ooking back at 2018, it is abundantly clear that Intel's employees, the 
unstoppable engine driving our innovation, are more determined than at any 
point in our history to make Intel technology the foundation for the world's 
most important innovations and a
dvances. Not only was it a record year 
from a financial perspective, we achieved major milestones in terms of our 
diversity and inclusion goals. We reached full representation in our U.S. 
workforce two years ahead of our plan. We also achieved gender pay e
quity 
across our global workforce. And to celebrate 50 years of Intel, more than 
68,000 employees volunteered approximately 1.5 million hours in the 
communities where we operate. I'm proud of what Intel employees achieved 
in 2018, and I'm equally proud on 
how they responded to challenges.
 
With that, let's turn to the financial results. The fourth quarter closed the 
record 50th anniversary year with strong data centric and PC centric growth. 
Revenue for the quarter was $18.7 billion, up 9% year
-
over
-
year. Ou
r data 
centric businesses were collectively up 9% and our PC centric business was 
up 10%. Operating margin of 35% was approximately flat with strong mix 
and continued spending leverage, offset by 10 nanometer cost and growth in 
our adjacent businesses. Str
ong business performance, spending leverage 
and a lower tax rate resulted in non
-
GAAP net income of $5.9 billion, up 
14% year
-
over
-
year. EPS of $1.28 was up 18% year
-
over
-
year.
 
For the full year of 2018, we generated $14.3 billion of free cash flow, 
return
ed $15.3 billion to shareholders, including $5.5 billion in dividends. We 
purchased 217 million shares and increased our buyback authorization by 
$15 billion. Free cash flow was $1.2 billion short of our October expectations 
due largely to an increase in a
ccounts receivable.
 
To summarize, we had a strong quarter and fantastic year with full year 
revenue up 13% or nearly $6 billion higher than our original forecast in 
January. Earnings per share was up 32% and free cash flow was up 38% 
over last year. 
We're expecting another record year in 2019. And as a result 
of our continued growth, we are raising the dividend 5%.
 
Our Leadership products continue to win share in our expanded TAM, as 
both our data centric and our PC centric businesses continue to grow
 
in the 
fourth quarter. Our data centric businesses were up 9% for the quarter as 
customers choose our performance products to move, store and process 
more data faster from the cloud to the edge. And our PC centric business 
was up 10% as we saw continued s
trength in the commercial and gaming PC 
segments and we gained modem share.
 
Moving to earnings, we generated solid EPS expansion in the quarter, up 
18% year
-
over
-
year. And our operating income increased $580 million with 
operating margin approximately flat
 
year
-
over
-
year in the quarter. Our EPS 
improvement was driven by growing demand for higher performance 
products in the data center and client businesses, leading to higher volumes 
in ASPs, continued spending leverage, a lower tax rate and lower share 
coun
t as a result of buybacks.
 
Our focus on operational efficiency continues to produce strong results with 
2018 spending as a percentage of revenue at 28.6%, down over 7 points 
since 2015 and meeting our 30% commitments two full years ahead of our 
goal. R&D i
s up $1.4 billion over the same period as we continue to increase 
investments in areas that will drive growth in our expanded TAM, such as 
product leadership, artificial intelligence and autonomous driving. Over the 
last three years, we've grown annual rev
enue by more than $15 billion, 
while adding less than $250 million in spending, resulting in a more than 
25% increase in revenue per employee.
 
Now some Q4 performance highlights by segment. The Data Center Group 
delivered another greater than $6 billion re
venue quarter and a growing 
storage and networking CPU TAM that is greater than 30 million units. 
Revenue of $6.1 billion was up 9% year
-
over
-
year but below our October 
expectations. Year
-
over
-
year growth decelerated as all three major verticals 
within DCG
 
were impacted by weakness in China demand and as some CFPs 
move to consume capacity put in place earlier in the year. Platform unit 
volume was up 9% and ASPs were up 1%.
 
Our Xeon ASP grew mid single
-
digits as customers continue to transition to 
Xeon Scala
ble and a richer mix of higher performance products. We also saw 
ASP expansion in our SoC products and much higher SOC volume as we 
continue to have success in network transformation. The higher SoC 
volumes resulted in more modest blended platform ASP grow
th.
 
Non
-
CPU adjacencies were down 2%, driven by several large one
-
time deals 
in the fourth quarter of 2017 that did not repeat in the fourth quarter '18. 
Cloud revenue grew 24% year
-
over
-
year, decelerating from Q3 '18. 
Enterprise and government revenue dec
lined 5% year
-
over
-
year on a very 
challenging compare versus fourth quarter of 2017 and weaker China 
demand. Com service provider revenue grew 12% year
-
over
-
year on 
continued MFS gains as customers choose to virtualize and transform their 
networks on Intel
 
architecture.
 
Our other data center business IoTG, NSG and PSG achieved solid growth in 
Q4, together were up 9% year
-
over
-
year or 13% excluding the Wind River 
divestiture. Our Internet of Things business had revenue of $816 million, 
down 7% or up 4% exclu
ding Wind River with operating profit of $189 
million, down 27% year
-
over
-
year due to primarily supply constraints. 
Mobileye revenue was $183 million, up 43% over the last year as design 
wins and ADAS adoption continues to accelerate. Our memory business 
d
elivered revenue of $1.1 billion, up 25% year
-
over
-
year due to strong data 
center growth and continued Optane adoption, offset by a weaker NAND 
pricing environment. The shift of our data center and client SSDs to our 64 
layer 3D NAND continues in both the 
data center and client businesses with 
volume mix greater than 75%. NSG was approximately breakeven for the 
year.
 
As expected, Micron exercised its right to call Intel's interest in our joint 
venture I am/technologies. This announcement does not change Int
el's plans 
in the coming quarters and the close of the call is at our discretion up to one 
year after the date of the call with a supply agreement that extends beyond 
the close. We have manufacturing options available and have been shipping 
a broad portfol
io of Intel Optane's technology products for more than a year. 
We will continue to expand our product line and lead the industry with this 
exciting new technology. PSGs revenue came in at $612 million, up 8% and 
strength in the data center income segments.
 
We saw continued momentum 
in PSG's datacenters segments, up 50% over last year and the advanced 
products category, our 20 and 14 nanometer solutions grew an outstanding 
70%. Operating profit was $162 million, up 4% year
-
over
-
year.
 
Finally, the client comp
uting group delivered another outstanding quarter 
with revenue of $9.8 billion, up 10% year
-
over
-
year. Commercial and 
gaming demand continued to be strong. The notebook segment grew 8% 
year
-
over
-
year, the desktop segment grew 3% year
-
over
-
year. Supply 
rema
ins constrained, particularly at the value end of our product range. We 
are working closely with our customers to align demand with available 
supply, while we add capacity. And we expect supply demand balance to 
improve by midyear. Client adjacencies grew 
45% year
-
over
-
year, driven 
primarily by increased modem share gains. Though modem revenue fell 
significantly below our expectations as a result of weaker smartphone 
demand.
 
Our operating profit grew 402 million year
-
over
-
year with operating margin 
up 1 poi
nt. While our PC volumes were down 2%, our leadership product 
performance and segmentation contributed to strong mix. The investments 
we have made in the business organically in two acquisitions are delivering 
excellent cash flow generation. For 2018, we g
enerated $29.4 billion in cash 
from operations. We invested $15.2 billion in capital expenditures and 
delivered $14.3 billion in free cash flow, up 38% year
-
on
-
year and closing 
the gap versus EPS by 4.5 points. During this period, we returned the 114% 
of o
ur free cash flow to our shareholders. Buybacks totaled $10.7 billion and 
dividends totaled $5.5 billion. In addition, settlements of our convertible 
debt reduced fully diluted shares by $40 million.
 
To wrap
-
up with our full year results, we ended 2018 our
 
50th anniversary 
year with our third consecutive year of record results. Revenue of $70.8 
billion up 13% year
-
on
-
year driven by 20% growth in our data centric 
businesses, and 9% growth in our PC centric businesses. We started the 
year in January and expec
ting to generate $65 billion in revenue, 30% 
operating margin, and $3.55 in EPS. The growth that we and the industry 
have seen has been remarkable. We ended the year approximately $6 billion 
higher in revenue with operating margin of 35% and $4.58 in EPS.
 
Operating income of $25 billion was up 25% on strong execution across the 
businesses and disciplined spending. In October, we provided a preview of 
our outlook for 2019. At the time, we described a combination of tailwinds 
and headwinds that were balanced.
 
The tailwinds were in expanded and 
growing TAM, products momentum and business mix. The headwinds were 
tougher compares following an especially strong 2018, and increasingly 
competitive environment and global trade.
 
Since that time, trade and macro concer
ns, especially in China have 
intensified. Cloud service providers shifted from building capacity to 
absorbing capacity and the demand pricing environment has further 
deteriorated. Those incremental headwinds are impacting our revenue 
expectations and sligh
tly reducing our operating margin percentage forecast. 
The remaining factors are roughly consistent with our October assessment.
 
Now, turning to our outlook for 2019. We expect 2019 to be another record 
year for us as the world's appetite for the analysis,
 
transmission and storage 
of data continues to grow. We are forecasting revenue of approximately 
$71.5 billion, up 1% year
-
on
-
year and operating margin of approximately 
34%, down less than a point year
-
on
-
year. We expect a modest decrease in 
gross margin p
ercentage, driven by the 10 nanometer ramp and the growth 
of our adjacencies. This will be partially offset by increasing OpEx leverage 
as we continue to make thoughtful trade
-
offs and invest in R&D that will 
accelerate our growth and profitability.
 
We exp
ect the full year tax rate to be approximately 13.5% following several 
beneficial discrete events in 2018 and we expect EPS of $4.60. We expect 
gross capital expenditures of $15.5 billion with logic spending up and 
memory spending down. The increase in log
ic CapEx reflects our effort to 
meet our customers' needs and avoid constraining their growth, while our 
investment in memory is focused on the sit up of our independent 
technology development facility in New Mexico. And finally, we expect free 
cash flow o
f $16 billion, an increase of approximately 12%.
 
As we look to the first quarter of 2019, we are forecasting revenue of 
approximately $16 billion flat year
-
on
-
year excluding Wind River. We expect 
PC centric revenues to be up low single digits on higher mod
ems share and 
data centric revenues to be down low single digits on broad weakness in 
data center and continued NAND pricing pressure. We expect operating 
margin of 29% down 1point year
-
over
-
year with a decline in gross margin as 
a result of the 10 nanomet
er ramp and the growth of adjacencies, partially 
offset by increased spending leverage. We expect EPS of $0.87 flat year
-
on
-
year.
 
We expect 2019 to be our fourth to record year in a row. We feel great 
about where we are and where we're going. Five years ag
o, we set out to 
transform Intel from a PC centric company to a data centric company. 
Today, our strategy, products and people, are delivering on that ambition 
with strong growth, record results and the largest TAM opportunity in the 
company's history.
 
I'v
e been inspired and humbled time and time again by our employees' 
commitment to this company, their colleagues and our customers, and we're 
just getting started. I am convinced the board will close on a new CEO in the 
near future and I believe the manageme
nt team, myself and 107,000 
employees will rally behind him or her to take this company to a whole new 
level. In the meantime, we will not be distracted by the board.
 
With that, let me turn it over back to Mark and we'll get to your questions.
 
Mark Henning

Thank you, Bob. Moving on now to the Q&A as is our normal practice, we 
would ask each participant to ask just one question. Operator, please 
introduce our first questioner.

[Operator instructions] Our first question 
comes from John Pitzer with Crédit 
Suisse. Your line is now open.
 
John Pitzer
 
Just relative to the DC, the data center guidance for the full year above mid 
single digits year over year in calendar year '19, you did a good job 
explaining what's causing the 
weakness in Q1 DCG and the NAND pricing. 
But as you look throughout the year from a minus low single digits to full 

against what becomes part of year
-
over
-
year compares in the J
une and 
September timeframe, at least. I'm just curious if you can help us frame 
how you think that reacceleration occurs how long of a pause products are 
you are seeing with the cloud customers? And importantly, how are you 
thinking about increased compet
ition in '19 in the data centric businesses, 
especially in the server business as you think about mid
-
single digit year
-
over
-
year growth?
 
Bob Swan
 
I'll take a stab, and then Navin is here with me as well, I am sure he has a 
few comments. First, I 
would say that as we look at just overall demand for 
the data center environment, the end user demand by consumers and by 
enterprises, the workloads that we're seeing, the continued growth in 
workloads, we are as excited about the future as we've ever been
. So we 
feel pretty good about the medium and long
-
term trend. As you know in 
2018, our growth rate particularly in the cloud was up 45% through the first 
nine months of the year. So what we saw in the fourth quarter was, as I've 
mentioned, we saw a little
 
bit of consumption going on. As you know, the 
purchases are done in cycles, massive purchases through the first nine 
months. And we started to see some of those purchases consumed in the 
fourth quarter. And we end the year we think with inventory levels o
n the 
server side of the business just a little bit higher than they have been 
historically.
 
So as we project forward in the first six months of the year, we think that 
it's going to continue to be both consumption on the server
-
side and pricing 
in the NSG
 
environment to be down through the first six months. And 
consistent with historical patterns, we do expect the purchasing to start 
picking up again in the second half of the year. So that's how we see it. 
Medium long
-
term we feel great, massive buying in 
the first nine months. 
The buying slowed a bit in fourth quarter and we expect that to continue 
through the first six months. I think the last part of your question I think 
just competitively, and then I'll kick it over to Navin. We're going into 2019 
with
 
every expectation to compete to protect our share position across our 
entire business. So we're obviously investing in the capital required to 

R&D. And third, we're going to invest
 
to protect our competitive position, 
both on the PC side and the data centric side.
 
So yes, we expect competition to be stronger as we go through '19. But our 
guidance incorporates the fact that we're going to fight to protect our 
position.
 
Navin Shenoy
 
M
aybe the only thing I would add, John, is that from a product point of view, 
the dynamic to think about in 2019 is that as Bob mentioned, we began 
shipping for production Cascade Lake, our next generation Xeon. And really 
that product is going to ramp, sta
rt to ramp in the middle part of the year 
and into the second of the year. The design momentum looks very strong. 
The product features look very compelling. The AI capability we have with 
DL Boost to support for Optane for persistent memory, the security 
h
ardware mitigation fixes, so that the customer momentum around that 
pipeline looks very strong. But it really doesn't ramp into the middle to the 
second half of the year. So as Bob said, the first half a little bit tougher but 
second half with product mome
ntum, as well as what we're hearing from our 
customers, we expect to be better in the Data Center Group.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. And our next question comes from Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein 
Research. Your line is now open.
 
Stacy Rasgon
 
So maybe generalize on t
hat. If I just look through your guidance, you're 
basically guiding flat in Q1. And roughly flattish for the full year, which 

very similar to the trajectory you had in 2018, which
 
was very, very strong 
sequentially in many of the quarters. So I guess what is the risk just given 
everything that's going on that that maybe too aggressive, especially as you 
had a number of drivers in 2018, both on the data center as well as on the 
clie
nt side that aren't going to be repeating in 2019. How do we think about 
that?
 
Bob Swan
 
Well first, yes, 2018 was a great year. And as we mentioned earlier, it grew 
during the course of the year. But a function we believe Stacy is just the end 
demand for d
ata, and we haven't seen that slowdown at all. Again, on 
workloads insights from our customer and the industry, workloads continue 
to grow. The demand for analytics for compute for storage, for rapid 
retrieval, we think only continues to grow. And we belie
ve that we have a 
very good position as we go into the year, including the products that Navin 
referenced. So we go into the year we think setting expectations in line with 
how we expect things to play out.
 
And I would say you know today our outlook is lit
tle more cautious than it 
was two months ago. And we try to take into account both the macro 
economics, the geopolitical risks, the modest inventory build as we enter the 
year and the competitive environment. And we've taken those into account 
and reflecte
d them the best we can as we go into the year. And we feel you 
know we feel pretty good about how things stack up right now. And our 
expectation as we have in the past is to deliver on the commitments we 
make as we kick off the year.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. An
d our next question comes from Pierre Ferragu with New 
Street Research. Your line is now open.
 
Pierre Ferragu
 
I was surprised Bob on your CapEx guidance and especially on the memory 
side. So my understanding is that last year you spent about $3 billion the
re 
with about half of that money actually coming from your clients, so not 
actually Intel Capital being deployed. So if you had $1.5 billion build out of 
Intel Capital deployed memory last year. If I look at your guide and think 
logic is slightly up, memor
y is going to be slightly down. So the actual Intel 
Capital invested deployed into memory this year is going to be up massively, 
maybe closer 2x and that's in a year in which everybody in the value chain, 
everybody in the memory industry is actually puttin
g back on CapEx and 
limiting capacity addition. So I'd love to understand how you see that and 
how you position Intel this year in memory?
 
Bob Swan
 
First, just maybe start with as we see free cash flow for the year, we expect 
to be up $2 billion year
-
on
-
ye
ar with gross capital relatively flat. And I think 
you said this but just to repeat, 15.5 going to 15.5. During the course of '19, 
our expectations are of that mix that we'll be more logic oriented. And that's 
really driven by a couple things; one, ensurin
g we have the capacity to meet 
the 14 nanometer demand for our customers; secondly, as we ramp 10 
nanometer in 2019 and position for 10 in 2020, we'll invest the additional 
capital there; and then third, obviously, our expectations there to continue 
to inv
est in next node of technology and particularly 7 nanometer.
 
The logic capital is going to be going up year
-
over
-
year. And as we 
indicated, memory capital will be coming down. We put the capacity in place 
in Dalian during the course of the '17 and '18. And
 
our expectations are in 
2019 that we have sufficient capacity for demand. However, we are going to 
be investing in our own capabilities or self
-
sufficiencies for Optane product. 
So we will use some capital on building out Optane capacity but memory 
capita
l will be a bit lower 
--
 
gross capital will be a bit lower during the course 
of the year.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. And our next question comes from Chris Stanley with Citigroup. 
Your line is now open.
 
Chris Stanley
 
I'm going to shift to the expense line. So may
be give us a little more color 
on OpEx and gross margin trends, and how you are going to hit the 
operating margin target?
 
Bob Swan
 
So first gross margin, the qualitative context is we expect gross margins to 
come down modestly off of Q4 levels and a little
 
bit more off full
-
year 18 
levels. And we do expect that that will be largely, although not completely, 
offset by outstanding as a percentage of revenue coming down again in 
2019. I think just on the gross margin, the trends are going to be a little bit 
si
milar to what you see in the past. Although, we do expect a little bit less 
ASP gross margin improvement from ASP. We expect unit cost to be up a 
little bit and that will be primarily as we ramp 10 nanometer. And then the 
mix dynamics of more memory and mo
re modem will weigh on gross margin 
a bit. So year
-
on
-
year, we expect gross margins to come down a little bit.
 
On spending, as you know, we exit this year with spending levels down in 
the 26% in the fourth quarter and little under 29% for the full year. So
 
we're 
way ahead of our the three year plans that we laid out a couple years ago, 
and we feel pretty good about the progress we've made on the spending. 
We've done it without cutting R&D. During that timeframe, R&D has grown. 
We've been investing in the ri
ght things. Those things are growing faster. As 
a result spending has come down 700 points from 2015 levels. As we go into 
2019, spending overall we expect to come down. Some things we did during 
the course of the second half of '18, including the exit of 
--
 
we exited Wind 
River, we exited wearables, we exited some of our new technology small 
little businesses. We exited those businesses in the second half of the year. 
And we did some restructure in the second half of the year. So as we go into 
'18, all tha
t benefit from a relatively low Q4, $4.9 billion run rate, we expect 
that standing for the full year will be down year on year.
 
So your net all that together and we have a 
--
 
we've been really focused on 
growing the operating income dollars of the company.
 

--
 
we focus 
on but we're not preoccupied with where the gross margin is going to land. 
Our focus has been on how do we grow the operating income dollars of the 
company. And a relatively small growth year, we see keeping operating 
margins at 34% 
to be a relatively good place without shooting the 
investments we need to make to continue to progress into '19 and '20.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. And our next question comes from Ross Seymore with Deutsche 
Bank. Your line is now open.
 
Ross Seymore
 
Just want to follow up. Bob you gave a lot of great detail there on the 
margin side, especially on the OpEx side. I want to go right back to the 
gross margin side though. And somewhat simplistically perhaps, but you 
kept the gross margin guide basically th
e same as you did at the end of last 
quarter despite the headwinds to mix seemingly with your data centric 
commentary and data center being worse and your revenue being lower. So 
is there any more color you can give on the puts and takes that leads to just
 
the modest decrease given those other variables that seem like they have 
increased as headwinds from when you last talked about gross margin in 
'19.
 
Bob Swan
 
The gross margin, Ross, isn't really any different. The puts and takes back 
then as I indicated w
ere modest ASP growth as we are going to fight to 
protect our market share position, we don't expect a lot ASP growth. Again, 
10 nanometer ramp not really any different, I highlighted it in the prepared 
remarks we feel very good about where we are. And ram
ping 10 nanometer 
during the course of the year to get systems on the shelf for the holiday 
season, so no real change there. And modem and memory growth will be a 
little bit slower today versus where we were 90 days ago. So on the 
operating margin percent 
that's a slight positive.
 
The real only change from 90 days ago is just we're a little more cautious on 
our revenue outlook, and our spending hasn't really changed. So we got a 
slight, not as much to leverage that we expected back in October, but still 
goo
d spending leverage during the course of the year. So, not really any 
difference on the gross margin and spending dynamics that we thought 90 
days ago except a little less leverage on the spending line.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. And our next question comes from 
the Vivek Arya with Bank of 
America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.
 
Vivek Arya
 
Within DCG, how should we think about the mix of cloud versus comps, 
versus enterprise for Q1 and 2019? Thank you.
 
Navin Shenoy
 
We've been over the last 18 months working 
hard to diversify the end 
customer segment mix inside of DCG. And the three large components, the 
enterprise and government segment, the Cloud segment and the com 
segment. Cloud and coms is about two thirds of the business now where it 
was about one third 
several years ago. And so I don't see any major 
changes to the way things play out in terms of where the growth will come 
from as we look into 2019 and beyond. While the first half in the cloud will 
be a little bit tougher, we do expect that cloud continue
s to grow as they 
start to move into build out again in the second half. The com segment, we 
continue to gain share in that segment, a large TAM where we have 
relatively small share. And as we grow our network SoC portfolio and as the 
market moves to 5G, w
e expect to continue to gain share.
 
And in the enterprise and government segment, while we've seen 
stabilization there over the last four or five quarters we're not really counting 
on the enterprise and government segments for growth. We do expect that 
ent
erprises will continue to make strategic choices about what to deploy on
-
premise and what to deploy in the cloud. And in general, that business is not 
one that we count on for growth. So in general, you'll see us continue to 
push on comps and cloud to driv
e growth, particularly in the second half of 
the year.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. And our next question comes from Chris Caso with Raymond 
James. Your line is now open.
 
Chris Caso
 
Just wanted to receive an update on the some of the CPU shortages that 
you've been 
experiencing, and how you are progressing on alleviating those 
shortages. What affect that may have had on the Q4 results given that I 
guess there was some supply tightness at least coming into the quarter. And 
then on that with demand slowing a bit, is th
ere any fear, do you have any 
visibility about customers who may have attempted or succeeded in building 
some inventory in those shortages?
 
Bob Swan
 
First, in the fourth quarter just in terms of isolating how we prioritize our 
capacity. There were no short
ages. Within the client business prioritization of 
big core and to a lesser extent small core lower value oriented products. And 
so we do feel like we constrained a fairly healthy PC ecosystem in the fourth 
quarter. I think when the dust settles on PC TAM,
 
our expectation is that 
was probably flat and our shipments were down 2%. And that was the 
function of we delivered every product that we could right up through 
December 31st. So we did have some constraints on the ecosystem and on 
our customers during th
e course of the quarter.
 
At the end of the year, Chris, I think inventory levels relative to the 
beginning of the year, were a little bit higher, maybe a week and a half, two 
weeks higher as we enter the year. Our expectations for the year is the PC 
TAM is
 
going to be relatively flat and that process is a good place to be. 
We're probably halfway through the PC refresh cycle. And we still think it'd 
be relatively flat during the year. Inventory levels in the channels a little bit 
higher ending the year. For 
us inventory levels were relatively low as you 
might imagine on CPU just because of the constraints we've been dealing 
with.
 
Our expectation is working with our customers that we will be through the 
supply constraints as we exit the second quarter of the y
ear. Again, we'll use 
the same prioritization of server, big core small core. But we'll be a little bit 
short on some product mix and on small core until we get probably through 
the second quarter. And that will constrain us a little bit on just overall 
gr
owth in the first half of the year.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. And our next question comes from Harlan Sur with JP Morgan. 
Your line is open.
 
Harlan Sur
 
Just wanted to get an update on 10 nanometer manufacturer built in. Last 
quarter, the team mentioned 10 nanome
ter yields were tracking 14 
nanometer yields at a similar point prior to production ramp. Is the team still 
seeing good improvements in 10 nanometer yields? Are you still tracking 14 
nanometer yield ramps? And can you just give us an update on early 7 
nano
meter development and manufacturability?
 
Murthy Renduchintala
 
I can only add to what Bob said in his opening statements that we continue 
to make solid progress against our plan that we shared with you during the 
course of 2018. And as I said on the last ca
ll, I feel better about our traction 
today than I did 90 days ago. So that continues to bode well for our product 
launch ambitions, which Bob summarized is having systems on shelf for 
holiday season in 2019 with a barrage of products across all of our 
busi
nesses to follow shortly thereafter.
 
And I would like to take the opportunity to just remind everybody that at 
CES and in the analyst meeting we had the end of last year, we did show 10 
nanometer across the entire portfolio of our product ranges. We talked
 
about 
Ice Lake clients, which clearly was top of mind in the early discussion. So we 
also talked about Lakefield. Bob mentioned that as well. Navin talked about 
10 nanometer for Ice Lake server. And we also talked about 10 nanometer 
moving into our networ
k in 5G program which we believe is going to be a big 
growth sector.
 
So the story is not just about 10 nanometer yields but 10 nanometer now 
being a key part of our entire product portfolio. And as I say, I think that 
coupled with our focus on the 
pillars of technology that Bob talked about, in 
my mind I think puts our product portfolio looking forward in a pretty good 
position. So net
-
net, I think 10 nanometer is looking better now than at the 
last earnings call. It's broadly deployed across our po
rtfolios. And that in 
combination with the other technology ingredients that Bob talked about, we 
believe sets us up for a pretty exciting product roadmap.
 
Operator
 
Our next question comes from Ambrish Srivastava with BMO. Your line is 
now open.
 
Ambrish Sr
ivastava
 
Bob, I just wanted to go back to the NSG and the profitability in what was a 
really booming year for memory. Obviously, prices started to come down 
back half of the year but NSG was barely profitable. So just from a CFO 
perspective, what is your t
olerance level for having a business segment that 
could go into a deep cyclical 6% downturn and not could? It is heading into a 
deep cyclical downturn. So how do you think about having a commodity 
within the Intel umbrella and again, the risk tolerance 

 
n
ot the risk 
tolerance for lack of profitability? Just your perspective on that please, thank 
you.
 
Bob Swan
 
First, a couple of things. When we look at, I mentioned this in the prepared 
remarks and Murthy touched on it. When we look at the technologies that 
we believe are going to be imperatives and going forward in this increasingly 
data centric world, process, CPU architecture, interconnect, software, 
memory is a key component. And all the advancements in CPUs will be 
constrained if you don't have different
iated technology in memory. So we 
think that the role memory plays going forward is increasingly important.
 
In terms of the just the CFO lens of having a commodity in the portfolio, I'm 
not too excited about it. And that's why the investments we're making 
in 
memory are for what we believe differentiated technology, both in the 
manufacturing process capabilities of 3D NAND, but also the differentiated 
technology for Optane and the role that it plays, both on the PC side but 
most importantly for us on the dat
a centric side. So we're not particularly 
excited about commodities. When we make these investments, it's really 
geared towards products and technologies that are increasingly important, 
and those technologies that are differentiated from the core memory s
pace 
that help us in conjunction with the CPU solve customers' problems.
 
Navin Shenoy
 
And I'll just maybe add one thing, it's Navin, as an example of that. The 
Optane persistent memory combined with Cascade Lake and Xeon plus 
Optane that is a platform play
. Optane persistent memory works uniquely 
with Xeon. And as I think about and talk to customers about the massive 
amount of data growth we're seeing, the ability for us to uniquely tie those 
two assets together to solve customers' problem is a differentiat
or for us, 
and allows us to drive growth. And so to the extent we can exploit more of 
those opportunities, things get more exciting from a business unit Xeon 
point of view.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. And our next question comes from Timothy Arcuri with UBS. 
Your 
line is now open.
 
Timothy Arcuri
 
Navin, I had a question for you. And there seems to me a little bit of 
different tone between what we hear from your cloud customers, the 
compute guys, you and the memory guys, are seeing weakness but the 
networking company
 
still sound fine. So is it just an inventory digestion of 
computer and servers, or is there something structurally happening there?
 
Navin Shenoy
 
I think as Bob said and I think we've talked about a little bit. We had three 
quarters and really, really stro
ng growth in 2018 in the cloud, and that was 
driven by product cycle, as well as the typical multiyear build out pattern 
with Xeon scalable. And if you look back at all the historical trends we have 
had in the cloud business, we've always said there is som
e lumpiness to the 
business, and there is periods where people build and then there's periods 
where people consume. The signals we get from our customers is period of 
build for compute is going to shift now to a period of consumption, and that 
started in t
he second half in the fourth quarter and we expect that to 
continue through the first half of the year.
 
Secularly, over the long
-
term, meaning in the long
-
term, the cloud business 
is going to continue to grow. There's no doubt about that. Both the 
consumer
 
cloud and the enterprise commercial cloud, we see both of those 
continue to grow. And the appetite for compute I think is somewhat 
insatiable. Bob talked about compute cycle growth. Our five
-
year forecast for 
compute cycle growth or MIPS growth is 50% CAG
R over the next five years. 
And I see nothing slowing that down over the next number of years. So 
that'd be how I answer that one.
 
Bob Swan
 
Maybe if I could just close out, Mark. We think 2018 was a great year. Our 
strategically what it is we're trying to 
do and the opportunities we see are as 
strong if not stronger today heading forward as they've ever been. We think 
'19 for us is going to be another record year. At the same time, we realized 
that first quarter is just going to be lower and the practical r
eality is we got 
-
-
 
we think we have a reasonably good read on the level of inventory that's in 
the ecosystem. I'd say this particularly for 
--
 

on the Diagnostics around the DCG business. The Q4 to Q1 dynamics for 
DCG histor
ically have been sequentially down 8% to 10%. And the practical 
reality is as we see it now is that could be double in the first quarter. But 
that has nothing to do with the strength of the business, the product line 
portfolio we have coming and our excite
ment about delivering a real strong 
2019 as we go forward. So thank you very much for joining us. And I'm sure 
we'll talk to you soon.

Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Intel Corporation Q1 
2016 earnings conference call. At this time, all participants are in a listen
-
only mode. Later, we will conduct a question
-
and
-
answer session, and 
instructions will be 
given at that time. As a reminder, this conference call is 
being recorded.
 
I would now like to turn the conference to Mark Henninger, Head of Investor 
Relations. You may begin.

Thank you, Nicole, and
 
welcome, everyone, to Intel's first quarter 2016 
earnings conference call. By now, you should have received a copy of our 
earnings release, CFO commentary and the announcement of our 
restructuring program. If you've not received all three documents, they'
re 
available on our investor website, intc.com.
 
I'm joined today by Brian Krzanich, our CEO; and Stacy Smith, our Chief 
Financial Officer. In a moment, we'll hear brief remarks from both of them, 
followed by the Q&A. Before we begin, let me remind everyone
 
that today's 
discussion contains forward
-
looking statements based on the environment as 
we currently see it, and as such, does include risks and uncertainties. Please 
refer to our press release for more information on the specific risk factors 
that could 
cause actual results to differ materially.
 
And a brief reminder that this quarter, we provided both GAAP and non
-
GAAP financial measures, following the acquisition of Altera, now our 
Programmable Solutions Group. Today, we will be speaking to the non
-
GAAP 
financial measures. The CFO commentary and earnings release available on 
intc.com include the full GAAP and non
-
GAAP reconciliations.
 
With that out of the way, let me turn it over to Brian.

Thanks, Mar
k. Our results in Q1 were in the lower half of the range we set in 
January and reflect an extra work week in the quarter. Revenue increased 
year
-
over
-
year, driven by an expanding business portfolio that now includes 
the Programmable Solutions Group, former
ly known as Altera. Strength in 
our Data Center, Internet of Things and Programmable Solutions businesses 
partially offset weaker
-
than
-
expected PC revenues in our Client business. I'll 
take a minute to review our Q1 results before talking about the restruc
turing 
program we're announcing today.
 
CCG revenue grew 2% year
-
over
-
year. We saw ongoing declines in the PC 
TAM, particularly in China and other emerging markets, which also led to 
greater
-
than
-
anticipated reductions in worldwide PC supply chain inventory
. 
Declines in the PC segment were offset by a richer core mix and the 14th 
work week.
 
The Data Center business posted another good quarter, growing 9% over 
last year on strong cloud and comms service provider demand, partially 
offset by ongoing softness in
 
the enterprise. The Internet of Things Group 
grew a remarkable 22% year
-
over
-
year due largely to the performance of 
the video and retail verticals. In the Memory business, strong unit growth 
was offset by pricing declines leading to revenue that was 6% lo
wer year
-
over
-
year, and in our Security business, revenue grew 12%, as this team 
continues to tighten its focus and execution.
 
And finally the PSG Group, formerly known as Altera, got off to a great start. 
It delivered a revenue of $359 million. And after 
adjusting for $100 million in 
acquisition
-
related accounting charges, the business achieved mid
-
single
-
digit growth. In less than a quarter after the deal closed, we are shipping 
our first FPGA Xeon co
-
packaged parts to customers in sample form.
 
These resu
lts tell the story of Intel's ongoing strategic transformation, which 
is progressing well and will accelerate in 2016. We are evolving from a PC 
company to a company that powers the cloud and billions of smart 
connected and computing devices. The Data Cent
er and Internet of Things 
businesses are now Intel's primary growth engines, and combined with 
Memory and FPGAs form and fuel a virtuous cycle of growth.
 
Last year, we achieved record revenue in the Data Center, Internet of Things 
and Memory businesses. Th
ey delivered a combined $2.2 billion in revenue 
growth and made up 40% of our total revenue and contributed the majority 
of our operating profit.
 
Today, we announced a series of actions that will build on the strength of 
those franchises and accelerate our
 
strategic transformation. Through this 
initiative, we will intensify our investments in the products and technologies 
that fuel the growth in the Data Center, IoT, Memory and FPGA businesses. 
And we expect it will result in an even more profitable Client 
business.
 
These changes will reduce our global employment by about 12,000 positions 
by mid
-
2017. We'll do this through site consolidation, voluntary and 
involuntary separations, project reevaluation and an intensified focus on 
efficiency across a variety o
f programs. These are not changes we take 
lightly. We will be saying goodbye to colleagues who have played an 
important role in Intel's success. Yet acting now gives us flexibility, flexibility 
to continue to invest in those Client segments that are growin
g, including 2
-
in
-
1, gaming, and home gateway, among others.
 
Even more importantly, acting now enables us to increase our investments 
in areas that are critical to our future success. This restructuring program 
will allow us to expand our investments in th
e Data Center, the Internet of 
Things, Memory and connectivity, even as we reduce our spending run rate 
by roughly $1.4 billion by mid
-
2017. This is a comprehensive initiative. It's 
designed to create long
-
term value by accelerating the fundamental long
-
te
rm change already happening at the company today. We will emerge as a 
more collaborative, productive team with broader reach and sharper 
execution and we expect it to result in the highest revenue per employee in 
the company's history.
 
Last, but certainly 
not least, we have one additional announcement today. 
I'm happy to share that Stacy Smith will be taking on a broader new role 
within Intel and reporting to me, leading sales, manufacturing and 
operations. Stacy has been a great business partner and a worl
d
-
class CFO 
and I'm looking forward to continuing the partnership as he brings his 
leadership, his depth of knowledge, and his breadth into these critically 
important areas for Intel's future. We expect this transition to occur over the 
next few months, fo
llowing a formal CFO search that will assess internal and 
external candidates. Stacy will remain in his CFO role throughout the search 
and transition process. Congratulations, Stacy.
 
And with that, let me turn the call over to you.

Thank you very much, Brian, and I really appreciate the kind words.
 
Revenue for the first quarter was $13.8 billion, up 8% year
-
over
-
year. The 
quarter showed year
-
on
-
year growth and was in the low end of the rang
e of 
our prior outlook. Within this, we are seeing growth in the Data Center, 
Internet of Things, Security and Programmable Solutions Groups, all of 
which helped offset a weak PC market.
 
First quarter gross margin of 62.7% was approximately a point higher 
than 
our expectations, driven by lower 14nm costs. R&D and MG&A was $5.4 
billion, down over $100 million from our guidance. Operating income of $3.3 
billion was up 13% from a year ago. The effective tax rate for the quarter 
was 18.4%, about seven points lo
wer than our prior outlook. Earnings per 
share of $0.54 was up 20% from a year ago.
 
The Client Computing Group had revenue of $7.5 billion, a 2% increase 
year
-
over
-
year. This was below our expectations due to a weaker
-
than
-
expected PC market. Operating pro
fit for the Client Computing Group was 
$1.9 billion, up 34% from a year ago. This improvement is driven by lower 
14nm unit costs on notebooks, lower overall total spending and margin 
improvements in our mobile products. Data Center Group had revenue of $4 
billion, delivering 9% growth on a year
-
over
-
year basis. Relative to our 
expectations, we saw a weaker enterprise business offset by strength in the 
cloud segment. The Data Center Group had operating profit of $1.8 billion, 
up 4% year
-
over
-
year as we ramp 
are 14nm server products.
 
Our Internet of Things segment achieved revenue of $651 million, with year
-
over
-
year growth of 22%. We saw strength in both the retail and video 
display segments of our business. Internet of Things operating profit was 
$123 millio
n, up over 40% relative to last year. Our Security business had 
revenue of $537 million, up 12% year
-
over
-
year. Our Memory business had 
revenue of $557 million, up 6% year
-
over
-
year. The segment had an 
operating loss of $95 million as a result of challengi
ng pricing, increased 3D 
XPoint spending and startup costs as we ramp 3D NAND in our China 
factory.
 
The Programmable Solutions Group had revenue of $359 million. When 
adjusted for the approximately $100 million of deferred revenue and 
compared to Altera's 
results from a year ago, the business achieved mid
-
single
-
digit revenue growth. Operating profit was a negative $200 million. 
This included over $300 million in non
-
cash charges for deferred revenue 
and inventory adjustments plus certain acquisition
-
relate
d charges. 
Excluding these charges would result in low double
-
digit operating margin 
growth for this business.
 
We generated $4.1 billion of cash from operations in the first quarter. We 
purchased $1.3 billion in capital assets, paid $1.2 billion in dividen
ds and 
repurchased approximately $800 million of stock in the first quarter. Total 
cash balance at the end of the quarter was roughly $15 billion, down $10 
billion from the prior quarter as a result of closing the Altera acquisition. Our 
total debt is appr
oximately $25 billion, consistent with our prior commentary 
on the financing plan for the Altera acquisition.
 
As we look forward to the second quarter of 2016, we are forecasting the 
midpoint of the revenue range at $13.5 billion. After adjusting for 
the extra 
work week in the first quarter, this forecast is in the low end of the average 
seasonal increase for the second quarter. We are forecasting the midpoint of 
the gross margin range to be 61%, plus or minus a couple of points. This 
decrease in compa
rison to the first quarter is driven by lower platform 
volumes.
 
Turning to the full year 2016, we expect revenue growth in the mid
-
single 
digits from 2015, down from the prior guidance. We are forecasting robust 
growth rates in the Data Center, Internet of
 
Things, Non
-
Volatile Memory 
Solutions and Programmable Solutions Groups, which we expect to offset the 
decline in the Client Computing Group. We now expect the PC markets to 
decline in the high single digits in 2016 versus our prior forecast of mid
-
single
-
digit decline.
 
Our projection of the PC market remains more cautions than third
-
party 
estimates. We are forecasting the midpoint of the full year gross margin to 
be 62%, a one
-
point decrease from the prior outlook driven by lower 
platform volumes. Our exe
cution of our strategy is driving growth. We are 
building on our strong position in Client and are investing for growth in the 
Data Center, Internet of Things markets and disruptive differentiated 
memory technology.
 
The trends over the last two years demon
strate that we are well into this 
transformational journey. From 2013 to 2015, the PC TAM declined 10%, yet 
Intel's revenue grew 5% and our operating profit grew 14% over this 
horizon. But as Brian mentioned, we want to accelerate that execution. In 
order 
to do that, we're going to go through a significant restructuring over 
the next several months. The goal is to come out of this more agile, more 
efficient, with more investment on our key growth initiatives and more 
profitable.
 
When completed by mid
-
2017, 
these actions will result in a 12,000
-
person 
workforce reduction and a $1.4 billion reduction to our spending run rate. 
Relative to full
-
year 2016, we are now revising our spending guidance down 
by over $700 million to $20.6 billion. We expect to realize o
ver half of the 
total workforce reduction by the end of this year.
 
In the second quarter of this year, we are taking a $1.2 billion restructuring 
charge on the GAAP P&L as an estimate for the related actions. These 
actions are significant, and we don't emb
ark on this lightly. But we are 
confident that they will build on the strong position we have across markets 
and accelerate the transformation of the company that is already underway.
 
I would like to end on a brief personal note by saying thank you to Bria
n for 
the upcoming new leadership opportunity. Intel changes the world with 
amazing technology, and I am proud of what we have accomplished and I'm 
excited about the opportunity that's in front of us.
 
With that, let me turn it back over to Mark.

Question

and
-
Answer Session
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Ross Seymore of 
Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.
 
Ross C. Seymore

Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
 
Hi, guys. Thanks for letting m
e ask a question. I guess first and foremost, 
B.K., if you can, go into a little bit more about what led to the restructuring 
announcement. Not only the one today, but there have been significant 
changes in senior management over the last three months. So 
if you could, 
just talk us through some of what's changed strategically in the company 
that's led to such a large amount of turnover so recently.
 
Brian M. Krzanich 
-
 
Chief Executive Officer & Director
 
Sure. If you take a look at it, so let's step back for 
a second and just talk 
about why are we doing the restructuring now, and then we can talk about 
some of the specifics beyond that. So we've talked about this 
transformation, that we're moving from a client
-
centric 

 
Intel's been 
typically known as the PC c
ompany, to a company that is focused more and 
more on a much broader set of products and really focused around the 
cloud, and the cloud and all the connected devices that connect to that cloud 
and the connectivity that brings those devices to the cloud. An
d that 
includes the PC, but it's much more than that.
 
And so what this effort around the restructuring is, is to say it's time now to 
try and 

 
we've made enough progress. You take a look at it, 40% of our 
revenue, 60% of our margin comes from areas other 
than the PC right now. 
It's time to make this transition and push the company over all the way to 
that strategy and that strategic direction. So that's why we wanted to do it 
now.
 
Let's talk then about the leadership changes. There have really only been 
th
ree leadership changes, if we just take the last couple of quarters. We had 
Doug Davis, he's simply retiring. Those are personal reasons. It has nothing 
to do with his leadership or direction of the company. It's IoT. We've talked 
about IoT as one of our g
rowth segments that grew 22% this quarter. 
(16:19) performance in the group is strong. And he's staying until we find a 
successor, roughly the end of the year we think, something like that. Kirk 
chose to leave for some outside opportunities.
 
And the one wi
th Stacy, Stacy and I have been working for several months, 
actually several quarters, on what does he do next, how do we grow his both 
exposure to other parts of the company, but also let the rest of the company 
see his leadership style. And so what we wa
nted to do is as soon as we'd 
made the decision to go ahead and start a search and start looking for a CFO 
replacement, we wanted to be completely transparent, be very open about 
that and let everyone know. It's just going to be an orderly transition. We 
a
re just going to start the search, see if Stacy's solid in the CFO seat in the 
meantime. But this gives him a chance to see other parts of the company. If 
you take a look at the group manufacturing operations, which is everything 
from purchasing to buildin
g construction and all, and sales, it's roughly half 
the company and people, and so it's a really good opportunity to see how 
the real operations of the company work.
 
Ross C. Seymore 
-
 
Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
 
Good, thanks for all those details. I gu
ess my follow
-
up would be the full
-
year guidance of mid
-
single
-
digit growth, when I put that together with the 
high single
-
digit decline now that you have in the PC business, I'm having a 
little hard time seeing how if you take the seasonality of PCs out o
f the 
equation in large part, what would be the lever that would get you there in 
the back half of the year, considering that a ramp to well into the $15 billion 
range in revenue seems to be a prerequisite? Are there some moving parts 
you could describe to
 
us that get you comfortable with that number?
 
Stacy J. Smith 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
 
Sure. Let me walk you through how we're viewing the year. And first let me 
just put it at the highest level. What we're projecting for the ye
ar is overall 
growth, and we think we'll see growth in the data center, growth in IoT, 
growth in memory that's offsetting some. And of course we have added in 
Altera now into our product family. And so you take that, and that's 
offsetting some of the weakn
ess that we're seeing in the PC market.
 
Specific to the PC market, as we said in our prepared remarks, we are now 
expecting that the PC market is down in the high single digits, and when we 
started the year we were in the mid
-
single
-
digits decline.
 
The lin
earity, so first you have to understand. The first half is impacted by 
the fact that as our customers' view of the market came down, and if you 
recall, we had a more cautious view of the market than they did when we 
started the year, that they were bringin
g down inventory levels. That 
impacted us in Q1, and I think you'll see the same impact as we forecast a 
roughly seasonal second quarter; that we'll continue to see those customers 
burning off inventory. We think that doesn't repeat in the back half. So 
th
at's a little bit of a tailwind.
 
I'd also say you want to be careful of 

 
we guided to mid
-
single digits. That's 
a range. If you're mathematically trying to drive to a specific number there, 
you may be driving more back end than what we're really anticipat
ing. So 
just a caution there that that's a range that's meant to be directional of how 
we see the business. All of that said, I just want to say I think Brian and I 
are very comfortable with the back end and what's implied in our guide 
based on everything 
that we know.
 
Ross C. Seymore

Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
 
Great, thank you.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Blayne Curtis of 
Barclays. Your line is now open.
 
Blayne Curtis 
-
 
Barclays Capital, Inc.
 
Yes, thanks for 
taking my question. I really just wanted to follow up on the 
restructuring. Is it more an effort to make the Client more profitable, or are 
you really trying to drive revenue and re
-
signing maybe more employees 
than you're letting go?
 
Brian M. Krzanich 
-
 
C
hief Executive Officer & Director
 
So it is absolutely a situation where we are restructuring to be able to allow 
ourselves to invest at a faster rate in those growth areas. If you take a look 
at it, 2016 to 2015 in the areas of Memory with our NAND technol
ogy, IoT, 
data center, even before this action, we were investing more in 2016 than in 
2015 in those areas. This will allow us to 

 
even with the cuts, even with the 
dollar figures that Stacy has read out on the savings, it's allowing us to 
invest even mor
e in those segments.
 
And I always want to make sure it's not just about cutting costs necessarily 
in the Client area. We think that we can become more focused. There are 
areas in the Client space that are growing. 2
-
in
-
1s are growing at double
-
digit rates 
year
-
over
-
year. Our gaming PCs are growing at double
-
digit rates 
year
-
over
-
year. Set
-
top boxes are growing, and we're gaining share in the 
set
-
top box space. So we are doing very well in segments that are growing 
in the Client space and the PC space. And w
e are going to continue to double 
down, focus on those. So it's really a narrowing down and allowing us as a 
result also to invest more in those growth areas. That's really what we're 
doing here with this restructuring.
 
Stacy J. Smith 
-
 
Chief Financial Off
icer & Executive Vice President
 
And, Blayne, just to make sure, if you look at the CFO commentary, just to 
give 

 
kind of make sure the financial answer is clear there, that the $1.4 
billion in run rate savings is a net number. So I just want to be clear o
n that. 
That's what we expect to achieve, and that is encompassing the fact, like 
Brian said, that we'll be increasing investments in a lot of different areas.
 
Brian M. Krzanich 
-
 
Chief Executive Officer & Director
 
Correct.
 
Blayne Curtis 
-
 
Barclays Capital
, Inc.
 
Thanks. And then I know mobile is within Client, but I was wondering if 
that's a segment that you expect to contribute to growth this year, and if 
you could just talk about your confidence in reaching the cost savings for the 
year?
 
Brian M. Krzanich
 
-
 
Chief Executive Officer & Director
 
Sure. Absolutely on schedule for hitting our committed $800 million and just 
like last year, we'll shoot to do better than that. Mobile is absolutely 
continuing to grow for us as a segment, and we are continuing to inc
rease 
our profitability. If you look underneath the numbers here, you'll see that 
the profitability within the mobile space continues to improve for us this year 
over last year.
 
Stacy J. Smith 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
 
Yes, you c
an really see it, Blayne, in the CCG operating profit, that's up over 
30%, which is on roughly flat revenues, revenues that were up a little bit, 
and when you parse out the big contributions there, there's some ASP good 
news, but the really big chunks are 
the improvement in the margin on our 
mobile products and decreases in investments that we talked to you about in 
the past that were all included in that mobile profitability. So you will see 
this play out in the CCG profitability over the course this year,
 
and you can 
see it in Q1.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur of 
JPMorgan. Your line is now open.
 
Harlan Sur

JPMorgan Securities LLC
 
Good afternoon. Thanks f
or taking my question. I'm trying to see if you can 
be just a bit more specific on your full year view. Does the team anticipate 
double
-
digit growth this year in PCG? And if I look at it fundamentally, I 
mean cloud and hyperscale CapEx looks to be up this 
year. There seems to 
be a big upgrade cycle in networking with the move to 25
-
gigabit. You guys 
are rolling out 14nm Broadwell. Can you guys just be a bit more specific on 
expectations for DCG growth?
 
Brian M. Krzanich 
-
 
Chief Executive Officer & Director
 
Sure. You did a great job explaining exactly why we believe that the data 
center will continue in double
-
digit growth this year. And if you take a look 
at the numbers that Stacy has talked about, they incorporate double
-
digit 
growth and it's for exactly th
ose reasons. We believe we have great products 
that we are introducing with the Broadwell lineup. We have got 

 
we started 
shipping our first Xeon plus FPGA samples to customers, which was part of 
our additional gaining more footprint and more performance 
in certain 
segments of the Data Center.
 
We're shipping an Omni
-
Path Fabric now. Later this year, we will have 
Silicon Photonics. We've got 3D XPoint starting to be sampled, and will start 
to ramp later this year. So we're very confident on our Data Center 
roadmap 
and we are still absolutely forecasting double
-
digit growth in that space.
 
Harlan Sur 
-
 
JPMorgan Securities LLC
 
Great, thanks for the insights there. And then in the Memory Solutions 
Group, I mean that's a business that grew 20% last year. I 
think it was up 
year
-
over
-
year every single quarter last year, obviously it was down in Q1. 
You guys mentioned aggressive price declines. Can you just talk about some 
of the trends that you're seeing there? Are the sharp declines more focused 
on capacity o
r performance optimized SSDs? And then you also mentioned 
your view on a strong growth outlook for the full year. So what drives the 
acceleration from the Q1 decline?
 
Brian M. Krzanich 
-
 
Chief Executive Officer & Director
 
Sure. So let me start, and then we
 
can just talk about 

 
remember the 
majority of our Memory space is built into SSDs that are going into the Data 
Center. So you call those, really those higher end performance class 
systems. What we are seeing, if you take a look at the units, units grew 
q
uite nicely year
-
over
-
year and quarter
-
over
-
quarter for the Memory Group. 
You are right. We are seeing aggressive pricing in this space. The Memory 
segment, the NAND segment especially tends to go on these cycles where 
there's overcapacity in the industry 
and aggressive pricing, and then it shifts 
back to more normal pricing, and then tight pricing, which is always very 
positive.
 
So this is just a normal cycle. We think we've done a very good job of 
structuring the business that we ride through these with a
 
high degree of 
confidence. If I look forward, we believe the 3D NAND technology that we're 
just beginning to ramp in our factories today and we're building out the 
Dalian factory for later this year startup, gives us a real cost advantage in 
this space an
d will allow us to even be more profitable in even these kinds of 
environments.
 
So we are still confident that this business will continue to grow. We will ride 
through this capacity situation within the industry and our 3D NAND 
technology will position us
 
very nicely as we move out of this and start up 
our Dalian factory in China.

Great, thank you.
 
Stacy J. Smith

And the operating margin, Harlan, you're looking at tha
t?
 
Harlan Sur 
-
 
JPMorgan Securities LLC
 
Yes.
 
Stacy J. Smith 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
 
Part of it is the competitive pricing environment that Brian is talking about, 
but there's a big piece of that that is associated with the inve
stments that 
we are making in 3D XPoint and the startup costs associated with the factory 
in China. And it just points to, yes, it's cyclically a tough time in what we 
consider a very good business and we're investing in technology that we 
think give us a 
very strong position as we go forward.
 
Harlan Sur

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon of 
Bernstein Research. Your line is now open.
 
Stacy Aaron Rasgon

Bernstein Rese
arch
 
Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. My first one on DCG in the 
quarter, so up 9% year over year, but that was with the extra week. Can 
you tell us what it might have been year over year without the extra week? 
And why did pricing fall again this
 
quarter?
 
Stacy J. Smith 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
 
Yes, so like we said when we started the quarter, that extra week was that 
week between Christmas and New Year's. When you look at where that 14th 
week fell, it's a relatively li
ght week. It certainly had some impact, so I don't 
want to say, none, but it's a little hard to figure it out on any given business. 
It certainly had some impact on DCG though.
 
In terms of the pricing, it's pretty simple in that it was the growth rate that
 
we saw in the networking segment. So what you would see if 

 
the constant 
mix, we would have seen ASP up in the Data Center. But the networking 
segment grew 60% year on year, which is exactly consistent with our 
strategy. And so what you see there is stro
ng unit growth offset by a little 
bit of a mix down.
 
Stacy Aaron Rasgon 
-
 
Bernstein Research
 
Got it, thank you. For my follow
-
up, I just wanted to touch on channel 
inventories. So you had your notebook and desktop volumes I guess down 
kind of low single di
gits year over year. I think it's fair to say the PC builds in 
the industry were down quite a bit more than that. I mean, you suggest that 
you drained out 

 
I guess that the channel drained on inventory. What 
happened with your own inventory in the channel
? And how do you see that 
changing for the rest of the year?
 
Stacy J. Smith 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
 
You said own inventory in the channel...
 
Stacy Aaron Rasgon 
-
 
Bernstein Research
 
The stuff you're shipping into the channel bec
ause it seems like your 
performance year
-
over
-
year was quite a bit better than what the industry 
was? I mean maybe it's some share gains, maybe it's the extra week. 
However, you just said the extra week didn't amount for very much. So can 
you explain the d
ifferential between your year
-
over
-
year unit shipment 
performance in PCs and what the market seems to be doing?
 
Stacy J. Smith 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
 
So I would point to two things relative to the overall 

 
like what we saw 
from 
our customers. One is, yes, we had a 14th week. That's going to make our 
compares different from a IDC and a Gartner for sure. But then the second 
thing is when you look at the results of our customer base, they would see a 
weaker quarter and I think 
that's because they were catching up to our view 
of the market and bringing inventory levels down. So, we were impacted by 
two things. I'll put it like that. We were impacted by a TAM that wasn't 
terribly strong and the fact that our customers were bringin
g their inventory 
levels down some.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Romit Shah of Nomura. 
Your line is now open.
 
Romit J. Shah

Nomura 
Securities International, Inc.
 
Yes. Thanks very much. Stacy, you're below your run rate on CapEx in Q1, 
and I know you reiterated for the year, but curious if you're giving yourself 
flexibility in case the second half doesn't prove out to be as strong as y
ou 
guys are anticipating?
 
Stacy J. Smith 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
 
No. What's going on there is that when you look at the two items that really 
dominated our CapEx this year, it's 10 nm capacity, so it's getting that first 
produc
tion capability in place. And it's the ramp of the Memory factory in 
China, and those are both backend loaded, so that causes the linearity to be 
off a little bit.
 
Romit J. Shah 
-
 
Nomura Securities International, Inc.
 
Okay, thanks. And then just staying on
 
the theme of CapEx with the 
restructuring you guys are talking about, site consolidation, and I'm 
wondering if longer
-
term, there will be an impact to the capital expenditures 
required to support the business and, by extension, free cash flow.
 
Stacy J. Sm
ith 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
 
I'd say the same answer. When you look at those two items that are the 
majority of what we're spending the CapEx on, 10nm and Memory, neither 
one of those is impacted by the restructuring, and so we 
haven't let our foot 
off the gas one bit on those two things.

C.J. Mus
e

Evercore ISI
 
Yes, good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. I guess I had a 
follow
-
up on DCG. Thank you for the commentary around the pricing around 
network. I'm curious how we should think about the mix shift through as we 
go through 2016, and
 
here curious in terms of presumably slowing 
enterprise and an uptick in hyperscale and what that means to ASPs. And 
then as you layer in ongoing growth in networking, how we should think 
about platform versus ASPs moving through the year?
 
Brian M. Krzanic
h 
-
 
Chief Executive Officer & Director
 
Sure, a bit of a complex question, so let me try and give you a lot of data 
that I hope will answer various parts of that question. So first, the simple 
answer. If you take a look at our forecast, we continue to forec
ast ASPs 
increasing through this year, so that's absolutely built into our forecast. And 
we've modeled in things like you described, the weaker enterprise 
computing and the difference between the pricing segments. And I always 
remind people that 

 
let's ju
st start at the very top. When you take a look at 
the Data Center, it's not one product. It's a family of products that really 
span from Xeon Phis that sell for several thousand dollars to networking 
processors that are a few hundred dollars at times.
 
But 
within each one of those families, so whether you have networking or 
cloud or hyperscale or enterprise computing, our ASPs are increasing. And 
that's mostly due to bringing in better products, people buying up the ladder 
in product and resulting in a highe
r ASP on average for any one of those 
segments. So you will see slight shifts in the overall Data Center ASP. We 
have a boomer quarter like this, like Stacy talked about. Networking is a 
little bit higher or something like that, but if you take a look insi
de any one 
of those segments, ASPs are increasing and our forecast for the overall 
segment for the year is an increasing ASP. It's driven by people buying up 
the stock, and that's because we're bringing more performance for a better 
price to those customer
s.
 
C.J. Muse

Evercore ISI
 
That's very helpful. And I guess as a quick follow
-
up, you outlined the cost 
savings, but it doesn't appear as though there's really anything on the COGS 
side, so curious if you see cost savings on that front as well.
 
Stacy J. S

Certainly. We are equally focused on efficiencies in the factory space. 
There's a little bit baked into the 2016 gross margin. I think you'll see a bit 
more of it kick in, in 2017. And just realize 
the labor cost in the factories is a 
relatively small component. The real opportunity for us is some of the other 
things around capital efficiency and how fast we convert over processes and 
things like that, and that takes a little while to play through.

Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for letting me ask the question. I guess my 
first one, I wanted to get a little bit more into profitability within
 
the Data 
Center Group. Revenue was down about $309 million sequentially. Operating 
profit was down $411 million sequentially. I know there are lots of moving 
parts. You had the extra week of OpEx that might not have been fully 
covered by revenue. And, Sta
cy, you talked about in your opening 
comments the 14nm ramp starting to hit there.
 
But with this new narrative of declining ASPs because of mix, I'm wondering 
if you could tell me how we should be thinking about operating profits in the 
business going forw
ard. I think it was about 44% in the March quarter, down 
pretty significantly in the December quarter. Is this change in mix also 
having an impact on operating profits?
 
Stacy J. Smith 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
 
So, John, you naile
d it in terms of what's going on with operating profit in 
Q1. It's just the early cost of the ramp of the 14nm server product. That's 
what's causing that to behave a little differently from revenue. And back to 
Brian's point, I would say no. There's nothin
g in the mix that per se would 
cause me to have a different view of the overall profit potential of this 
business. So taking networking as the example, it does have a lower ASP 
than the Xeon product line does. It also has a very different cost structure 
th
an the Xeon product line does. So it doesn't cause us to be in a different 
space from an overall operating profit percent.
 
John William Pitzer

Credit Suisse Securities (

That's helpful.
 
And then maybe for my follow
-
up to Brian, you guys gave us 
your view for the PC market this year. I'm just curious, in lieu of the 
restructuring, how you're thinking about the PC market longer term. And 
specifically, there's lots going on in the market th
at you probably can't 
control, but there's always been this view at Intel that the best use of cash 
is to invest in the business and to innovate, and innovation drives growth. 
How do you balance that innovation desire with the realities of PC market? 
And h
ow do you think about the structural unit growth of PCs going forward? 
And do we want to risk at some point that PCs just don't provide the scale 
that you've talked about in the past to invest in other businesses like DCG 
and IoT?
 
Brian M. Krzanich 
-
 
Chief
 
Executive Officer & Director
 
Sure. So again, John, that's a bit of a two
-
sided question. So let me start 
with the back half and then we'll move into the first half. So first is no, I'm 
not worried that PC will shrink to a point where the scale will get la
rge 
enough to fund either the factories or the other innovations. The fact that we 
talked about the restructuring actually makes us more profitable in the PC. 
That's allowing us to invest even more in those growth areas. Remember 
also, those growth areas a
re growing, and so they are replacing some of the 
volume in the factories as they grow.
 
Now, let's talk about the PC. You asked, how do we take a look at the PC 
long term and how do we make sure we're making the right investments, 
which to me that's the ke
y. That's what we really tried to do with this 
restructuring, is take a look at the areas that are growing, that we believe 
we can bring innovation to, that will make a difference to the end user. 
You're going to see more investments in 2
-
in
-
1s. You're goi
ng to see more 
investments in thin
-
and
-
light devices. You're going to see us push even 
harder on high
-
end gaming systems, which are growing at a very fast rate, 
and they tend to buy up the stack to the very, very top. And then we're 
continuing to gain shar
e in segments like set
-
top boxes, which are becoming 
more and more PC
-
like in their capabilities, if you think about it from a 
hardware standpoint.
 
So there are absolutely segments we'll continue to invest and continue to 
innovate in. There are some very i
nnovative systems in design right now 
that bring new functionality and new thinness and lightness to the market 
for the second half of this year. And we'll do that. What we're going to do is 
make sure we're not doing 

 
that we're doing this as most efficie
ntly, and 
not doing it spread out across all PCs and all form factors. And that's what 
we've really tried to do with this effort right now.

Thanks a lot. I think just to start, could you just talk about from a 
restructuring cost perspective, how much of that is going to be cash versus 
non
-
cash? And would all the cash outlays happen in the back half of this 
year?
 
Stacy J. Smith 
-
 
Chi
ef Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
 
You were a bit faint. I think you asked on the restructuring, how much of 
that is cash versus non
-
cash, and how does that play out over the year?
 
Amit Daryanani 
-
 
RBC Capital Markets LLC
 
Yes.
 
Stacy J. 
Smith 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
 
Yes, now you're loud and clear. Thanks. So I would say the restructuring 
charge is a mix of cash and non
-
cash, but it's probably 

 
it's more heavily 
weighted towards cash costs. And it will be rela
tively frontend loaded on the 
year, but some of it will extend over the course of the year, and some of it 
frankly will extend into the first half of next year.
 
Amit Daryanani 
-
 
RBC Capital Markets LLC
 
Perfect. And I guess if I could just follow up, 
ASPs in the clients were up 
19%. Just talk about how much of that was potentially CPE improvements 
on notebook and desktop pricing versus the lower mobility that may have 
had a better part to play there?
 
Stacy J. Smith 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer & Executive
 
Vice President
 
And if you look at the CFO commentary, we actually gave you desktop and 
notebook. What you'll see is that notebook was pretty flat from an ASP 
standpoint year on year. Desktop was up 6%. So that is one of the adders to 
profitability.
 
And th
en the big difference is what happened in phones and tablets. On a 
year
-
on
-
year basis I think I termed it in the CFO commentary, up 
significantly as we weaned ourselves out of some of those contra revenue 
programs that we talked to you about. So that actua
lly had a fairly 
significant impact on the overall ASP for CCG.

Thank you. Our next question comes fro
m the line of Vivek Arya of Bank of 
America. Your line is now open.
 
Vivek Arya 
-
 
Bank of America Merrill Lynch
 
Thank you for taking my question. Brian, on the Data Center Group, there 
are a lot of headlines from IBM, from the different ARM server vendors, 
and 
even from some of your cloud customers, like Google, who want to try new 
architectures. And I understand there is no near
-
term impact, but longer
-
term, how do you assess the competitive landscape? And especially how do 
you think it plays out in the com
pute market, where you are a very large 
incumbent versus the comms market where you're not the incumbent?
 
Brian M. Krzanich 
-
 
Chief Executive Officer & Director
 
Sure, good question, Vivek. First, I'll just tell you that having been raised by 
Andy Grove, al
ways paranoid about the competition, always driving. And we 
know that we live or die by the performance of our products. We believe if 
you take a look at our roadmaps, we have a strong competitive leadership 
that should allow us to continue to have the pos
ition in the market that we 
currently have.
 
I think also you have to take a look at some of our strategy that is becoming 
much, much broader than just the CPU. What we are trying to do is really 
provide top
-
of
-
rack to bottom
-
of
-
rack solutions that bring, t
hat work 
together and bring performance across the whole rack. And that starts with 
Rack Scale Architecture itself, which is a very unique architecture that will 
allow people to build racks in a much denser and lower cost way to Silicon 
Photonics for withi
n rack communication. Then we've got a 3D XPoint, and 
then you have our whole CPU architecture from networking, storage, up 
through server.
 
So we believe we are uniquely positioned to provide that whole rack 
viewpoint and have everything work together, and
 
come together to bring 
really performance that is just unbelievable. And that's what's key to really 
keeping our position is to own that, is to understand that whole rack from 
top to bottom. And that really is our strategy when you take a look at it.
 
In t
he other areas, like you said, networking and storage and the telco area, 
those are areas that we're gaining share. And we are, as they move to 
software
-
defined infrastructure, and basically virtualized infrastructure, it 
plays right into the Intel archite
cture and really what we do best, which is 
general purpose computing. And that same architecture from top of rack to 
bottom of rack plays out in those areas as well like in the telco area. So we 
believe our strategy absolutely will maintain our position in
 
that. But we're 
always paranoid and we're always realizing we get there by performance of 
those products.
 
Vivek Arya 
-
 
Bank of America Merrill Lynch
 
Got it, thanks for those details. As a follow
-
up, I know you probably have 
answered different pieces of th
is question. But perhaps if, Stacy, you could, 
help us quantify what Intel's target operating margins are this year or 
maybe even longer term. Because when I look at a lot of fabless 
semiconductor companies, they can get towards 20% 

 
25% operating 
margins
. And when I look at a foundry like TSMC, it's able to get close to 
40% operating margin. So given those bookends, where should Intel be 
after all these restructuring actions are taken?
 
Stacy J. Smith 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
 
Le
t me give you some elements of it. And then I would expect we'll have a 
much more in
-
depth conversation on that at the next investor meeting. But I 
will give you some insight into how Brian and I are thinking of this. First and 
foremost, we believe there i
s growth potential here. So just from a top line 
overall company standpoint, we think that there's significant opportunity to 
grow. And I think we've executed well in terms of growing over the last 
couple few years, even as the PC TAM declined, and that's 
very consistent 
with our strategy, is invest in the Data Center and Memory and IoT and 
things like 5G, where we think there's opportunity and focus our investments 
on the Client that we talked about.
 
In terms of the overall model and the financial model fo
r the company, I've 
given you this range of 55% to 65% gross margin as being most of the data 
points landing between those goalposts. If you look at it over the last five 
years, we've very consistently been in the very high end of that gross 
margin range, 
so a bit more like between 60% and 65%. Last year we were 
at 63%, this year we believe we're at 62%. So that just continues. I don't 
see anything on the horizon that changes that in the near term.
 
And then with these actions that we're taking, when we get 
to full 
realization, and I want to stress we do believe that this will give us an 
opportunity to reinvest in the business and actually accelerate growth. But if 
you just look at the cost side of it, it's two to three points of spending as a 
percent of reve
nue. When we get to mid
-
2017 and full realization, that takes 
our spending as a percent of revenue, even just based on your estimate of 
2016 revenues of two to three points, it takes it back down into the low 30% 
from a spending as a percent of revenue, an
d you can do the math from 
there and see what we think we can achieve next year in terms of overall 
operating margin.

Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Chris Danely of 
Citigroup. Your line is now open.
 
Christopher B. Danely 
-
 
Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)
 
Hey. Thanks, guys, just a quick follow
-
up on the la
st question on 
restructuring. So should we assume that total expenses will drop roughly 
$150 million a quarter from 4Q 2016 to the second quarter of 2017? And 
then if you guys could, break that out between how much of the savings 
would be on COGS versus Op
Ex.
 
Stacy J. Smith 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
 
So no, I'm not going to give that level of granularity of forecasting by 
quarter in 2017, but I'll say and I want to be clear that the $1.4 billion is all 
OpEx. So that's an OpEx savin
gs number that we think we get to by mid
-
2017. And so just to recap some of the financial data that we've provided 
you, we get to that level by mid
-
2017. That's $1.4 billion in savings. That is 
a net number, so that's including some reinvestment that we pl
an to make. 
We think that that's 12,000 positions that get eliminated, which is a very 
difficult thing for us to go through, but that's what's in these numbers. We 
think we'll achieve half of those employment reductions by the end of this 
year.
 
And overall
 
for 2016, we've brought down our OpEx by $700 million. That is 
again due to this restructuring program. And we've added in a line that you'll 
see on the GAAP P&L of $1.2 billion in restructuring charges to achieve that. 
So beyond that, I'm not going to go
 
into any more granular data. I think 
that should be plenty, and now we want to go have the conversation with 
the employees and help them understand what this program means.
 
Christopher B. Danely 
-
 
Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)
 
Yes, very fair res
ponse. And as for my follow
-
up, in terms of the growth 
opportunities that you guys are really pushing for, IoT, DCG, et cetera, I 
guess if you look at the margin profile of the Memory and basically cell 
phone processors, it's substantially below your curre
nt margins. So I guess 
my question is why would you want to pursue two markets like that where 
the margin profile is so much lower than yours?
 
Brian M. Krzanich 
-
 
Chief Executive Officer & Director
 
Sure, so let's dissect those. For Memory, one, we believe 
that if you take a 
look at our typical margins, they're better than cell phone margins on typical 
quarters, but also it's integral to the Data Center. So it really actually is this 
virtual cycle that especially as we move to 3D NAND and then to 3D XPoint, 
as we've talked about 3D XPoint and how that really re
-
architects how 
Memory and storage is played out in the server rack and in the Data Center 
overall. It's a chance to really very uniquely shift that whole infrastructure. 
So we believe that's actually c
ritical to our strategy in the Data Center, and 
we'll bring a product with good margins.
 
Now let's talk about IoT. If you take a look at it first, it's growing quite well. 
And if you take a look at the IoT right now, it grew 22% this quarter, and it 
has PC
-
like margins. So this is not cell phone chips. They don't tend to be 
cell phone chips. If you take a look at the segments we're really going after, 
which are things like automotive, or what I'll call autonomous vehicles, 
industrial and retail, they tend t
o be systems that have a fair amount of 
compute at the edge. They tend to have machine learning capabilities, and 
they tend to have a high degree of comms, and more and more will move 
into 5G.
 
So that link also between those products in IoT and 5G, and the
 
5G 
infrastructure, we believe also plays into the Data Center and the whole 
Data Center strategy, and will be critical that you can provide end
-
to
-
end 
solutions. So if you're somebody out trying to build whatever that 
autonomous vehicle is, you need to be
 
able to provide the 5G backend, but 
also the 5G out on the device, whether it's a car, or a drone, or a robot, or 
whatever it is out there autonomously moving about.
 
Stacy J. Smith 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
 
And, Chris, let me ju
st, on the margin point, I would take you back to points 
that Brian and I had made at the Investor Meeting and at other places, 
which is, remember, and IoT is the perfect example of this. Those 
businesses lever IP that we create broadly for the company. An
d so our cost 
of entry in something like IoT actually is relatively low because we have the 
Atom core. We have the graphics. We're investing in the connectivity. We're 
investing in the wireless win for other businesses, and that's where we really 
get lever
age in this model. And that's one of the reasons that the IoT profit 
margins have been as high as they have been.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ambrish Srivastava of 
BMO. Your line is now open.
 
Ambrish Srivastava 
-
 
BMO Capital Markets (United States)
 
Hi. Thank yo
u very much. Actually I wanted to continue on IoT, Brian. A 
couple of years ago, you had laid out a 20% CAGR target for this. Then I 
think a year later, you had brought it down to mid
-
teens. And yes, it grew 
very strong this quarter, but last full year it 
was a 7% grower. So the 
question is, what's the right way to think about the growth profile for this 
business? And what happened in the past? Was it a one
-
year off event or 
kind of just help us understand the drivers? And why it should re
-
accelerate? 
And w
hy the first quarter is not an anomaly? And then I had a quick follow
-
up.
 
Brian M. Krzanich 
-
 
Chief Executive Officer & Director
 
Sure. I would tell you that I'd reiterate what I said, which is it's a mid
-
teen 
type of growth rate. And you got to take a look
 
at this over the long haul. 
The IoT space is like similar to the embedded space a little to some extent 
and to the FPGA space where you have, especially where we're trying to go, 
where you're trying to go into products that require that higher level of 
co
mpute, the machine learning and those capabilities. You have a design 
time, a design
-
in time to win the design, and then you have a ramp for that 
product, and so those tend to take a little while.
 
Autonomous driving vehicles are a good example. If you're o
ut winning 
designs today, you're winning 2018/2019 car designs. Those are what are 
being won today. So as you bring your products to market, that's what 
you're winning. So I'm still believing that over the long
-
term, this will be a 
mid
-
teens growth. It'll 
have for the most part PC
-
like margins and we've 
tried to pick the segments that play to our strengths and that also use the 
connectivity that we believe we're uniquely qualified to bring.
 
Ambrish Srivastava 
-
 
BMO Capital Markets (United States)
 
Okay, 
thank you. And then my quick follow
-
up, Stacy, what explains such a 
big swing in the tax rate for the quarter, for the reported quarter, and then 
for the rest of the year? Thank you.
 
Stacy J. Smith 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
 
Sure.
 
For the reported quarter, the big driver of the tax rate was a discrete 
item associated with one of the divestitures that we drilled out of our 
Security business. And we got a one
-
time tax benefit associated with that. 
And it's just coming back to the str
ategy, you can see the performance of 
the Security business both in terms of the revenue growth and their profit 
growth. I think the team there is doing a really good job of focusing in on a 
few key areas where we think we have competitive advantage and th
en 
driving them hard. And we've divested a few smaller businesses and then we 
happened to get a tax benefit on one of them. As we look at the year, so 
part of it is just what happened in Q1, and then the other part is we would 
expect to have a higher propo
rtion of our profits in lower tax jurisdictions as 
we work our way through the year. It will bring down the tax rate a little bit.

Thanks very much. A clarification of the commentary you gave earlier on 
your restruc
turing. Will there be any product lines or types of products that 
you'll be pulling out of in the future with all the cuts that you're making?
 
Brian M. Krzanich 
-
 
Chief Executive Officer & Director
 
Yes, I'm sure that as we go through this and we finish the
 
project 
evaluations, there will be some products that will exit from those as they're 
defined. Murthy, who we brought into the company is doing a complete 
review of all of our products, and he's going to report back to me in the near 
future and give me a 
proposal for what those look like. So we don't have any 
that are set out today, but at the end, I'm sure there are going to be a few 
that are part of that.
 
David M. Wong 
-
 
Wells Fargo Securities LLC
 
Okay. And related to that, does the restructuring affect 
your longer
-
term 
expectations for technology transitions? And in particular, are you still 
hoping to get back to a two
-
year tick
-
tock cadence?
 
Brian M. Krzanich 
-
 
Chief Executive Officer & Director
 
So no, it does not have any effect on our technology caden
ce. It has not 
touched that at all. And Stacy talked about even our CapEx and how the 
CapEx that we're spending this year, which has not moved, is mostly for 
either the 3D NAND ramp or 10 nm. As far as Moore's Law, we are always 
constantly striving to get 
back to two years. We're giving you a timing that's 
for 10 nm that's more like 2.5 years. We haven't talked about 7 nm, partly 
it's still in definition and alignment, so we're not sure. But I can truly tell you 
we are constantly working to get back to two 
years. And they have tried to 
lay out, all right, if you look at the history of Moore's Law, there have been 
anywhere from 18 months to three years in the length of cycles over the 
time. More importantly, what I always remind people, is the leadership you 
have over the competition, which is always what's important.
 
All of these are getting harder and they get hard for everybody. And so you 
want to make sure also that your leadership gap, what you're able to do 
relative to the competition, remains constant a
s well. Both of those are as 
important as the other.

Good day, ladies and gentlemen. And welcome to the Intel Corporation 
Fourth Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. Thank you for your patience. 
We do apologize for the delay as we were experiencing a technical issue. At 
this time, all 
participants are in a listen

earnings conference call. By now you should have received a copy of our 
earnings release and the CFO commentary that goes along with it. If you 
have not 
received both documents, they are available on our Investor 
website, intc.com.
 
I am joined today by Brian Krzanich, our CEO; and Stacy Smith, our Chief 
Financial Officer. In a moment, we will hear brief remarks from both of 
them, followed by the Q&A.
 
Befor

forward
-
looking statements based on the environment as we currently see it 
and as such, does include risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our press 
release for more information on the 
specific risk factors that could cause 
actual results to differ materially.
 
Also during this call, we use any non
-
GAAP financial measures or references, 
we will post the appropriate GAAP financial reconciliation to our website, 
intc.com.
 
So, with that, let
 
me hand it over to Brian.
 
Brian Krzanich
 
Thanks, Mark. The fourth quarter marked a strong finish to a great year. We 
began 2014 expecting roughly flat year
-
over
-
year revenue and operating 

 
all
-
time record of $55.9 billion. At the same time, operating income rose 25%.
 
When I became CEO, I set two imperatives for the company. First, develop a 
more outside
-
in view markets to ensure we go to where the markets are 
heading. And second, increase o
ur velocity or piece of innovation in a 
purposeful direction. Over the last year, we made meaningful progress 
against these imperatives, which helped us meet and exceed many of our 

 
In the PC Client G
roup, our goal was to stabilize the PC business. We 
expected revenue to be down by a low single
-
digit percentage and for 
operating profit to be roughly flat year
-
over
-
year.
 
Instead, the year closed with a 4% increase in revenue and a 25% increase 
in operat
ing profit. Our focus on reinventing the computing experience and 
leaving no segment unserved from a low
-
end to the high
-
end contributed to 
these results.
 

-
nanometer manufacturing 
processor. While we did have so
me start
-
up challenges that contributed to 
roughly six
-
month delay, yields have steadily improved.
 
The end result is a family of Core M and fifth
-
generation core processor that 
are the foundation for the industries most compelling new designs. These 
design
s include the thinnest, lightest and most energy efficient notebooks, 
2
-
in
-
1s, Ultrabooks, Chromebooks and mini PCs.
 
We began the year with high expectations for the Data Center Group. We 
said we would capitalize on the growth of the cloud and big data by 
diversifying customer segments and product leadership.
 
We initially forecasted revenue growth in the low to mid teens, with 
operating profit growing faster than revenue. We exceeded those high 
expectations and grew revenue 18%, while operating profit expan
ded by a 
remarkable 31%.
 
In the Mobile and Communications Group, we set a goal to ship into 40 
million tablets in 2014. This goal is intended to establish Intel architecture in 
the marketplace and scale the supply chain and attract developers.
 

to report that we shipped into 46 million tablets, becoming one 
of the industries largest merchant silicon providers in tablets. We also began 
shipping our second
-
generation LTE baseband known as 7260.
 
We are proud that the company reached these milestones
. We have more 
work ahead of us. Our key goal for mobility is to improve profitability. To 
that end, we just qualified the first SoC in our SoFIA lineup. SoFIA is a low
-
cost integrated application processor and baseband chip.
 
As it ramps, it will progressi
vely reduce the bill of material costs that have 
adversely affected our gross margins in the mobile business. We also struck 
landmark agreements with Rockchip and Spreadtrum to expand the 
development and distributions of IA products performing in hardware.
 
Similarly, we grew other adjacent businesses by using IP from our core 
products. For example, our Internet of Things Group grew 19% through 
2014, passing the $2 billion mark for the first time. The recently launched 
RealSense 3D camera technology is anoth
er example of extending our IP.
 

making its way into all sorts of new and unanticipated applications, 
highlighting the value of taking outside
-
in view, investing ahead of churn 
a
nd shaping nascent technology.
 
Finally, you see us moving quickly to wearables through our growing 
portfolio of collaborations with world
-
class fashion and fitness brands, like 
Fossil, Oakley, Opening Ceremony and SMS Audio, along with our own 
products lik
e the Basis Peak and the Curie Module, a computer the size of a 
button.
 
Intel is in a very different place today than we were just 12 months ago. We 
are participating in a broader range of devices, but we are innovating in 
emerging segments. These are the 



increasingly confident in our strategy.
 
With that, let me turn th
e call over to Stacy.
 
Stacy Smith
 
Thanks Brian. To reiterate what Brian said, the fourth quarter was a strong 
finish to a great year. Revenue of $14.7 billion was a record for the company 
and was up 6% from a prior year. The strength of our product 
portfolio can 
be seen in our gross margin of over 65% and in our profitability.
 
Operating income grew 25% and earnings per share, which also benefited 
from the passage of the R&D tax credit grew 45% from a year ago. From a 
market perspective, we saw nice u
nit and revenue growth in the PC Client 
Group segment, with revenue up 3% and operating profit up 18% on a year
-
over
-
year basis.
 
The Data Center Group benefited from the build out of the cloud, data 
analytics and our strong product portfolio. This business
 
achieved 25% 
revenue growth and 39% profit growth year
-
over
-
year.
 
The company saw modest increase in net inventory levels quarter
-
over
-
quarter as we are efficiently managing capacity, while ramping Broadwell on 
14
-
nanometer. And the worldwide PC supply ch
ain appears to be healthy, 
with inventory levels appropriate as we enter the first quarter.
 
These results for the fourth quarter completed a strong year for Intel. 
Recapping the 2014 financials, for full year 2014, revenue of $55.9 billion 
was up 6%, opera
ting income of $15.3 billion was up 25% and earnings per 
share of $2.31 was up 22% from 2013.
 
Gross margin of approximately 64% in 2014 is up about 4 points from 2013. 
Spending on R&D and MG&A was $19.7 billion in 2014, up $1 billion from 
2013, driven prim
arily by increased R&D spending and higher profit 
dependent spending. In 2014, both our PC business and our Data Center 
business outperformed our expectations at the start of the year.
 
PC Client Group revenue grew by 4%. We saw PC Client Group platform 
vol
umes grow 8% from a year ago and inclusive of tablets, we saw 18% unit 
growth. Operating profit for the PC Client Group segment was up 25% over 
the same horizon.
 
We saw robust growth in our Data Center business with 8% unit growth 
leading to 18% revenue gr
owth from 2013 and operating profit growth of 
31%. Additionally, in comparison to 2013, the Internet of Things segment 
achieved revenue growth of 19% and Software and Services Operating 
segment was up slightly, our NAND business grew at vast pace and altho
ugh 
revenue was down for the Mobile and Communications Group, we grew 
share in tablets.
 
The business continued to generate significant cash with $20.4 billion of 
cash from operations in 2014. Total cash balance at the end of the year was 
roughly $14.1 bill
ion, down approximately $6 billion from a year ago.
 
We purchased $10.1 billion in capital assets, down from our prior outlook of 
$11 billion, as we found efficiencies, optimize the manufacturing network 
and increased our factory utilization.
 
In addition, w
e paid $4.4 billion in dividends. In November, we announced 
dividend increase to $0.96 per share on an annual basis effective for the first 
quarter of 2015. We repurchased about $10.8 billion of stock in 2014, up 
from $2.1 billion in 2013.
 
Our net cash bal
ance total cash less debt is approximately $340 million and 
inclusive of our other longer term investment is more than $4 billion. This is 
down by over $5.5 billion from the start of the year.
 
As we looked forward to the first quarter of 2015, we are forec
asting the 
midpoint of the revenue range to $13.7 billion, plus or minus $500 million, 
down about 7% from the fourth quarter. This forecast is in line with the 
average seasonal decline for the first quarter. We are forecasting the 
midpoint of the gross mar
gin range for the first quarter to be 60%, plus or 
minus a couple of points.
 
Consistent with the business drivers discussed in the November Investor 
Meeting, the 5 point decline from the fourth quarter is primarily driven by 
higher platform unit costs on 1
4
-
nanometer products, higher factory start
-
up 
costs and lower platform volumes.
 
Turning to full year 2015, we are planning for revenues to grow in the mid
-
single digits. We are forecasting the midpoint of our gross margin range at 
62%, plus or minus a coup
le of points. We are forecasting R&D and MG&A 
spending for the year at $20 billion, plus or minus $400 million and we are 
forecasting capital spending of $10 billion, plus or minus $500 million.
 
2014 was a great year and the financials demonstrate our stra
tegy and 
action as we enter 2015. First, we are growing again across a broad range of 
products and markets.
 
Second, we continue to invest in our core competitive advantages of 
leadership IP and leadership manufacturing. These competitive advantages 
are bec
oming increasingly valuable and increasingly rare.
 
Third, we are in a great position to benefit from the build out of the cloud 
and data analytics as we enter 2015. We expect these trends to drive growth 
again this year.
 
And last, we continue to execute ou
r strategy of both investing in our 
business and also generating return for our shareholders via the dividend 
and the buyback.
 
With that, let me turn it back over to Mark.
 
Mark Henninger
 
Okay. Thank you, Brian and Stacy. Moving on to the Q&A, as is our nor
mal 
practice, we would ask each participant to ask one question and just one 
follow
-
up if you have one. Jamie, please introduce our first questioner.
 
Question
-
and
-
Answer Session
 
Operator
 
[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Chris Danely fr
om 
Citigroup.
 
Chris Danely
 
Thanks guys. And Brian, in all sincerity, congratulations on a great year for 
yourself and the company. I guess the first question is on gross margins. 
Can you just talk about, I guess for Stacy, the trend in gross margins after 


year assuming something close to normal? Can we assume gross margins 
would be up in 2016 on an apples
-
to
-
apples ba
sis?
 
Stacy Smith
 
Hi, Chris. This is Stacy. Yeah. I am 
--
 


about those in November. So you are getting a little ahead of me.
 
In terms of 
the 
--
 

with what we talked about in the November Investor Meeting. And to be 
--
 
to specifically answer your question, yes, I expect that the second half gross 
margins will be back above the midpoin
t, we forecasted 62% for the year, 
we are at 60% in Q1, I think the second half will be above that midpoint, the 
first half will be below. This is all I told you in November.
 
The big drivers for us here are 14
-
nanometer. As 14
-
nanometer becomes a 
larger mi
x of our products, we are mixing up in terms of our costs. That is 
higher than normal and beginning of the year and then it will come down 
and catch
-
up to prior technologies by the time we get into the back half.
 
We have some increase in start
-
up costs and
 
then we will get some good 
news associated with getting back some of the impact associated with 
tablets. So we get back about half of the impact from 2014 and into 2015.
 

thing th


of every other year. So, probably adjusted for that, we are going to be in the 
same kind of range.
 
Chris Danely
 
Great. And then for my follow
-
up, question for Brian, just on the MCG 

quarter, but you said that those losses will go down. Any color you can 
provide on that, anything you c
an give us in terms of your overall goals or 
goals for the mobile business this year, either in units or profitability or 
anything else there?
 
Brian Krzanich
 
Sure. Sure, Chris. So what we said for 2015, so if you remember, step back 
in 2014, we said, look,
 
we have to go out and establish our footprints here. 
We have to get ourselves known in this market, be considered a serious 
player and get the developers attracted, both the hardware and software 

 
We now s
et a goal, a unit level goal. So we knew we were serious and we 
brought parts that were not necessarily design for this segment and plus 
with the BAM costs deltas came from.
 

ourselves, w
e are one of the top producers of silicon in this segment. And 
our goal right now is from a unit perspective is, we think we can just grow 

and necessarily outpace the market or an
ything like that for this year from a 
growth perspective.
 
Instead, we are going to focus on two segments and that is, one, as you just 
said, getting our cost profiles down, making it, so that we are much more 
cost effective and then as a result getting a l
oss out. And Stacy and I 


of this reorganization was to drive efficiency, to get to consistency across
 
the 
platform, to be utilized and to get the efficiency of people, of hardware, of 
software from all of that.
 
The other one is as we move into the second half of this year, especially 
SoFIA, which we said was designed for this segment and has no BAM out 
th

internally qualified our first SoFIA, the 3G version. We said that, the next 
version, the LTE version would be in the first half of next year and they will 
ramp through the year. So as thos
e come in, they take a lot of that cost 

--
 
feeling fairly good about the $800 
million.
 
The other place, you saw the Dell Venue 87000 is a great example, was one 

howing a 
thinnest tablet with real innovation at a $399 price, where people can start 
to make money in the tablet space a little bit now again. And so we think the 
combination of right products plus real innovation like that will allow us to 
make real prog
ress.
 
Chris Danely
 
Thank you.
 
Operator
 
The next question comes from Mike McConnell with Pacific Crest Securities.
 
Mike McConnell
 
Thank you. Looking at the balance sheet, Stacy, there was a pretty 
significant spike in receivables in Q4 and DSOs look like th
ey are pretty 

kind of explain what was going on there with the receivables?
 
Stacy Smith
 
Sure. And actually, I think DSOs still are in a healthy range, but the timing 
-
-
 
the quart
er was a little bit more backend loaded than Q3 was and so we 
ended the quarter with more receivables. It was as simple as that. We 
started with 
--
 

strengthened as we went through.
 
Mike McConnell
 
Oka


to be expiring this year? Could you give us any color on how we should 
expect linearity on a quarterly basi
s for DCG this year, if it will be any 
different than what we see in the past?
 
Stacy Smith
 
So, yeah, I think, we always caution you that the PC market, I think, we 
have data that says, it behaves roughly seasonal. With DCG, you have to be 
careful, because 
you have five to 10 very large cloud customers that based 
on their buying patterns can really change the quarter
-
to
-
quarter trend. So I 
tend to hesitate to tie to much to seasonal in DCG.
 
When you look at the results over the course of 2014, it was robust 
unit 
growth. It was great revenue growth, 18% revenue growth. As we said in 
the Investor Meeting, we think that the underlying trends that are driving 


still think.
 
Mike McConnell
 
Thank you.
 
Operator
 
The next question comes from Ambrish Srivastava from BMO Capital 
Markets.
 
Ambrish Srivastava
 
Hi. Thank you. Brian, I just wanted to continue with the question on the 
mobility side. Based on the drivers 
that you laid out, should we than expect 
that the recovery in the operating losses should be more backend loaded? 
And then, you mentioned that tablets you expect to grow with the end 

gro
wth? So is that how you guys are thinking about the tablet market? And 
then I had a quick follow
-
up for you, Stacy?
 
Brian Krzanich
 

talk about how the $800 million is laid out through t
he year and then you 



he 

grow at the rate that the market does.
 

significantly I think we would then probably try and target more of 
a flattish. 


send. And whether its minus 5, zero or plus 5 to 10, I call that 
--
 
all of that 
kind of flatti
sh to grow with the market.
 
Stacy Smith
 
Yeah. And on the linearity of the $800 million improvement, there is really at 
the highest level three things that are improving our profitability this year. 
So first is bringing SoFIA into the product mix, that help
s us both from the 
standpoint of the SoC cost that SoFIA has and the contra revenue dollars 


SoFIA into 
the product family kind of as we speak, but it becomes really 
significant volume for us when we get into the back half.
 
The second one is the LTE 
--
 
the ramp of LTE to offset some of the 

 
would expect the back half volume to be higher than the first half. So that 
also is a little bit more backend loaded.
 


e items and two of 
those three does put more of the improvement in the back half.
 
Ambrish Srivastava
 
Okay. Thank you. And my quick follow
-
up for you, Stacy, is on the capital 
allocation side, last couple of quarters, you did a great job, brought back a 
lot
 
of stock, but now if I look at the onshore versus offshore on the balance 
sheet, there is just a $2 billion delta? Could you remind us in the 
--
 
in terms 
of the cash flow generated, how much is onshore versus offshore and then 
the ramifications for stock 
buyback? Thank you.
 
Stacy Smith
 
Sure. It varies year
-
by
-

--
 
remember we 
actually invest in factories around the world. So a lot of the onshore versus 

majori
ty of our cash generation is in the U.S. We do generate a lot of cash 
and we certainly have the ability to use that for any corporate purposes 
including a buyback.
 
Ambrish Srivastava
 
Thank you.
 
Brian Krzanich
 
Thanks, Ambrish.
 
Operator
 
The next question com
es from Jim Cabello with Goldman Sachs.
 
Jim Cabello
 
Great and thanks so much for taking the question. First question, Stacy, I 
see the CapEx is shifting around a little bit, anything significant there or are 
you just able to find a little bit of the abilit
y to save some money?
 
Stacy Smith
 



 


negotiate some overpricing. We had some non
-
capacity related projects that 

opportunities. And I th
ink the manufacturing organization did a great job of 
finding them.
 
And then about half of it is, as we progressed over the course of 2014, we 
learnt a couple of things. One is our confidence in yields and our yield 

you in the November investor 
meeting.
 
Secondly, the manufacturing organization demonstrated the ability to 
startup factories more quickly than we had assumed at the beginning of the 
year. And the combination pf that allowed us to shift out the third HVM 14
-
nanometer factory that starts up now kind of mid
-
15, out by two to three 

those factories are that actually gives us a much more capital efficient ramp 

 
savings as a result of it.
 
Jim Cabello
 

-
up, Brian, I mean, could you just 
on the highest level maybe give us a sense of how you think the PC market 
stands today entering 2015 compared to how it was 
entering 2014? Some of 
the ODM data would suggest we exited 2014 a little weaker but that may 
just be a function of that weak October that Stacy had mentioned in terms of 
linearity and things. Maybe it really is more similar than we thought, even 
though th

maybe if you could offer your perspective there? Thank you.
 
Brian Krzanich
 

me just give you a kind of our view
 
of the PC market. I think, when we look 

played out exactly as we forecasted and predicted. And Q4 ended up being 
very much a seasonal quarter. We saw demand in the more mature marke
ts, 
stronger especially on the consumer side than in the emerging markets.
 

comfortable with where the inventories are. So remember, as we entered 
--
 
exited Q3 and kind of entered Q4, there m
ight have been 
--
 
there are some 

that off to the system, especially a lot of that was down at the low end. And 

 
From me as I
 

Core M, which has just really hit the market as we entered into the holiday 


e got the Broadwell
-
U, which is a 

got something dozen systems in Q1 that will be coming out on Broadwell. 
You saw us introduce RealSense at CES.
 
We have, I think seven or eight sys
tems in the first quarter coming out with 
RealSense and that combination. So I look at the amount of innovatio,n all 


rom 
Chromebook starting at $199, Windows Systems $249 all the way up from 
there to the real innovative systems like Sprout. I look at it and say that the 
innovation and the options of the PC market have never been better.
 
So I am feeling pretty good about 
where we are in the PC market. If you 
remember our forecast is based even still on flat units and a slight decrease 



year and a slight decline even in ASPs given that.
 
Stacy Smith
 

as pretty normal from an in
-
demand standpoint. We under shipped demand 
some in Q4, so there wa
s inventory burn. But we now think it happened as 
we look back, as there was a bit of inventory, particularly Bay Trail lower 
end systems. When we started the quarter that led to some weakness in the 
first few weeks and then it caught back up as we worked 
our way through 
the quarter and burn through that inventory and then we saw it behave a bit 
normally from the shipment pattern.
 
Jim Cabello
 
Truly helpful, guys. Thanks so much and good luck.
 
Brian Krzanich
 
Thanks Jim.

The next question comes from 
David Wong from Wells Fargo.

Thanks very much. You talked about blocking and testing to bring down 
CapEx but your $10 billion 2014 CapEx and then your 2015 plan is almost a 
billion below $10.7 billion to $11 billion in every year 2011 to 2013. S
o are 

the case, what would your long
-
term CapEx as a percent of revenue be?

are

term view for

if you think 

between $10 billion and $11 billion. We are at the low end of that for a 
couple of years. I still think t

thirds to three quarters is manufacturing capacity related and then the rest 
is non
-
manufacturing CapEx.
 
David Wong
 
Okay. Great. And when do you expect to offer 10

nanometer capability to 
foundry customers?
 
Bri
an Krzanich
 
We are timing on 10
-
nanometers. We are not going to come out with when 

-
nanometer to the marketplace in general, probably 
until the end of this year. So again as we go through the year probably by 
the investor 

what timing is for 10

nanometers.

The next question comes from Stacy Rasgon from Sanford Bernstein.
 
Stacy Rasgon
 
Hi guys. Thanks for taking my questions. I think first, I just want to 
--
 
it 
sounds like the slightly weaker PC volume you saw in Q4 is not changing 
your 2015 of the market at all. If the inventory burn that you saw in the 
channel was at the low end, we sa
w ASPs come up I guess because you 
were losing some of that low
-
end shipment. What does that suggest for your 
ASP trend next quarter as potentially those 
--
 
I guess, Stacy, after you see 
those inventory trends going back the other way and what does that me
an 
for pricing as we move into next quarter? Does the low end start to come 
back for you?
 
Brian Krzanich
 

saw in Q4 really had three elements to it. One element was the fact that
 
we 
saw some inventory burn on Bay Trail. So our mix within, notebooks was a 

about two thirds of it is associated with server. We just had a very strong 
quarter in terms of s
erver and our server mix is starting to look better, 
starting to improve some.
 

-

jumping out on the margin recon. So you should take from that. They were 
expecting pretty benign ASP env
ironment as we go into the year, and it also 

next year based on what we can see today.
 
Stacy Rasgon
 
Got it. And so my follow
-
up, I want to ask maybe more general question on 
14 ver
sus 22. So for 14
-

normalized cost per transistor dropping below trend. Obviously wafer cost is 
going up quite a bit, but your density seems to be increasing even faster and 


had yields and obviously you have taken a bit longer to get into place. We 
have factory ramps that seem to be hitting more than normal in the first half 
of the year. Would you say that the all
-
in costs of the lifetim
e of 14
-
nanometers is actually is going to turn out to be lower than the all
-
in cost of 
22?
 
Brian Krzanich
 
Hey, Stacy. I would take you back to the graph I showed at the investor 
meeting because I actually a non
-
normalized cost that showed Broadwell 
relati
ve to other products at the same stage of manufacturing. And so what 
that chart shows is the churn up in the first half of this year. So the early 

talked about, it is higher. On a non
-

by the time we get into the back half of the year on a non
-
normalized basis, 
Broadwell actually is less expensive than those other products at the same 
stage of their life.
 
Stacy Rasgon
 
So you think if I integrate
 
that curve over the lifetime, the integration unit 
will be lower?
 
Stacy Smith
 

remind you, we are trying to take two questions per person, please.
 
Stacy Rasgon
 
Sure. Thank you.
 
Brian K
rzanich
 


guess a lot of it depends on how much volume happens after we get to that 
point of parity and improvem
ent. But I think that the cost per transistor and 
the fact that we are investing that in lower die sizes and more features, we 
think we are getting super high performance and very cost effective product 
on 14
-
nanometer.
 
Stacy Rasgon
 
Got it. Thank you, guys

The next question comes from Ruben Roy from Piper Jaffray.
 
Ruben Roy
 
Thank you. First question for Brian, just around SoFIA and some of the 
commentary that you had on expectations for a solid ramp in the second 
half
, just qualified internally I believe. Is the chip qualified on network and 
can you talk about design win traction at this point?
 
Brian Krzanich
 
Sure. So we have 
--
 

the SoFIA 
--
 
the first of the produ
ct is the SoFIA 3G, which is 
--
 
basically has 
a 3G modem. The second product will be a SoFIA LTE modem. What we said 
was that 3G modem version, the SoFIA 3G has finished its internal 

 
apps processor is fully functional and the modems working. All of that work 

 
We are in the process now of what we 
--
 



and partners plus some. We are in the process now going out to the carriers 

the difference, the time difference between ramping a product, or 
qualifying 
the product in Q4 internally and before our customers can ramp in the first 
half is a lot of that qualification and getting it out there into the rest of the 
world. Same thing will happen. We said we would qualify internally in the 
first half, t


 
Ruben Roy
 
Thank you for that, Brian. Just a quick follow
-
up for Stacy on the data center 
side. Solid year for ASP growth and I think over the last few years you have 
been averaging kind of mid
-
to
-
high single digit ASP growth. Can you talk a 

the next couple of years? Thanks.
 
Stacy Smith
 
Yeah. So, I think I have said in the past, I view ASP
 
growth in the data 
center product line as being much more akin to capacity additions. So as the 
performance of the machines go up, as people move up in terms of one
-
way 
servers to two
-
way, to four
-
way servers, what we see that as a increase in 
ASP. But it
 
really is from the standpoint of a CIO, an increase in capacity 
that they go and buy.
 

where as we bring technology and then that technology brings benefit to the 
customer and incr
eases their capacity and decreases our operating costs, we 

Brian, if you want to add anything to that?
 
Brian Krzanich
 
I think you covered it well.
 
Ruben Roy
 
Great. Thanks, guys.
 
Brian Krzanich
 
Thanks, Ruben.
 
Operator
 
The next question comes from John Pitzer from Credit Suisse.
 
John Pitzer
 
Yeah, good afternoon, guys. Brian, Stacy, nice job on the quarter. But my 
first question, Stacy is a follow
-

 
Q1 and 


playing out, is Q1 going to be the trough, or do you have more sort of non
-
operational things like
 
start
-
up costs in the June quarter that could actually 
have gross margins go down against sequentially in June before rebounding 
in the second half?
 
Stacy Smith
 

to be the trough fo
r the year.
 
John Pitzer
 

-
up Brian, one of the things that 
happened when PC penetration slowed was that mix actually got better than, 
I think a lot of us from the outside looking in thought. Do you think that now 
th
at tablet penetration growth seems to be slowing that we could see some 
stabilization of mix, or even some mix
-
up, or how do you view the tablet 
market as unit growth begins to slow relative to mix?
 
Brian Krzanich
 

ink that almost like the PC, if you 
really look back at the PC, the PC began to kind of bifurcate. You did see 
systems coming in at lower and lower price points, right. And you saw kind 
of a bottom of the PC market go from the $500 range to, as we said now
 
you can go out there and get a good system, $249 all the way down to $199 
with Chrome.
 
I think and then you saw. But at the same time, as you said, we saw record 
Core i7 and the gaming PCs are hitting record levels. And so the high end 
kind of did very we

middle. I think the same thing is going to happen on tablet. You are going to 

out of China right now. And there are some good 
low cost tablets that are 
going to come out and continue to drive probably that average ASP of 
systems down into the sub $100 range.
 

all of our major OEMs, Lenovo, Dell, HP, systems
 
with real innovation, things 
like the RealSense snapshot, thinner and lighter, longer battery life, better 
screen, the edge
-
to
-
edge screen. People are willing. If you bring the 
innovation, a $399 tablet, maybe $299 to $399 tablet is not an unreasonable 
pr

So, I think we will get that same kind of effect, yes, in the tablet space that 
we saw in the PC space as well.
 
John Pitzer
 
Okay. Thanks, guys. Appreciate it.
 
Stacy Smith
 
Okay.
 
Brian
 
Krzanich
 
Thanks, John.

The next question comes from Ross Seymore from Deutsche Bank.
 
Ross Seymore
 
Hi, guys. Thanks for letting me ask a question. Stacy, a couple for you 
actually. The first one is on full year R&D spend. It looks like you are 
growing that in line to slightly even faster than the midpoint on the revenue 
side of things. Can you just give us a little bit of detail why the R&D is going 
to be up about 6% year
-
over
-

the tock year whe
re some of the expense goes up in the COGS?
 
Stacy Smith
 
Yeah. There is a 
--
 

making increases in R&D investment in areas where Brian and I have looked 
and believe we are going to get a significant
 
payoff on those investments. 
So, specifically Data Center Group, the Internet of Things Group and a bit 
more towards process technology. And then we are offsetting some of that 

segment 
being top of that list and some efficiencies across our Product 
Engineering Group.
 

Axxia, which is going into the Data Center Group and increases our product 
or improves our product p
ortfolio there in the networking space, is bringing 

adding to the R&D spending next year.
 
Ross Seymore
 
Okay. And I guess as my follow
-
on in somewhat similar. We talked a little bit 
ab

in the fourth quarter and then starting to ramp now. Skylake, it sounds like 
you want to continue to have that be on time and I guess the early part of 
the second half of this year.
 
To the extent of the Broadwell, duration is 

the revenue, the COGS, et cetera line, should we think of to hit the financials 
throughout the year?
 
Brian Krzanich
 
Well, this is Brian
. Let me first kind of answer how we are looking at this and 
we are not going to slow Skylake down. We said it will be a second half of 

lot of new capability to this market. W

SKUs of what SKUs we are bringing out on Broadwell to really refresh the 2 
in 1 devices, the Chromebooks. We wanted to bring Core M out, which I 
think in the first part of this year with the Chinese New Year, the back
-
to
-
s
chool season, having the super
-
thin and light devices is going to be critical.
 
So missing that by doing something else with Broadwell would have been a 

managed the transition on the n
umber of SKUs as Broadwell will have and 
how we will transition the market to Skylake now moving forward from a 
margin or COGS standpoint. But remember, they are on the same 

change 
the piece of glass in the scanner to get a different product. So there 
is not a change or revamp of our factories that needs to occur for this.
 
Stacy Smith
 
Yeah. That last point is important. They are both 14
-
nanometer products for 

 
our factory profile. And just generally, the faster we 
bring out new features and cool stuff to the market, the better off we are. So 
we are not planning to slow down Skylake, if that was at the heart of your 
question.
 
Ross Seymore
 
Great. Thank you.

The next question comes from C.J. Muse from Evercore ISI.
 
C.J. Muse
 
Yeah. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. I guess first 
question, Brian, I wanted to, I guess, clarify a comment you made earlier. I 

00 million out of the business in mobility 
in 2015, including reorg to drive efficiencies. And I guess my question here 
is, does that include also the benefit of lower contra
-
revenues?
 
Brian Krzanich
 
Yes.
 
Stacy Smith
 

-
in number.
 
Brian 
Krzanich
 

structure. We are doing continued, just I will call it fundamental cost 
reduction, getting the right P mix in there, reducing the board count, board 
layers, that kind of I
 
will call basic engineering and the introduction 
--
 
the 
increased percentage of Bay Trail cost reduction at the beginning and then 
introduction of SoFIA in the second half, which has no contra
-
revenues. So 
you put all of those together and they will add u
p to that $800 million.
 
Stacy Smith
 

 
Brian Krzanich
 
[Indiscernible]
 
Stacy Smith
 
Yeah.
 
C.J. Muse
 
Great. And then, I guess as my follow
-
up, can you provide, I guess, some 
additional color on the Rockchip and 
Spreadtrum side, would love to hear 
what milestones perhaps we should be watching for?
 
Brian Krzanich
 




their first silicon out. You have to go talk to them. Again, part of this is they 
have a certain level of 
independence. They are going to ramp and launch 
that product when they feel ready.
 
But the first silicon is out and they are going at their validation and 

ahead of schedule with 
Rockchip and we will continue to bring designs. And 
next, we will move to LTE just like ours and then keep moving on, just right 
in line with ours, just a little bit, maybe a quarter or two after our exemplary 
product as well.
 
From a Spreadtrum, that deal 
closed more in the second half of the year. 

working on exactly what their SoFIA will look like and we will progress 
through that through this year. But the relationship and the mode
l of having 
them produce SoFIA derivatives with additional features or additional 
capabilities targeted towards their specific market and channels is exactly 
the same methodology that we will take.
 
C.J. Muse
 
Very helpful. Thank you.
 
Mark Henninger
 
Thanks, 
C.J. And operator, we will go ahead and take two more questions, 
please.
 
Operator
 
The next question comes from Matt Ramsey from Canaccord Genuity.
 
Matt Ramsey
 
Thank you very much for taking my question. Brian, I wanted to ask on 
DCG, obviously a really big
 
quarter in December, up about $1 billion from 
the March quarter. Apparently you talked a bit about it being lumpy with the 
cloud customers, maybe you can talk about what part of that big jump in 
revenue from September to December was from first time purch
ases of 
Grantley? I guess the longer
-

enterprise server market relative to some weaker trends we saw earlier in 

 
Stacy Smith
 
Yeah. This is Stacy. We are n

in terms of a breakout of the DCG revenue. I would say what we saw in Q4 
was, we saw strength in enterprise and then we continue to see those robust 
growth rates in cloud and networking and data analytics. 

not going to break it out.
 
Matt Ramsey
 
Fair enough. And Brian, as a follow
-
up in the mobile group, we see obviously 
great work in hitting the target on the tablet units. Maybe you could talk a 
little bit about the market reception and the 
health of the channel for those 
products, particularly since a lot of those are Chinese OEMs, with sort of the 
set
-
up for Chinese New Year on the tablet side? Thanks.
 
Brian Krzanich
 

--
 

so far 
for the Intel tablets has been very strong. There is a strong brand value just 
in Intel tied to a tablet, no matter who is the manufacturer. The tablets 

--
 
I will call it major 
OEMs, have been selling 
very well. And you saw the great reception, the Dell 
Venue 8, for example, 7000 got at CES. I will call it the more broad products 
that are coming out of China, more of the Shenzhen marketplace.
 

d say the 
number of OEMs that are working with us in that space and amount of 
innovation and breadth that they are bringing to these products has 
surpassed even what our expectations were. And as we show them things 
like RealSense and WiDi and WiGig, all t
hese capabilities both from the 
tablet and the PC space, we are seeing a lot of innovation coming out of that 
in Chinese market 
--
 
Chinese manufacturer space.
 
Matt Ramsey
 
Thank you very much.
 
Mark Henninger
 
Thanks, Matt. And operator, please go ahead 
and introduce our last 
questioner.
 
Operator
 
The final question comes from Vivek Arya from Bank of America Merrill 
Lynch.
 
Vivek Arya
 
Thank you for taking my question. As my first one, Brain, how important is 
the recovery in emerging markets to maintaining y
our expectations for 
flattish PC growth? And how are you balancing the push there in terms of 
the low cost tablets versus PCs?
 
Brian Krzanich
 

roughly flat in units. We also forecasted a r
oughly similar worldwide 

did not build in a big recovery or big resurgence of the emerging markets 

recovery or return 

 
The next question you asked is what about tablets and the low
-
end tablet. 

-
end tablet and the emergence of the phablet 
in that space versus the PC. And we think that if I took a look at 
that, the 
phablet is probably taking a little bit more out of the tablet than the PC. I 
think people still are going to use the PC for their high
-
end usages, when 
they have to have a keyboard, when they have to have the higher
-
end 
compute.
 
And for the low
-
end kind of, I want to look at the material, I want to watch a 

of battling it out for the user in that space I would say. And you see the 

s in the emerging markets. So 


with our current PC forecast.
 
Vivek Arya
 
Got it. And just as a quick follow
-
up,
 
you mentioned the ramp in discrete 
LTE. I know, you have done very well at Samsung, any more progress there 
and just the broadly customer diversification on your LTE chip for this year? 
Thank you.
 
Brian Krzanich
 
Yeah. We continue to win other customers. W




 
the second half of the year with their products, the SoFIA products. And

answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a 

 

Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
 
Trey Campbell
 
Thank you, op

earnings conference call. By now, you should have received a copy of our 


e, intc.com. The earnings 
presentation is also available in the webcast window for those joining us 
online.
 


Before we

looking statements based on the environment as we currently see it 
and, as such, does include risks and uncertainties.
 
Please refer to our press release for more information on the spe
cific risk 
factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. A brief reminder 
that this quarter, we have provided both GAAP and non

GAAP financial measures 
when describing our consoli
dated results. The earnings presentation and 
earnings release available on intc.com include the full GAAP and non

reconciliations.
 
With that, let me hand it over to Bob.
 
Bob Swan
 
Thanks, Trey, and thank you all for joining our call. We had an outstand
ing 
Q1 in the midst of incredibly challenging circumstances. We generated $19.8 
billion in revenue, expanded operating margin by 10 points and delivered 
$1.45 in earnings per share. We exceeded our guidance by $800 million on 
the top line and $0.15 on the 
bottom line. Our data

centric businesses grew 

our PC

centric business grew 14%.
 

commend all the Intel employees and
 
supply chain partners who have 
helped keep our business operating during this unprecedented challenge. I 
want to give a special praise to those in our factories and labs and other on
-
site personnel who have role modeled the values of our company every day
 
and every shift. I am so incredibly proud of your effort and commitment. I 
also want to thank the rest of our employees who are largely working 
remotely to help support the social distancing requirements of those that 
need to work from our sites.
 
Ensuring
 
the safety and well
-
being of our global workforce has and will 

than $100 million in additional benefits to aid and support employees, 
including a special recognition award for employ
ees that have been working 

-
changing technology that enriches 
the lives of every person on earth. Never before has our delivery of that 

Interne
t communication and government digital infrastructure.
 
And in a world where many of us are working remotely and socially 
distancing, the PCs and networking technologies delivered by Intel and our 

 
closer together, 
helping those directly struggling with the virus or caring for those who are 
enabling remote classrooms so that our children can continue to learn and 
connecting governments and businesses so they can operate and deliver 
goods and service
s.
 
Around the world, Intel platforms that support telemedicines have also taken 
on greater importance since the outbreak of COVID
-
19 as hospitals and 
health care workers scale to meet the increasing demand for care. Our 
products and capabilities are also d
elivering vital computing power for 
medical research, robotics for assisted patient care and artificial intelligence 
and data analytics for public health. We recognize that our local and global 
communities need us to continue delivering technology to help 
overcome 
this COVID

Our world

class safety standards have allowed our factories to continue to 
operate safely on a relatively normal basis with greater than 90% on

delivery. We only allow employees i
n our factories who are essential to the 

the cleanest places in the world. While most of our construction projects 
have remained operational, we have had to temporarily pause a few p
rojects 
due to local government restrictions at a small number of our sites. We will 
restart those projects in due course, and we expect these interruptions to 
have minimal impact on our ramp and no impact on our process technology 
transition time line.
 
We
 
also realized that solving the enormous challenge of COVID
-
19 requires 

accelerating access to technology that can combat the current pandemic and 
enable new technology and scientific dis
covery to better prepare society for 

response technology initiative to combat the coronavirus through improved 
access to technology at the point of patient care, to speed scientific
 
research 
and to ensure access to online learning for students and teachers. We are 
also granting free access to our IP to all COVID
-
19 researchers and 
scientists.
 
At the same time, we also know that our communities need help right now. 
Between Intel and o
ur foundation, we are providing $10 million towards 
coronavirus relief in the communities where we have significant presence. 
This will aid community organizations focused on food security, shelter, 
medical equipment and small business support. We also wan

equipment.
 
We have already started delivering masks, gloves, face shields and other

technical innovation to help people and communities across the globe 
persevere through this crisis.
 

business. But first, I want to reiterate our strategy and prio
rities. Even as 
COVID
-
19 drives significant disruptions across the globe, our long
-
term 

-
centric world, is unchanged. And the environment is uncertain, but our 
priorities are unwa
vering. We are focused on accelerating the growth of the 
company, improving our execution and continuing to thoughtfully deploy 
your capital.
 

positioned to grow our share in the largest
 
market opportunity in our 
history. We live in a world where everything increasingly looks like a 
computer, including our homes, our cars, our cities, our hospitals and our 
factories.
 
Additionally, we have redefined Intel Inside to include much more than t
he 

and Optane, among other capabilities. Our opportunity set is more and more 
Intel silicon inside more and more computers so that we can have a larger 

s. And our quarterly results demonstrate the 
benefits of that diversity. Nowhere is growth accelerating more than in our 
cloud and networking businesses where we are helping our customers 
transform the way they move, store and process data.
 
Through this cr

delivered massive scaling to support vital workloads for businesses and 
consumers. Cloud
-
delivered applications seen as conveniences a quarter 
ago, such as online shopping and video collaboration, have
 
now become 
indispensable. We scaled our cloud and communication service provider 
businesses by 53% and 33% year
-
over
-
year, respectively, to help our 
customers meet these growing needs. These two segments now drive 70% 
of our data center segment revenue.
 
N
ew usages and market needs are also pushing compute resources closer to 
the data source or point
-
of
-
service delivery, giving rise to an increasingly 
intelligent edge. Our edge business delivers a wide range of platforms, 
including some innovative solutions
 
that are helping the medical community 
tackle COVID
-

Powered by Intel technology, this solution can turn beds into virtual ICU 
beds in minutes, helping protect critical health care workers while exp
anding 
their care capacity significantly.
 
Houston Methodist Hospital deployed Sickbay for its virtual ICU and was able 
to leverage it within one day to support remote monitoring of its COVID
-
19 
patients without risking exposure to care providers. We are al
so partnering 
closely with Medtronic and Dyson as they use Intel technologies to deliver 
much needed ventilators. We also continue to demonstrate significant 
progress in ADAS and autonomous driving. While auto vehicle production is 
largely stalled, Mobiley
e delivered another proof point, demonstrating its 
leadership position with a landmark first
-
ever design win with a major Asian 
OEM.
 
Finally, we see AI as a significant growth opportunity and are embedding AI 
capability into everything we make. AI has the 
power to reimagine how we 
solve problems across industries, including cutting
-
edge health care 
diagnostics, for example, in China, Intel teams with Lenovo and BGI 
Genomics to accelerate the analysis of genomic characteristics of COVID
-
19. 
Our combined work
 
will further advance the capabilities of BGI sequencing 
tools to help scientists investigate transmission patterns of the virus and 
create better diagnostic methods.
 
And in India, we are working with government labs, academia and industry 
to achieve faste
r and cheaper testing, accelerate drug discovery through 
virus genome sequencing and help architect a pandemic response platform. 
We acquired Habana in the fourth quarter of last year to strengthen our AI 
portfolio and accelerate our efforts in a nascent, 
fast
-
growing AI silicon 
market that we expect will grow to $25 billion by 2024. This quarter, we 
have largely completed the integration. We consolidated product road maps, 
aligned software resources and are executing to our deal thesis. We are also 
now sam

 

road map objectives. Shortly after our January call, we started to see the 
impact of COVID
-
19 in China, force 
many of our ODM partners to extend 
Chinese New Year factory shutdowns. ODM partners have now returned to 
work, and production is increasing every week. As I mentioned earlier, our 
factories remain operational. And in Q1, we are able to mitigate most of the
 
COVID
-
19
-

committed client CPU orders as expected.
 
We remain on track to add sufficient wafer capacity this year so that we 
meet market demand and restore our PC unit inventory to more norm
al 
levels. Near
-
term PC demand has increased due to work from home and 
online learning, but the second half demand picture is more uncertain. We 
continue to assess how COVID
-
19 impacts to the economy will offset the 
immediate catalysts for more remote work
 
and will balance wafer start plans 
accordingly.
 
We have made strong progress on a wave of 10
-
nanometer
-
based product 
introductions this year. This quarter, we announced the new Intel Atom 
P5900 SoC, Snow Ridge, a 10
-
nanometer
-
based new addition to our 
portfolio of 5G capabilities. We are a leading silicon provider in 5G 
infrastructure, and Snow Ridge expands our reach to the fullest edges of the 
network. With major design wins at Ericsson, Nokia and ZTE, we expect to 
be the base station market segment l
eader by 2021, a year earlier than 
previously committed.
 

-
generation mobile processor, 
Tiger Lake. Using our second

generation 10
-
nanometer process, Tiger Lake 
will deliver breakthrough performance, and our c
ustomers have more than 
50 fantastic Tiger Lake
-
based notebook designs lined up for the holiday 
season. Finally, in the latter part of 2020, we continue to expect initial 
production shipments of our first 10
-
nanometer
-
based Xeon Scalable 
product, Ice Lake.
 
While product development in a work
-
from
-
home environment is extremely 
challenging, we are largely on track for our 2020 product deliverables. We 
are always mindful of our role as stewards and thoughtful allocators of your 
capital. We generate significant
 
cash flow and have an excellent balance 

shares during the quarter.
 
In light of the uncertainty, we took some actions to dramatically strengthen 
our liquidity position that we felt
 
were prudent. We raised $10.3 billion in 
debt to further underpin an already strong balance sheet, and we suspended 
our share buybacks. We think this level of conservatism is appropriate at 
this phase, and we intend to reinstate our buyback program as 
cir
cumstances warrant.
 
Our focus now is on investing in our products and process technology and 
ensuring we have the capacity to meet our customer needs. We also 
continue to take a disciplined approach to our portfolio of investments, 
including an agreement t
o divest our Home Gateway Platform business. We 
have transformed our company to lead the data
-

fueling our industry. Our belief is that opportunity is resolute. COVID
-
19 has 
only reinforced how important it is for Intel and our cust
omers to accelerate 
the power of data to fight the current pandemic and avert the next one.
 

companies survive them. Great companies are improved by them. Guided by 
our cultural values, 
competitive advantages and financial strength, we will 
emerge from this situation even stronger.

Thanks, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. Q1 marked a strong start to the 
year amidst significant economic uncertainty and the unexpectedly strong 
demand for both PCs and servers as work

dynamics played out global
ly. Revenue came in at $19.8 billion, up 23% 
year
-
on
-
year and $800 million higher than guide. Data
-
centric revenue of 
$10.1 billion, up 34% year
-
on
-
year, represented 51% of our total revenue, 
an all
-
time high.
 
Strong server demand across segments and a ric
her mix of our Xeon devices 
drove a significant portion of the upside. Q1 PC
-
centric revenue was $9.8 
billion, up 14% year
-
on
-
year on strong notebook PC sales and increased 
supply resulting from capacity additions over the past year. Gross margin for 
the q
uarter was 62%, beating expectations due to strong flow
-
through of 
higher platform revenue, partly offset by reserves associated with our 
memory business and from the sale of our Home Gateway Business.
 
Operating margin of 38% in the quarter was up 10 point
s versus last year on 
higher gross margins and disciplined spending controls, consistent with the 
environment. Q1 EPS was $1.45, $0.15 above our guide on strong 
operational performance, partially offset by losses in our ICAP and trading 
asset portfolios, a
long with the effects of a slightly higher tax rate. The 
strength of these results show the remarkable talent and commitment of our 
global workforce in a difficult and rapidly evolving environment.
 
In Q1, we generated $6.2 billion in operating cash flow an
d invested $3.3 
billion in CapEx with $2.9 billion of free cash flow, up 76% year
-
over
-
year. 
We returned $5.6 billion to shareholders via dividends and share 
repurchases. As Bob mentioned, we announced a pause in our share 
repurchase program as we felt it 
was prudent to do so in the current 
economic environment. This does not change our commitment to returning 
$20 billion in repurchases as outlined in October last year, and we plan to 
resume the program when market dynamics stabilize.
 
With Q1 buybacks at $4
.2 billion, we have already more than offset expected 
dilution associated with employee stock compensation for this year. In 
addition, our dividend policy remains unchanged with $1.4 billion in 
dividends paid in Q1.
 

 
Data Center Group revenue of $7 
billion was up 43% from the prior year, coming in higher than expectations 
with strength across our customer landscape. Year
-
over
-
year platform 
volumes and ASPs were up 27% and 13%, respectively. While year
-
over
-
year compar
isons benefited from a weak Q1 2019, revenue in the quarter 
came in at the second
-
highest level ever for DCG.
 
Revenue was up 53% in cloud, 34% in enterprise and government and 33% 
for communication service providers. DCG adjacencies also delivered solid 
gr
owth with revenue up 35% year
-
on
-
year on strong adoption of networking 
solutions. Our other data
-
centric businesses were up 19% year
-
over
-
year in 
Q1 despite more tangible COVID impact. IOTG operating income declined 
3%, primarily on lower revenue from indu
strial and retail. Mobileye revenue 
and operating income were up 22% and 29%, respectively, driven by 
continued ADAS penetration and new IQ program launches, offset partially 
by eroding conditions in the automotive market.
 
While Q1 marked a record for Mobi
leye revenue, we expect 2020 revenue 
growth will be lower than our prior expectations as automobile production 
and volume ramps are being materially impacted by COVID
-
19. NSG 
revenue grew 46% on strong bit growth and improved pricing. Better market 
conditi
ons versus last year, along with cost reductions on strong factory 
performance, resulted in a lower operating loss of $66 million.
 
PSG revenue grew 7% year
-
on
-
year on cloud and enterprise strength, 
partially offset by weaker embedded and communications seg
ment. 
Operating income was up 9% on higher revenue. CCG revenue was $9.8 
billion in Q1, up 14% year
-
over
-
year, driven by notebook market strength 
and higher modem sales. PC unit volumes were up 13% year
-
over

higher notebook demand and increased sup
ply. Notebook demand strength 
is expected to continue into Q2 with more people working and learning from

Operating margin was 43%, up 7 points year
-
on
-
year, on higher revenue 
and lower spending driven b
y the 5G smartphone modem exits, partially 
offset by higher unit costs associated with the ramp of 10
-
nanometer 
products.
 

global economy, the range of potential outcomes has a wider di
stribution 
than normal. Based on demand signals from our customers, we expect the 
strength in cloud and comms infrastructure to continue in Q2, while IOTG 
and Mobileye will see lower demand driven by COVID
-
19.
 
As a result, we expect total revenue of $18.5 
billion with PC
-
centric 
approximately flat to slightly up year
-
over
-
year and data
-
centric up 
approximately 25% year
-
over
-
year. Operating margin is expected to be 
approximately 30%, down 1 point year
-
on
-
year on lower gross margin, 
largely offset by lower sp
ending on higher revenue. Gross margins are 
expected to be approximately 56%, down 6 points sequentially due primarily 
to three reasons: prequalification reserves associated with the ramp of our 
next 10
-
nanometer client product, code named Tiger Lake; lowe
r sequential 
revenue; and an accelerated ramp of 10
-
nanometer products, including 
isolate client CPUs and 5G SoC.
 
The Tiger Lake reserves are not expected to impact full year gross margin as 
we expect to sell through the reserve inventory in the second hal
f of the 
year. As a result, Q2 EPS is expected to be approximately $1.10 per share.
 
Moving to the full year. With limited visibility due to the uncertainty driven 
by COVID
-
19, we are not guiding the full year. However, I do want to spend 
a few minutes disc
ussing the expected headwinds and tailwinds we are 
monitoring and our response to the market dynamics. Tailwinds are most 
evident in the first half of the year on strong demand for mobile compute 
and related infrastructure on the dynamics of sheltering in 
place.
 
In particular, mobile PCs, cloud and network infrastructure for 5G remain 
above seasonal trends. Headwinds include the impact of a global recession 
on IOTG end markets, particularly industrial and retail, lower automotive 
production impacting Mobile
ye and slowing enterprise and government data 
center demand. We also expect the PC TAM to weaken in the second half as 
GDP effects outweigh the initial demand bump from COVID. Also, given the 
volatility of the margins in Q1, our losses in our ICAP and trad
ing asset 
portfolios were negatively impacting EPS by $0.03. Given the uncertain 
environment, this remains a watch item for the remainder of the year. In 
response to these market dynamics, we acted swiftly and strengthened 
liquidity.
 
In addition to spendin
g repurchases, we issued $10.3 billion in debt in the 
quarter. Our total cash investment balance at quarter end was $20.8 billion. 
Our liquidity actions to date are expected to impact full year EPS 
performance by approximately $0.12. The company has an exc
eptional 
balance sheet and strong cash flow to handle a very wide range of scenarios. 
We have positioned the company to support investment in technology 

scenarios.
 
As you would exp
ect, we are very focused on cash flow management and 
believe our free cash flow generation this year will be resilient as impacts 
from COVID are tempered by first half demand strength, OpEx savings 
initiatives, capital actions and tight working capital ove
rsight. To conclude, 

diligently in these challenging times to provide products essential to the 
world.

All right. Thank you, George. Moving on now to the Q&A. As this our normal 
practice, we would ask each participant to ask just one question. Operator, 
please go ahead and introduce our first caller.
 
Question
-
and
-
Answer Session
 
Operator
 
Certainly. Our first question comes from the line of John Pitzer from Credit 
Suisse. Your question please.
 
John Pitzer
 

wondering if you could give us a little bit more detail on the 
gross margin 
decline heading into the calendar second quarter. George, you kind of broke 

Lake versus just lower volumes and then other 10
-
nanometer parts. And I 
guess, more impo
rtantly, how do we think about kind of normalized sort of 
gross margins as you get past some of the start
-
up costs for a faster 10
-
nanometer ramp?
 
George Davis
 
Yes. Thanks, John. So the margin picture is really unchanged from what 

 
past in terms of how we think our product road 
map is going to move products that we expect to introduce and their margin 


 
the quarter is from 
the Tiger Lake pre PRQ reserves. Obviously, the fact that 

 

sequentially and year
-
over
-
year. And so I think the way we would look at it 


 
if you take COVID out of the 
year, we


-
in of 
demand for some of our 10
-
nanometer products.
 
I mean I think one of the things 

 
we got very strong demand for Tiger
 
Lake. And so when you look at the impact that Tiger Lake reserves are 

Lake in Q1 of 2019. And yet we have about double the number of units in 
the 

 
being reserved. And I think i
t gives you an indication of just how much 
our performance was improving on 10
-
nanometer.
 
Bob Swan
 
So John, I would just say, relative to where we were 90 days ago, gross 

expectations
 

timing dynamics of pre PRQ reserves that we take in the second quarter and 
recoup in the second half, the only other change is just that we feel 
confident in accelerating the ramp for 10.
 
So f
rom our vantage point, at or better than kind of how we started the 

excited about the Tiger Lake products ramping going into the second half 
and the 5G Snow Ridge product that we announ
ced. So all in all, gross 

back to the commentary that George provided back at our Analyst Day in 
the spring, which is, obviously, when we transition from a mature node to a 
new nod
e, margins tend to come down. We indicated that we plan to get 
back on a 2 to 2.5
-

-

-
nanometer that we 
anticipate having in the fourth quarter of 2021.
 
So th
ose dynamics of 

 
from a mature node to a new node, impacts the 


 

the plans we laid out and feel pretty good about a dynamite first quarter and 
an outlook for the second quarter 
in line or better than what we expected.
 
Operator

Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I guess a follow

on, John, with 
the gross margi

when we look out at that trajectory that you had given us, I was wondering 
if you can just kind of step us through with the acceleration. And actually, 
maybe looking back to last year, if you look 
at the improvement you saw of 
that low quarter, just kind of any kind of directional guidance of where this 
gross margin can go from here.
 
George Davis
 

going to improve, all t
hings being equal, just from the fact that starting in 


really hard to think about the second half in t
erms of how demand is going 
to look compared to what we ultimately thought when we first gave 
guidance, which is because of the 

 
all the obvious issues related to COVID.
 


 
as we look at what we guided all the way back in May of 
2019, i

clear evidence of improved performance on 10

nanometer. And so we feel 
good about the overall gross margin dynamics. You can see how our other 
cost initiatives are helping 5 points out of
 
the 6

offset by effectively the OpEx percentage. So overall, I would go back and 
say no real change to our fundamental outlook. But when you overlay

before. I understand the need to be responsive to the macro dynamics and 
in preserving the balance sheet. But you upsided first half by quite a bit, and

nanometers. Does that create some 
upward bias or at least protect the kind of capital spending plans that you 
had for the year? Any puts and takes would be very helpful. Thank you.

our R&D and our

Our next question comes from the line of Joe Moore from Morgan

Joe Moore
 
Great, thank you. I wonder if you could talk about some of the changes to

more focused on Ice Lake server. Is that about confidence of the 

 
in the 10

nanometer plus? Is that 

 
just kind of describe what led to that 
decision.
 
Bob Swan
 


 
our 
product road map for se
rvers is very focused on delivering workload

-
world 
environments that our customers are operating in. So we ramped 

 
Skylake 
was the fastest ramp in the Xeon history, followed by Cascade Lake, that 
was a very strong ramp. Next, we have a Cascade Lake refresh that is a 
relatively simple, simple upgrade, easier upgrade for our customers because 
the architecture is very simple to the fastest
-
growing Cascade Lake ramp.
 

in the second half of the year or in the 
fourth quarter, as we indicated. So as we step back and look at the market 
dynamics and the product road map, we feel like we got the right products 
at the right time as we ramp and scale the high end of Cascade Lak
e and 
refresh while positioning for Ice Lake.
 
Joe Moore

nanometer plus, 

clock speeds, better yields, better 

 
is there
 
better transistor performance 
implicit in that transition?
 
Bob Swan
 

Rapids product or 

 
oh, for clients, sorry. Yes, the client 

 
the Tiger Lake 
product, we are extremely excited abou
t. We 

 
as I think I mentioned in our 
prepared remarks that we have 50 designs that we expect to ramp in the 
holiday season this year. Clock speed, battery life, AI incorporation into the 
core design, a platform offering that we think is a real differentia
tor for 
customers on 

 
in thin and light format.
 


in both the product and the yield is 

 
has us at a point 
where we expect to 
accelerate the ramp and adoption a bit faster than we did coming into the 
year.

Hi, guys. Thanks for ta
king my questions. I wanted to ask first about the 10

Lake demand signals and a potentially faster 10

nanometer. Like what do 
you think your product mix by node is going to be exi
ting the year? Do you

nanometers?
 
George Davis
 

this is 

 

through,
 

-
nanometer this 
year than we thought going in. Again, I think Ice Lake demand was strong 

 

-
nanometer getting stronger demand as the mark
et there just gets stronger 
and stronger on the comp side. But Tiger Lake is really, I think, going to be 
the driver for us in being above our expectations for all the reasons that Bob 
just covered. And

or
 
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ross Seymore from 
Deutsche Bank. Your question please.
 
Ross Seymore
 
Hey, guys. Thanks for that. I want to go to the Data Center Group, you have 
the color commentary about the enterprise and government 
being weaker in 


the cloud and the comms side? And specifically, you had worried earlier this 

 
enter a digestion period. So I wanted to see if your views 
have changed on that. And then in the comms service provider side, how 
much of that actually acts like the enterprise and government versus the 
side that benefits from the 5G ramp? Any pluses and 
minuses there would 
be helpful as well. Thank you.
 
Bob Swan
 
Yes. Thanks, Ross. First, on the cloud side, as you indicated, we came into 
the year off a very strong second half of 2019, and our expectations were 
that Q1 would continue that strength. But then
 
the cloud service providers 
would go through their normal digestion stage, if you will. That was kind of 
what we indicated back in January.
 
First quarter, as George flagged, demand was even stronger for the CSPs. In 
our raised outlook for Q2, we expect th
at demand for the cloud folks to 

 
the 
strong demand to continue. And possibly, even going into the second half of 


 
product. So 
ASPs, as you saw in our results, were very strong.
 
So purchasing is extending beyond what we thought a few months ago. And 
that drove Q1 upside, it drove Q2 upside, and we think it will be relatively 

n the comms side, fantastic 
growth in the first quarter. Our expectations are, as we go through the 
course of the year, it will stay relatively strong as we continue to gain share 

within t
hat sector and with the product that we just qualified a few weeks 
back.
 
So we expect share gains, the infrastructure 

 
share gains to continue, 

positioned in the 

 
with the key 
players of Nokia, Ericsson and ZTE going 
into the second half of the year. So we feel good about the comms segment 
as well.
 


 

about is just enterprise and government and what kind of demand signals 

Enterprise and government, a big 

 
a bit of an unknown for us at this stage.

was wondering a couple of things. The first one is how much is that really 

you catching up on capacity and being bette

to regain share in PCs? And if not, when do you see that happening this 
year
?
 
George Davis
 

expectations from the work

at

home, learn

at

home dynamics. But we had 
expected a strong quarter in our initial forecast, which really reflected the 
dynamics tha

of demand for a number of quarters who were seeing a chance to finally 
build some 

 
a little bit of inventory, which gave us a seasonally strong first 
quarter relative to anything we might see his
torically. But we saw notebook 

just the pent

up demand.
 

early part of the quarter with their supply chains, w



 

very strong demand coming in on the PC side. So 

 
and we had expected 
solid PC i


 

stronger and heavily weighted towards the notebook.
 
Bob Swan
 
And the only thing I would add is in our fab network and the supply chain 
was able to 

 
coming out of last year, not only able 
to deal with the backlog 
coming into the year but also meet the higher demand signals that George 
flagged at the latter part of March.

manufacturing teams, keeping the factories up and running. Delivering 90%

Evercore
. Your question please.
 
C.J. Muse
 
Yes, good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. I realized that you 
removed your guidance for the full year. But if I look at your results and 
your guide for Q2, it would suggest data

centric tracking, maybe down 2
% 
half

on

positive trends in notebooks and the weakness on the enterprise and 

 
more muted, and would love to hear your 
thoughts on that.
 
George Davis
 


 

But I appreciate the question. I think the 

 
maybe talking a little bit, C.J., 
headwinds and tailwinds, w
hich we referred to on the call, clearly, cloud is a 
tailwind and 

 
cloud and mobile compute are a tailwind for the first half for 
sure. I think cloud continues to be 

 
will probably be helpful throughout the 
year. The 

 

ee the impacts of the 
recession start to impact demand on PCs.
 


 


on IOTG, particularly in industrial an

Mobileye had a record quarter in Q1. But I think the full year is going to be 
certainly weaker than we had expected coming into the year. Now not nearly 
as weak as automotive overall because they continue to grow. They

part of the automotive market that is growing substantially.
 
And they have the leadership position in ADAS. And so it will be more subtle 
of an impact, but still an impact nonetheless. And then as Bob said, on the 
data center side, enterprise and 
government appear to have been very 
strong in the first half, and so we would expect some digestion. How those

out.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Srini Pajjuri from SMBC 
Nikko. Your question please.
 
Srini Pajjuri
 
Thank you. George, I want to go back to the gross margins. I think you did a 
great job giving us color about h

wondering, the remaining half, is that because of reserves, which is going to 
reverse in the second half? Or is this something more structural or mix 

ould love to hear 
some color on that. Thank you.
 
George Davis
 

-
nanometer demand in the year than we had forecasted at the beginning of 
the year. And that will have a little bit of 
dampening on margins but not 
materially different from what we had seen coming into the year. The 
temporary impact is really the reserve action, which will reverse. It is about 
half of the year
-
over
-
year effect. And so I would say the other impact, 
again, 
is if we look year
-
over
-

of Ice Lake and 5G SoCs year
-
over
-
year, but much of that was expected. I 
would say both Ice Lake and the 5G SoCs are a little bit stronger than we 
would have thought coming into the year 
and 

 
which is consistent with just 

around that.
 
Bob Swan
 
Yes. And just we came into the year with an outlook of 59% gross margin 
for the year. And I would just say through the first 


pre PRQ reserve are no impact on the full year. Therefore, net
-
net, to the 
first six months of the year, we feel just as good about our gross margin 
performan
ce and even better about our ability to ramp 10

nanometer. So 

relative to where we were 90 days ago across demand signals and gross 
margin performance.

Chris Danely
 
Hey, guys. Thanks for squeezing me in. Can you just run down the supply 
demand sort of balance thr
oughout the server, desktop and notebook lines? 
I guess are you on track for the high single
-
digit unit increase in output? And 
then did the shortages anywhere get any worse during the during Q1? Or it 

 
color there would be 
great.
 
Bob Swan
 
Yes. On 

 
as we indicated at the beginning of the year, our intention 

 
well, 
we did add capacity last year, and our intention this year was to add another 
mid
-
20% growth in capacity, which would generate real strong o
utput. And 
we are on track, maybe even a little bit better than what we said at the 
time. Obviously, in the first quarter, demand was also greater. It was 
greater for 

 
across the board, server and notebook, in particular. And we 
were able to keep pace wit
h accelerating demand as the quarter closed.

So meaning mix dynamics across the board is 

 


more demand

we can deal with the variation by SKU mix.

Good day ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Intel Corporation 
Fourth Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. As a reminder, this 
conference call is being recorded. I'd now like to introduce your host for 
today's conference, Mr. Mark 
Henninger, Head of Investor Relations. Sir, you 
may begin.
 
Mark H. Henninger

Intel Corp.
 
Thank you, Chanel, and welcome everyone to Intel's Fourth Quarter 2016 
Earnings Conference Call. By now you should have received a copy of our 
earnings release and t
he CFO commentary that goes along with it. If you've 
not received both documents, they're available on our Investor website, 
intc.com.
 
I'm joined today by Brian Krzanich, our CEO; and Bob Swan, our Chief 
Financial Officer. In a moment, we'll hear brief rem
arks from both of them, 
followed by Q&A.
 
Before we begin, let me remind everyone that today's discussion contains 
forward
-
looking statements based on the environment as we currently see 
it, and as such, does include risks and uncertainties. Please refer to
 
our 
press release for more information on the specific risk factors that could 
cause actual results to differ materially.
 
A brief reminder that this quarter, we have provided both GAAP and non
-
GAAP financial measures. Today, we will be speaking to non
-
GAA
P financial 
measures when describing our consolidated results. The CFO commentary 
and earnings release available on intc.com include the full GAAP and non
-
GAAP reconciliations.
 
And finally, I'd like to remind everyone that we'll be hosting our annual 
Inves
tor Meeting here at our Santa Clara headquarters on Thursday, 
February 9. If you have any questions about the event or logistics, please 
contact Investor Relations.
 
With that, let me hand it over to Brian.

Intel Corp.
 
Thanks, Mark. I'd 
like to cover three things with you today before handing 
off to Bob: a brief review of our results for the year; an update on the 
transformation of the company; and a look ahead at 2017 and Intel's future.
 
First, the review of our result. Q4 was a strong f
inish to a record year in 
which we increased revenue 7% and net income 9%. The Client Computing 
Group, Data Center Group, Internet of Things and Intel Security all grew in 
2016, with DCG and IoTG setting full
-
year revenue and volume records. The 
acquisitio
n of Altera added three percentage points to our overall growth 
rate.
 
In the Data Center, cloud service provider revenue grew 24%, while 
enterprise revenue was down 3% for the full
-
year. Additionally, we are very 
excited that comm service provider revenue 
grew 19%, and across all of our 
customer categories, adjacency revenue grew an incredible 21% with 
strength in Ethernet controllers, Omni
-
Path fabric controllers and switches 
and network ASICs.
 
IoT revenue was up 15% for the full
-
year, driven by strength i
n the video, 
retail and industrial segment. In Q4, we launched new Apollo Lake and Kaby 
Lake product and we won key designs in automotive and video.
 
Our Memory business finished the year with record quarterly revenue, while 
full
-
year revenue was down 1%. T
his was an investment year for the 
Memory business, but MSG operating margins improved meaningfully in the 
fourth quarter. We are now shipping 3D NAND from our Fab 68 and we just 
qualified our first 3D XPoint base Optane SSDs, which we expect to ship for 
r
evenue in the first quarter. And our 3D XPoint memory DIMM, a sample to 
data center customers.
 
The Client Computing business achieved impressive result, driven by strong 
execution and higher ASPs as customers bought a richer mix of Intel Core 
products. Thi
s was also a breakout year for CCG's wireless communication 
product line, our 7360 LTE modem ramped into high volume and we shipped 
record Wi
-
Fi units. I'm very proud of the Client Computing business and 
what this team has delivered in 2016.
 
Our strategy o
f delivering consistent product leadership, segmentation and 
differentiation paid off. We achieved record i7 units and overall core mix in 
2016. And Client Computing revenue was up 2% for the year, despite a 
declining PC market.
 
The Programmable Solutions 
Group was up about 7% on a non
-
GAAP basis 
over Altera's 2015 results. PSG saw strength across many segments with 
particular strength in compute and storage. The Programmable Solutions 
business tackled the industry's first and only 14
-
nanometer FPGA this ye
ar, 
known as Stratix 10. This product line has the largest demand pipeline in 
Altera's history.
 
The integration of Altera into Intel was an important milestone in what was a 
transformative year for Intel. This team did a great job of meeting 
integration ob
jectives, while continuing to deliver new products and grow the 
business.
 
In 2016, we took other important and in some cases difficult steps to 
position the company for future success, improve the alignment of our 
resources to our strategy and accelerate o
ur transformation to the company 
that powers the cloud and billions of smart connected devices.
 
Our restructuring initiative focused on our investments on the product and 
technologies that will fuel our growth, and that work, combined with 
improvements in 
14
-
nanometer cost, drove a 30% operating margin 
improvement in our Client business.
 
Our decision to establish McAfee as a separate, independent company was 
another transformative move. This transaction will give McAfee the flexibility 
to invest independent
ly, tighten our focus and allow Intel to share in 
McAfee's future success as the market demand for world
-
class security 
product continues to grow.
 
And finally, looking ahead to 2017, and Intel's future, I'm confident we're 
making the right investments to c
ompete and win, not only in the segments 
where Intel is strong today, but also in new areas that are poised for growth 
driven by the emerging flood of data.
 
By 2020, the average person will generate about 1.5 GB of data per day, 
while smart and connected d
evices of the future will produce data at many 
times that rate. Autonomous cars, for example, will generate about 4,000 
GB of data each day. The resulting explosion of data is creating tremendous 
opportunity. But data alone isn't valuable. It's the transmi
ssion, aggregation 
and analysis of the data that results in value and impact. Intel will play 
essential role in those steps because our products are key to turning raw 
data into high
-
value insight and information.
 
Our investments in advanced research and d
evelopment are making this all 
possible, while significantly expanding our TAM at the same time. These 
investments are creating opportunities in segments from autonomous 
driving, where we are uniquely positioned to be the compute engine in the 
vehicle and 
the data center, to 5G where we are building on our momentum 
in 4G to establish leadership, to artificial intelligence where we are providing 
the industry's most complete range of products to accelerate all AI solutions 
from the edge to the data center.
 
We
're already seeing signs of progress. In autonomous driving, we are 
winning key designs like BMW, Delphi and WiDi. In 5G, we are leading in the 
definition of standards, prototyping and field trials.
 
Our network business saw strong growth as infrastructure 
moved to Intel 
architecture in anticipation of 5G. Our design wins and network 
virtualization, innovation position us for leadership share in the wireless 
access market.
 
Other proof points of our progress include important partnerships with AT&T, 
SK Teleco
m, Korea Telecom and Verizon and the announcement earlier this 
month of the industry's first global 5G modem.
 
Finally, in Artificial Intelligence, we believe we have the industry's strongest 
product portfolio. Intel processors power well over 90% of 
servers deployed 
to support machine learning workload, and we are winning the vast majority 
of AI solution based on strong product performance and customer value.
 
Wrapping things up, I'm very pleased with Intel's performance in 2016. We 
have important work
 
to do in 2017 as we continue to transform the 
company, but the progress we've made leaves me increasingly confident in 
Intel's growth and Intel's future.
 
And with that, I'll hand it over to Bob.

Intel Corp.
 
Thanks, Brian. The fourth q
uarter was an outstanding quarter. Revenue was 
up 10%, operating income was up 11%, and EPS was up 4% year
-
over
-
year. Revenue set an all
-
time record of $16.4 billion, and operating income 
was $4.9 billion.
 
Fourth quarter operating margin was 30%, flat year
-
over
-
year. Gross 
margin at 63% was down two points, primarily driven by a couple of one
-
time events related to product warranty cost and long
-
term IP agreements.
 
Direct spending came in at $5.4 billion, up 4% year
-
over
-
year and down two 
points as a percen
t of revenue. Earnings per share of $0.79 was up $0.03 
from a year
-
ago.
 
The Client Computing Group had revenue of $9.1 billion, up 4% year
-
over
-
year. During the fourth quarter, the worldwide PC supply chain remained 
healthy, and we saw some inventory burn 
during the quarter. Client ASPs 
were up 7% year
-
over
-
year, and core mix was at an all
-
time high, as a 
result of the success of our segmentation strategies and strength in gaming 
and high
-
end systems.
 
This segment had another quarter of significant profit g
rowth, with operating 
profit growing 30% from a year ago as the business continues to benefit 
from lower spending, richer product mix and continued improvements in 14
-
nanometer unit cost.
 
The Data Center Group had record revenue of $4.7 billion, up 8% year
-
over
-
year. In the fourth quarter, we continued to see robust growth in the cloud 
and comm service provider segments of the business, which both grew 
approximately 30% year
-
over
-
year, partially offset by a 7% decline in the 
enterprise and government segmen
t over the same horizon.
 
The Data Center Group had operating profit of $1.9 billion, down 14% year
-
over
-
year. Operating margin was impacted by the two one
-
time items I 
referred to earlier and the ramp of 14
-
nanometer on our server products, 
which we expect
 
to generate continued cost improvements over time.
 
Our Internet of Things business achieved record revenue of $726 million, 
growing 16% year
-
over
-
year, driven by strength in both the retail and 
industrial segment. Operating profit for the business was $18
2 million, up 
37% year
-
over
-
year.
 
Our Memory business had record revenue of $816 million, up 25% year
-
over
-
year with strong demand for data center SSD solutions with demand 
signals outpacing supply. We've made great progress ramping Fab 68 with 
yields and 
unit costs well ahead of expectation. This segment had an 
operating loss of $91 million, largely driven by cost associated with 3D 
XPoint and startup costs for our memory capacity.
 
The Programmable Solutions Group had revenue of $420 million, and 
operating
 
profit was $80 million. Our Intel Security Group business had 
revenue of $550 million and operating profit of $103 million.
 
Turning to the full
-
year 2016, revenue grew 7%, operating margin grew 
11% and EPS grew 9%. Operating margin percent improved by one
 
point, 
while gross margin was approximately 63%, flat to 2015.
 
Spending was $21 billion, or 35.4% of revenue, down one point from 2015, 
primarily from the restructuring programs we began earlier in the year. 
Operating profit for the year was $16.5 billion
. Earnings per share for the 
year was $2.72, up $0.23 from the prior year.
 
In 2016, the business generated record cash from operations of $21.8 
billion. We purchased $9.6 billion in capital assets, paid $4.9 billion in 
dividends and repurchased about $2.6 
billion of stock. Total cash balance 
was $17.1 billion, down $8.2 billion. Total debt was $25.3 billion. Our net 
cash balance, total cash less debt and inclusive of our other longer
-
term 
investments is approximately negative $2.3 billion.
 
Now, let me turn 
to guidance. First, some context. First, our guidance 
assumes a stable macroeconomic environment, but we have taken a more 
cautious view of PC consumption versus third parties, particularly in our 
outlook for the emerging markets including Russia, China an
d Latin America.
 
Second for the Data Center, we continue to expect similar growth rates in 
the cloud and comm segment, but we are not expecting an improvement in 
enterprise. This gets us to an expectation of high single
-
digit growth in the 
Data Center busi
ness. Third as a reminder, we have one less week as a 
result of the inclusion of an extra work week in 2016. And last, we have 
assumed the Intel Security transaction will close in Q2 and our full
-
year 
guidance reflects one full quarter of the group's conso
lidated results.
 
We have lots of work to do to close this out, and in the event the close 
happens at the end of the second quarter, we would update our full
-
year 
guidance by approximately an additional $500 million of revenue and $100 
million of operating 
income.
 
As we look forward to the first quarter of 2017, we are forecasting a 
midpoint of the revenue range at $14.8 billion, up 7% year
-
over
-
year and 
down from the fourth quarter. This is at the lower end of our seasonal range 
and reflects an expectation 
of lower core brand mix and ASP coming off a 
strong holiday selling period for gaming and other premium PC systems.
 
For the first quarter, we expect operating margin percent to increase four 
points year
-
over
-
year, gross margins to be flat at approximately 
63% and 
spending to be $5.3 billion, down 1%. We expect EPS to be approximately 
$0.65, up 20% year
-
over
-
year.
 
Turning to the full
-
year 2017, we're expecting revenue to be roughly flat. 
Revenue is expected to grow in the low single digits, after excluding t
he 
Intel Security Group from both years. We expect operating margin percent 
to be up one point year
-
over
-
year with flat gross margins and direct 
spending as a percent of revenue down one point versus 2016.
 
Let me provide a bit more detail on our year
-
over
-
year direct spending. Our 
restructuring plans are on track, including reducing our head count by 
approximately 15,000 heads and generating gross savings of $1.6 billion. 
We are reallocating investments from CCG to higher growth segments and 
are continuing 
to invest in areas that extend our leadership position in 
Moore's Law and expand TAM opportunities such as memory and 
autonomous driving.
 
We anticipate the net benefit of these actions to result in an additional point 
of improvement in direct spending as a
 
percent of revenue in 2017. We 
expect EPS of approximately $2.80, up 3% year
-
over
-
year.
 
In 2016, we had a fairly significant gain from our Icap portfolio. Our 2017 
guidance assumes that we'll have gains roughly in line with 2016 levels. The 
capital spendi
ng forecast for 2017 is $12 billion, up $2.5 billion from 2016 as 
we continue to ramp our memory capacity.
 
In closing, 2016 started out slow but finished strong. Our CCG business is 
focused and executing extremely well in a declining market and provides 
sc
ale that's required to advance Moore's Law, generate significant cash flows 
and enables investments for growth. Our growth
-
oriented businesses were 
up 15% collectively as we continue to transform the company from PC
-
centric company to a company of smart an
d connected devices that power 
the cloud.
 
We are excited about our plans for 2017 as we continue with our 
transformation, and we look forward to sharing more details with you at our 
Investor Day in February.
 
With that, let me turn it over back to 
Mark.
 
Mark H. Henninger

Intel Corp.
 
Okay. Thank you, Brian and Bob. Moving on now to the Q&A, as is our 
normal practice we would ask each participant to ask one question and just 
one follow
-
up if you have one. Chanel, please go ahead and introduce our 
fi
rst questioner.
 
Question
-
and
-
Answer Session
 
Operator
 
Our first question comes from the line of Chris Danely of Citigroup. Your line 
is now open.
 
Christopher Brett Danely 
-
 
Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
 
Hey. Thanks, guys. Just digging in on the segments, t
he CCG operating 
margins were I think the highest in the last few years. DCG was kind of the 
lowest in the last few years. Can you just talk about the trend in operating 
margins for those two segments for this year given the guidance?
 
Robert Holmes Swan 
-
 
Intel Corp.
 
Yeah, Chris. The CCG performance 

 
a couple of dynamics that are driving 
the record margins. One, higher ASPs on the strong mix that Brian referred 
to. Secondly, real strong unit cost. It's been on 14
-
nanometer for a while, so 
we expect that to
 
continue. And then constrained investments in the CCG 
business as we focus more on investing heavier in the higher growth 
businesses. So real good performance, and those are the dynamics that 
we're expecting in 2017.
 
On the DCG front, good in Q4 and then 
project forward. Nice ASP 
performance in the quarter as we migrate from Haswell to Broadwell, and as 
we think about Skylake in 2017, we expect that to continue. Unit cost in 
DCG is a little bit higher because we're coming off more great unit cost 
performan
ce on 22
-
nanometer, but as we migrate to 14
-
nanometer in the 
earlier stages of that cycle, unit costs are little bit higher. And then we're 
increasing our investments in DCG on a year
-
over
-
year basis.
 
So, dynamics are relatively good. The one 

 
I referred 
to it a little bit earlier, 
but in terms of Q4, we had a couple one
-
time items that really weighed on 
the profitability or operating margins of DCG that we think are well
-
bounded 
and do not expect to continue in 2017. And just quickly, one, we entered 
into
 
a long
-
term cross licensed agreement and patent purchase agreement, 
particularly in the comm space in the quarter, and DCG was impacted by a 
portion of that cost in the quarter.
 
But secondly, and a little bit more significant, we were observing a product 
quality issue in the fourth quarter with slightly higher expected failure rates 
under certain use and time constraints, and we established a reserve to deal 
with that. We think we have it relatively well
-
bounded with a minor design 
fix that we're working w
ith our clients to resolve. So, those two one
-
timers 
in the fourth quarter weighed on DCG margins, and we do not expect that to 
continue in 2017.
 
Christopher Brett Danely

Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
 
Great. Thanks. Do I get a follow
-
up?
 
Mark H. Henning
er 
-
 
Intel Corp.
 
Yeah. Please go ahead, Chris.
 
Christopher Brett Danely 
-
 
Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
 
Oh. Great. Maybe just to expand on the PC market, what do you see driving 
the strength here? How sustainable is it? Any thoughts on PC unit growth for 
this year?
 
Brian M. Krzanich 
-
 
Intel Corp.
 
This is Brian. I can start, and then Bob can add in. If you take a look 

 
Bob 
mentioned in his portion of the talk of, hey, we've taken a slightly more 
conservative view of 2017 then third parties for what we see 
the overall PC 
unit market as, and we had extremely strong, record Core i7, record core 
mix in the fourth quarter that we've, as we look at Q1 and we look at 2017, 
we factored a little bit of caution into that as well. Those two things put us in 
the PC mar
ket in the unit level in the mid
-
single
-
digit decline. That's better 
than if you went back a year or so ago, we were in the high single
-
digits, 
depending on how you looked at it and where you counted from the 2
-
in
-
1 
devices. So, it is starting to get bette
r, but I don't think we're back at a zero 
unit or a positive unit.
 
But as Bob said, what we've really been focusing on in that space is how do 
you make money, how do you sell up, how do you do a better business 
performance in that kind of market? And we're
 
comfortable that we can 
continue that into 2017.
 
Robert Holmes Swan 
-
 
Intel Corp.
 
And Chris, the only thing I'd add is we think, as Brian said, our outlook is a 
little more conservative than the third parties and our view is that's probably 
the right post
ure and the right caution to have as we go into the year. And 
obviously, the team has done a great job in adjusting its cost structure for a 
more cautious outlook, and then we'll see how it plays out during the course 
of the year.
 
Christopher Brett Danely 
-
 
Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
 
Great. Thanks guys. Nice quarter.
 
Brian M. Krzanich 
-
 
Intel Corp.
 
Thank you.
 
Mark H. Henninger 
-
 
Intel Corp.
 
Thanks, Chris.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Joe Moore of 
Morgan 
Stanley. Your line is now open.
 
Joe L. Moore 
-
 
Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
 
Great. Thank you. I wonder if I could ask about the DCG commentary of 
being up by single
-
digits. Obviously that's a little bit more conservative than 
the longer
-
term numbers you had ta
lked about. And I guess as you think 
about that, is there an element of the cloud spending that you think is 
causing the enterprise to be weaker? Or maybe just give us the qualitative 
underpinnings for that change?
 
Brian M. Krzanich 
-
 
Intel Corp.
 
Sure. So 
let me start, and then again Bob can jump in on this one. As we 
said, we took a look at the 2017 view on enterprise to be relatively 
equivalent to what we saw in 2016, which says that enterprise continues to 
decline.
 
I think that certainly some of that is,
 
that it's moving to the public cloud, it's 
moving to those areas at a faster rate than I think we expected. It's also 
been a little bit slow about developing private cloud and we're working with 
several partners like Microsoft, Azure and others around the
 
private cloud 
segments as well for the enterprise. But if you take a look at the long
-
term, 
we still see this as the growth engine and still getting into that double
-
digit 
regime.
 
Remember, for us, enterprise is now less than 50% of our overall Data 
Cente
r business and the areas that are growing even faster or as fast as 
cloud in most cases are the networking and storage space, which we have 
very low market share in still, and it's a great opportunity for us. And then 
the emerging areas like Silicon Photon
ics, Omni
-
Path fabric, Rack Scale 
Design and 3D XPoint, and those areas are really what we've always 
forecasted to be the growth engine of the Data Center Group as we exit and 
go towards the back half of this decade.
 
So for us, our view is this is, anytime
 
you're going to a market transition, 
you're not going to get the cloud to enterprise mixed perfect, and this is an 
anomaly right now that we've forecasted, we think, accurately and adjusted 
for the way it is. But our long
-
term growth was actually based on
 
other 
factors and we're still very, very confident in those growth areas. I don't 
know if Bob wants to add?
 
Robert Holmes Swan 
-
 
Intel Corp.
 
Nope, I think that's perfect. Nothing to add. Thanks.
 
Joe L. Moore 
-
 
Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
 
Great. Thank you for
 
that. That's great. And then separately on the PC 
market, the ASP growth that you guys saw over the course of 2016, is that 
strictly mix shift and strength in the higher
-
end segments as you've been 
talking about? And any thoughts on your ability to contin
ue that price 
momentum over the course of this year?
 
Brian M. Krzanich 
-
 
Intel Corp.
 
Sure, yeah, it mostly, if not in almost every case, all mix shift and our 
customers buying up. And the great example was the case SKUs, the 
enthusiast, the 10
-
core systems
 
that we put out there, and they far and 
away exceeded our original sales forecast for people who are out there 
buying 10
-
core gaming systems.
 
So we do believe that that market, that enthusiast market will continue. We 
factored a little bit more caution in
to this as we go into the 2017 in the first 
quarter. Some of that is seasonality. Holiday, people tend to buy lot of 
gaming systems, and some of it's just how much more can people buy up? 
And so how much more growth in ASP can we see? But we don't see a 
de
cline or anything of the average ASPs.

The only thing I would add as we think about the full
-
year, the second half 
comps get a little bit tougher on ASPs, because of the strong ASP 
performance throughout the course of the 2
016. So, that's probably the only 
other dynamic that I would add.

Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ross Seymore of 
Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.

Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
 
Hey, guys. Thanks for letting me ask a question. I guess the first one on 
OpEx, and it's more of a conceptual one for you, Brian. On flat revenues it's 
great to see some OpEx leverage on there, but I think some
 
people are 
hoping for a little bit more as you had the restructuring only halfway done 
and then the McAfee sale that's pending. So, can you talk conceptually how 
you balance the desire to reinvest versus the desire to get the profitability 
up to your long
-
term targets?
 
Brian M. Krzanich 
-
 
Intel Corp.
 
Sure. I'll let Bob talk about the McAfee financials and how that affects OpEx, 
because it's a little complex with Q1 into Q1 target there. But let's just talk 
about it in general. What we've always said is tha
t we were going to go 
through the program that we went through at the middle of last year, which 
we called ACT, which was continued through the end of last year 2016, and 
we said we'd be completed about the middle of 2017. And we always said 
there'd be som
e mix between taking that to the bottom line and reinvesting 
it in those growth areas.
 
And so, as we've done acquisitions like Nervana for Artificial Intelligence, we 
want to invest in those businesses now to bring them onto our Silicon to 
integrate them into our software stack, and so we're going to make those 
kinds of investments in key areas. We said the key areas are around Data 
Center in general. We have Rack Scale Design. We have 3D XPoint. We have 
Artificial Intelligence around IoT, a
nd we're making big bets around 
autonomous driving.
 
And so you see us making the investment in HERE, the investments with 
BMW, and that's really 

 
when you take a look at autonomous driving and 
why are we doing that, it's around data and data centers again
. Remember, 
every one of those high definition maps is going to require data centers. 
They're going to require small data centers at the edge.
 
So it's all around are we understanding and managing how data is going to 
flow in that system? And then Memory it
self, and we're going to go make 
those investments around 3D XPoint and really bringing that and 3D NAND 
to market in a big way. And so we'll balance between those, and I think 
you'll see some mix of bringing it to the bottom line. But if I can invest, and
 
think I can turn that into additional profitability in the future, I'm going to go 
and do that.
 
Robert Holmes Swan 
-
 
Intel Corp.
 
Yeah. The only thing I'd add is just to maybe make it a little simple for 
people is we look at our full
-
year guidance that we 
gave, and then we 
extract out three quarters of McAfee. At the macro level, we're looking at 
low single
-
digit growth and mid single
-
digit EPS growth, so that's kind of the 
year
-
on
-
year apples
-
to
-
apples dynamic. On direct spending itself, we'll be 
down roug
hly half 

 
our guidance implies we'll be down roughly $500 million 
year
-
on
-
year, and that's just a function of three things.
 
One, continued benefits from the restructuring actions that we took in 2016 
and continue to execute on in the first half of 2017. S
econdly, obviously the 
direct spend of McAfee kind of goes away. And third, as Brian mentioned, 
during this transformation we continue to make the investments in the 
higher growth businesses. We'll continue to invest in 5G and ADAS, and then 
we'll continue
 
to invest in Moore's Law as we bring 10
-
nanometer to life in 
2017 and continue to invest in 7
-
nanometer. So net
-
net, the implications of 
all that for direct spending was one point down as a percentage of revenue 
in 2016 and another point down as a percent
age of revenue in 2017.
 
And then the only other thing I would add is in terms of the milestones that 
we employ during the course of the year for these big bets, we'll continue to 
build milestones then to make sure those bets that we're making are turning 
o
ut in the medium and long term the way we expect.
 
Ross C. Seymore 
-
 
Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
 
That's very helpful. I guess as my follow
-
up, you talked about the ASPs in 
answering a prior question. I wondered about the competitive intensity in 
the PC m
arket. You're taking a more conservative tack than the third
-
party 
vendors are forecasting, but your primary x86 competitor is coming out with 
a new architecture for the first time in many, many years. So, I wonder 
whether it's on the ASP or the unit or th
e market share side how you're 
factoring that into your forecast for the year.
 
Brian M. Krzanich 
-
 
Intel Corp.
 
Sure. I would tell you that we always look at this environment and say 
there's going to be a competitive risk in the environment. And we're alway
s 
focused on really, our own product roadmap and making sure that we have 
the highest performance product. So, when we look at 2017, we still believe 
that our product roadmap is truly the best ever it's been.
 
And as we look at the Kaby Lake and as it reall
y ramps up through 2017, or 
it came out really just at the end of 2016 and now will ramp with many more 
SKUs and higher
-
performance products as we go into 2017. And then we 
showed at CES the first working 10
-
nanometer Cannonlake product, which 
we're still 
planning to ship by the end of this year and really ramp into 2018. 
We still believe that our roadmap and our leadership will continue to give us 
the performance the customers want and desire. And so that didn't 
necessarily factor into that more cautious f
orecast. That forecast was really 
much more a function of where we think the PC market really is overall.

Great. Thank you, guys.

Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon
 
of 
Bernstein Research. Your line is now open.
 
Stacy Aaron Rasgon 
-
 
Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC
 
Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. I had a question first on the 
guidance for next year. Unless I'm doing the math wrong to get to $2.80, I 
need a fai
rly sizable reduction in share count. So is that true? Could you tell 
us how you're thinking about shares for next year? Are you intending to use 
the cash from McAfee to buy back shares to get to that number?
 
Robert Holmes Swan 
-
 
Intel Corp.
 
First, in esse
nce, the guidance year
-
on
-
year doesn't really anticipate any 
dramatic change in our share count. I think philosophically, our approach is 
to offset dilution from our comp
-
based program. So all else equal, share 
count relatively flat year
-
on
-
year. I think t
he one thing worth noting is we, 
in our Icap portfolio in 2016, we had a fairly significant gain. And what I 
indicated in the prepared remarks is we expect roughly in 2017 that gain to 
be in line with what 2016 generated.
 
Stacy Aaron Rasgon 
-
 
Sanford C. Be
rnstein & Co. LLC
 
Okay.
 
Robert Holmes Swan 
-
 
Intel Corp.
 
But I think just in terms of implied share count in our guidance, it's 
essentially flat year
-
on
-
year.
 
Stacy Aaron Rasgon 
-
 
Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC
 
Okay. For my follow
-
up, I wanted to again dig
 
into the OpEx. So you talked 
about like a mix of the restructure and the cuts versus the reinvestment. But 
I mean if I throw the McAfee cost back in, you've actually got OpEx going up 
fairly sizably year
-
over
-
year. And your employee count is actually up y
ear
-
over
-
year, even though you supposedly had a pretty big, a layoff. So I guess 
can you talk a little more specifically about exactly what the additional 
spending is going on? Is it people versus technology versus something else? 
Where is it going? And do
 
you view those investments as looking to open up 
new markets versus being defensive in nature, or maybe a mix of both?
 
Robert Holmes Swan 
-
 
Intel Corp.
 
Yeah. In terms of the type of cost, maybe two
-
fold. Yes, people and yes, 
technology slash Moore's Law at the macro level, and that expresses itself in 
higher depreciation year
-
on
-
year. So in our guide, our depreciation is up 
quite a bit and a portion of th
at will flow through direct spending.
 
Again on a more macro basis, at the risk of maybe repeating myself, we are 
investing more in DCG and in particular, bringing some of these adjacent 
products that Brian referred to, to market. We continue to 
invest in Memory, 
in particularly the 3D XPoint product, and we continue to invest in IoT. So 
those three businesses are getting a disproportionate share of the 
investment, because those are the businesses that we've seen really strong 
growth in 2016 and w
e're counting on continued growth in 2017.
 
The second area, and again, we talked about this a little bit, but we see real 
opportunities in autonomous driving that play to our strengths and our 
capabilities. And we are making step function increase in our i
nvestments to 
position ourselves very well for that industry in that market as it evolves.
 
And then again third, 7
-
nanometer technology investment in the spend 
associated with building a new pilot line in 2017 is also an additional 
investment. So, we're ex
ecuting on our restructuring programs, it was 

 
we 
took out roughly, we made the tough decisions in 2016 that resulted in 
roughly 11,000 fewer people as a result of our restructuring program. We're 
not quite done, but I'd say we're on track. At the same ti
me, we're making 
investments both in technology and people to strengthen and enhance our 
competitive position in the areas that we see as real opportunities for us.
 
Brian M. Krzanich 
-
 
Intel Corp.
 
The only thing I would add, Stacy, is more of a blunt answe
r to your 
question is, if you take a look at the areas that we're talking about, in 
almost every case these are new and expanding TAMs for us.
 
So even when you look at the places where we're going in the Data Center, 
and this was my point earlier about ent
erprise versus cloud. Enterprise is 
now less than 50% of our total makeup for the Data Center Group, and the 
cloud is growing great and that will continue, but if you look at the areas, 
the majority of the rest of the growth for the rest of this decade in 
the Data 
Center alone, it's networking and storage where we have very low market 
share today. But we're bringing things like software
-
defined networking and 
NFV to those and so that's a growing and expanding TAM as those markets 
move to Intel architecture.
 
And then it's going into Rack Scale Design, Omni
-
Path fabric, Silicon 
Photonics, those are all again new either nascent or expanding TAMs for us. 
Autonomous cars and the IoT space are new and expanding TAMs for us. 5G 
is a TAM that's brand new that will b
e really being built out over the rest of 
this decade.
 
And then Memory, if you look at the large part of the investment we're 
making is 3D XPoint, which we will really re
-
architect memory and storage 
and we'll create a new market in our mind and we believe
 
we are unique in 
having that technology.
 
So to me when I look at the investment, they're all focused around data, 
they're all in support of how the data center ecosystem works and they're all 
in either expanding or new TAM or Intel. And so that's why I se
e the growth 
in those areas. It's not just enhancing the technologies that we already 
have. We'll do that, but the new investments are really focused on the new 
areas.

Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of John Pitzer of 
Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.
 
John William Pitzer

Credit Suisse Securities (

A

Yeah. Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for letting me ask the question. Brian, 
my first question, I want to go back to the DCG ASPs in the December 
quarter. They were up 4% year
-
over
-
year, which kind of reverses I think the 
four quarter or five quarter 
trend of ASPs going down.
 
I know that you've had some mixed headwinds that have been driving 
blended ASPs down, I'm kind of curious what happened in the fourth quarter 
to drive ASPs up? And do you think it's sustainable, is this just what we 
would expect t
o see the first quarter of the Broadwell launch and then it 
normalizes going forward? How do you think about ASP's from here?
 
Brian M. Krzanich 
-
 
Intel Corp.
 
John, I'll let Bob start with this and then I'll come in and talk a little bit about 
the macro vie
w of it.
 
Robert Holmes Swan 
-
 
Intel Corp.
 
Yeah. Two dynamics in the fourth quarter where we had higher ASPs. One, 
the continued transition from Haswell to Broadwell, is helpful, and then as 
we project forward, the next transition is Skylake, we believe wil
l be helpful 
as well. So those dynamics where we're delivering better performance for 
our customers, we're able to capture some of that in ASPs, and we saw a 
little bit of that in the fourth quarter.
 
And secondly, in the comms and network space, which is a
 
share gain 
opportunity for us in DSG, getting those clients to move up the stack in 
terms of the high performance server CPUs is the second dynamic, both of 
which we think are helpful as we exit 2016 and go into 2017.
 
Brian M. Krzanich 
-
 
Intel Corp.
 
Yeah.
 
And only thing I'd add, John, is, we'll 

 
as we go back into the second 
half of this year do this Skylake transition, and that is a technology that will 
increase performance and the performance per cost to our customers in one 
of the largest improvements 
in a long time, if not ever, on the data center. 
So we expect 

 
typically when that happens, people see the value in that, 
and they tend to buy up. They tend to buy the better SKUs. So to my view, 
this trend of higher mix should continue.
 
John William Pitz
er 
-
 
Credit Suisse Securities (

That's helpful. And then maybe as my follow
-
up, Brian, relative to the full
-
year guide you're kind of expecting a pretty significant drop in free cash flow 
this yea
r with the increase in CapEx, and you highlighted that CapEx is going 
to the Non
-
Volatile Memory Group. I'm just kind of curious, given that that 
business, even though it made some improvements in losses in the calendar 
fourth quarter, is still in sort of 
a loss position. I'm assuming the higher 
CapEx is going to be a headwind to getting to profitability, but I guess, how 
do you think about the path to profitability, the longer term business model 
in Memory and what it might do to the DCG growth rate longer
 
term if 
XPoint is successful?
 
Brian M. Krzanich 
-
 
Intel Corp.
 
Sure. So let's talk about Memory in kind of a big picture, John, and then I'll 
let Bob talk a little bit about how the CapEx lays and what our view on 
CapEx is in the space.
 
But we are in 
this space for one reason because I understand it's a cyclical 
business that tends to be fairly difficult from a price capacity standpoint. But 
we believe we're coming at it with two very unique technologies. Our 3D 
NAND technology has some of the best per
formance and best cost in the 
market. Our current version of 3D NAND has a 15% cost value over the 
competition, and our next version, second generation, has even a higher 
when you look at it on a density basis.
 
And so we believe we're going to be able to b
ring differential cost and 
performance in 3D NAND that will give us a unique position, and that, 
combined with our knowledge of the data center, should allow us to really 
provide compelling product for data center SSDs. 3D XPoint is very different 
and that
 
is a unique technology that bridges between memory and storage, 
and we believe it can re
-
architect how big data applications, artificial 
intelligence applications where you want large amounts of data being 
brought up as close to the compute as you can, wi
ll really transform not only 
the architecture of those systems but the performance of those systems.
 
And we've demonstrated on stage, even on client systems, using these types 
of SSDs on an equal price you can get 5x to 7x performance improvement 
using 3D 
XPoint as a large memory storage combination. So, we're investing 
purely because we believe we have this differential technology, and that's 
why we're in this business. I think if I didn't have that differential, not sure 
it's a business that Intel would n
ecessarily be in, right? But with that 
leadership, and as we believe we can sustain that leadership, we believe it's 
a good business and a good investment. I'll let Bob talk about and how long 
and how we view the capital.
 
Robert Holmes Swan 
-
 
Intel Corp.
 
J
ohn, the CapEx dynamic 

 
first kind of at the macro level, up $2.5 billion 
year
-
on
-
year, driven by two things. One, Memory obviously, but also 
bringing 10
-
nanometer capacity online. If I just go down a level to Memory, 
roughly $1.6 billion CapEx in 2016. E
xpectation is that it'll be roughly $2.5 
billion in 2017 as we bring the incremental capacity online. And as we look 
at Memory specifically in 2018, we think it begins to drop off a little bit as we 
focus that capacity on 3D NAND and increasingly 3D XPoint
.

rya of Bank 
of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.
 
Vivek Arya 
-
 
Bank of America Merrill Lynch
 
Thanks for taking my question. Brian, I'm curious with this new U.S. 
administration. There's a lot of interest in using U.S.
-
made products. And 
since yo
u have sizable fabs here in the U.S., I'm wondering how you can 
take advantage of this environment, or if you're interested in making a 
bigger push in your foundry business.
 
Brian M. Krzanich 
-
 
Intel Corp.
 
Well, we're always open for business in foundry an
d we're always interested. 
Remember, we said our foundry strategy was really to be on the leading 
edge, so 

 
because we can get paid for our technology. And it really allows 
us to use our unique differentiation in that space.
 
Beyond that, I would just tell
 
you we've always been proud. I mean it's not a 
new transition or new strategy for Intel. We've always been roughly between 

 
a little bit more than half to two
-
thirds of our capacity in the U.S. We're 
the second largest exporter in the U.S. and we're prou
d of that position. But 
other than that, there's no real shift in our strategy right now.
 
Vivek Arya 
-
 
Bank of America Merrill Lynch
 
Got it. And as my follow
-
up, back to DCG. There seem to be two moving 
pieces. You have this declining but very profitable e
nterprise part, but a 
faster growth but perhaps less profitable networking and cloud and other 
areas. Is that fair characterization? And do you envision a point at which the 
non
-
enterprise parts become dominant enough, so you can actually see an 
accelerati
on in DCG back to your traditional double
-
digit type growth rate?
 
Brian M. Krzanich 
-
 
Intel Corp.
 
So let me start and then we can see. I think 

 
our view is that enterprise will 
continue to decline. A lot of that is those workloads moving to the cloud. It 
will get to a point though where it starts to stabilize. And those 

 
because 
there are still things that 

 
workloads that will want to be in a private cloud.
 
At the same time, we believe as the world becomes connected, cloud will 
grow at a much, much faste
r rate. And I made a point in the prepared 
remarks, where if you look at the cloud of today being mostly based on 
people, the average person will generate about 1.5 gig of data a day. An 
autonomous car, when those things start hitting the road 

 
and we've 
started to build these data centers for some of the trials we're working with 

 
I mean you're talking about petabytes of data that you're having to deal 
with and 4,000 gigabytes a day off is the average autonomous car. You put 
a couple of those on the road
 
and you need petabytes of storage to handle 
that. So, we do believe that the cloud will move at a faster rate as these 
connected devices become basically more available. That said, the cloud is 
becoming bigger than the enterprise.
 
We said enterprise is no
w less than 50%, and we believe the other areas 
that will grow, networking and storage, the adjacencies like Omni
-
Path 
fabric, Silicon Photonics, Rack Scale Design, which we're working with our 
partners on, it really lowers the cost of the system and re
-
ar
chitects how the 
Rack is laid out. And 3D XPoint, should dramatically 

 
that will drive the 
growth for us as we go through the rest of this decade. We believe when you 
add those up together, this thing will go back to double
-
digits. When exactly 
that is be
cause it's pretty hard 

 
we're trying to grow these new nascent 
areas and manage the decline of enterprise, going to be hard to call exactly 
when. But we do still have a strong belief, and we believe the products are 
very compelling; that these will drive 
us to double
-
digit growth long
-
term.
 
Robert Holmes Swan 
-
 
Intel Corp.
 
The only thing I'd add, Brian, is on the 

 
on like
-
for
-
like product, ASPs have 
a tendency to be lower to the cloud service providers. But at the same time, 
the cloud service providers re
ally value performance. And in terms of the 
mix of their product, they'll value performance and the higher
-
end products 
more than maybe enterprise as a whole.

Thank you. And our next 
question comes from the line of Romit Shah of 
Nomura. Your line is now open.
 
Romit Shah 
-
 
Instinet, LLC
 
Yes. Thank you. I just had one question. I noticed that you didn't raise the 
dividend in January, and Bob, I'm curious if your view on capital returns, 
buybacks and dividends is different than what Intel has done historically?
 
Robert Holmes Swan 
-
 
Intel Corp.
 
Yeah. I think historically, the philosophy around first and foremost to invest 
it in organically in our capabilities has always been the first prior
ity. That will 
be the same. Secondly, we'll continue to look at M&A that will strengthen our 
capabilities, so that's no different than the past. Third, in terms of capital 
returns, our expectation has been and I think we'll continue to think it this 
way go
ing forward as it relates to dividend, grow it in line with non
-
GAAP 
earnings, and have it be roughly 40% of the free cash flows of the company. 
Those change around the margins over time, depending on the CapEx 
intensity of the business. But I don't expect
 
that to change and we'll 
continue to look at how we move the dividend in line with that philosophy.
 
As I said earlier, in terms of the more holistic capital returns bucket, we will 
continue to offset dilution, which I think is pretty consistent with what 
we've 
done in the past. And then third, we have a great balance sheet and I do 
think that opportunistically when it makes sense, reducing our outstanding 
float is an opportunity we have as we get closer to the net cash zero position 
that we've been trackin
g forward over the last 12 months since the Altera 
acquisition.
 
So philosophically, no dramatic change, dividend in line with non
-
GAAP 
earnings growth, but trying to stay in that roughly 40% free cash flow world. 
And maybe if opportunities present itself, 
be opportunistic in share counts 
without limiting our financial flexibility relative to the things that matter 
most which is strengthening our business.

Okay. And our next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur of JPMorgan. 
Your line is now open.
 
Bill Peterson 
-
 
JPMorgan Securities LLC
 
Yeah. Hi, good 
afternoon. This is Bill Peterson calling for Harlan. 
Congratulations on a nice quarter. Coming back to the storage market, 
trying to understand how you view growth this year in light of obviously 
good sequential growth in the prior quarter, but also overla
ying that with the 
Optane qualifications that are going on in progress. How should we view that 
in terms of a incremental growth driver in 2017?
 
Brian M. Krzanich 
-
 
Intel Corp.
 
Sure. So, if you take a look at it, as I said this is a cyclical market. If you
 
take a look at 2016, it started out with an over
-
supply, came into the back 
half of the year with an under
-
supply really of capacity. We're entering 2017 
with the continued tightness in supply. That makes pricing stable to better. 
So we expect that at lea
st right now the estimates are through the first half. 
It's pretty hard to project out through the second half, and so we've kind of 
kept the second half relatively calm and cautious.
 
If you take a look at 3D XPoint, as we said, we've qualified. We've star
ted to 
ship DIMM samples to the big cloud service guys. Those are targeted for 
2018 revenue shipments on an SSD basis. We'll start shipping for revenue 
this quarter. And if you take a look at the full year, I think the estimate is 
it's around 10% of our to
tal revenue is 3D XPoint.
 
And you know, that'll be, it could take off and it could be a little bit more 
than that. It could take a little while to qualify some things if it's a little off. 
But you should think it's around 10% of the revenue, and really ram
ping 
much, much more into 2018. What we're proud of is you get past that first 
hurdle of getting the first one to production ready and starting to ship 
samples to their cloud guys and actually getting ready to start shipping 
SSDs for revenue to the client 
devices and all that. We're pretty excited 
about just getting to that point right now with 3D XPoint.

And just a little more tactical, the full
-
year for Memory
 
was down 1% 2016 
over 2015, but the momentum that you saw is that supply chain dynamic 
that Brian highlighted changed. And as we began to scale our own 
capabilities, you saw the strong exit growth of 25% in the fourth quarter. So 
with that going into 2017
, we feel pretty good about that growth rate in the 
fourth quarter as we enter the new year.

Great. Appreciate the color on that. Maybe a question on the Programmable 
Solutions. The group has shown sequential decline
s in the prior two quarters 
versus your main competitor that has shown sequential growth, albeit 
modestly. You discussed taking share, and now you have the 14
-
nanometer 
based product. Wonder if you could provide some color on maybe why that 
group has lagge
d in the prior few quarters. But more importantly, when we 
should see the inflection in the business and how to think about growth in 
that business this year.
 
Brian M. Krzanich

Intel Corp.
 
Yeah. So let's talk about that. If I look at 2016, as we 
showed, we had about 
7% growth over what Altera had in 2015. If you take a look at it, there's a 
couple of big segments that are driving that, telco, data center. And we're 
starting to see and in the networking space as well. Those are the big three 
segmen
ts. And where we started to see, as we went through especially the 
back half of the year, good connection between our ability to go in, and 
we're better together with Xeon and the FPGA as we go into that networking 
space. So again, as our footprint grows i
n networking and storage, I think it 
also gives us an ability to continue to bring both products to those markets. 
So we think in 2016, we actually gained share relative to the competition.
 
As we look out into 2017, we forecasted again above market growth 
from 
what we understand of the current estimates, and we believe we'll gain a 
little bit of share again in 2017. And remember, these markets are slow 
moving. You don't grow 10% share instantly because the design cycles and 
design conversions are relatively
 
difficult. It's again driven by data center, 
networking and the Telco industry. And with Stratix 10 as we said, largest 
design enablements in the history of Altera. So we're really excited. We 
believe it brings a performance and a cost to our customers th
at is truly 
industry
-
leading and shifting.
 
And so we are very comfortable or confident in that; but again, that will 
really start to ship in the second half of 2017. And so I think that will be 
really driving growth in 2018. And really, if you think about 
these design 
cycles, that product will really continue to drive growth for probably the next 
three years plus just because these cycles are fairly long.

Thank you. And Chanel, please go ahead and introduce our last questioner.

No problem. Our next question comes from the line of Blayne Curtis of 
Barclays. Your line is now open.

Barclays Capital, I

Hey, guys. Thanks for squeezing me in. I just want to ask Bob on the gross 
margin, your full
-
year is equal to the Q1. Just maybe as you look into the 
back half, I just wanted to make sure I heard it straight. It sounded like 14
-
nanometer on the server 
side may have some initial yield, and that would be 
headwind. But I'm just curious on the PC client as well. If you could just talk 
about the puts and takes as you ramp in 10
-
nanometer but you still ship a 
lot of 14
-
nanometer? What are the headwinds and ta
ilwinds to gross 
margin?
 
Robert Holmes Swan 
-
 
Intel Corp.
 
Yeah. The two tailwinds on the year
-
on
-
year flat are ASPs being a little bit 
better, and we anticipate that more on the DCG side. Secondly, unit cost 
being a little bit better, and we anticipate tha
t more on the CCG side. And 
again, as I mentioned earlier, for DCG as we transition more from 22
-
nanometer to 14
-
nanometer, all else equal, that will be a little bit of a 
headwind in the early stages of yield for server on 14
-
nanometer.
 
The headwinds parti
cularly are strong growth coming from memory and 
modem. So, those two dynamics themselves, good growth increasing 
profitability, good earnings. However, they are at a lower margins so the mix 
dynamic of those are real on a year
-
over
-
year basis. So good ASP
, good unit 
costs but mix is a challenge. And then year
-
on
-
year, factory ramp both 10
-
nanometer and memory are a headwind for the full
-
year, but it gets a little 
bit better in the second half, the dynamic to the first half, second half; it 
gets a little bi
t better in the second half.

Thanks. And then just maybe a clarification, the $3 billion you're getting 
from the sale, should I assume that that goes to debt retirement like you 
have been using your cash flow? And I g
uess you should get at some point 
this year potentially the end of the year to that net cash zero, should we 
think about buybacks at that point?
 
Robert Holmes Swan 
-
 
Intel Corp.
 
I think the dynamics of the $3 billion, the intention is that roughly $1 billi
on 
comes in line at time of transaction, and that there's, we will provide our 
financing in the early stages, so we'll only get roughly $1 billion upfront. In 
terms of then just the net debt position during the course of the year, you 
can assume that we ha
ve some maturities in 2015 that will take out, sorry 
2017, that will take out, and we believe by the end of the year, given those 
dynamics, will be closer to a net cash zero position.
 
In term of that, that gives us the much stronger balance sheet and how w
e 
think about that, we'll continue, as I said earlier, invest in business, return 
capital to shareholders, and opportunistically, whether it's reducing 
outstanding flow, that's one that we'll continue to look at, and be 
opportunistic as opportunities prese
nt themselves.

Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Intel Corporation first 
quarter earnings conference call. At this time, all participants are in a listen
-
only mode. Later, we will conduct a question
-
and
-
answer session, and 
instructions will follow at that time. And as a reminder, this conference may 
be recorded.
 
I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Mark Henninger, Head of 
Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.
 
Mark H. Henninger

Intel Corp.
 
Thank you, operat
or, and welcome, everyone, to Intel's first quarter 2018 
earnings conference call. By now you should have received a copy of our 
earnings release and the CFO earnings presentation that goes along with it. 
If you've not received both documents, they're avai
lable on our investor 
website, intc.com. The CFO earnings presentation is also available in the 
webcast window for those joining us online.
 
I'm joined today by Brian Krzanich, our CEO, and Bob Swan, our Chief 
Financial Officer. In a moment, we'll hear brie
f remarks from both of them, 
followed by Q&A.
 
Before we begin, let me remind everyone that today's discussion contains 
forward
-
looking statements based on the environment as we currently see 
it, and as such, does include risk and uncertainties. Please refe
r to our press 
release for more information on the specific risk factors that could cause 
actual results to differ materially.
 
A brief reminder that this quarter we have provided both GAAP and non
-
GAAP financial measures. Today we will be speaking to the n
on
-
GAAP 
financial measures when describing our consolidated results. The CFO 
earnings presentation and earnings release, available on intc.com, include 
the full GAAP and non
-
GAAP reconciliations.
 
With that, let me hand it over to Brian.

Thanks, Mark.
 
Coming off a record 2017, 2018 is off to an exceptionally strong start. Q1 
was Intel's best first quarter ever and significantly exceeded the 
expectations we set in January. Our Client Computing Group continued to 
execute well, p
roducing growth within a declining PC market. And our 
transformation to a data
-
centric company accelerated, with our data
-
centric 
businesses, including McAfee, up 25% over the first quarter of last year.
 
The strength of Intel's business underscores my conf
idence in our strategy. 
What we're seeing is an unrelenting demand for compute performance, 
driven by the continuing growth of data and the need to process, analyze, 
store, and share that data. That dynamic benefits our traditional CPU 
business, and it rei
nforces the big bets we've made in memory, modems, 
FPGAs, and autonomous vehicles. We're competing to win in our largest 
collection of addressable markets ever. And importantly, we're not just 
competing in these markets. We're leading and shaping them, as 
our first 
quarter results demonstrate.
 
Data Center Group revenue was up 24% year over year. We saw broad
-
based demand strength across all DCG segments in Q1. And customer 
preference for high
-
performance products, including Xeon Scalable, drove a 
richer ASP
 
mix. The cloud segment grew 45%. And in the comm service 
provider segment, we continued to take share and grew revenue 33%, as 
customers chose IA
-
based solutions to virtualize and transform their 
networks as the industry prepares for the 5G transition.
 
In
tel's presence at the Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang was a powerful 
showcase of our 5G capability. Intel and KT deployed the world's largest 5G 
network to date, including more than 20 5G links, delivering 3,800 terabytes 
of network capacity. We've establis
hed leadership in 5G. And when 
commercial networks begin deploying around 2019, we'll be there with 
industry
-
leading products, from the core of the data center to the edge to 
mobile devices.
 
And we also saw growth in our enterprise segments for the second 
consecutive quarter, as macro strength continued and customers prioritized 
hybrid and on
-
premises infrastructure investments.
 
Data center customers are also looking to FPGAs for workload acceleration. 
The Programmable Solutions Group again set a record for
 
design win 
volume, and those design wins are translating directly into revenue. PSG's 
business grew 17% in Q1 on data center and embedded strength along with 
last
-
time buys. PSG's data center segment was up 150% over last year. And 
the advanced products c
ategory, our 28, 20 and 14
-
nanometer solutions, 
grew more than 40%.
 
Microsoft also recently announced that they're using Intel's FPGAs to power 
new Bing Intelligent Search features using real
-
time AI. PSG's momentum is 
evidence that our 2016 acquisition of
 
Altera is delivering value for our 
customers and contributing directly to Intel's growth.
 
Our IOTG [Internet of Things Group] business grew 17% on record unit 
volume, with continuing momentum in the retail and video segments, as 
compute increasingly moves
 
to the edge. Consistent with our commitment to 
be disciplined with our resources, we made the decision to divest Wind River 
and sharpen the focus of IOTG on other growth opportunities that more 
closely align to our strategy.
 
The memory business set a reve
nue record, growing 20% in the first 
quarter, crossing over the $1 billion mark in revenue. The last business that 
passed that mark was DCG, crossing over that mark over a decade ago. 
Both yields and output in our Dalian factory continue to ramp ahead of 
s
chedule. In fact, we believe the Dalian fab expansion is one of the fastest 
brownfield wafer starts projects in memory industry history.
 
We also launched our first mainstream Optane SSDs for clients, known as 
the 800 Series, driving further industry adopti
on of this revolutionary 
technology. The NSG remains on track to be profitable for the full year.
 
And we continued to demonstrate momentum in autonomous driving, and 
I'm happy to report that the Intel Mobileye autonomous vehicle test fleet has 
begun to ope
rate in Israel and will expand to other geographies in the 
coming months. Our fleet fully implements the Responsible
-
Sensitive Safety 
system, or RSS, that we introduced last year. This unique system applies a 
formal common
-
sense safety seal to the vehicle'
s decision
-
making, resulting 
in the optimal combination of provable safety and human
-
like driving style.
 
We believe that the winning path to autonomous driving will be a 
progression from ADAS capabilities to full autonomous driving. And we're 
seeing signif
icant momentum in the marketplace, including a recent high
-
volume design win for EyeQ5 with a European premium vehicle 
manufacturer.
 
And finally, the Client Computing Group extended its strong track record of 
execution in a challenging PC environment. Reve
nue was up 3% despite a 
declining PC TAM, on strength in the commercial and enthusiast segments, 
leading to a strong Core mix. The CCG launched its first
-
ever i9 processors 
for laptops in the first quarter, again demonstrating our outright product 
leadersh
ip.
 
We continue to make progress on our 10
-
nanometer process. We are 
shipping in low volume and yields are improving, though the rate of 
improvement is slower than we anticipated. As a result, volume production is 
moving from the second half of 2018 into 2
019. We understand the yield 
issues and have defined improvements for them, but they will take time to 
implement and qualify. We have leadership products on the roadmap that 
continue to take advantage of 14
-
nanometer, with Whiskey Lake for clients 
and Casc
ade Lake for the data center coming later this year.
 
Moore's Law is central to our strategy and our product leadership. It 
continues to create significant value for Intel and our customers. While it's 
taking longer and costing more to deliver and yield adv
anced process 
technologies, we are able to optimize our process and products within the 
node to deliver meaningful performance improvements.
 
For example, 14
-
nanometer process optimizations and architectural 
improvements have resulted in performance gains o
f more than 70% since 
the first 14
-
nanometer products were launched. We combine these advances 
in manufacturing technology and architecture to produce truly leadership 
products. And it's that product leadership that ultimately matters most to 
our customers
 
and end users.
 
Intel and the industry stepped up to a tough challenge as we responded to 
the security vulnerabilities known as Spectre and Meltdown. I'm pleased with 
our progress and proud of how Intel and industry partners addressed this 
issue collaborat
ively with transparency and with customer
-
first urgency. 
We're delivering against our security
-
first pledge and we've now rolled out 
micro code
-
based mitigations for all Intel products launched over the last 
nine years that require protection against Spect
re and Meltdown. We'll also 
begin delivering both client and data center products with hardware
-
based 
mitigations later this year.
 
With our data center transformation accelerating, we're raising our 
expectations for our full
-
year results, yet more 
evidence that our strategy is 
working. As Intel marks its 50th anniversary, we're well positioned to be the 
end
-
to
-
end platform provider for the new data world and a leader in artificial 
intelligence and the autonomous revolution.
 
With that, let me hand it
 
over to Bob.
 
Robert Holmes Swan

Intel Corp.
 
Thanks, Brian.
 
Q1 was truly an outstanding start to 2018. Our transformation to a data
-
centric company continues to build momentum. Revenue was a first quarter 
record at $16.1 billion, up 13% year over year. O
perating income was $4.8 
billion, up 21% year over year, and EPS at $0.87 was up 32% year over 
year. From a capital allocation perspective, we generated $6.3 billion of cash 
flow from operations and returned $3.3 billion to shareholders in the form of 
buyb
acks and dividends.
 
As a result of the strength we are seeing in the business, we are raising our 
full
-
year revenue guide by $2.5 billion to $67.5 billion. We're raising our EPS 
guide by $0.30 to $3.85, and we're raising our free cash flow guide by $1.5 
bi
llion to $14.5 billion.
 
Our Q1 results demonstrated continued momentum in our transformation 
from a PC
-
centric company to a data
-
centric company. Intel's data
-
centric 
businesses were up 25% collectively, with each business individually growing 
double digit
s. Our data
-
centric businesses are now approaching 50% of our 
revenue, an all
-
time high. Our PC
-
centric business was up 3% on strength in 
notebook, desktop, and modem. DCG's strong cash flows fund Intel's 
investments in new data
-
centric growth.
 
As a remind
er, we adopted a new revenue recognition standard in Q1. The 
new standard drove $462 million in incremental Q1 revenue recognition. 
This predominantly affected CCG and NSG. By year end, we expect roughly 
half of this to net out.
 
Moving to Q1 earnings, we g
enerated significant EPS expansion in the 
quarter, up 32% year on year. Our non
-
GAAP EPS improvement was driven 
by strong top line growth, a 3
-
point improvement in operating margins, and 
an 11
-
point reduction in our effective tax rate. The 3
-
point improvem
ent in 
operating margins were driven by a 4
-
point reduction in spending, partially 
offset by a 1
-
point decline in gross margin. The 1
-
point decline in gross 
margin was driven by growth in our adjacencies, which have lower gross 
margins than our CPU product
s. From a spending standpoint, versus last 
year, we delivered $1.3 billion more revenue on $200 million less spending.
 
As a second reminder, we adopted a new mark
-
to
-
market standard for our 
equity investments. In 2017, all realized gains and losses were re
corded in 
our non
-
GAAP results. But in 2018, all mark
-
to
-
market adjustments flow 
through earnings. In an effort to eliminate volatility, we have excluded these 
adjustments from our non
-
GAAP results. Our Q1 GAAP EPS included 
approximately $0.13 for mark
-
to
-
market gains in our ICAP portfolio that 
were excluded from our non
-
GAAP results.
 
We are also making excellent progress on our operating efficiencies. In 
January, we pulled in our 30% spending goal from 2020 to 2019, and we're 
off to a good start in 2018. T
otal spending was down 4% year over year in 
the quarter. R&D spending as a percentage of revenue was down 
approximately 2 points. And our SG&A costs were down over 2 points.
 
Our intensity on spending is designed to accelerate top line growth, and it is 
pay
ing off. Currently, as a result of strong top line growth, we now expect to 
meet our 30% spending target in 2018, two years ahead of our original 
expectations.
 
Let me touch briefly on our Q1 performance by segment. The Data Center 
Group delivered a great q
uarter, much better than expected. DCG revenue 
of $5.2 billion was up 24% year over year, and operating income of $2.6 
billion grew 75%. Q1 operating margin was 50%. Overall, unit volume was 
up 16% and ASPs were up 7%.
 
We saw broad
-
based demand strength in
 
Q1, with customer preference for 
high
-
performance products driving richer ASPs. Cloud and comm service 
provider segments were greater than 60% of the data center business. And 
this was the first quarter our cloud business has surpassed $2 billion in 
reven
ue, which made it our largest segment in the first quarter.
 
Additionally, we redefined our expanded TAM for DCG to markets beyond the 
CPU, like silicon photonics, fabric, network ASICs, and 3D XPoint memory. 
These adjacent businesses are gaining traction a
nd grew 16% year over 
year. DCG performance in all segments was better than our January 
forecast, and we expect that strength to continue to aid DCG momentum 
through the second quarter.
 
Our additional data
-
centric businesses, IOTG, NSG, and PSG, are becomi
ng a 
larger component of our overall business, growing 18% year over year in the 
quarter. Our Internet of Things business achieved revenue of $840 million, 
growing 17% year over year, driven by strength in video and continued 
momentum in retail. Operating 
profit was $227 million, up 116% year over 
year, on higher revenue and lower spending, as we shifted our ADAS 
investments to Mobileye. As you heard from Brian, the Mobileye business is 
going strong. Q1 revenue was $151 million. And while it's early in the 
journey, we are on track to our deal thesis.
 
Our memory business broke $1 billion in quarterly revenue for the first time, 
up 20% year over year, with strong demand for data center SSD solutions. 
We reduced our operating losses by $48 million, with strong 
gigabyte 
demand and unit cost reductions more than offsetting ASP reductions.
 
The transition to 64L 3D NAND is improving our cost while we invest in and 
expand our Dalian factory. We expect the second half of 2018 to be balanced 
between supply and demand, 
and we continue to expect this segment to be 
profitable for the full year of 2018.
 
The Programmable Solutions Group had revenue of $498 million, with 17% 
growth, driven by strength in data center and the embedded segments. 
Operating profit was $97 million,
 
up 5% year over year. The PSG team 
continues to perform and execute well. Our advanced FPGA products, those 
at 28, 20, and 14
-
nanometer, grew over 40% in the quarter. In fact, PSG 
won more customer designs in Q1 than in any prior quarter.
 
Finally, the Cli
ent Computing Group had another strong quarter. Revenues of 
$8.2 billion were up 3%, and operating margins were down 4 points due to 
10
-
nanometer transition costs and growth in our modem business. Our PC
-
centric business continues to perform well in a chal
lenging but improving 
market and serves as a significant source of cash flow for the company. We 
saw strength in the commercial and gaming businesses, and we believe the 
worldwide PC supply chain is operating at healthy levels.
 
We've laid out our capital a
llocation priorities: invest organically; expand 
acquisitively; and return capital to our shareholders and do it wisely. We 
continued to execute to these priorities. We generated $6.3 billion in cash 
from operations. This included $1.7 billion in cash rece
ived from NAND 
customer supply agreements. We invested $2.9 billion in CapEx and 
delivered $3.4 billion in free cash flow, up 73% year over year. We returned 
almost 100% of free cash flow to our shareholders in the form of $1.9 billion 
in buybacks and $1.4
 
billion in dividends, a 10% increase per share over last 
year.
 
Now moving to our full
-
year outlook, our strategy is working and our 
investments are paying off. We are now forecasting the midpoint of the 
revenue range at $67.5 billion, up $2.5 billion vers
us our expectations in 
January. We expect operating margin of approximately 31%, up 1 point 
from January, as spending as a percent of revenue drops to approximately 
30%. Versus prior estimates, gross margin will be approximately flat, as 
broad
-
based streng
th in our business is offset by the higher costs associated 
with the 10
-
nanometer volume production shift to 2019. We now expect a 
full
-
year tax rate of 13%, 1 point down versus our prior estimates.
 
Overall, stronger top line growth, improved operating mar
gins, and a lower 
tax rate will boost EPS to $3.85, up $0.30 versus prior estimates.
 
From a cash flow perspective, we are increasing our free cash flow to $14.5 
billion, up $1.5 billion from January. We now expect net capital deployed of 
approximately $12.
5 billion, up $500 million versus the expectations we set 
in January. This reflects gross CapEx of approximately $14.5 billion, offset 
by approximately $2 billion of customer prepayments for memory supply 
agreements.
 
In Q2, we expect strong growth to conti
nue. We are forecasting the midpoint 
of the revenue range at $16.3 billion, up 10% year over year. We expect 
operating margin of approximately 30%, up 1 point versus last year, which 
reflects approximately 1.5
-
point decrease in gross margin and a 2.5 to 3
-
point decline in spending. We expect EPS of $0.85, up 31%, excluding equity 
adjustments, from strong top line growth, spending reductions, and a lower 
tax rate.
 
To sum it up, we believe 2018 will be another record year for Intel. We've 
met and exceeded our
 
financial commitments, and we feel great about 
where we are relative to our 3
-
year plan. Our PC
-
centric team keeps winning 
in a challenging market and our data
-
centric businesses are growing fast, 
fueling Intel's transformation to a company that powers th
e cloud and smart 
connected devices.
 
With that, let me turn it over to Mark, and we'll get to your questions.

one follow

first questioner.

Thank you. And the first question will come from the line of Ross Seymore

Hi, guys. Thanks for letting me ask a question and congrats on the strong 
results. Brian, one for you about the sustainability of this demand, 
specifically on the data center
 
side. I think people are pretty aware that the 
macroeconomic drivers are all going the right way, and that's helping the 
enterprise side of things. But the acceleration of the cloud on the comm side 
for the last two quarters is beating your own expectatio
ns for growth rates 
and have been quite strong. How much of that do you believe is Intel
-
specific, and if you can go into the reasons why, or is the macro side really 
the bigger driver on those two vectors as well?
 
Brian M. Krzanich 
-
 
Intel Corp.
 
Sure, Ros
s. That's a good question. Let me try to answer it. So the first 
thing I'd tell you is that there is a bit here that the transition to cloud 
continues to occur. It's occurring at a bit even faster rate, so that you do see 
that trend going on. Remember, we'
ve always talked about that over the 
long haul you have to look at these a bit. It can sometimes be lumpy. So our 
forecast for the long term is still in that high teens, low 20s range for that 
kind of growth.
 
We thought that enterprise is clearly up. We th
ink that, as you said, a lot of 
that is reinvigoration of investments by companies in onsite data. Our view 
of the long term there, as I look out over the long term again, it's still that 
should be in a declining mode versus moving those workloads long ter
m 
over to the cloud.
 
So, if I take a look at this, as Bob said in his prepared remarks, if I look at 
our data
-
centric businesses in general, so even just beyond the data center, 
we see these growing in that mid to high teens range. And that's how we 
view t
his, and we do believe that is sustainable. And it will move from cloud 
to enterprise. And sometimes you'll see IoT pick up a bit and offset 
something, but that's why we grouped those into that data
-
centric, but 
they're all really tied together. It's data 
coming from the edge, moving 
through the network into the data center, and really being based in the 
cloud and analytics being applied to it, and people using that data then to 
make decisions or drive businesses. So we think it's sustainable in the data
-
ce
ntric numbers that you saw, but it will float between those various 
segments.
 
Robert Holmes Swan

The only thing, Ross, that I would add is in terms of our outlook in the more 
near term, our outlook for the year is continued strength into the 
second 
quarter, similar to the first quarter. But beyond that, it's probably a little 
cloudier. I think we are benefiting from global macroeconomic environments. 
I think the higher earnings and the ability to deduct IT
-
related expenditures 
I think has give
n CIOs a little more money to spend. And we see ourselves 
benefiting from that through the first half of the year. Second half is going to 
be a little bit of a wait
-
and
-
see as to whether the short
-
term dynamics 
continue into the second half.
 
But if you go 
back to Brian's comments, I think what we do know is this 
increased demand for compute data, analytics, storage, rapid retrieval is 
what's really driving the demand for high
-
performance compute. And not 
only do we see the unit volume strength, but also the
 
ASP strength, which 
we think is a function of Intel
-
related products.
 
Ross C. Seymore 
-
 
Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
 
That's very helpful. For my follow
-
up question, for either of you, frankly, on 
the 10
-
nanometer pushout, do you believe that the competi
tive lead you 
have versus your competition is shrinking, or is this a challenge everybody is 
going to have? And then the gross margin side of that equation, Bob, you 
said it was going to be a headwind into the full
-
year guide. Any sort of 
linearity about w
hen that starts to move from being a headwind to a tailwind 
would be great. Thanks.
 
Brian M. Krzanich 
-
 
Intel Corp.
 
Sure, Ross. So let me start with we absolutely have product and process 
leadership. We're shipping 10
-
nanometer products today. So I did wan
t to 
make sure that that was very clear to you, and those are the densest, 
highest performing products out there.
 
We're slowing the ramp down as we go and fix these yields, and we're able 
to do that. A), we understand the yield issues. They're really tied 
to this 
being the last technology tied to not having EUV and the amount of multi
-
patterning and the effects of that on defects. But also, the real strength of 
14
-
nanometer, I mentioned in my prepared remarks that we've done 70% 
improvements in the performa
nce of that technology over its current 
lifetime. And we believe it continues to have legs, that we can continue to 
make improvements, both within that process technology and 
architecturally. That's really giving us the breathing room to go and make 
these 
yield improvements.
 
So it's really balancing between delivering the world's best products. So we 
believe our roadmap for 2018 is as strong or stronger than it's ever been. 
And we have the ability to carry that into 2019, allowing us to get the yields 
where
 
we want them to be. So the cost and the spending are really in line 
with what you as a shareholder expect from us.
 
We believe that if you take a look at others during this timeframe, if you 
looked at anybody else and said 70% improvement on a technology n
ode, 
they may rename those nodes as we go through this. And we have always 
chosen to be really transparent and clean and just say it's improvements on 
the existing technology rather than renaming. So we believe we have that.
 
Now as we look out in time, we 
do see the density. If you just take that 
component, the density gap is narrowing a bit, but that's out in time. But 
again, performance is really a function of multiple parts of the process 
around power and performance and in architecture. And that's why w
e think 
our products continue to lead and be the world's standard.
 
Robert Holmes Swan

Intel Corp.
 
And on the gross margin question, the strong both volume and ASP 
performance in the first quarter contributed to gross margins being 2 points 
ahead of our e
xpectations at the beginning of the year, so we saw that real 
good performance on the top line flowing through in the first quarter.
 
What we indicated for the full year, though, there's no change in our full
-
year gross margin. That essentially is a functio
n of continued volume and 
ASP strength, but partially offset by yields that are improving but not quite 
at the rate that we had anticipated on 10
-
nanometer. And secondly, our 
costs associated with 

 
we expected at the end of the year that we'll have 
pre
-
PR
Q reserves that will be a little bit higher as we shift into 2019. So 
strong first quarter, strong for the full year, but those 10
-
nanometer costs 
will be a little bit of a drag.
 
When we step back, we still look at gross margins for the full year that are 
at the high end of our historical range, in the 60% to 65% range, which is 
good. And for us, that's despite the fact that we're getting really solid growth 
from our lower
-
margin but earnings
-
accretive businesses like modem and 
memory. Thanks, Ross.

Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon with 
Bernstein Research. Your line is now open.
 
Stacy Aaron Rasgon

Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC
 
Hi, guys. Thanks for 
taking my questions. I wanted to follow up on that 10
-
nanometer point. So as the volume production pushes out into 2019, given 
you understand the yield issue supposedly, is this a first half pushout, or 
does it push out into the second half? And when it ac
tually does ramp, do 
you think it actually will be the current 10
-
nanometer process that's 
shipping, or will that be slipping out to 10
-
nanometer plus potentially?
 
Brian M. Krzanich 
-
 
Intel Corp.
 
So I'm just going to correct you. You said that supposedly w
e have the 
solutions. We do understand these, and so we do have confidence that we 
can go and work these issues, Stacy. Right now, like I said, we are shipping. 
We're going to start that ramp as soon as we think the yields are in line. So 
I said 2019. We d
idn't say first or second half, but we'll do it as quickly as 
we can based on the yield.
 
The last part of your question about whether will it be a 10 or 10
-
plus
-
plus 
or 10
-
plus I think was your question, the yield improvements that we're 
making are just th
at, more focused on yield. So think of them as 
improvements to the various edge stuff, the lithography stuff, thin cleans 
(33:54) and things like that in order to really drive the multi
-
patterning and, 
in some cases, multi
-
multi
-
patterning, where you have 
four, five, six layers 
of patterning to produce a feature. It's really about that. They aren't 
necessarily around performance.
 
We do have plans on 10
-
nanometer already, similar to 14
-
nanometer, for 
10
-
plus and 10
-
plus
-
plus. And so we think all of these tec
hnologies now 
have multiple years of performance improvements built into them as they 
come off the floor.
 
Stacy Aaron Rasgon

Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC
 
Thank you. For my follow
-
up, I wanted to ask about gross margin drivers 
and free cash flow drivers
 
into 2019. We have CapEx pretty significantly 
outpacing depreciation at the moment. You'll have that 10
-
nanometer ramp 
starting. Memory and modems are probably going to be growing. And then 
on the free cash flow side, we've got the reversal potentially of
 
the NAND 
prepayment eventually as you start shipping the NAND that you've been 
paid for. How do we think about the drivers, gross margin puts and takes 
around those elements and maybe others as we go through 

 
get into 2019?
 
Robert Holmes Swan 
-
 
Intel Cor
p.
 
First, I'll probably not dwell a whole lot on 2019 as we focus on trying to 
execute what we believe will be an outstanding 2018. But I think there are a 
few dynamics that we've been wrestling with. As you know, over the last 
couple years, we've seen a g
ap between earnings and cash flow, and it's 
really been driven by a couple things. One, success, and by that, I mean 
accelerating rates of growth and the additional capital that goes along with 
that growth, both CapEx and inventory levels. So those have be
en one of 
the drivers. Secondly, we've brought on 10
-
nanometer equipment but 
haven't necessarily put it to use yet, so that's a cash driver without an 
impact on earnings. And third, memory is in the investment phase. So those 
three things have really been 
what's driving the gap.
 
And we've done a few things in light of that that you're aware of. One, 
memory, we engaged in the strategic supply agreements that you 
mentioned, which really for us is a sign that our customers are excited and 
committed to the tech
nologies that we're building such that we can help 

 
we can use their money to help fund the scaling of the business. And we 
think that's a good positive short, medium, and long
-
term move.
 
And the other thing, just if you think about, Stacy, how we guided 
this year, 
you have earnings. If you don't give us credit for the ICAP gains last year 
and strip that out, you see earnings growth. That's roughly 25% 

 
26%. And 
you see free cash flow growth that's in the mid
-
30s. So you'll start to see 
that gap narrowing
 
as we go through the course of this year.
 
And then the other thing is we're going to make a fairly significant cash tax 
payment in 2018 as a result of the ICAP gains from last year, and that's 
roughly $1.2 billion that's going to weigh on our cash flows t
his year. If you 
strip that out for a second, what you see during the course of 2018 is 
roughly 25% earnings growth and roughly 50% free cash flow growth. And 
that gap begins to narrow while we're accelerating the growth rate of the 
business.
 
So those are 
the dynamics in terms of how we're deploying capital for 
accelerating top line growth and the improvements on free cash flow relative 
to earnings per share this year. As we get through the course of 2018, we'll 
start to shed a little more light on what tha
t means for 2019 later in the 
year.

Citigrou
p. Your line is now open.
 
Christopher Brett Danely 
-
 
Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
 
Hey. Thanks, guys. I guess another question on the manufacturing. Can you 
just talk about why the ramp in 10
-
nanometer or why the yields have been a 
little bit slower than 
expected? Have there been any changes in 
manufacturing? And then also, should we expect this to extend to future 
generations as well; i.e., a little bit slower than it had been in the past?
 
Brian M. Krzanich 
-
 
Intel Corp.
 
Sure, so the issues around 10
-
nano
meter, I'm trying to lay that flat out 
without getting too deep into the technology. But this is the last technology 
that doesn't incorporate EUV. And what you also need to understand is that 
we took very aggressive goals at 10 nanometers. So if you talk a
bout the 
scaling factor or think about it as the multiple at which you shrink a feature, 
we took a target of 2.7. So you took any feature and run over 2.7 is the 
dimensional shrink that you did to this device. For example, on 14
-
nanometer, we took a target
 
of 2.4, so you're almost 10% more aggressive 
on 10 nanometers.
 
And if you look at what is the industry standard, what the foundries and 
other players are typically doing, they're typically in that 1.5 to 2.0 range. 
So there, we're maybe 20% more aggressiv
e. So it's very aggressive goals 
to hit our cost targets and where we want the technology to be. And that 
combined with the end of life of the immersion scanner before we hit EUV 
has just created something that's a little bit more difficult.
 
So that's why 
I have the confidence that this is not something we're 
shipping. The transistors work. We know the performance is in line. So it's 
really just about getting the defects and the costs in line to where we want.
 
As far as what does that imply for future techn
ologies, we made a lot of 
changes at 7 nanometers. 7
-
nanometer currently is the first technology 
forecasted to implement EUV, so that immediately makes the lithography 
system different. We're going back to a more standard, for us, compaction 
number of 2.4,
 
so that makes it a little bit easier. We think we bit off a little 
too much in this case. And it may not seem like a lot, but 10% can make a 
lot of difference in this kind of a world.
 
And thirdly, we are using some very unique packaging 
technologies and such 
that allow us. At 7 nanometers and beyond, we're really moving to a world 
where you're not going to look at any piece of silicon as being a single node. 
You're going to use what we're going to call heterogeneous techniques that 
allow 
us to use silicon for multiple nodes. So you may use cores from 7 
nanometers and IP from 14 nanometers and even as far back as 22 
nanometers for the parts that don't need the high performance. And we're 
able to put those together and make them perform and 
behave like a single 
piece of silicon in the package. So really 7 nanometers is quite a bit 
different, and so I think as a result, we don't expect to see these kinds of 
impacts on 7 nanometers.
 
Christopher Brett Danely

Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
 
Grea
t. For my follow
-
up, I know in the presentation, you mentioned that 
adjacency ramps will be responsible for some of the gross margins being 
down in Q2. Does that have any impact on gross margin for the rest of the 
year, or are you assuming that data center
 
growth is going to slow down in 
the second half of the year, and that's another reason why the gross margin 
hasn't moved up, or is it entirely the 10
-
nanometer issue?
 
Robert Holmes Swan 
-
 
Intel Corp.
 
No, it's maybe all three. First, we do expect the adjac
encies throughout the 
course of the year to continue to grow faster than the rest of the business, if 
you will, so that will have a compression effect throughout the course of the 
year. Secondly, yes, 10
-
nanometer will be a headwind. And third, for data 
ce
nter growth, while we're expecting strong growth through the first half of 
the year, the second half of the year implied in our guidance is a 
deceleration.
 
If you put it in the context of the updated guide, we have data
-
centric 
growth going from mid
-
teens 
to higher teens. And you can attribute virtually 
all of that to DCG because obviously it's the biggest component. But we do 
expect there to be deceleration for DCG growth from first half to second half 
for sure. We hope we're wrong, but where we sit right 
now, we see the 
trends continuing into Q2. But we'll have tougher comps. We'll have tougher 
competition going into the second half. And we're going to wait to July to see 
how we see the trends we've experienced through the first four months of 
the year pla
y out for the second half.

e is now open.
 
Chris Caso 
-
 
Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
 
Yes, thanks for letting me ask a question. Just the first question is on CapEx 
that's been coming up a bit. If you could, talk a little bit about the 
incremental growth in CapEx, what that's asso
ciated with. And are there any 
CapEx effects associated with the changes in the ramp of 10
-
nanometer?
 
Robert Holmes Swan 
-
 
Intel Corp.
 
Just the CapEx that we took up, $0.5 billion is really a function of the 
incremental $2.5 billion of revenue. So, Chris, 
when we came into the year, 
we guided a larger CapEx of roughly $10.5 billion, and we had full
-
year 
revenue of $65 billion. So we've taken $65 billion up to $67.5 billion. That's 
going to require roughly $0.5 billion additional CapEx for the second half of
 
the year and as we go into 2019. So it's the best I've ever felt about a 
CapEx increase. And it's a result of $2.5 billion more revenue. And net the 
CapEx increase, as we indicated, we'll generate an additional $1.5 billion of 
free cash flow as well.
 
Chri
s Caso

Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
 
All right, great. Thank you. And as a follow
-
up, perhaps you can give a bit 
more color on the expectations on memory as you go through the year. I 
know you talked about that being profitable and I think consistent 
with what 
you guys said last quarter. Have there been any changes in your outlook for 
the year? And if you could, talk a little bit about what's framed your 
expectations as you look through the year for memory.
 
Robert Holmes Swan 
-
 
Intel Corp.
 
First, no re
al changes. As Brian mentioned, it's our first $1 billion quarter in 
Q1. We feel good about the demand that we're seeing. Gigabyte demand is 
relatively strong. Our cost per gigabyte coming out of our Dalian fab 
continues to trend down. And at the same time
, we see ASPs were down a 
bit.
 
But as we go through the rest of the year, we see demand and supply to be 
relatively well balanced. We are ramping Mod A (00:46:47) in Dalian, so that 
is in the early stages of the ramp. That's costing a little bit. But conti
nued 
gigabyte demand, continuing to scale the Dalian fab, and continuing to come 
down 

 
the cost per gigabyte curve are all contributing to what we believe 
will be a continued growth and profitability for the business for the full year.
 
Brian M. Krzanich 
-
 
Intel Corp.
 
And maybe the only thing I'd add to that is, Bob mentioned it in his remarks. 
Our 64
-
tier product we also believe gives us really a leading
-
edge product 
and also very good costs relative to the market. So as we ramp that 
technology in Dalian, 
at 64 tiers, we believe our costs are very competitive 
relative to the rest of the market.

Credit Suisse Securities (

Yes, good afternoon, guys. Thanks for letting me ask the questions. 
Congratulations on the strong results. Brian, I think 
within DCG, the cloud 
hyperscale dynamics are well understood by investors. 90 days ago, I think 
what surprised everybody, probably including yourselves, was just the 
strength of enterprise in the December quarter. And I think when you 
reported December, y
ou were reluctant to call that a trend, and you wanted 
to get some more data points.
 
I'm curious as to what the view of enterprise is now 90 days later. And 
specifically, a couple of your key software partners last year in Microsoft and 
VMware finally brou
ght out their hybrid cloud software stack solution. And 
I'm wondering if that's actually been the driver of some of this pent
-
up 
demand in the enterprise. And how sustainable do you think it is?
 
Brian M. Krzanich 
-
 
Intel Corp.
 
Yeah. It's a great question, 
John. What I would tell you is clearly, as we look 
out into Q2, we're expecting the same kind of positive trends on enterprise 
for the second quarter. I think as we look at the long term, though, that 
trend that says enterprise should decline in that low s
ingle digits and it 
drives and helps fuel the growth of cloud, and that's not all of the driver of 
the growth of cloud, those workloads are moving over to the cloud base 
continue.
 
I think you're right. Products like Microsoft Azure and others where you can
 
be a hybrid, Azure on
-
prem versus Azure in cloud, are great examples how 

 
I think that low single digits is sustainable over the long haul, but I just 
don't see that trend. Again, I try and look at these businesses not over the 
quarter, or even within th
e quarter, or even one to two quarters, but really 
thinking about how am I going to invest over the next two to five years. I've 
got to look at that and say that trend is probably likely to continue.
 
Now for us, we also need to understand that those other 
segments of data 
center, the cloud and networking and comm, as I look at the Data Center 
Group, are now well over 50% of the revenue of that segment. So we are 
less and less impacted, I'll say, by the enterprise.
 
If you go back, when I started as CEO, ente
rprise was 60% 

 
70% of the 
business, and so we swung wildly by that. It's the other way around now, 
where the cloud and networking and storage are now that 60% to 70%, 
growing to the right, and enterprise is less and less. So the other thing you 
need to r
ealize, John, is we're more driven by what that cloud is doing 
anyway.

That's helpful. And as my follow
-
up to Bob, just a multipart question on the
 
guide for Q2 and the full year. First, was the ASC 606 impact embedded in 
the original March quarter guidance? Is that the only quarter where you'll 
have an ASC 606 impact?
 
Second, is Wind River now out of the Q2 and full
-
year guide, or is that still in 
i
t? And how big is that business?
 
And then third, when you look at Q2 specifically, it just looks like the 
operating income beat seems a lot larger than the EPS beat. Is there 
anything going on below the line other than the tax rates that you guided to 
that
 
can explain that? Thank you.

Yes, great question. First on ASC 606 and what we expect for the full year, 
we had a strong benefit in the first quarter, and roughly half of that unwinds 
during the course of the year. So it c
ontributed to growth in Q1. It will 
unwind itself throughout the course of the year. So full
-
year impact will be 
likely 

 
at this stage of the game, we've got somewhere around $200 million 
to $250 million, but it unwinds through the next several quarters.
 
I think your second question, John, was Wind River. Our assumptions are 
that we will complete the sale of that business at the end of the second 
quarter. So it's in our second quarter guide, but it's a component of the first 
half to second half deceleratio
n.
 
The third question, I think it relates to in the first quarter, we had good 
volume, operating margin flow
-
through to EPS. In the second quarter, the 
flow
-
through is not as rich. And the fundamental reason is we have some 
below
-
the
-
line charges associate
d with, A), the 2039 convertible securities 
that we have outstanding that have an exchange feature associated with 
them. And as people 

 
as we hit a certain stock price, our holders can 
exercise that exchange feature. The implications are there is a non
-
ca
sh 
charge associated with that, which goes through our interest and other line, 
that's negative.
 
The good aspect of it is, all else equal, it reduces our outstanding 

 
our 
diluted shares, and we avoid a coupon going forward. But that will have 

 
as 
more pe
ople exercise that exchange feature, we'll see that non
-
cash charge 
below the line. So that's causing a little bit of a drag on the operating 
income growth flowing through to EPS in Q2.

Perfect. Thanks, guys. I appreciate it.

Thanks, John. And, operator, I think we have time for two more questioners.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of 
Timothy Arcuri 
from UBS. Your line is now open.
 
Timothy Arcuri

UBS Securities LLC
 
Thank you. I actually had a two
-
part question on 10
-
nano. The issues 
seemed to be going on now for some time, and it's almost as if the design 
libraries or something are fl
awed. So I guess the first question is why not 
skip 10
-
nanometer and go directly to 7
-
nanometer? You guys have a lot of 
EUV experience and it's going to cut out a lot of the multi
-
pattern layers. So 
that's the first question.
 
And number two, the real quest
ion is that if you did that, would that be a 
net drag to gross margin looking out because you never really monetized 
10
-
nanometer? Thanks.
 
Brian M. Krzanich 
-
 
Intel Corp.
 
Okay, so let me try and answer your question. No, there's nothing wrong 
with the desi
gn libraries or anything like that. The proof of that is that we're 
shipping product. So if there were basic functionality issues like that, you 
wouldn't be able to produce and ship the product. Again, as I said, this is all 
around how many layers are on m
ulti
-
patterning and the end of life of the 
immersion for the critical layers.
 
The second part of your question was would it benefit to just skip to 7 
nanometers, and would that have an effect on the capital or the gross 
margins? The simple answer is no. I 
don't think that's a good idea. The best 
answer is there's a lot of learning that will happen that we can carry forward 
into 7 nanometers just like we carried from 14
-
nanometer to 10
-
nanometer.
 
The other thing is that we still hold 

 
roughly 80% of our 
capital equipment 
is fungible to the next node or backwards to the prior node. And so that's 
why as we've shifted 10
-
nanometer and 14
-
nanometer, we were able to do 
that without shifting our capital expenditures greatly from 

 
we're able to 
just move the ca
pacity back and forth. The same thing is going to happen 
between 10
-
nanometer and 7
-
nanometer. So you'll have some percentage, 
and it's always based on demand and how fast things are ramping and all of 
that. But the equipment will be fungible for the most 
part between 10
-
nanometer and 7
-
nanometer as well.
 
But no, the right thing to do is exactly what we're doing. This is a unique 
opportunity we have. There's a lot more performance than 14
-
nanometer. 
We can keep driving that. We'll fix the yield issues. If 1
0
-
nanometer can 
have a 10
-
nanometer, a 10
-
plus, a 10
-
plus
-
plus, you're going to see a lot of 
products and a lot of performance out of that technology.

Got it, Brian. Thank you.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. The next question comes
 
from the line of Romit Shah with 
Nomura Instinet. Your line is now open.

Thank you and congratulations. Brian, I wanted to ask you about China. 
Your filings indicate that mainland China was about 20
-
plus percent of 
re
venue in 2017. And I have two questions. One, does that figure represent 
your exposure to the domestic vendors in China? And I guess just in light of 
the current environment between the U.S. and China, there are reports now 
of a potential ban beyond ZTE. H
ow concerned are you as it relates to the 
impact to Intel?
 
Brian M. Krzanich 
-
 
Intel Corp.
 
That number is much broader, so that would be, if you think about it, so 
everything from shipments into companies like ZTE or Huawei that are more 
domestically orien
ted, although Huawei ships around the world now. It goes 
to Lenovo and companies like that, Spreadtrum, all of those companies now. 
If you look at Chinese companies, very few are holding within just China. 
They're almost all shipping products and selling a
cross the world. So the 
number is really representative of all of the companies that are building 
within China.
 
Our view is that China is an important market, as you just described, 20
-
something
-
plus percent. It's one of our fastest growing segments as wel
l. 
It's important to us, and we're counting on our leaders and the leaders of 
the world to go resolve these issues. We believe in fair trade. We believe 
that countries and companies need to be able to play in markets fairly and 
compete, and we're counting 
on this getting worked out. That's very 
important to us.
 
Romit Jitendra Shah

Nomura Instinet
 
Okay, great. Thanks for that. And then, Bob, I'm sure you'll shed more light 
on longer
-
term spending targets. But as we build our models for 2019, do 
you think i
t's reasonable to assume that you can drive additional operating 
leverage beyond 2018?
 
Robert Holmes Swan 
-
 
Intel Corp.
 
You're right. I will shed more light on that later. No, but I think look, the 
trends that you've seen over the last couple years is how 
we framed things 
back at our Analyst Day early last year, I guess. And that is that we're going 
to see an expanded TAM, and with that expanded TAM, accelerating growth 
in areas that have lower gross margins, and that we expect over time that 
there will be 
a modest degradation in gross margins as a result of growing 
earnings in different segments. But at the same time, we've said that that 
gross margin modest erosion we believe will be offset by continued 

 
both 
continuing to invest in the critical prioritie
s, but getting leverage on our 
existing spending base.
 
So with that, I think you're going to have a natural offset. We're two years 
ahead of our targets to get to 30%. We're excited about the accelerating 
growth of the company. And we do believe that as we
 
continue to accelerate 
growth and invest in key priorities that our leverage on spending continue to 
come down.

Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Intel Corporation First 
Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a 
listen
-
only mode. Later, we will conduct a question
-
and
-
answer session and 
instructions will be given at that time. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, 

 
I would now like to turn the conference over to Mark Henninger, Head of 
Intel Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
 
Mark Henninger
 
Tha
nk you. And welcome everyone to Intel's first quarter 2014 earnings 
conference call.
 
By now, you should have received a copy of our earnings release and the 
CFO commentary that goes along with it. If you've not received both 
documents, they're available on
 
our investor website, intc.com. I'm joined 
today by Brian Krzanich, our CEO; and Stacy Smith, our Chief Financial 
Officer. In a moment, we'll hear brief remarks from both of them followed by 
Q&A.
 
Before we begin, let me remind everyone that today's discus
sion contains 
forward
-
looking statements based on the environment as we currently see it 
and as such, does include risks and uncertainties.
 
Please refer to our press release for more information on the specific risk 
factors that could cause actual results 
to differ materially. Also, if during this 
call we use any non
-
GAAP financial measures or references, we'll post the 
appropriate GAAP financial reconciliation to our website, intc.com.
 
So, with that let me hand it over to Brian.
 
Brian M. Krzanich
 
Thanks Ma
rk. 2014 is off to a solid start with our first quarter closing much 
as we expected. PC client platform unit volume was up year
-
over
-
year for 
the second consecutive quarter. Even as challenges remain in the consumer 
client segment, we saw continued improve
ment in enterprise clients, driven 
by increasing form factor innovation and refresh.
 
Mobile unit volume was up year
-
over
-
year for the first time since Q2 2012, 
while desktop units were flat year
-
over
-
year, with all
-
time record core 
volume and mix.
 
Our Data
 
Center revenue grew 11% year
-
over
-
year and the enterprise 
segment was again in positive territory, up 3% over last year. While cloud, 
networking and storage were all up in excess of 20%.
 
The newly formed Internet of Things Group, which includes our embedd
ed 
business, grew 32% year
-
over
-
year, with particularly strong demand in in
-
vehicle infotainment and retail. While the Internet of Things Group Atom 
volume nearly doubled over Q1 of last year.
 
We had all
-
time record NAND revenue driven by the Data Center a
nd 
particularly, in cloud. And McAfee reported record Q1 bookings along with an 
8% year
-
over
-
year increase in consumer bookings.
 
Perhaps more importantly, we made progress against our most critical 
strategic objective. And I'd like to take a few minutes to
 
highlight that 
progress.
 
In PCCG, where we're working to reinvent computing with new form factor 
innovation, longer battery life and OS of choice, we saw 2 in 1 volume 
increase more than 20% sequentially in a seasonally down quarter.
 
We're now expecting m
ore than 70 two
-
in
-
one designs for the back
-
to
-
school selling season and many will be offered at $699 or less. These trends, 
in combination with renewed interest in Windows 8 from our customers, are 
encouraging.
 
At the same time, we're ramping more than 13
0 Atom microarchitecture 
notebook and desktop designs with our Bay Trail M&D platforms, 
significantly increasing our presence in the value segment. And we exit the 
quarter with market segment share leadership on Chrome Systems and saw 
positive traction in 
small form factor and all
-
in one computing.
 
In DCG, we launched our Ivy Bridge MP server CPU family known as Xeon 
E7. The new E7 line, which features the largest memory footprint in the 
industry, saw particularly strong reception from enterprise as a resul
t of its 
high speed, real
-
time data analytic capabilities.
 
We also announced an important strategic alliance with an investment in 
Cloudera which is designed to accelerate Hadoop innovation and penetration, 
particularly on IA.
 
We've broken out MCG results 
for the first time this quarter. In order to 
achieve long
-
term success in all of our market segments, from 2 in 1s all the 
way through to the Internet of Things, we're making the investments 
necessary for leadership, and you can see these investments in MC
G's 
results.
 
For example, at Mobile World Congress in February, we announced multi
-
year, multi
-
device agreements with Lenovo, Asus, Dell and Foxconn to 
expand availability of out
-
of
-
base smartphones and tablets.
 
We set an aggressive goal of shipping 40 mil
lion tablet SOCs this year. And 
I'm happy to say we've tallied more than 90 designs on Android and 
Windows and shipped 5 million units in the first quarter, placing us squarely 
on track to that goal.
 
Our first LTE solution, the 7160, is now available in th
e Samsung Galaxy 
Note 3 Neo and the Asus Fonepad 7, in addition to the previously announced 
Samsung Galaxy Tab 3. Our Cat 6 LTE solution, the 7260, with carrier 
aggregation, is on track to ship this quarter. And Samsung, Asus, Lenovo, 
and Dell are all comm
itted to the platform on a combination of phone and 
tablets, along with module vendors like Huawei and Sierra Wireless.
 
We demonstrated SoFIA, our first integrated apps processor and baseband, 
after adding it to the roadmap late last year. We're on track t
o ship the 3G 
solution to OEMs in Q4 2014, with the LTE version following in the first half 
of 2015.
 
In the new devices and Internet of Things Group, we're working to extend 
Intel technology into the fast
-
growing world of interconnected devices. We 
complet
ed the acquisition of BASIS. BASIS provides access to new world
-
class technology and a team of proven innovators.
 
We also shipped our first Quark SoCs for the Internet of Things and 
announced an upgrade of Edison to the Silvermont Atom architecture. 
Edison
 
is on track to ship this summer.
 
And in the Technology and Manufacturing Group, who've worked to advance 
Moore's Law as foundational to our long
-
term success, we began production 
on our 14
-
nanometer process technology and remain on track to launch 
Broadwell in the second half of the year.
 
And the foundry team extended our collaboration with Altera to the 
development of multi
-
dye devices that take advantage of our world
-
class 
package and assembly capabilities and Altera's leading
-
edge programmable 
lo
gic.
 
Taken together, these milestones give me confidence that the pace inside 
our company and our progress with our customers is accelerating. We've 
made a lot of changes. We have more work to do, but I'm confident that we 
will continue to transform and re
alize our vision that if it computes, it does it 
best with Intel.
 
With that, let me turn the call over to Stacy.
 
Stacy J. Smith
 
Thanks, Brian. The first quarter came in consistent with expectations, 
demonstrating financial growth and a solid start to the y
ear. For the first 
quarter, revenue came in at $12.8 billion, up 1% from a year ago and in line 
with expectations.
 
PC Client Group revenue was down 1% from a year ago. We saw PC Client 
Group platform unit volumes grow 1% year
-
over
-
year. And inclusive of 
ta
blets, we saw high single
-
digit unit growth. PC platform average selling 
prices declined 3% on a year
-
on
-
year basis.
 
Our Data Center Group revenue grew 11% from a year ago, with platform 
volumes up 3% and platform average selling prices up 8% over the same
 
period.
 
Some insights into the revenue results of our new segments. The Mobile and 
Communications Group is down 61% from a year ago. The underlying 
dynamics are consistent with what we shared at the investor meeting last 
November.
 
We're seeing a decline i
n our feature phone and 2G/3G multi
-
[com] [ph] 
business, as we're in the midst of a transition to integrated LTE solutions. In 
addition, the ramp in tablet volume is being offset by an increase in contra 
revenue dollars.
 
The Internet of Things Group is up 
32% year
-
on
-
year. We continue to see 
robust growth across segments with particular strength in point
-
of
-
sale 
devices in retail and automotive in
-
vehicle infotainment systems.
 
Gross margin of 60% was down two points from the fourth quarter and one 
point abo
ve our guidance. Spending came in at $4.9 billion, $100 million 
above our outlook, primarily driven by a current period charge relating to 
ongoing litigation.
 
Operating income for the first quarter was $2.5 billion; up 1% from a year 
ago, and earnings per 
share was $0.38, down 5% from a year ago.
 
As we look forward to the second quarter of 2014, we're forecasting the 
midpoint of the revenue range at $13 billion, up 2% from the first quarter. 
This forecast is in line with the average seasonal increase for th
e second 
quarter.
 
We're forecasting the midpoint of the gross margin range for the second 
quarter to be 63%. The three point increase from the first quarter is 
primarily driven by lower factory startup costs as we ramp 14 nm.
 
We're also forecasting higher 
platform volume and lower platform write
-
offs 
on the qualification of our first 14
-
nanometer products. This is partially offset 
by the increase in tablet volume and related contra revenue dollars.
 
Turning to full year 2014. We're still planning for revenue
s to be 
approximately flat to 2013. We expect PC Client Group revenue to decline in 
the mid
-
single
-
digits and the Data Center Group revenue to grow in the low 
double
-
digits.
 
We're forecasting the midpoint of our gross margin range at 61%, up one 
point from
 
the outlook provided in January. This increase is primarily driven 
by lower unit costs across both our PC and tablet products and lower non
-
production manufacturing costs.
 
We are forecasting spending for the year at $18.9 billion. This $300 million 
increa
se over the prior outlook is driven by increased R&D investments and 
litigation expenses. We still expect capital spending to be flat to 2013 with 
the midpoint at $11 billion.
 
The first quarter was a solid start to 2014, reinforcing our view of the 
underly
ing market trends. The PC market has stabilized and on a year
-
over
-
year basis, we saw unit growth for the second quarter in a row.
 
In the Data Center, we continue to see robust growth rates in the cloud 
segment and the enterprise segment grew in the first 
quarter. These trends 
led to Data Center growth of 11% year
-
over
-
year.
 
We're winning designs and ramping our tablet volume rapidly and we have 
design wins in LTE that will result in a second half revenue ramp.
 
Our Internet of Things business grew over 30% 
in the first quarter on a 
year
-
on
-
year basis. And we're driving significant innovation in this area as 
we invest to extend our architecture into the very low power space and 
acquire IP and capabilities.
 
At IDF Beijing two weeks ago, we showcased the broad 
range of products 
we're bringing to the marketplace. These products range from servers in the 
Data Center to innovative PC form factors like detachables and all
-
in ones, 
to tablets, to phones, and to wearables. This is our strategy in action. If it 
compute
s, it does it best with Intel Inside.
 
With that, let me turn it back over to Mark.
 
Mark Henninger
 
All right. Thank you, Brian and Stacy. We're getting a little bit of feedback 
that some of you may be having a hard time hearing us, so I'm trying a 
different
 
mic here and we'll hope that that's better.
 
Moving on to the Q&A, as is our normal practice, we'd ask each participant 
to ask one question and a follow
-
up if you have one. Jamie, please go ahead 
and introduce our first questioner.
 
Question

and

Answer session
 
Operator
 
(Operator instructions)
 
The first question comes from Chris Danely from JPMorgan.
 
Christopher Danely 
-
 
JPMorgan
 
Hello. Thanks guys. A question on gross margins. So, it's going up nicely in 
Q2, but if we look at the year
ly guidance, it looks like it's dropping in the 
second half. Can you just talk about the reason that is happening?
 
Stacy J. Smith
 
Sure, Chris. This is Stacy, I'd be happy to. Let me 
--
 
I'll do the walk kind of 
from Q1 to Q2 and then I give you a sense of w
hat I see in terms of the 
pluses and minuses as we move into the back half of the year.
 
As we go into the second quarter, so we ended Q1 at 60%, we're forecasting 
Q2 at 63%. The big driver there is we get about two and a half points of 
good news associated
 
with the fall off of 14
-
nanometer startup costs, so it's 
pretty consistent with what we've been talking about and what you've seen 
from us in the past.
 
We'll get a little bit more good news associated with Q2 being a bit up in 
terms of volume, so that's a
bout half a point and then we get half a point in 
Q2 associated with lower platform write
-
offs as we qualify those first 14
-
nanometer products towards the end of the quarter.
 
And then there's a bit of an offset, as we ramp tablets and start to see some 
of 
the associated contra revenue dollars with tablets, we saw some of that in 
Q1 but we'll see a bit more in Q2 and so that's about half a point offset. So 
that gets us to 63 for Q2.
 
And then yeah, the math if you triangulate a 61% for the year would say 
that
 
we have a gross margin in the back half of the year that's in the low 
60s. I think the plus that we see going in is we expect seasonally stronger 
volume in the back half so that gives us a little bit of a plus.
 
On the minus side it's two things. One, the 
tablet volume is backend loaded 
for us. Again as you'd expect it's primarily a consumer product, so we'll see 
in the back half of the year the ramp of tablets and the associated contra 
revenue dollars so that's a bit of an offset.
 
And then we'll also see c
osts coming down from Q1 to Q2 and Q3 and then 
in Q4, we'll see a lot of volume coming out of multiple factories on 14
-
nanometer. And so you get a bit of a mix up in cost from those early wafers 
coming off of 14
-
nanometer and again that's a phenomenon you'
d see from 

the first quarter tends to be pretty expensive.
 
Christopher Danely 
-
 
JPMorgan
 
Got it. Thanks. And for my follow
-
up, maybe just give us your take on the 
PC space, just t
alk about how the market is feeling now versus your 
expectations three months ago? And then any impact from the expiration of 
Windows XP, either in your expectations for Q2 or with what happened in 
Q1?
 
Brian M. Krzanich
 
Sure. I can give you kind of an over
all look at how we see the PC market, 
this is Brian. In general, if you look at Q1 and even as we head into Q2, it's 
playing out as we pretty much expected. We continue to see strength in the 
enterprise and that's pretty much across
-
the
-
board everywhere.
 
C
onsumer still remains a bit weak for us. Emerging markets starting to 
strengthen a little bit in the consumer, but the rest of the world still showing 
some weakness at the consumer level.
 
We think what's driving kind of the overall stabilization is a serie
s of things 
that started to play out in Q4 and we see them playing out into Q1 and we 
think throughout this year and some of it is a mixture of things from yes 
--
 
there is Windows XP. It is a part of this equation.
 
I don't think it's the driver. If you loo
k at the form factors that we're 
bringing out, the price points that we've been able to enter, you're seeing 
strong PCs down in the $200 range now. Haswell really coming to market as 
we enter into Q1 and Q2. You saw the 130 Atom designs that we have out 
th
ere. So, it's a series of real vectors that are driving the stabilization we 
believe.

The next question comes from Jim Covello from Goldman Sachs.
 
Jim Covello

Goldman Sachs
 
Great, guys, thanks so much. Just one point of clarification first. The 
segment 
--
 
the year
-
over
-
year segment numbers, is that apples
-
to
-
apples or 
does that include this year's reclassification, but it's versus last year's old 
reclassification?
 
Stacy J. Smith
 
No, no, it's apples
-
to
-
apples, Jim.
 
Jim Covello 
-
 
Goldman Sachs
 
Apples
-
to
-
apples, okay great.
 
Stacy J. Smith
 
Everything got restated.
 
Jim Covello 
-
 
Goldman Sachs
 
Great, terrific. Thank you. In terms of the contra revenue support going 
forward for the tablets, can you talk about the pushes and pulls as we 
maybe go into 
2015 or whatever period you want to talk about going 
forward, about what would cause you to continue to do that versus maybe 
cutting that off? That will obviously be a critical part of our model as we start 
to look forward into next year.
 
Stacy J. Smith
 
Ye
ah, I'd be happy to, Jim. Let me even back up and give you 
--
 
again 
restate the strategy of what we're doing here. And Brian can come in over 
the top with some of the technology. But what we're doing is we're taking 
Bay Trail, which is a product really des
igned for the PC market, and we 
made the decision to take it broadly across different segments of the tablet 
market this year.
 
It brings along with it, at least over the course of 2014, a higher bill of 
materials. And that's independent from the SOC cost. 
It's the power 
management subsystem, it's the motherboard that it goes on, it's the 
memory solution, those kinds of things. And so, we're providing some contra 
revenue to offset that bill of material delta over the course of 2014.
 
Now, as we said, we're do
ing value engineering with our customers and our 
partners. And so we're bringing down that bill of material over the course of 
2014 independent of any changes to our SOC.
 
I'll pause there and actually let Brian if he wants to come in over on the top 
on any
 
of the technology.
 
Brian M. Krzanich
 
I think Stacy's absolutely got it right. We have a series of improvements. 
They have already started to kick
-
in in some cases around our power 
management systems, the number of layers in our motherboards, the 
memory sy
stem integration. All of those things we've worked on and actually 
have started to see the advantages already in our costs.
 
Stacy J. Smith
 
So, I think on a like dollars per unit, it comes down pretty dramatically over 
the course of 2014. And it should be r
elatively small, if at all, as we get into 
2015. And it's, again, the enablement we're doing around the bill of 
materials.
 
And then we also have new products coming into the marketplace, like 
SoFIA, that's targeted at the low end, and then in 2015 you'll s
ee Broxton, 
which is an SOC more for the mid
-
range to high
-
range of the market coming 
into our product portfolio.
 
So, the combination of all of that gives us a better cost structure with our 
own products and a better cost structure overall with the bill of
 
materials as 
we enter 2015 and then work through 2015.

The next question comes from Ambrish Srivastava.
 
Ambrish Srivastava

BMO Capital Markets
 
Hi, thank you. I had a question on D
CG, Stacy, just to make sure it's apples
-
to
-
apples. The guidance that you provided for this year as well as for the 
long term CAGR, does that change now that you have a common 
infrastructure part also within that group?
 
Stacy J. Smith
 
Yeah. So, interesting
 
what we're doing here Ambrish is we're actually now 
restating the segment to match how we've been talking about this segment. 
If you go back to the investor meeting presentations over the last couple of 
years, we've included the communications infrastruct
ure piece of that 
because we do view it as part of the server market.
 
So, you need to go back to Kirk's original presentation, I think it was two 
years ago, 2011, and you'll see it's clearly laid out in that long
-
term CAGR. 
Brian and Renée have now organiz
ed the company more in line with that, so 
we have all of that under one group. So, we've redone our segments as a 
result.
 
I'll also say for Q1, because I don't think you can see this anywhere else, but 
the DCG year
-
on
-
year growth rate was 11% in the restat
ed segments. If you 
took out the CID piece, so if we had not made that change, it still would 
have been 10% plus. So, it's worth about one point of growth in Q1. So, I 
think we're pleased with the growth rate with and without, I guess is how I'd 
say it.
 
Am
brish Srivastava 
-
 
BMO Capital Markets
 
Okay, that is helpful. Because you're right, at the last analyst day, also, you 
did have that piece in there when it was not part of DCG. My follow
-
up then 
is a quicker one. On the MCG side, are we looking at this rev
enue run rate 
bottoming out here, because now you're going into the back half, you also 
talk about Cat 6 shipments?
 
I think, Brian, you were at IDF or somewhere in Shanghai or in China. So, is 
this the bottom for this segment in the quarter? Thank you.
 
Stacy J. Smith
 
I think you'll see two phenomena as we move into the back half. As we said, 
we're seeing on the com side that transition from 2G/3G. So, we're seeing a 
trough
-
ing of that business. And as we move into the back half we'll see the 
LTE, particu
larly the 7260, coming to market. So, we'll start to see, I think, 
a nice ramp in revenue on that segment.
 
We'll have significant unit growth in tablets. But remember that contra 
revenue isn't just a gross margin impact; it's actually a subtraction from 
re
venue. And so that will mute the revenue growth for the segment because 
you have that negative as we get into the back half and ship more tablets. 
To the prior question, I expect that to abate as we get into 2015, but you'll 
definitely see that in the back
 
half of 2014.

The next question comes from Christopher Rolland from FBR.
 
Christopher Rolland

FBR Capital Markets
 
Hey, guys, thanks for faking the question. So, I think a lot of us were 
surprised to see Q1 notebook platforms up year
-
over
-
year, a
s you guys 
alluded to. Why is third
-
party data off year, perhaps even ODM data, off so 
much? I imagine some of that's market share, but what might be the rest 
there?
 
Stacy J. Smith
 
Let me give you the one key finance and then I'll turn it over to Brian to 
talk 
about our notebook strategy and kind of how that's playing out across the 
products. From a year
-
on
-
year comparison, from our billings standpoint, you 
have to remember that Q1 of 2013, there was a big contraction in the 
worldwide supply chain terms of 
inventory levels and I think that impacted 
our billings. So, we're, I think, getting the advantage of a good year
-
on
-
year 
comparison point there.
 
We still expect for the year that units are down in the low single
-
digits. And 
by the way we would love to be 
wrong on that but that's our view of the 
market. And I think that's pretty aligned with the third parties.
 
Brian M. Krzanich
 
Yeah, I would agree with that. And that's not to say that inventories have 
grown. Actually inventories are in very good shape as we
 
look across the 
entire supply chain, both within Intel and outside. So, we think inventories, 
after that correction in the beginning of 2013, are actually normalized now 
where they will probably stay.
 
And as Stacy said 
--
 
and as we said in the call, you'r
e seeing us in all price 
points in this space. So, you're seeing Bay Trail and even core products 
down at lower price points. You'll also see us gaining market share in 
Chrome over this time period.
 
We're in a significant percentage of the Chrome systems o
ut there. So, 
there's a variety of things that are allowing us to get some upswing a bit in 
the mobile market, as well.
 
Christopher Rolland 
-
 
FBR Capital Markets
 
Great. Thank you. As a follow
-
up, at one point there was Bay Trail T, M, and 
D for tablet, mob
ile and desktop. Is the M and D still accounted for in PC, 
and T in tablet? And with that 8% ASP decline that you guys had in mobile, 
was that natural or is that a mixing of Bay Trail M? Thanks.
 
Stacy J. Smith
 
Yes, great question. The first answer is yes, 
the M and D would be included 
in PCCG's results. The T is included in MCG's results and would be in the 
tablet volume that we're talking about.
 
And, yes, the notebook ASP that you saw was exactly consistent with our 
strategy. We're bringing Bay Trail in th
ere. It's got the right cost structure. 
It's actually the volume is a little ahead of what we thought in Q1. It's 
enabling us to grow units a bit and maintain and grow profitability and the 
overall company's gross margin looked pretty good, too.

Thanks for taking my question, guys. And a few of the things that you've 
guided to we've really never seen in the history of Intel and that being OpEx 
dropping rather m
aterially in the back half of the year. Can you give us a 
little bit of color on what you're doing to make that happen?
 
Stacy J. Smith
 
Yeah. I mean as we said at quarter a go, we're bringing employment down 
over the course of the year. In particular, we're
 
driving for some efficiencies 
in the engineering organization. But they're happening a little later than we 
thought. But we're 
--
 
what Brian and Renée are driving for is to get more 
output and more products and more derivatives for the engineering teams 
a
nd that will result in some efficiency as we get into the back half.
 
Doug Freedman

RBC Capital Markets
 
And for my follow
-
up, also another spending question, that being on the 
CapEx. I believe there was a change to the longer
-
term roadmap on your 
move to 
get to 450 and yet we're not seeing really any change on your 
CapEx spending. Is there a change that we should be thinking is possible in 
the future? How would you talk about your CapEx? In the past you talked 
about maintenance and then the other if you co
uld give us an update on 
that.
 
Brian M. Krzanich
 
The 450, let's start with that. We haven't changed. We've said that actually 
our 450 is similar in the latter half of this decade, right? So, we're still 
saying that. You're going to see gives and takes on 
450 spending.
 
These are long, drawn
-
out programs over multiple years. And so I think 
don't grade the whole program by one shift in when we buy a tool or when 
we move out some spending, in some cases.
 
And don't forget, any time we do that you typically have
 
just more 300
-
millimeter that you're going to go spend money on. We continue to hold our 
forecast flat for CapEx. We are comfortable with the CapEx where we're at to 
maintain our business based on the demand we're seeing for our core 
products.

The next question comes from John Pitzer from Credit Suisse.
 
John Pitzer 
-
 
Credit Suisse
 
Yeah, good afternoon, guys, congratulations. Stacy, a question 
on gross 
margins. Has the full year expected impact for tablets changed at all? And if 
memory serves me correct, that was 150 basis points. And if I do the math 
right, would that alone account for about two and a half percentage points of 
decline in Q3, Q4
? Am I doing that correctly?
 
Stacy J. Smith
 
The answer to your first question is that our expectations haven't changed. 
There may be 
--
 
the second decimal may have changed, but directionally it's 
the same. And as Brian said in his prepared remarks, we're a
ctually feeling 
pretty good about the line of sight we have across the customers, the longer 
term agreements we have in place and design wins that we know are coming 
to market, as well as the Q1 volume.
 
In terms of the impact in the second half, I haven't 
done the math that way, 
but just to manage your math, you're probably not too far off because it's 
150 basis points more or less for the year, and it's backend loaded, so it's 
going to be in that kind of a range.
 
I did do the math for the back half saying 
that 
--
 
that as well as the Q4 cost 
of 14
-
nanometer out of multiple factories, is the thing that keeps us in the 
low 60s as opposed to higher. So, I think your math probably is pretty close.
 
John Pitzer

Credit Suisse
 
Perfect. Thanks, guys. And as my foll
ow on, Brian, you talk a little bit about 
the expectations around the Grantley product launch? Nehalem clearly drove 
good growth in DCG. Romley was a little more mixed. What's the 
expectation for Grantley? And is there a concern of a pause of buying in DCG
 
ahead of the launch and how do you manage that?
 
Brian M. Krzanich
 
We look at the Grantley as a great product. I don't think there will be a 
pause. We've factored that into all of our forecasts, the launch dates. Those 
haven't moved. I don't see it as bein
g a shift. Customers typically line up 
their products around our product launches, and they have several months 
to work around those and forecast there's, as well. So, I don't see a stall in 
our business based on what we see with the forecasts right now.

The next question comes from C.J. Muse from ISI Group.
 
C.J. Muse 
-
 
ISI Group
 
Yeah. Good evening. Thank you for taking my question. I guess first 
question, since 
you announced a vision for being a larger foundry at your 
Analyst Day, I'm curious what you've learned in your discussion with 
potential clients in terms of what may be bigger opportunities than what you 
initially thought and perhaps what could be bigger c
hallenges?
 
And I guess as part of that, as you think about offering those foundry 
services to potential customers, how do you think about maybe some of the 
changes you need to do in terms of tool sets with Fab 42?
 
Brian M. Krzanich
 
So, let's answer the 
first part first. I'd say the interest since we opened up 
the foundry has been high. These interactions, just getting people 
comfortable with what the technology is, take several months typically.
 
There's deep interaction between the technical teams on bot
h sides, really 
understanding what the process of silicon technology incorporates, what the 
design tools are, what IP we have to offer, where they can go get third
-
party 
IP, all of those kinds of interactions. Those have been ongoing with many 
customers. A
nd then, you start the business discussions around pricing and 
availability and all of that.
 
So, I'd tell you that the uptake has been strong. We've been in many 
interactions. As far as what does it tell us about what needs to change within 
Intel, I think 
we still have a lot to learn about how to be a good foundry.
 
Altera, who is really our lead premier customer 
--
 
I'd say big customer has 
really been helpful. They've helped us see where we're strong and where we 
are not and what it takes to become strong i
n those areas. They are making 
good progress on their products.
 
I don't think there's a lot of change from a technology standpoint that's 
outside the changes we're going to make, say, at 10
-
nanometers of our own 
product. We're driving to lower power, more 
mobility, able to integrate 
better, all of those things into our own products. Integration of memory 
capabilities, that's driven by our own need to move into those mobile 
spaces. And that's helping us with the same roadmaps that are being 
required by the f
oundry partners.
 
Fab 42 is purely a capacity
-
driven based on demand. We'll trigger that as we 
trigger demand both either internally or from the foundry. Remember 
though the foundry partners signed up today.
 
It's probably two years 
--
 
18 to 24 months before
 
first silicon and probably 
30 to 36 months before they really have ramped to any volume. And Fab 42 
is probably 12 to 18 months from when you would be able to bring it into 
capacity. So, the two have a great deal of overlap.
 
Stacy J. Smith
 
And I would jus
t add, just reading into your question 
--
 
maybe I'm reading 
too much, C.J., if you're viewing the foundry business as we would have a 
specific foundry factory, that's probably not the case. These will be run side 
by side with our own products and taking ad
vantage of the same technology 
and technology features that we need for our product line.
 
Brian M. Krzanich
 
That's correct.

Got it. Very helpful. If I could sneak in a second one here. In terms of 
integrated LTE, you've talked about w
hen we'll first see that. But curious

2016. We're still battling back and forth on how fast we can bring it in and 
at 
what impacts that has. 14

The next question comes from Blaine Curtis from Barclays.
 
Blaine Curtis

Barclays Capital
 
Hey, good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking my ques
tion. Maybe actually 
follows up on CJ's prior question. The MPG business that you're now 
breaking out, it's pretty clear it's losing $3 billion, $3.5 billion. How do you 
think about this business?
 
Obviously you're trying to ramp the product set you are a b
it behind. You're 
entering from the low end and that pricing seems quite tough. You're facing 
some subsidies that you have to do on the tablet side.
 
Are there some milestones that you look at to get this business back 
profitable? Or maybe would you conside
r this strategic enough that you 
would consider continuing to run this as a loss?
 
Brian M. Krzanich
 
So, you asked several questions in there, so let me start to pars it apart. 
Absolutely this is a strategic business, so let's just start with that. We think
 
this is critical and we said this in our prepared statements. It's critical from 2 
in 1 devices down through the Internet of Things.
 
You look across the connectivity requirements there; more and more of the 
devices are requiring integrated connectivity, w
hether it be LTE, 3G, Wi
-
Fi, 
Bluetooth and all of these connectivities are becoming more and more 
required.
 
We don't go into these businesses thinking that we're going to lose money. 
We believe we have a roadmap to get to profitability in that 
business. The 
milestones that I look at 
--
 
and so I'll give you those for yourself to look at, 
we have the 7160, the current LTE version out there. We're the second in 
LTE. We have the 7260 launch this quarter. I think that's a critical there.
 
Again, we're
 
closing the gap with our competition. We're bringing out leading 
edge Cat 6 capability with carrier aggregation. That's a critical milestone. 
That puts 
--
 
that closes the gap and puts us firmly in the LTE capability.
 
The next one is SoFIA. If you look at 
the SoFIAs at the end of this year with 
3G integration and then a big first half of next year with LTE integration. 
Remember those products weren't even on our roadmap six or seven 
months ago. So, that shows that we're acting quickly integrating and 
bringi
ng those products to production.
 
Then after that is, as Stacy said earlier, Broxton, which is our internal 14
-
nanometer product. That's targeted towards the mid to high level. And as we 
bring that into the second half of 2015 and into 2016, there will be v
arious 
levels of integration on that.
 
So, when I look across this, those are the milestones I look at, because 
those are what drive that along with just the basic cost reduction capabilities 
we talked about for this year as we get out of this contra revenu
e into 2015. 
Those products then place us firmly in leadership capability from the low end 
to the high end with integration. And those are the milestones to me that 
will lead to profitability long
-
term.
 
Stacy J. Smith
 
And I'll just add to that, I think you
 
left it off because it was so obvious, but 
the 40 million tablets is one of the things I see Brian just laser focused on. 
And as we've talked about before, it gets us into the 15% to 20% range of 
the total tablet market.
 
It gives us a big enough footprint
 
that we start to see people developing on 
our architectures. It becomes a self
-
sustaining ecosystem as we're bringing 
these other products to the marketplace. So, don't lose sight of that one, 
Blaine.
 
Brian M. Krzanich
 
Yeah.
 
Blaine Curtis 
-
 
Barclays Capit
al
 
Thanks. And then just as a second question, in terms of Broadwell timing 
you had the one quarter slip. It seems like no change so far. Are there any 
more hurdles in terms of yields or anything before this product is ready to 
ship in the back half?
 
Brian
 
M. Krzanich
 
Well, as we said, we qualified for startup production this month. We will 
qualify for shipment to customers towards the end of this quarter. Those are 
the first two milestones, so we've passed one of them. And then you'll start 
to see our cust
omers bring products to market as we progress into the 
second half of this year.
 
These things are hard. There are always yield improvement efforts that we 
have and cost deductions that we're going through. But I think we're past 
the first of the two big mi
lestones by turning on the production internal. And 
we have the next big one at the end of this quarter with certifying to ship to 
customers. We don't see any roadblocks, don't see any issues. But that's still 
out there at the end of this quarter.

The next question comes from Stacy Rasgon from Sanford Bernstein.
 
Stacy Rasgon 
-
 
Sanford C. Bernstein & Co
 
Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. For my first one, I wanted to dig a 
little bit into the mob
ile and wireless group. So, you've talked a bit about 
having I guess developing leadership products, leadership position in order 
to drive profitability. We're looking at this right now, though. So, we had the 
business fall more than 50% sequentially.
 
You 
have your 7160 which is shipping but apparently it's not really driving 
much volume. We have the 7260 which is forthcoming, but we really haven't 
heard much about design wins. And you launched at Mobile World Congress 
without really saying very much there.
 
We have SoFIA coming, which absolutely is integrated, but it's being made 
at TSMC for the next few years which means you lose any potential benefits 
from your own process technology. And you would seem to be well behind 
what the market leaders are shippin
g in terms of 4G.
 
Just what should we be looking for and over what timeframe should we be 
looking for, for the ramp? I guess what I'm asking is, how can we get 
confidence that we're going to actually see the revenue ramp that is built 
into the short
-
term e
xpectations for this year and then going forward, to 
make sure that you can actually get a profitable business, which obviously 
would be driving quite a bit of upside to where the models are today?
 
Brian M. Krzanich
 
Sure, Stacy. I'll start and then Stacy c
an jump in. Remember, the 7160, we 
gave you a series of products that it's shipping in. And on the 7260, which 
will qualify this quarter, we gave you a list of OEM partners that have 
committed to that platform. So, we're fairly confident that the ramp in t
he 
second half of this year will continue on that product. And it is a leadership 
product.
 
SoFIA, you're right, is built at TSMC. We went for speed and integration. And 
it was simply quicker to get to market with a competitive product from both 
a price and
 
performance. We actually believe that the IA core will give us 
better performance than the competition. And the competition is at that 
same node at TSMC. And it's 3G at the end of this year and LTE in the first 
half of next year.
 
We then told you that in 
the second half of next year 
--
 
and again, we're 
debating whether it's the second half or the first quarter of 2016, but we'll 
move all of that internal on to 14
-
nanometers. And it's really based on other 
products that we have moving in at that time and ju
st overall resources all 
right.
 
We had a lot going on 
--
 
the ramp of Broadwell, the ramp of Skylake in the 
second half of next year, plus bringing these products inside. But I'm very 
confident that when you do that, plus you add in Broxton, which is 
targeted 
towards the mid to high range and again is integrated with leading
-
edge 
LTE.
 
And don't forget we have a roadmap of LTE products beyond the 7260 that 
continue the level of carrier aggregation and product leadership. We're fairly 
confident that we c
an continue to grow this business and turn it profitable 
over that time.
 
Stacy J. Smith
 
And let me just comment on the question about the long
-
term profitability. 
It sounds basic, but it really stems from our manufacturing leadership. If 
we're two years ah
ead of the rest of the industry, and extending it gives us 
the ability that, as we target our products into the right space from a power 
standpoint, we will have power advantage or performance advantage and a 
cost advantage.
 
That really is our strategy pla
ying out. You're seeing the first products 
hitting that theme over the course of this year and into early next year. Bay 
Trail is a really good product. For the high end of the market, you'll see 
products coming into the market that are more targeted at th
e mid
-
range 
and lower end of the market next year. But that's how the strategy plays 
out.
 
I'd say for 2015, I would expect to see reduction in the loss. Not profitability, 
but a reduction in the loss will feel pretty good when we get there and then 
we'll k
eep driving towards the long
-
term profitability goal.

Did you have a follow
-
up Stacy?
 
Stacy Rasgon 
-
 
Sanford C. Bernstein & Co
 
I did. I'd like to drill in a bit more. I'm actually into the 
tablet efforts now. 
So, we're obviously subsidizing. And I get the idea of reducing BOM cost in 
order to make up for the deficiencies with the idea being that you can drive 
improved product set down the road.
 
But at the same time, if you look at the tablet
 
market, where it is today, 
you're obviously not going to be going after Apple any time soon. Maybe 
there's a little bit of volume at Samsung. But I mean if you take those guys 
out, 75% of what's left is systems that are $250 and below, where your 
competit
ors are shipping quad
-
core chips for much less than $10.
 
I'm curious to know what kind of economics and pricing you see from that 
market long
-
term. And are the 
--
 
I guess the total revenue pool and profit 
pool that's available, even if you were to succeed 
at your goals, why does 
that make it a worthwhile effort to actually go after? Or is this simply, as you 
said, strategic? Is this an attempt to limit further penetration of tablets into 
the core market?
 
Brian M. Krzanich
 
So, I'll start and Stacy is welcome
 
to jump in. You've asked a question that 
has multiple questions built into it. But let's start with what we told you was 
we've got multiple OEM partners building tablets and phones on our 
products. And we gave you Asus and Dell and Lenovo and Samsung on t
hose 
products.
 
If you look at the tablet business overall, it's broken up into a series of 
segments. And you're right; there is a large percentage of them that are 
$250 and below. Products like SoFIA are specifically designed for that 
segment.
 
And our dual
-
core SoFIA already performs quite well against quad
-
core 
systems. As we move into next year, we'll bring quad
-
core SoFIA
-
based 
products out, as well. And so we believe that we can stay very cost 
competitive and have a performance leadership.
 
Remember, Int
el has two assets. We have our silicon technology, but we 
also have our architecture. And one of the things an OEM gets when they 
build with Intel technology is that they can go into any OS and they can 
build a single platform and move that on to Chrome, o
n to Android, on to 
Windows. And that's a very unique capability that we provide to OEMs for 
flexibility.
 
So, we believe with a product like SoFIA, as we bring that into the market 
next year, we can absolutely compete in those spaces and make money. 
You're
 
probably not going to make as much revenue dollars and as much 
margin dollars as the PC business, but we think this is still critical. And it's 
critical for a variety of reasons. Part of it is simply the scale. You want to 
have those units. You want to ha
ve a presence in all areas of computing.
 
And the second one is developer attention. You want developers creating 
new products, doing innovation on your architecture. This is a space that's 
got innovation. We are going to bring some of that innovation to th
is 
market. You're going to see some tablets as you go into the end of this year.
 
We showed them at CES, some of the highlights where you have 3D 
cameras, you have perceptual computing capabilities for gaming. All of those 
kinds of things can change the tab
let market, along with the PC market.
 
So, we believe that we can bring a lot of the innovation that we do in the PC 
down into the tablet space. And again, that keeps the developers developing 
and interested in our platform. I think for all of those reasons
, we want to be 
in this space and we will be in this space from now on.
 
Stacy J. Smith
 
I would just add. That was very complete, but we don't fear the low end of 
the market. You look at how we played out in PCs. You can drive a lot of unit 
growth by partic
ipating in PCs now that are $199 to $250. We can have the 
cost structure because of our manufacturing lead to participate nicely there. 
And you see that as markets mature, they also segment.
 
And so we have look, you look at our PC business, we have great d
emand 
and profitability in core I7s and it spans down to Bay Trail at the Atom 
segment of the market. So, it's a misconception to think that we only want 
to play at the high end. Our manufacturing leadership can give us the cost 
structure to play profitabl
y at the low end, as well.

Thank you, guys.

Thanks Stacy. And operator we'll go ahead and take two more questions.

The next question comes from Ross Seymore from Deutsche Bank.

Hi, guys. Thanks for letting me ask a question. Back on to the PC Client 
Group for a second and on to the ASP side of the equation, between the 
desktop and notebook obviously there's very different dynamics.
 
Do you see a point in wh
ich the notebook side starts flattening out and 
starts to act like the desktop side, where ASPs have been up strongly both 
last year and year
-
over
-
year in the first quarter? Or is that pressure to the 
low end going to persist and so we shouldn't think of a
 
flattening out any 
time soon?
 
Stacy J. Smith
 
I actually think more about the two markets together. I think you have this 
range of devices that are computers and they range from a high end all
-
in
-
one down to a $199 very low cost notebook computer that's be
ing sold. And 
I think what we're seeing is strength at both ends of the market.
 
If you look at our pricing over the last three years, it's been pretty dead flat 
on average across the PC market. You can see from my gross margin 
forecast from 2014, I'm not e
xpecting ASP to be one of the big drivers. So, 
you can take from that that we continue to see a pretty benign pricing 
environment. So, that's how I think about it, I don't know, Brian, if you 
have
--
 
Brian M. Krzanich
 
No, I would agree. I don't see it behav
ing any differently moving forward.

And as my follow
-
up, switching over to the OpEx side, it's good to see the 
headcount coming down in the second half, down versus the first half. But 
you're still significantly elevated versus
 
your target model.
 
I know you're not going to guide for 2015 with any specifics whatsoever. But 
can you remind us, if you do end this year with lower headcount than you 
ended the prior year, so you're going into the year down year
-
over
-
year is 
the tick
-
to
ck of process engineering moving from R&D into COGS a 
headwind or a tailwind in 2015? Are there any big moving parts that we can 
think about for that year's OpEx versus this year's?
 
Stacy J. Smith
 
Yeah, it's the reciprocal to what happens to gross margins.
 
So, in a year like 
this year where you see startup costs coming down, that means that the 
engineers that were working on 14
-
nanometer that were being classified as 
cost of sales, now move to 10
-
nanometer and they are being classified as 
R&D. So, next year
 
you should see gross margin 
--
 
some headwind in terms 
of gross margin and some tailwind in terms of the R&D spending.

Thanks Ross. And operator can you go ahead and introduce our last 
question?
 
Ope

The final question comes from Mark Lipacis from Jefferies.

Thanks for taking my question. First one, Brian, when you talk about the 40 
million unit bogey on tablets this year, could you go through the taxonomy 
of that a littl
e bit? To what extent do you think this is Windows versus 
Android? And what's the class of product you think will represent the mode 
or the mean? Like where do you think your sweet spot is going to be this 
year on tablets?
 
Brian M. Krzanich
 
Sure. Our mix o
f OSs reflects pretty much what you see in the marketplace. 
So, I think, depending on how you look at it, it's probably something on the 
order of 90% Android, 80% Android, 10% to 20% Windows.
 
Our percentages look very much like the marketplace. So, if Wind
ows 
continues to grow and gain traction I think our percentage would just align 
directly to that. So, you can 
--
 
don't separate what we ship from what's 
basically in the marketplace. We're leadership capability on all of the OSs 
now.
 
As far as what is 
the price point, again, it reflects fairly close to what the 
marketplace is. You see us in systems below $100 now. The majority of the 
systems are say $125 to $250, somewhere in there. And then you see us in 
some of the upper end systems, $250 to $400. And
 
so 
--
 
but the majority is 
in that 
--
 
I'd call it, $125 to probably $250 range.

Okay. Thank you. And then as a follow
-
up, did you discuss, do you expect to 
have the Android tablets ramping in volume this quarter? Are we going to be
 
--
 
should we expect to see the Bay Trail Android products at Computex this 
year? When do we really see the material ramp in the Android products? 
Thank you.
 
Brian M. Krzanich
 
Sure, absolutely. You can go out to the store today and buy an Android 
--
 
in 
fac
t, I'd love you to go buy one of the 40 million we'll sell. But, yes, you can 
buy Android. It continues to ramp through this quarter. At Computex, we'll 
show a series of Android and Windows
-
based tablets. And they just continue 
to ramp through this year. B
ut they're on shelves today. I saw them in the 
store this weekend.
 
Stacy J. Smith
 
The majority of the 5 million units, for example, are Android. Just as Brian 
said, it more or less follows the distribution between Windows and Android.

Intel Corp.
 
Thanks, Mark.
 
Our results for the quarter were outstanding, mar
king a record second 
quarter on our way to what we expect will be a record 2018. Last week we 
celebrated Intel's 50th year as a company, which is a big deal in an industry 
that never stops evolving. Even more remarkable is that after five decades 
in tech, 
Intel is poised to deliver its third year in a row of record financial 
performance.
 
We set a course five years ago to transform the company. To do that, we 
made investments to enhance and extend our core microprocessor business 
along with a series of bold 
bets to compete and win in new markets. Our 
thesis was that Intel is uniquely positioned to capitalize on the world's 
insatiable need to process, store, and move data.
 
The results have been dramatic. We are now competing for a $260 billion 
TAM, the largest
 
in the company's history, and we have lots of room to 
grow. Just five years ago, roughly a third of our revenue was data
-
centric. 
Today, nearly half of our revenue is data
-
centric and growing at a double
-
digit rate. Data has never been more pervasive nor 
more valuable. In fact, 
90% of the digital data ever created was generated in just the past two 
years. But of that data, only 1% has been analyzed, indicating massive 
untapped potential.
 
I'd like to highlight a few indicators of Intel's accelerating transf
ormation 
before going into our financial results. First, in our Data Center business, our 
focus on the cloud, network transformation, and AI and analytics produced 
outstanding results in a strong demand environment. Customer preference 
for our highest perf
ormance products continued, with Xeon Scalable at 
nearly 50% of our mix in the second quarter. Cloud revenue grew as service 
provider CapEx continued to accelerate to meet the explosive demand for 
digital services, artificial intelligence, and data analyti
cs. Enterprise revenue 
was driven by a combination of macro strength and companies increasing 
deployment of hybrid cloud solutions and data
-
intensive workloads.
 
In the comms service provider segment, we continued to gain share as 
customers choose to virtua
lize and transform their networks and prepare for 
the 5G transition using Intel architecture.
 
Our Programmable Solutions Group also delivered strong results this 
quarter. PSG again set a record for design win volume, indicating customers' 
confidence in our
 
roadmap and growing adoption of FPGAs for workload 
acceleration from the data center, through the network, and out to the edge.
 
Earlier this month we announced the planned acquisition of eASIC, which will 
give us a competitive differentiator and another s
olution to meet customers' 
diverse time to market, performance, cost, and power needs.
 
We combined Intel and Altera 2.5 years ago, and we expected a key value 
driver to be the increasing use of FPGAs in the data center. In Q2, PSG's 
data center business mo
re than doubled for the second consecutive quarter.
 
IoTG set an all
-
time revenue record, with particular strength in the retail and 
industrial sectors, as customers look to Intel not only for compute 
performance, but for solutions that drive business value
. We also completed 
the sale of Wind River, as we continued to redeploy resources to higher 
growth and return areas.
 
Building on its industry leadership in ADAS and driving the industry toward 
and autonomous future, Mobileye set another all
-
time revenue re
cord. 
Customer momentum continued with several design wins, including a 
multimillion unit deal with ZF for a large global automaker. We also 
announced that Baidu has adopted Mobileye's EyeQ
-
based Surround 
Computer Vision kit as the preferred vision solutio
n for commercial Apollo 
Pilot AD [Autonomous Driver] deployments. In both the open source and 
commercial Apollo programs, Baidu will also integrate Mobileye's 
Responsibility Sensitive Safety model, an open and transparent model that 
provides safety assuran
ce for AD decision
-
making, an industry imperative.
 
Our memory business also set an all
-
time revenue record. We are 
transforming the memory industry with a pair of differentiated platform 
connected capabilities, high
-
density floating
-
gate 3D NAND and high
-
p
erformance persistent Optane technology. We recently announced that we 
are in production on the industry's first 4
-
bits per cell data center NAND 
PCIe SSDs. At the same time, industry support for Intel Optane DC
-
persistent memory continues to grow, with te
chnology leaders, including 
CERN, Google, SAP, and Tencent already announcing plans for future use of 
the technology. Unlike traditional DRAM, Intel Optane DC
-
persistent memory 
will offer the unprecedented combination of high capacity, up to 3 terabytes 
pe
r socket, along with affordability and persistence.
 
Intel and Micron recently announced that we will develop future generations 
of 3D Xpoint technology independently to better align the technology to our 
individual business needs and strategies. We'll cont
inue to jointly 
manufacture 3D Xpoint at the Intel Micron Flash Technologies fab in Lehi 
[Utah]. Intel intends to extend its leadership with Intel Optane products 
based on 3D Xpoint, which combined with our high
-
density 3D NAND 
technology, offer the best s
olution for today's computing and storage needs.
 
And finally in client computing, our focus on innovation and differentiation in 
the commercial, enthusiast, and thin
-
and
-
light segments is producing 
results. Overall market conditions also continue to improv
e, and we now 
expect modest growth in the PC TAM this year for the first time since 2011. 
The commercial segment remains strong, as CIOs refreshing aging PC fleets 
are turning to Intel Core processors, with vPro as the gold standard for 
performance and man
ageability.
 
At the same time, consumer interest in gaming and our outright 
performance leadership are driving strength in the enthusiast segment, 
producing another outstanding quarter in gaming. These trends reflect the 
market's demand for our highest perf
ormance products, resulting in strong 
overall product mix in CCG. We also began shipping the 7560 modem, Intel's 
first CDMA and first multi
-
SIM
-
capable modem.
 
Our industry
-
leading products continue to deliver outstanding results. We 
have a leadership 14
-
na
nometer product lineup for 2019, and we continue to 
make progress on 10
-
nanometer. Yields are improving consistent with the 
timeline we shared in April, and we expect systems on shelves for the 2019 
holiday season.
 
In the second quarter, we announced a CEO
 
change. The board is making 
good progress determining the best person to be the next CEO of this great 
company. While there is no timetable, the board is working with a sense of 
urgency, and the identification of candidates, both internal and external, is
 
well underway.
 
Personally and on behalf of Intel's 100,000
-
plus employees, I'd like to thank 
Brian [Krzanich] for his many contributions to the company over his 35
-
year 
career. The investments he made set us on a course for transformation. 
Even more 
importantly, he developed the right strategy and leadership team 
to carry that transformation forward while we conduct the CEO search. Our 
financial results in the second quarter show we're doing just that.
 
Let's turn to the numbers. Revenue of $17 billion
 
was up 15% year over 
year, marking a second record quarter. We saw strong performance across 
all of our businesses and record revenue in NSG, IoTG, and Mobileye.
 
Our data
-
centric businesses were collectively up 26%. Excellent operating 
margin leverage and
 
a lower tax rate resulted in EPS of $1.04, up 44% year 
on year, even as we continued to invest for growth.
 
From a capital allocation perspective, year to date we have generated $6.3 
billion of free cash flow, returned $8.6 billion to shareholders, includi
ng $2.8 
billion in dividends and $5.8 billion in buybacks, repurchasing 117 million 
shares.
 
As a result of the continued strength we are seeing in the business, we are 
raising our full
-
year revenue guide by $2 billion to $69.5 billion. We are also 
raising 
our EPS guide by $0.30 versus April to $4.15 and the free cash flow 
guide by $0.5 billion to $15 billion.
 
Our leadership products are winning in an expanded TAM, and our data
-
centric businesses are now almost 50% of our total revenue. Our data
-
centric busi
nesses had strong quarters, with each business individually 
growing at a double
-
digit rate. Our PC
-
centric business was up 6% on 
strength in the commercial and enthusiast segments.
 
Q2 was another quarter of significant EPS growth, up 44% year on year, and 
our operating margin expanded $1.4 billion and 5 points year on year. Our 
EPS improvement was driven by growing demand for high
-
performance 
products in the Data Center and Client businesses, leading to higher volumes 
and ASPs, strong growth in our adjacent
 
businesses, a lower tax rate, and 
lower share count as a result of buybacks.
 
In January we pulled in our 30% spending goal to 2018, a full two years 
ahead of schedule. We are on track to meet that target, and our operating 
efficiency continues to improve.
 
We remain extremely diligent in managing 
spending while prioritizing investments in areas that will accelerate revenue 
growth, product leadership, artificial intelligence, and autonomous driving. 
This focused approach is producing results.
 
Total Q2 spendi
ng came in at $5.1 billion, 30% of revenue. Total spending 
as a percentage of revenue is down 4.6 points year over year in the quarter, 
while we continued to increase investment in our key priorities. Versus the 
second quarter of last year, we delivered $2
.2 billion more revenue with no 
incremental spending.
 
Let's talk now about our Q2 performance by segment. The Data Center 
Group delivered another great double
-
digit growth quarter, with revenue of 
$5.5 billion, up 27% year over year, and operating income o
f $2.7 billion, up 
65%. Q2 operating margin was 49%, and we continued to see strong growth 
in both the cloud and comms service providers segments, which now make 
up two
-
thirds of DCG revenue. Platform unit volume was up 14% and ASPs 
were up 11%. Non
-
CPU ad
jacencies grew 30% over last year, yet another 
indicator that we are growing share in a larger data
-
centric TAM.
 
We saw continued broad
-
based demand strength this quarter, with customer 
preference for leadership products like Xeon Scalable driving strong m
ix. The 
cloud business, our largest Data Center segment, grew 41% year over year, 
as hyperscale CapEx expands to handle the explosive need to transmit, 
store, and analyze data.
 
Our comms service providers segment grew 30% year over year, as 
customers conti
nue to choose Intel architecture to transform their networks. 
And our enterprise segment was up 10% year over year against a strong IT 
spending environment and prioritized investment in hybrid cloud 
implementations.
 
Our other data
-
centric businesses, IoTG,
 
NSG, and PSG, also achieved 
double
-
digit growth in Q2 and together were up 22% year on year.
 
Our Internet of Things business achieved record volume and record revenue 
of $880 million, up 22% year over year, driven by strength in retail and 
industrial, as 
I mentioned earlier. Operating profit was $243 million, up 75% 
year over year, on higher revenue and flat spending. We expect the Wind 
River divestiture, which closed in the second quarter, will have a negative 
impact to IoT revenue of approximately $150 m
illion in the second half of 
2018.
 
Mobileye also had another strong double
-
digit growth in the quarter, up 37% 
over last year on increasing ADAS adoption.
 
Our memory business delivered more than $1 billion in revenue for the 
second quarter in a row, up 23%
 
year over year. Optane gained momentum 
during the quarter, mostly on client strength, shipping over 1 million client 
Optane memory modules. We expect the memory segment to have full
-
year 
profitability in 2018, as we scale revenue and transition a higher p
ercentage 
of our output to cost
-
effective 64
-
layer 3D NAND.
 
PSG's revenue came in at $517 million, up 18% in Q2, primarily from 
strength in the data center business. PSG's data center segment was up 
140% over last year. In the advanced products category, o
ur 28
-
nanometer, 
20
-
nanometer, and 14
-
nanometer solutions grew 70%. Operating profit was 
$101 million, up 4% year over year.
 
Finally, the Client Computing Group continued to execute on all fronts with 
another outstanding quarter, generating $8.7 billion of
 
revenue, up 6%.
 
Operating margin percent was flat year over year, as the customer 
preference for high
-
performance products drove a strong mix and higher 
ASPs, offset by 10
-
nanometer ramp cost. DCG continues to be an extremely 
important source of IP, scale
, and cash flow for our company.
 
We are executing to our capital allocation priorities of investing organically, 
expanding acquisitively, and returning capital to our shareholders. Year to 
date, we generated $13.7 billion in cash from operations. We invest
ed $7.4 
billion in capital expenditures and delivered $6.3 billion in free cash flow, up 
61% over the first half of last year. We returned well over 100% of our free 
cash flow to our shareholders. Buybacks totaled $5.8 billion, and dividends 
totaled $2.8 b
illion. In addition, settlements of our convertible debt reduced 
fully diluted shares by 12 million.
 
Shifting gears to our full
-
year outlook, our strategy is working, our products 
are winning, and our investments in data center growth are paying off. We 
ar
e now forecasting the midpoint of the revenue range at $69.5 billion, up 
$2 billion versus our expectations in April. This represents a $4.5 billion 
increase versus the expectations we set in January. Product innovation, a 
strong global economy, and U.S. t
ax reform are spurring CIO investment in 
IT infrastructure, leading to higher data center demand and a stronger PC 
TAM.
 
We are seeing demand signals in supply feasibility to deliver on our revised 
expectations. Our biggest challenge in the second half will
 
be meeting 
additional demand, and we are working intently with our customers and our 
factories to be prepared so we are not constraining our customers' growth.
 
Data Center growth is now expected to be approximately 20%, up from our 
April guidance of high 
teens. We now expect operating margin of 
approximately 32%, an increase of 1 point from April. We remain on track to 
our 30% spending goal, a full two years ahead of our original target. Gross 
margin is expected to be up slightly versus our April guidance 
on broad
-
based business strength. And we expect a full
-
year tax rate of roughly 
12.5%, down slightly from our prior estimates.
 
Overall, we expect stronger top line growth, improved operating margins, 
and stronger demand will boost EPS to $4.15, up $0.30 fr
om our estimate in 
April. In response to the stronger demand, we are raising gross CapEx $0.5 
billion to $15 billion, or $13 billion net of memory prepayments. And we are 
now expecting free cash flow of $15 billion, up $0.5 billion from April. And 
we expec
t free cash flow per share as a percentage of EPS to improve by 
more than 10 points over last year. We remain intensely focused on closing 
the gap between free cash flow and EPS and expect to make more progress 
next year.
 
For Q3, we are forecasting the mid
point of the revenue range at $18.1 
billion, up 12% year over year. We expect operating margin of 
approximately 34%, flat versus last year, which reflects about a 1 point 
decrease in gross margin and a roughly 1 point decline in spending. We also 
expect EP
S at $1.15, up 31% excluding equity adjustments, from stronger 
top line growth, spending reductions, and a lower tax rate.
 
Again, last week we celebrated our 50th anniversary and reflected on the 
impact Intel and our ecosystem partners have had on the worl
d. It has been 
nothing short of extraordinary. At the same time, we are even more excited 
about the role Intel will play in technology's future. We're laser
-
focused on 
Intel's opportunity, which is larger than it has ever been. Intel's 
inventiveness, archi
tectural innovation, manufacturing expertise, and 
intense drive have allowed the company to create and capitalize on 
opportunity over the long haul.
 
From the early days of DRAM to the era of the first microprocessors, from 
one architectural battle to the n
ext, and from the PC to the Internet to the 
cloud, Intel has grown and thrived. I'm very excited about what lies ahead 
for the company.
 
With that, let me turn it over to Mark and we'll get to your questions. Thank 
you.

Hi, thank you for taking my question, a quick follow
-
up on 10
-
nanometer. 
When I look at this timeline between now and the Christmas season next 
year, it's 18 
months. It's a very long time to improve your yield. And I have 
two questions on this one. The first one is, could you give us some color on 
what are the most challenging aspects of the process that you need to 
address to improve use? What's the most chall
enging in the 10
-
nanometer 
process? And then my second question is how do you think about the impact 
of these delays on your competitiveness? Where do you think it's going to 
hurt you the most?
 
Venkata S. M. Renduchintala 
-
 
Intel Corp.
 
So let me take that.
 
I think as we look at what we need to do in 10
-
nanometers, again, let me replay some of the data we shared on our April 
call. Recall that 10
-
nanometers strive for a very aggressive density 
improvement target beyond 14
-
nanometers, almost 2.7x scaling. And 
really, 
the challenges that we're facing on 10
-
nanometers is delivering on all the 
revolutionary modules that ultimately deliver on that program. And while 
there's risk and a degree of delay in our timeline on that, we're very pleased 
with the resiliency o
f our 14
-
nanometer roadmap, where in the last few 
years we've delivered in excess of 70% product performance improvement 
as we've moved through our 14
-
nanometer generation of products.
 
So as we look at 2019 across both the client and data center space, we 
feel 
very good about the product competitiveness of our 14
-
nanometer program, 
and that to some degree is factoring into our timing on 10
-
nanometer and 
launching 10
-
nanometer at a point in time where we believe the yields are 
at a level that make it prime f
or volume production. So 14
-
nanometer I 
think through the rest of this year and through 2019 continues, we believe, 
to drive product leadership across all our portfolio in client and server.

Good afternoon, guys. Bob, thank
s for letting me ask a question. Just 
relative to your data center expectations now for the full year, I'm just 
curious. What's been the biggest driver? You're decelerating to mid
-
teens in 
the back half of the year, which is still very impressive. And I gu
ess as you 
talk about the question, and maybe Navin can chime in. Once again, 
enterprise is much better than expected. And the 10% growth I think is 
what you referenced year over year in the June quarter. To what extent is 
that going to be more sustainable
 
as you look into the second half of the 
year and into 2019?
 
Robert Holmes Swan 
-
 
Intel Corp.
 
Thanks, John. I'll start and then have Navin chime in. Q2 data center growth 
was outstanding. We started when we talked to you back in April, we started 
the quart
er out strong. The middle of the quarter was strong, and the end of 
the quarter was strong. So 27% top line growth for data center, we feel very 
good about it and see that momentum continuing into the second half of the 
year.
 
As you know, Q4 last year was 
an outstanding year, so we have slightly 
tougher comps in the fourth quarter, but we're looking at real strong growth 
for the full year. And as I indicated earlier, the strength was across the 
board, cloud up over 40%, comms services up 30%. And specifical
ly to your 
question, enterprise strength continues, not only volume, but the trajectory 
of Xeon Scalable and the adoption of Xeon Scalable has accelerated a little 
bit beyond what we expect to drive real good ASPs.
 
So real good first half, strong outlook f
or the second half across the board, 
and then slightly tougher comps as we go into Q4.
 
Navin Shenoy 
-
 
Intel Corp.
 
The only thing I'd add to that, John, is that the demand is broad
-
based 
across all the segments that Bob talked about. And it's also broad
-
bas
ed in 
terms of our product portfolio. Xeon Scalable we launched about a year ago. 
And it crossed over or getting close to crossing over at about 50% of our 
volume, so a lot of room still to go on Xeon Scalable as we look forward.
 
And as I think about the p
roduct portfolio beyond Xeon Scalable, you might 
have seen this week at the Google Next show, Google talked about adopting 
the Optane Persistent Memory DIMM, so we have that product portfolio 
ahead of us in the second half. And then our next
-
generation Xeo
n will begin 
to ramp in the early part of 2019.
 
So general macroeconomic all
-
segment growth, people applying information 
technology to handle their data problems combined with a very strong 
product portfolio as we look forward.

Stacy Aaron Rasgon

Bernstein Research
 
Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. I guess one question. I wanted to 
ask about gross margins. Your full
-
year guide implies a very significant 
deceleration of gros
s margins in Q4, like 300 bps sequentially, down to 
about 59%. Can you talk about what's driving that sequential decline from 
Q3 to Q4? And do those drivers sustain into 2019? For example, is it 10
-
nanometer or mix or whatever? Can you give us some color o
n what's going 
on there please?
 
Robert Holmes Swan 
-
 
Intel Corp.
 
Thanks, Stacy. First, I think the first half to second half dynamics, we're 
looking at an operating margin improvement by 1.5 to 2 points, so we see 
good solid op margin growth first half to 
second half. The dynamics are the 
gross margin we expect to come down a bit and be more than offset by good 
volume leverage on a relatively stable spending base. So that trend of 
modest gross margin erosion more than offset by spending leverage driving 
op 
income improvement is the trends that you've been seeing for the last six 
to eight quarters, and we expect that to continue into the second half of the 
year.
 
When you look at 

 
implied in our guide for Q4 in particular, a couple things 
going on. One, accel
erating growth of modem as we go through the second 
half of the year, accelerating growth of NSG or memory as we go through 
the second half of the year. We haven't assumed the continued strong ASP 
performance that we've seen through the first half. We hope
 
that turns to be 
conservative, but we'll see how that plays out. And then lastly, to your point 
and Murthy mentioned earlier, we're ramping up 10
-
nanometer to improve 
the yield. So that's going to weigh on gross margins for the fourth quarter as 
well.
 
So 
all things involved, we feel good about op margin expansion. We're up 
500 basis points in the quarter. We'll be up another couple points first half to 
second half. But the gross margin dynamics will weigh on us in the fourth 
quarter, and spending will more
 
than offset it.
 
As we go into 2019, I think the way we've been running the business for the 
last few years, we have dramatically expanded our TAM. And with that TAM, 
we see more and more opportunities to invest and grow, and that growth is 
driving improve
d earnings for the company. At the same time, some of that 
growth has lower gross margins. But that expanded TAM, the higher revenue 
growth on a very well controlled spending base is expanding our op income 
dollars and our earnings per share. So we feel pr
etty good about where we 
are as we exit 2018 and head into 2019 in terms of operating income for the 
business. Thanks, Stacy.

Ross C.

Hi, guys. Thanks for letting me ask a question, I wanted to go back to the 
DCG side of things. Obviously, the 27% year
-
over
-
year growth in 2Q is very 
impressive in both its magnitude and its breadth. But I get a 
ton and an 
increasing amount of questions about competition, whether it's direct 
competition on the x86 CPU side of things, or if it's more indirect competition 
for a greater TAM from accelerators and FPGAs and the GPU compute, those 
sorts of things.
 
So, I
 
don't know if it would be Murthy or Navin, but I'd love to hear how you 
guys are looking at competition, and if you've taken the 10
-
nanometer 
aspect of competition and 7
-
nanometer for those folks off the table. Talk 
about the design side, where you think 
you can take share or there might 
actually be some pressure, and in general, how Intel reacts 4to the optimism 
we're hearing from a number of your aspiring new entrants.
 
Navin Shenoy 
-
 
Intel Corp.
 
Sure, I'll take that. It's Navin here. Look, we feel great 
about our 
competitive position. We came into 2018 expecting a competitive 
environment. And against that backdrop, you've seen the results we've 
delivered over the last two or three quarters. This was our third consecutive 
quarter above 20% growth.
 
And real
ly that reflects our investments that we've made over several years. 
We have a leadership roadmap, not just in CPUs but in, as you pointed out, 
a broad set of additional silicon, from ASICs to FPGA to silicon photonics to 
memory. And our approach really ha
s been to over time increasingly stitch 
all of those assets together to deliver a better solution for our customers. 
And that really sets us apart from everyone that we're competing with, 
where one or another may have one of those solutions but very few ha
ve 

 
in fact, none have that broad portfolio that we've been pursuing.
 
So we are going to be aggressive and competing. We're going to have to go 
out and earn the business, just like we always have every day, every week, 
every month. And as I look at our ro
admap now and as I look at our 
roadmap in the second half and as I look at our roadmap into 2019, I'm very 
confident that we continue to maintain that leadership on that broad 
portfolio of products. So we're set up for a great second half and another 
stron
g growth year as we head into 2019.
 
Ross C. Seymore 
-
 
Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
 
Great, thank you.
 
Robert Holmes Swan 
-
 
Intel Corp.
 
The one thing I'd add, Ross, is on the accelerator side, particularly the 
FPGAs, 18% growth for FPGAs in the quarter, an
d as we mentioned earlier, 
real strong penetration in data center. So that growth has been fueled by 
140% increase in PSG in the data center environment. So I think, Navin, if I 
could, had a choice to make when he took over in the Data Center business, 
and
 
it was protect our large microprocessor share or dramatically expand the 
market and both protect our share as well as participate in a much bigger 
market, and that's how he and the team have been focused. And that's 
resulted in both protection of CPUs but
 
expansion of share and a much 
broader TAM. So again, I'd just close with we feel great about what the team 
is doing in expanding the role we play in the data center and at the edge.

Hey, thanks for taking my question. I just want to ask you about 7
-
nanometer. You mentioned 10
-
nanometer and timing 
there, and I don't 
expect you to put a date out there for 7
-
nanometer. So maybe you could 
talk about what you've learned on 10

nanometer, how you're applying it to 
7
-
nanometer, and any indications of that development, how it's going.
 
Venkata S. M. Renduchi
ntala

Sure. Blayne, so 7
-
nanometer is very much R&D in deep progress, and we're 
making good progress on that development. We're not giving a direct 
timeline right now. But we've also made some fairly judicious choices in 
defining 7
-
nanometer,
 
learning from our 10
-
nanometer experiences. And 
we're focusing on an optimum balance point between density, power and 
performance, and schedule predictability. So I think what you'll see is a 
more balanced approach across those three vectors.
 
So we're sti
ll going to drive density but balancing that with a continued focus 
on driving transistor performance at the same time, which is highly valued 
as ASP drivers both in our client and server businesses. And we're really also 
focusing on being much more precis
e in our ability to launch. So those are 
the key learnings that are coming out of 10
-
nanometer as we go into 7
-
nanometer. And as we monitor progress on 7
-
nanometer just as closely as 
we are on 10
-
nanometer, I feel those lessons are being well absorbed into
 
our progress, and we're lining up to support our product plans as our 
roadmap dictates.

Thanks very much. I actually wanted to go back to the question about gross 
margins in Q4. And I wanted to see if you could segment out the pieces 
because it seems like the modem piece could maybe be a 200 basis point hit 
just by its
elf. So I wondered if you could maybe segment out some of the 
pieces between 10
-
nanometer, between the modem, and between ASP. 
Thank you.
 
Robert Holmes Swan 
-
 
Intel Corp.
 
I presume by segment out, you mean quantify, and my answer will probably 
be 
unfulfilling if that's the case, but I think you hit on the three things. As 
we go into 

 
as we enter the second half and the fourth quarter in particular, 
we see modem accelerating. We have a great product that's getting good 
traction in the modem space, 
so that product is accelerating, and that 
obviously has margins a little lower, NSG growth accelerating going into the 
fourth quarter, those margins are a little bit lower, 10
-
nanometer ramping, 
and that will weigh on gross margins. And lastly, just our ou
tlook for ASPs, 
ASP has been a significant contributor to our high gross margin performance 
over the last couple quarters. Now we've assumed that it won't stay at those 
levels.
 
So those are the four components of segmentation. And then I'd just go 
back to 
with this high growth, we're getting really good leverage and expect 
our operating margins to improve as we go to the back half of the year.

Great, thank you. I was wondering. With DCG, you guys have had an 11% 
ASP increase, and I know there's a lot of noisiness to that. But it's about 
double what you've averaged over the last few years. Is that a Purley e
ffect? 
And if so, do you anniversary that and have less of an ASP increase going 
forward? Just how should I think about the price increases you've seen on 
average?
 
Robert Holmes Swan 
-
 
Intel Corp.
 
Joe, the ASP strength that we've seen actually really most 
of this year is a 
reflection of what we see our customers doing across the board. All of them 
are buying our highest performance products. There's this insatiable appetite 
for performance on all the workloads that they're looking at.
 
Certainly we did expec
t the transition to Purley to be accretive to us from an 
ASP point of view. But if I look at our broad portfolio of products, our ASPs 
look very good. And year on year our ASPs look good in the other parts of 
our products as well, Broadwell for example. So
 
in general, we're just seeing 
an almost insatiable appetite for the best products, the highest performing 
products that we have, and I don't see that slowing down as I look forward.

Hi, thank you. Bob, I just wanted to go back to the comments you were 
making as you were concluding
 
your prepared remarks about demand 
challenges in the second half. Is that specific to client, servers? And where is 
that coming from? And then more importantly, does that open up another 

 
or a window for a competitor to wedge in and take some share from 
you? 
Thank you.
 
Robert Holmes Swan 
-
 
Intel Corp.
 
When we started the year, our outlook for the year was $65 billion in 
revenue. And six months through the year, given strong demand, across the 
board actually, both servers and PCs, real strong demand had us
 
raise our 
outlook by $4.5 billion for the year. So we feel very good about the demand 
signals we see at the $69.5 billion level. We feel very good about having the 
supply in place for that fairly significant demand increase.
 
And now as we go to the back h
alf of the year, to the extent demand 
continues to increase, which I'd say it has almost month to month the first 
six months of the year, we need to work with our customers and our fabs to 
make sure that we continue to have the capacity to fill demand to t
he extent 
that it rises beyond the $69.5 billion level.
 
So we're working closely with our customer base, both on the server and the 
PC side, and very closely with our internal teams to make sure we're not a 
constraint to the extent that demand in the secon
d half of the year continues 
to go up like it has through the first six months of the year, and just to fill 
that demand along the way and not give others the opportunity to fill it for 
us.

Thanks, guys, just a quick one on the DCG op margins. So data center rev 
was u
p sequentially, but the op margins were down. I think you talked about 
the 10
-
nanometer yield issues. Was that all that was going on there? And so 
essentially, are DCG operating margins capped at this 49% and change 
level? And when are these 10
-
nanometer h
eadwinds going to go away and 
reverse and start to become tailwinds?
 
Robert Holmes Swan 
-
 
Intel Corp.
 
So just to maybe repeat, 27% top line growth and 65% operating income 
growth with an 11 point improvement in operating margins year on year. So 
outstandin
g performance on product margin, as Navin indicated, particularly 
with strong ASP performance. Our margins have continued to improve, and 
I'd just say not at the expense of curtailing investments for our data center 
business. We see real good growth opport
unities and we continue to invest, 
so really good expansion in margin performance while continuing to invest.
 
In terms of 10
-
nanometer, that is more 

 
again, with client being first on 
10

Hey, Murthy, you might have actually answered this with your ""shortly after"" 
comment. But given some competitive threats in server in particu
lar, are 
you guys thinking that you might ramp 10
-
nanometer server more quickly 
than you traditionally would after PC?
 
Venkata S. M. Renduchintala 
-
 
Intel Corp.
 
In general, we're going to see a much shorter ramp period between our 
products going forward in
 
client and server. So yes, I think it's a good 
observation that as we talk about client systems on shelf by the second half 
of 2018, you shouldn't expect too much of a delay before you see data 
center products coming out.
 
So much closer proximity, albeit 
slightly delayed than we expected on 10
-
nanometer, and then you should see that pretty much improve to almost 
parity of launches as we get into later technologies. So the traditional model 
of server following rather lengthily after client is probably going
 
to become 
more sequential going forward.

Great, thanks for taking my questions. Sorry about the gaffe earlier. A 
question for you on your evolving manufacturing strategy. It sounds like as 
opposed to copying exactly, we're moving to a world where you would 
consider building both 14
-
nanometer
 
and 10
-
nanometer in the same factory. 
So curious what the implications of such a move are to gross margins and 
capital intensity as we look ahead.
 
Robert Holmes Swan 
-
 
Intel Corp.
 
I think obviously from node to node over the last several nodes, frankly, t
he 
capital intensity of the business with each node has increased over time. At 
the same time, the amount of reuse of equipment and tools from one node 
to the next is extremely high. So with the exception of particularly 10
-
nanometer going to 7
-
nanometer, 
litho changing quite a bit with EUV, with 
each node, even with more capital intensity, we have relatively high reuse 
and we can leverage the tools for longer and longer.
 
So in terms of implications on gross margin, I'd just say it's a function of 
product l
eadership and maintaining that product leadership. And Navin 
talked about how customers are looking for high performance, and the ASPs 
associated with that high performance allows us to continue to generate 
extremely attractive gross margins despite increa
sed capital intensity as you 
go to each node.

I just wanted to add to Bob's perspective. The way I look at our roadmap, 
what we're really focused on is deliv
ering product leadership generation after 
generation, and that's the system level. And while processes are a very 
important part of that recipe, so are the other ingredients as well, such as 
product architecture, silicon design, and packaging.
 
And to Bob's
 
point, as we look towards our roadmap, gross margin 
maximization is going to come from delivering excellence that drives 
performance, and therefore we're taking a very balanced view in all the 
ingredients that go into that. So you should expect in our roa
dmap going 
forward a much longer overlap between generations of technology as we try 
and make sure that, along with process, we add the other ingredients of 
technology leadership that will become more and more apparent.

Thanks for

drag in the future? And can you frame it how long tha
t would be?

Yes, first we've been

In terms of modem in 
particular, yes, we do expect to improve gross 
margins for our modem business, both with our 7560 product that will begin 
to ship in the second half. But also as we migrate to a 5G world, we expect 
margins in the modem business to continue to improve. So y

Hi, good afternoon. So looking at the fact that you're ramping for the first

So as we see our customer relationships going forward, you'll probably see a 
lot more co

their delivery and their interworking with the product port
folio that Navin

Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to Intel Corporation Second 
Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a 
listen
-

-
and
-
answer session and 
instructions will be given at that time. (Operator Instructions). As a 

 
I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Mark Henninger, Head of 
Intel Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.
 
Mark Henni
nger
 
Thank you, Saied, and welcome everyone to Intel's second quarter 2014 
earnings conference call.
 
By now, you should have received a copy of our earnings release and the 
CFO commentary that goes along with it. If you've not received both 
documents, they
're available on our investor website, intc.com.
 
I'm joined today by Brian Krzanich, our CEO; and Stacy Smith, our Chief 
Financial Officer. In a moment, we'll hear brief remarks from both of them 
followed by Q&A.
 
Before we begin, let me remind everyone tha
t today's discussions contain 
forward
-
looking statements based on the environment as we currently see it 
and as such, does include risks and uncertainties.
 
Please refer to our press release for more information on the risk factors 
that could cause actual r
esults to differ materially. Also, if during this call we 
use any non
-
GAAP financial measures or references, we'll post the 
appropriate GAAP financial reconciliation to our investor website, intc.com.
 
So with that, let me hand it over to Brian.

Thanks, Mark. The second quarter exceeded our expectations. The improving 
economic environment, PC refresh, form factor innovation and the end
-
of
-
life of Windows XP combined to drive better than expected demand. In fact 
microprocessor volume in the 
second quarter was an all
-
time record.
 
From the most powerful supercomputers to the smallest energy
-
efficient 
embedded machines, the breadth and strength of our results suggest that 

co
nsecutive quarter of year
-
over
-
year unit growth. In Q2, both the desktop 
platform revenue and the notebook platform revenue grew year
-
over
-
year.
 
The installed base of PCs that are at least four years old is now roughly 600 
million units and we are seeing c
lear signs of a refresh in the enterprise in 
small and medium businesses. While there are some signs of renewed 
consumer interest and activity, the consumer segment remains challenging, 
primarily in the emerging markets.
 
The Bay Trail family of SoCs has be
en a standout that has helped us expand 

much smaller and lower cost Atom based core in our Pentium and Celeron 
brands for the first time. Our Bay Trail SoC volume in desktops and clam
 
shells more than doubled over the last quarter and now represents more 
than 60% of our Pentium and Celeron mix and nearly 20% of our notebook 
mix.
 
This is enabling our growth at lower price points and in new segments like 
Chrome
-
based systems without sacr
ificing margin. The data center business 
had a strong quarter with 19% growth year
-
over
-
year leading to all
-
time 

-
based Xeon E7 processor family, we saw strong NP volume and a ri
cher 
product mix and ASP mix.
 
Cloud, networking, high
-
performance computing and enterprise revenue all 
grew more than 15% in the second quarter. Demand and revenue growth in 
several segments demonstrated the growing reach of Intel technology 
beyond CPUs fo
r PCs and servers. Our Internet of Things Group grew 24% 
year
-
over
-
year and set a revenue record, as the retail and manufacturing 
sectors performed especially well. NAND revenue grew 20% and McAfee 
revenue grew 5%.
 
Finally, we are squarely on track to our 
40
-
million
-
unit tablet goal shipping 
10 million units in the second quarter. We also achieved some important 
milestones during the quarter. We qualified the first Broadwell
-
based Core M 
processors and at Computex we highlighted the form factor innovation t

Stacy will talk more, specifically about our plan, but this change to our 
capital structure and allocation is a direct result of our ongoing commitment

capital.
 
With that, let me turn the call over to Stacy.
 
Stacy J. Smith
 
Thanks, Brian. The second quarter came in above the expectations we 
provided in the April earnings call and consistent with the revised outlook we 
released on June 12. I
t was a good quarter representing financial growth 
and solid momentum as we enter the second half of the year.
 
Focusing on our second quarter results, revenue came in at $13.8 billion, up 
8% from a year ago. Both the PC Client Group and the Data Center Gro
up 
achieved better growth than we expected at the beginning of the quarter. PC 
Client Group revenue was up 6% from a year ago.
 
We saw PC Client Group platform unit volumes grow 9% year
-
over
-
year and 
inclusive of tablets, we saw almost 20% unit growth. PC p
latform average 
selling prices declined 4% on a year
-
on
-
year basis. Our Data Center group 
revenue grew 19% from the year ago with platform volumes up 9% and 
platform average selling prices up 11% over the same period.
 
Looking beyond the PC and data center businesses, the mobile and 
communications group is down 83% from the year ago. The underlying 
dynamics are consistent with what we shared at the investor meeting last 
November. We are ahead of our expectations in table
t volume but the billing 
increase is being offset with an increase in contra revenue dollars.
 
We are seeing a decline in our feature phone and 2G/3G multi
-
comm 
business as the industry transitioned to integrated LTE solutions. The 
Internet of Things Group 
is up 24% year
-
on
-
year. We continue to see robust 
growth across segments with particular strength in the retail and 
manufacturing segments.
 
Gross margin of 64.5% was up almost five points from the first quarter and 
one a half points above our original Q2 g
uidance. The five
-
point increase 
relative to the first quarter is due to lower 14
-
nanometer start
-
up costs, 
higher platform volumes and lower platform unit costs. Spending came in at 
$4.9 billion in line with our revised outlook provided on June 12.
 
Net in
come for the second quarter was $2.8 billion, up 40% from the year 
ago and earnings per share was $0.55, up 41% from the year ago. The 
business continued to generate significant cash with over $5 billion of cash 
from operations in Q2. We purchased $2.8 bil
lion in capital assets, paid $1.1 
billion in dividends and repurchased over $2 billion of stock.
 
Total cash balance at the end of the quarter was roughly $17 billion, down 
approximately $1.7 billion from the prior quarter. Our net cash balance, total 
cash 
less debt, is approximately $4 billion, and inclusive of our other longer 
term investments is closer to $7.5 billion.
 
Our capital allocation philosophy is to first invest in our business, then 
generate shareholder return through our dividend and then to re
turn cash to 
shareholders via stock repurchases. Our business generates healthy free 
cash flow through economic cycles but as a result of this capital allocation 
philosophy, we have brought down our net cash balances plus longer term 
investments from over 
$23 billion in 2010 to around $7.5 billion today.
 
We plan to continue our journey returning cash to our shareholders by 
adjusting our capital structure to further bring down our net cash balances. 
The intention is to repurchase $4 billion of stock in the t
hird quarter with 
additional buybacks in Q4. This strategy enables the sufficient liquidity for 
our operations and provides strategic flexibility to invest in our business 
while continuing to return cash to our shareholders.
 
As we look forward to the third
 
quarter of 2014, we are forecasting the 
midpoint of the revenue range at $14.4 billion, up 4% from the second 
quarter. This forecast is in line with the average seasonal increase for the 
third quarter that we are seeing over the last several years.
 
We are
 
forecasting the midpoint of the gross margin range for the third 
quarter to be 66%. The one and a half point increase from the second 
quarter is primarily driven by lower platform unit costs and higher platform 
volumes. This is partially offset by lower p
latform average selling prices.
 
Turning to full year 2014, we are planning for revenue growth relative to last 
year. This is approximately 5%. We are forecasting the midpoint of our gross 
margin range at 63%, up two points from the midpoint of the outlook 
provided on April 15. This increase is primarily driven by lower platform unit 
costs, higher platform volumes partially offset by lower platform average 
selling prices.
 
As I reflect on the first half of 2014, I believe the strategy that we put in 
place for
 
this year are playing out nicely to extend the reach of Intel 
technologies across the spectrum of the smallest embedded devices to the 
most powerful supercomputers. We have seen better than expected trends 
in the overall PC market but strength in both non
-
consumer and desktop 
segments.
 

-
in
-
one devices and lower price points and we 
are growing our market segment share. We have brought new products into 
the data center which drive a strong return on investment for our customers 
t
o upgrade their infrastructure and we are benefitting from both our product 
line up and the build out of the cloud.
 
The Internet of Things business is growing fast as we bring intelligence to 
more and more devices and we are making investments in communica
tions 
and tablets that benefit the breadth of our businesses and set us up for 
improving financial results going forward. As a result of these trends and our 

flow and we were return
ing more of that cash to our shareholders.
 
With that, let me turn it back over to Mark.

Thank you for taking my question. I have the first question on the PC side 
and the second one on smartphones. So, Brian, on the PC side, obviously a 
good growth in enterprise and obvious question is how long does that 
last? 
And then I think you had mentioned in your comments that the consumer 
has not yet recovered and the industry has tried lots of things, different form 
factors, price points, et cetera, but it has not seem to revive the consumer. 
So what will it take t
o revive the consumer side because that will be an 
important factor for next year on the PC market?
 
Brian M. Krzanich
 
Sure. So let me try and answer your questions. The first one was good 
growth on the enterprise side, small and medium business, how long w
ill it 

-

factors, the 600 million systems four years or older, new price points and 
Windows XP end
-
of
-
life. So all of those things are coming together to drive 
this. We see it at least
 


part of your question was what does it take to reinvigorate the consumer? 

lf of this year to work on 
that; everything from marketing to really 

 
we talked about in the call, the 
Core M Broadwells, those are going to allow really a whole new class of 

two
-
in
-
one devices but they now become fanless, ultrathin, very portable, 
long
-
battery life, strong Core performance or Core like performance. We 
believe that will bring another class of system into the market as well along 
with just an overall general refresh o
f many, many of the form factors. We 
think that all of those things will start to move it but that is part of why we 

through the second half of this year.

Great, thank you. It was really nice gross margin guidance and if I look back 
historically a couple of years ago and I think four years ago, you h
ad some 
gross margin headwinds in midyear when you ramped all of the fabs in the 

headwinds in Q3. Am I thinking about that the right way and is there still 
some cost of ramping 14

to maintain on the balance sheet?
 
Stacy J. Smith
 

actually going to give you a ton of clarity on the timeline to the 20 billion, 
but if you think about this as a multiyear focus that w

can see this playing out. And if you go back to 2010, as I said in my 
prepared remarks, and you look at net cash plus some of the other 
investments the treasury group makes, we had a net cash balance that was 
running in the mid
-
to
-
hig
h 20s back then. We brought it down to sub 10 as 

-
tested our 
business in terms of cash generation through things like the economic 

free cash flow 

taking the next step there to bring cash balances down further. From my 

just gave, some
thing around 0 net cash, it still gives us a positive gross cash 
balance. We have plenty of cash for strategic reasons and operational 
reasons. That feels like a pretty comfortable number. And then to do that 

he 2 billion that we executed 

that, and that will get us pretty close to that goal. And then you can do the 
math of cash generation next year and kind of figure out how in your model
 

over the next six months.

Brian and Stacy, congratulations on the strong results. Brian, I guess my 
first question is just whether or not you can go into a little bit more detail 
into DCG and with AS
Ps being up 11%, I know you gave us some color in 
your commentary but I am kind of curious to what extent was that a better 
mix of enterprise, was it hyper scale mixing up even more than they did in 
the calendar first quarter? And to the extent that you sa
id the Grantley 

see that ramp playing out and how accretive that might be to the data 
center business?
 
Brian M. Krzanich
 

 
a mix of the 
product and then how the financials roll into that as well. I think if you just 
take a look, what we said if you look back at the remarks, we said almost all 
of the segments of the enterprise were up 15%. That was a mix of volume 
and ASPs acr

go until this quarter, but we did continue to launch the E7 during this 
quarter and see that ramp, which definitely helps our ASP and overall 
product mix.
 
Every one of these launches is a littl
e bit different. They always have a mix 
of kind of what are our customers doing? If you just take a look at the data 
center volume in general, it tends to be a bit lumpy. There were big orders 

r or a cloud 
order or an enterprise order, they tend to come in big pieces. And so as we 


basis when we look 
at something like a Grantley launch. We really look at it 

to be a very powerful product. But exactly how that transition will occur, we 

a quarterly basis.
 
Stacy J. Smith
 
If I may just add a couple of things, John. So in terms of the Q2 ASP uplift, 

mind we are shipping and selling Grantley today into cloud and HPC
 
customers and we saw the E7 moving into production. So, we had a 
combination of things in the second quarter and I think where Brian was 


rate when we move into the back 
half but not 19%. We think there was some specific purchasing going on 

we get into the back half.
 
John Pitzer 
-
 
Credit Suisse
 

. Then Stacy going to solving the algebra equation for 
Q4 gross margins, it kind of implies gross margins could be down as much 
as 400 basis points sequentially from doing the math right and that would be 
about 2x kind of the hit you saw as you were rampin
g the 22
-
nanometer 


how 14 is going and how Broadwell is going in the popular press, so I am 
wondering if you
 

seeing in the calendar fourth quarter are kind of as expected and generally 
just kind of characterize how that 14
-
nanometer Broadwell ramp is going 
from your perspective?
 
Stacy J. Smith
 

let Brian come in on the 14
-

algebra. So first I think we have to be careful not to get trapped in the 


 




 
either way Broadwell is rolling out of 

 
cause 


happening in the fourth quarter. In terms of 14
-

that more from the ope
rational standpoint.
 
Brian M. Krzanich
 
Yes, 14
-

would during this quarter qualify and we did qualify our 14
-
nanometer 
product and we actually are shipping product today to our customers and 
partners. We said we would have products on shelves for the holiday season 

product on shelf in the holiday. We talked to you about this. We focused on 
Core M which is the Broadwell par
t that we think really highlights the power 
of 14 nanometers and the Broadwell architecture. As I said, it will be the 
first class of core level PC products that are fanless. We talked to you about 
the Llama Mountain product 7.2 millimeters thick, 24 ounce
s in weight, 
fanless. Those are going to be devices that we think will start to transform 
how people think about a two
-
in
-
one device in the PC versus the tablet. 

launch and ramp as we
 
go through 2015.

Hi, guys. Congr
atulations. Thanks for letting me ask a question. You guys, 
Stacy, have been real helpful in giving us some idea on the algebra for the 
gross margins in the fourth quarter. If I do the same on the revenues, it 
looks like kind of flattish revenues which sho
uld be a little bit below 
seasonal. You guys have done a great job executing versus your plan in the 

or is that more of a function of kind of the XP end
-
of
-
life which Brian 
referre
d to sort of playing itself out? Thank you.
 
Stacy J. Smith
 



ing from our customers is 


for a while yet. And so what we have in for Q3 is a roughly seasonal third 
quarter



some great devices coming to the mar


enabling with Bay Trial in terms of touch enabled clam shells. We think that 
those will share and drive excitement in the market but we just h
ave to 
watch it.
 
Brian M. Krzanich
 
Jim, the only thing I would add is what I said was we believe the XP end

Hi, guys. One clarification I think might be helpful to people. Can you just 
give us a rough idea in your PC Client Group how much of that is the 
commercial side and how much is consumer?
 
Brian M. Krzanich
 
Of the overall 

 
are you saying how much is of 
the business?
 
Stacy J. Smith
 



rket is a 
shift. If you go back four or five years, it was kind of 60% plus business and 


 
Brian M. Krzanich
 
That i

percentage, especially small and medium business, they go into the same 
place consumers do a lot to buy a system. So tracking where did that 
system end up is a bit difficult, but 60
-
40 is pro
bably not far off.
 
Ross Seymore

I guess really what I was getting at is that representative for Intel as well or 
are you a little more skewed? I realize you have the dominant market share, 


 

approximation?

Yes, that would be indicative of our mix. I mean our mix is going to look like 

 
Ross Seymore

Deutsche Bank
 

you guys, Stacy you talked 
in an earlier question, I think John asked about 
the gross margin in the fourth quarter and how much it was implied being 
down. When you have those multiple fabs ramping it 14
-
nanometer, can you 
walk us through what a typical duration is of that higher cos
t inventory 
working its way through before the lower cost benefits actually start to kick 
in?
 
Stacy J. Smith
 

from qualification for sale you have the phenomenon of a big facto

fully equipped with pretty small amounts of volume going through it. But we 

a point until the factories are ramped and then the cost would continue to 
come down for a
nother 12 months or so after that.

Thanks very much. With the 
current schedule for the Broadwell ramp on 14 
nanometers, what are your expectations for 10

nanometer timing? And will 
there be a follow
-
on 14
-
nanometer family after Broadwell or would you go 
straight to 10 nanometers?
 
Brian M. Krzanich
 
So let me try to an

on 14 nanometers. We always remember to do a Tick
-
Tock kind of products, 
plus we do a refresh of the Atom line typically, so we have Cherry Trail 
coming in at the end of this year and ramping in the
 
first half. We have 
Broxton which is the follow
-
on Atom product as well and then the [Talk] [ph] 
or the real architectural shift on 14 nanometers is SkyLake which is also 
scheduled for '15. We have done no changes or shift to our 10
-
nanometer 
schedule but
 

-
nanometer schedules until next 
year.
 
David Wong

Wells Fargo
 
Okay, great. And could you give us any numbers on your 4G baseband, until 
shipments or revenue for June and the growth momentum going into 
September for 4G baseban
ds?
 
Stacy J. Smith
 
Well, LTE and this is pretty consistent with what we had showed at the 

his remarks, so a little bit later than we thought. So we kind of thought it 
was going
 


this year or early next year. And in the meantime the market is transitioning 
part away from the 2G/3G platform t
o LTE. So that part of the curve is 
consistent with what we saw and you can see it in our overall revenue 
results from the second quarter for the segment.

Mike McConnell

Pacific Crest Securities
 
Thank you, guys. Looking at just the traditional enterprise segment of DCG, 
it is encouraging to see that recov
ery here in Q2. Regarding sustainability 
with Grantley kind of coming out this fall and then Microsoft planning to end
-
of
-
life Windows Server 2003 in July, can you comment on kind of the 
sustainability within that bucket within DCG? Are you getting more co
nfident 
that we could see multiple quarters of a recovery there please?
 
Brian M. Krzanich
 

general and this gets back to that comment we made earlier about just the 
lumpiness of each one of these segments. We said that we believe we can 
continue to grow the data center in the low double digits out into time of 
which the enterprise is a portion of that. As we said, this quarter was 
extremely strong in the enterprise an


 
there was a 
lumpiness or kind of a pattern to the orders where customers came in and 


-
ish single digits g
rowth 

be a good product. The enterprise so we think is still going to grow in about 
that mid range.
 
Mike McConnell 
-
 
Pacific Crest Securities
 
Okay. And then just for my follow
-
up, 
I wanted to ask about market share in 
Q2. If I look at PCG, volumes were up about 4% year
-
over
-
year; IDC just 
reported about a 2% decline in overall PC sales and you had some pretty 
optimistic commentary on volumes for Bay Trial on the desktop and the 
note
book side. So that growth relative to the market, that outsized growth, 
was that mostly market share gain or was it something else to do with 
maybe inventory build, et cetera?
 
Stacy J. Smith
 

r to us that we 



-
in
-
one type touch enabled clam shell into 
these price poi

as you look at this in terms of year
-
on
-
year comparisons, if you recall last 
year what we saw is that our customers were managing inventories very, 
very lean. I think they had very little co
nfidence in a back half seasonal 
selling season and so part of it is just the year
-
on
-
year comparison. What 


those 
two things.

Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.
 
Guys, thanks for taki
ng my questions. I had a first question on the tablets 


driver for Q3. Is this a function of the tablet volum
e or is this a function of 
contra revenues rolling off? I think they were supposed to start to decline as 
we go through the year. Any color you could give us on that would be 
helpful?
 
Brian M. Krzanich
 
So let me start with just kind of an overall, Stacy, d
iscussion on the tablets 

discussion. We are on schedule for our 40 million. We did 10 million in Q2, 
so we did roughly 5 million in the first quarter, 10 million in the second 
quarter. So yo
u can kind of break out how the rest of the 40 million come in 
Q3 and Q4 with clearly Q4 being probably the bigger of the two quarters 
remaining. We did say that we would continue to drive down our cost and 

that. Bay Trail adds to that 
capability. As we exit this year we said they were on schedule with SoFIA. 
SoFIA is a fully integrated part really designed for this segment. That allows 
us to move into '15 with a much, much better cost structure and really dr
ive 
down the contra revenue to near 0 on those products. So, we are on 


how contra is reported versus the mar
gin.
 
Stacy J. Smith
 

me walk you through it. First, we saw more or less a full point of margin in 
Q2 associated with our ramp of tablets. If you think about the volume curve 
t

to anchor. We did 15 in the first half that we did 10 in Q2. That says we 

really that linear but ju
st take that for the sake of argument. The change 


have been on my gross margin recon.
 
Stacy Rasgon 
-
 
Sanfor
d C. Bernstein & Co.
 

 
Stacy J. Smith
 
Yes, exactly. So you saw the big change in Q1 to Q2 where it was kind of a 
full point of gross margin impact. It was a little hidden 

 


little hidden and the fact that we were up five points quarter
-
on
-
quarter.
 
Stacy Rasgon

Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.

up question I wanted to dig into mobile a 

he rest of the

wondering if you could give us more of a feeling for how mobile presence fits 
into the lon
g
-

available or is this a strategic imperative for the rest of your business is to 
succeed here? I guess what milestone should we be looking for and how do 
you see the loss rate in this business
 
trending I guess into the second half 
and into 2015? This is presumably some of the new products that are in 4G 
hopefully start to ramp.
 
Brian M. Krzanich
 

side. To answer your q

go into businesses to lose money and we believe that over time we can 
make this a profitable business. We have some ground to make up both in 
getting our LTE to Cat6 and in our products being specif
ically designed for 
this segment. We said we moved some of the early products Clover Trail and 
Bay Trail that were really targeted towards clam shells and almost the 
netbook era down into this space to get there quickly. And as we turn into 
SoFIA next year
 


become profitable in this space. But aside from that, this is we believe a 

ll of our products have become 

work their way into PCs, for example, especially two
-
in
-

going to probably start with Chromebooks. Chromebooks are best when they 
are connect
ed and so all these connected requirements are going to drive 
modems into there, for example. But you can go from a PC down through 
tablets, phones and into the Internet of Things in the industrial space where 

dle of the desert someplace or 

back into the system. So we believe modems and connectivity in this space 
is critical to almost every segment of our business, but we also believe t
hat 
we can be in this mobile space and make money. We just got to get our 
products there and get the right price structures.

Thank you. Great quarter. I was hoping for

th
 

segment level much less at a consumer versus enterprise inside to segment. 


en which is relatively stronger, enterprise 
relatively stronger, mature markets are kind of the more dominant factors in 

and continue to see some weakness in emerging markets. But non

those trends.

Nomura Securities
 
Okay, thanks. And my follow
-
up is on the buyback and trying to figure out 
the pace of the $20 billion repurchase, Stacy, you share
d with us that 
roughly 6 billion is in U.S. cash which is about a third of your total cash 
balance. If I just flow that through to cash flow, it would imply roughly 2 
billion a quarter in U.S. cash flow before 1 billion in dividend and the CapEx 
commitment

buyback without going into a net debt position? Appreciate your perspective 
on that.
 
Stacy J. Smith
 

would look a


generating cash and a reasonable amount of cash is available to me in the 
U.S. Just simple math; net of any cash ge


reasonable amount of potential to do another leg of this buyback in Q4. Did 
that answer your question?

Thanks. Congratulations on the quarter. Brian, just going back 
to the 14
-
nanometer Broadwell, the availability to OEMs in the first half of 2015 seems 
to be about a year late. I understand that you made comments about Core 

portfolio of Broadw
ell products? And the follow
-
up is what does that do if 
anything to the cadence without Tick
-
Tock? Thanks.
 
Brian M. Krzanich
 

We targeted Broadwell and the Core M because we real

product that highlights the real power of 14 nanometers and Broadwell, 

highly mobile systems which is really going to differentiate I think in my 
mind 14
-
nanom
eter from prior technologies. But it will be the technology 
that brought the fanless PC to your laptop. Every one of these process nodes 
that we do takes 

 
if you take a look at it going all the way out through the 
mobile products, the desktop products, th
e server products, the Atom 

you, every one of these. By the time you get to the E7 version and look 

tech



between our customers and OEM partners
, availability and readiness to do a

have a set of criteria that we use on every technology, so to be shipping to 


on shelf.

ymond James
 
Okay. And just a follow
-
up, does that delay SkyLake by six months?
 
Brian M. Krzanich
 





 
as we launch these other 
Broadwell products (indiscernible) consumers, everybody, when are they 
ready for SkyLink. That will drive it as
 
much as anything on the process 
readiness and the product readiness.

FBR Capital Markets
 
Hi, guys. Great quarter. Thanks for letting me ask a question. I missed a 
brief segment there, so forgive me if this was asked, but on PC guidance and 
oper
ating profits for the PC segment, you guys previously said down, I think 
it was mid single digits there and Op profits were flat and I guess given the 
strong results here and guidance, can you update us for the year?
 
Stacy J. Smith
 
Sure. I would say that g
uidance is no longer valid based on what we saw in 
the first half. So on the PC market if you go and look at some of the third 

divergent at this point but some of the ones I was lo
oking at earlier today 

things like Chromebooks and two
-
in
-



see we believe some unit growth based on the things we talked about 
earlier, more normal inventory levels and more importantly some share gain 

granular than that and it probably won


 
Christopher Rolland

FBR Capital Markets
 
Okay. Last time I looked I think Gartner was down maybe 3% so that 
discrepancy is growing pretty dramatically th

 
Stacy J. Smith
 

form factors all coming together and so you have to get really precise about 
what you call a PC Client. In our PCG results we would include Chromebooks, 
we would
 
include two
-
in
-
ones, things like the Microsoft Surface, we would 
include detachable; so the definitions become pretty important here in terms 
of what are they telling versus what shows up in PCG.
 
Christopher Rolland 
-
 
FBR Capital Markets
 
Okay, great. And 
then on the 4% sequential growth for next quarter, maybe 
you guys can give us a little color on sort of first rank perhaps those 
segments where you see the most strength?
 
Mark Henninger
 

just want to 
remind everyone we ask people to ask just one question and one follow
-
up. 
Thanks.
 
Stacy J. Smith
 

 
Christopher Rolland 
-
 
FBR Capital Markets
 
Yes, just some color on the 4% sequential growth for next q
uarter, how that 
sort of shakes up between the segments?
 
Stacy J. Smith
 


several years and it kind of
 
feels like the right place to be after a fairly 
strong first half.
 
Christopher Rolland

All right, thanks, guys. Great quarter.
 
Brian M. Krzanich

manufacturing lead. Any other impro
vements in your foundry offerings or 
collateral as you target the next node? It seems the window is closing here 
to go after some new 14
-
nanometer customers?
 
Brian M. Krzanich
 

discussio

agree that the window is closing in on 14 nanometers. We have already 

-
nanometer from all 
segments both from our own efforts into the mobi
le space, our partnerships 

design like synopsis and cadence. So we are carrying that off into the 10
-
nanometer space and we already have people that are talking to us about 
10
-
nan

-
nanometer 
window is closing. I mean if you still take a look at the 14
-
nanometer 

the only company on the planet who is s
hipping a (indiscernible) transistor 

-
nanometer products. So I think our leadership is 

 

where people could still jump in and have a leadership product.
 
Ian Ing

MKM 
Partners
 
Okay. Thanks, Brian. And then a housekeeping for Stacy, domestic versus 
overseas cash, is there a mix there and should there be a repatriation 
holiday? Would that free up even more cash for buybacks and dividends or 
are those already being investe
d overseas?
 
Stacy J. Smith
 
So there is a mix and we disclose it. If you look at domestic cash and this is 

order of 6 billion out of the total. In terms of our priorities from the 
stan
dpoint of tax reform, we actually like to see a more comprehensive tax 
reform for corporations that bring down our tax rate to make it more in line 


so the manufacturing credits become 
important. We think those help us create jobs here in the U.S. The cash 
piece for us is less important than it is for maybe others because remember 
we generate cash all over the world but we also make investments all ove
r 
the world. We have factories in Ireland and Israel and China and the U.S. 

cash problem that companies do that have minimal operations outside the 
U.S.

Brian Krzanich
 
Thanks Mark. Our
 
third quarter results were consistent with our expectations 
and included a number of important milestones. Revenue and earnings per 
share both set new records with strong performances from the PC and the 
Data Center groups. The trends we observed in the P
C market last quarter 
continued the stability in mature markets offset by ongoing declines in 
emerging markets.
 
The PC Client Group launched Core M, a new family of products with full core 
performance in both compute and graphics in a fanless design, enabl
ing 
breakthrough designs and form factors. The first of these systems will be 
available by the end of this month.
 
In the Data Center, we saw double
-
digit revenue growth across all four 
major market segments. Enterprise grew 11%; networking grew 16%; and 
HP
C; and cloud service providers grew 22% and 34%, respectively. We also 
launched the new Xeon E5 processor, formerly known as Grantley. This 
product family provides leadership, features and performance for compute; 
storage and network workloads. Formally la
unched just five weeks ago, E5 is 
already 10% of our DP or two
-
socket volume.
 
In the Mobile and Communications Group, losses declined sequentially and 

million units and we remain on trac
k to our 40 million unit goal for 2014. 
Third parties estimate that we are now the second largest tablet [assesses] 
vendor worldwide and the largest among merchant suppliers.
 
In addition, Samsung chose our Cat6 LTE modem with carrier aggregation 
known as t
he 7260, which recently announced Galaxy Alpha and Galaxy 
Note 4. The strategic importance of these capabilities continues to grow. Our 
LTE technology, which we originally developed for phone is becoming 
increasingly valuable in tablets and even PCs as wir
eless wide area network 
connectivity becomes increasingly common. We estimate for example that 
by 2018 the rate of baseband attached to tablets will roughly double and 
that PCs will rise to more than 15%.

an important work left to do. Within our factory network 14

across a remarkably wide range of products. We sold record volumes of PC, 
server, Internet of Things, phone and tablet products. The diversity and 
scale of our products unique
ly position us across the breadth of devices that 
competes and connects.
 
Importantly, our results demonstrate that we are building on our success in 
the PC and Data Center segments to successfully pursue adjacent 
opportunities. These businesses are the sou
rce of tremendous intellectual 
property and that IP creates valuable and important synergies that position 
us to compete in an increasingly diverse computing market.
 

Dell Venue wi
th Intel RealSense technology. It has an industry first 3D 
camera that enables features like after effect focusing and a host of 
capabilities that have the potential to change how people engage with their 
photography. That technology was first developed fo
r PCs and was adapted 

because we invested in next generation technology for PCs.
 
Another example of IP synergy is the Atom microarchitecture. We first

purposely evolved that IP to the point that it now spans from smartphones 
to tablets and mainstream PCs and from storage, networking and compute 
devices in the data center to the Internet of Things.
 
Lastly 


capabilities in emerging sectors like wearables before they become 
mainstream. The data center team is customizing 
our Xeon products for 
specific customers and workloads. Custom SKUs now number roughly 35 and 
over the last year volume from custom SKUs has grown at 3x the rate of our 

agreement. Our 
recently announced collaborations with Rockchip and more 
recently, Spreadtrum will provide new sources of innovation and a new set 
of partners that will work with us to scale Intel architecture. Our vision is 

h Intel. The breadth of our 
results this quarter, our progress against our strategic goals and the 

that our strategy is working.
 
With that, let me turn the call over to Stacy.
 
Stacy Smi
th
 

history with overall results demonstrating solid financial growth as we 
approach the end of this year.
 
Focusing on our third quarter results, revenue came in at $14.6 billion, up 
8
% from a year ago. Both the PC Client Group and the Data Center Group 
achieved better growth than we expected at the beginning of the quarter. PC 
Client Group revenue was up 9% from a year ago. We saw PC Client Group 
platform unit volumes growth 15% year
-
o
ver
-
year and inclusive of tablets, 
we saw almost 30% unit growth. Of note, our notebook platform units grew 
over 20% year
-
over
-
year as we are enabling innovative two
-
in
-
one devices 
and growing our market segment share with Bay Trail at lower price points.
 
Our Data Center Group revenue grew 16% from a year ago with platform 
volumes up 6% and platform average selling prices up 9%. We are seeing 
robust growth rates across all the segments of our Data Center business.
 
Operating income for the third quarter was 
$4.5 billion, up $1 billion and 
30% from a year ago. Operating income in the PC Client Group was $4.1 
billion and in the Data Center Group operating income was $1.9 billion.
 
The Mobile and Communications Group had $1 billion of loss which is an $81 
million
 
improvement from the second quarter. The company generated $3.3 
billion of net income for the third quarter, up 12% from a year ago. And 
earnings per share was $0.66, up 14% from a year ago.
 
Our net inventory levels rose modestly 
quarter
-
over
-
quarter as we are 
efficiently managing capacity while ramping Broadwell and 14
-
nanometer. 
The worldwide PC supply chain appears to be healthy with inventory levels 
appropriate in anticipation of the fourth quarter retail cycle.
 
Moving to gross
 
margin, third quarter gross margin of 65% was up 0.5 point 
from the second quarter and down 1 point from our guidance. The increase 
from the second quarter was primarily due to lower platform unit costs on 
22
-
nanometer and higher platform volume, mostly o
ffset by higher 
production costs on 14
-
nanometer products. Spending came in at $4.8 
billion, $100 million lower than our outlook. The overall decrease in spending 
was driven by efficiencies and one
-
time events like capital asset sales, 
partially offset by 
higher profit dependant expenses.
 
The business continues to generate significant cash with over $5.7 billion of 
cash from operations in Q3. We purchased $2.4 billion in capital assets, a 
$1.1 billion in dividend and repurchased over $4 billion of stock. To
tal cash 
balance at the end of the quarter was roughly $16 billion, down 
approximately $1.7 billion from the prior quarter. Our net cash balance, total 
cash less debt, is approximately $2 billion, and inclusive of our other longer 
term investments, it is m
ore than $6 billion. This is down by almost $2 
billion from the second quarter.
 
As we look forward to the fourth quarter of 2014, we are forecasting the 
midpoint of the revenue range at $14.7 billion, up 1% from the third 
quarter. This forecast is in line 
with the historical average seasonal increase 
for the fourth quarter. We are forecasting the midpoint of the gross margin 
range for the fourth quarter to be 64%. The one point decrease from the 
third quarter is driven by higher platform unit costs, higher 
factory start
-
up 
costs, primarily offset by lower production costs on 14
-
nanometer.
 
As we enter the fourth quarter, we are seeing our strategy play out in our 
financial results. In the third quarter, we grew revenue 8% and grew 
operating profit 30% versus 
last year. We also shipped over 100 million 
units for the first time in our history across a widening range of devices.
 
In the Client segment, we are seeing robust growth in the PC segment as a 
result of innovation and enabling lower price point.
 
We have g
rown to be the largest merchant supplier of tablet silicon and we 
are winning large designs at our LTE communications product. And our 
Internet of Things business is ramping out its products and growing. In the 
Data Center, we continue to innovate our prod
ucts; bring increased 
differentiation and value to our customers. And underlying all of this is our 
manufacturing leadership. We have led the world to 14
-
nanometer and plan 
to do the same with 10
-
nanometer process technology.
 
With that, let me turn it back
 
over to Mark.
 
Mark Henninger

Hi guys. Congrats on the strong results. So, one bigger question then a 
smaller picture one for my second follow
-
up please. O
n the bigger picture 
one, your units in the PC Client Group being up 15% year
-
over
-
year, can 
you talk a little bit about what do you think is driving that in the PC market 
that I think most of the third party data provider says is flat? And do you 
think th
at delta can actually stay that large for a bit longer?
 
Stacy Smith
 



rty data. When you adjust for some of the 
other form factors like Core
-



-
on
-
year 
in the third quarter.
 
In terms of our billing results, I think there is couple of things driving that. 
First, we saw in Q2 that we gained a relatively significant amount of share 

probabl

all the third party results come in to know for sure, but our sense is that we 
gain some share in the third quarter so that helps.
 

lace a normal supply 

different than what we saw a year ago where people were managing 
inventory levels very low in anticipation of a very muted fourth quarter. So, I 
think the combinat
ion of those two things does our billing results ahead of 

 
Brian Krzanich
 

covers most of the gap between the two
 
numbers.
 
Ross Seymore 
-
 
Deutsche Bank
 
Great. And I guess as my follow
-


-

communications group. Can you talk a little bit about how we should ex
pect 
that Concur revenue impact the trend overtime? And I believe in the past 

sort of clues that you can provide on how we should expect either the 
revenue or the profitability to
 
trend as we get into next year? Thank you.
 
Brian Krzanich
 


of where you see the financials move. And s

sides of that equation.
 
So from a product standpoint, you saw throughout this year we did a very 
good job of as we figure out how to get into this market and work with our 
customers and partners, how to reduce the cost just on 
the general bomb 
picking the right 
--
 
the right board layout. So reducing our product count all 
of those kinds of just fundamental engineering efforts is what we focused on.
 
As we got to the end of the year then we had brought out the Bay Trail cost 
reduce
 
part which is really focused on 
--
 
the first part that was really 

on to the shelves as we go through the holiday season with Bay Trail CR and 
that part will start to have really a d
esigned in cost reduced effort.
 



ear. 

ones, Rockchip and then more recently Spreadtrum which are focused 
around the SoFIA architecture bringing parts for this mobile space really 
designed by people who are in that ec
osystem are very cost efficient and are 

those parts come out as we go to next year. So when we look at the end of 

a 
revenue.
 
And so when you go through the next year, again, it will be somewhat mixed 
dependant as our product shift the mix and seasonal Stacy will talk to you a 

you will 
see us mix Bay Trail cost reduce Cherry Trail and then a lot of SoFIA 
coming in, in both the tablet and phone space and that really is what drives 
the contra kind of out of this system.
 
Stacy Smith
 
Yes. So Ross let me just 
--
 
as Brian said, the way the con
tra accounting 
works, the contra dollars that we recognize are associated with that 

majority of our shipments, our products that are carrying a fairly high contra 
dollar per unit. 
As we ramp the Bay Trail CR and then the SoFIA products, 

 

-
by in the prior statements. We plan to make a substantial imp
rovement in 


our goal, but it will take a little time to get there.

Blaine Curtis

Barclays Capital
 
Hey thanks for taking my question and nice quarter. Stacy I just want to 
follow
-
up, you talked about the more normal kind of supply chain this y
ear 


on seasonality; you also have Broadwell kind of launches in a typical point of 
year. Is there any sort of
 
catch up before you kind of ramp Broadwell into 
late first half next year?
 
Stacy Smith
 


question. So, let me go to the 


 
Blaine Curtis 
-
 
Barclays Capital
 
I just was wondering out that you are launching a platform that kind of 
usually you launch it for back
-
to
-
school and holiday 

--
 
the 
majority of the Broadwell clearly is coming kind of in the first half of the 

then I just wanted to kind of clarify your comments; you kind of said that 

particularly much in Q4 just thought there.
 
Stacy Smith
 


ppropriate amount of inventory in 
anticipation of a seasonal Q4. And if you go back here to Q3 of 2013, if you 
recall we are tracking about usually low inventory levels based on our 
customers, I think I used the word muted, having muted expectations about 

about the third quarter. And so 
--
 
and our guidance for Q4 would be 


e seen over the last several 

 


Investor Meeting whi
ch is just a few weeks away.
 
Blaine Curtis 
-
 
Barclays Capital
 
Okay. And then just a follow
-
up on the gross margin given your full year 
guidance, you were looking at a step down in December and now it looks 
like the gross margin sustains quite nicely. Just 
what changed in that outlook 
and does any of those factors carry into first half of next year?
 
Stacy Smith
 
Yes, so the 
--
 
as you rightly pointed out, the gross margin forecast for the 
year is pretty much on; we were a little light in Q3, we look a little b
etter in 

seeing more of the 14
-
nanometer cost coming through in the third quarter 

and the year staying 
on track. And again, it sounded little bit like a broken 


-
term trend. So, 

l we get to the November 
Investor Meeting.

The next question comes from Harlan Sur from J.P. Morgan.
 
Harlan Sur 
-
 
J.P. Morgan
 
Great. Thank you for taking my question and congratulations on the solid 
q
uarterly execution. DCG was up strongly in Q2 and again here in Q3 up 
16% year
-
over
-
year strong growth in all end markets. Do you expect the 
breadth of spend to continue across the different customer base in Q4? I 
know cloud tends to be a bit lumpy. And th
en do you expect to see 
continued double
-
digit growth in DCG in the fourth quarter?
 
Brian Krzanich
 
Sure, this is Brian. I think what we said was, we believe we can grow this 
business around 15% year
-
over
-
year. And you kind of framed it correctly 
that we 
do especially in the cloud space it tends to be lumpy, but if you take 


across the enterprise and the
 
cloud and HPC and other data centers. So, 

our forward
-
looking what we believe we can grow this business as.
 
Harlan Sur 
-
 
J.P. Morgan
 
Great. And then 
--
 
thank you for that. And then
 
I guess part of the reason 
for the lower gross margin profile in the fourth quarter is the ramp of 14
-
nanometer across multiple fabs. I think you said on the last call, it takes a 
couple of quarters to ramp up for full manufacturing capability after which
 
time you would see ramp cost starting to come down. Is that how you still 
see it?
 
Stacy Smith
 
Yes. I think I said you see highly elevated cost for a couple of quarters then 
it starts coming down, but it takes a period of time for it to come down. 



-
through 

get a lot more specific on so
me of the unit cost trends next month at the 
investor meeting.

The next question comes from Jim Cabello from Goldman Sachs.
 
Jim Cabello 
-
 
Goldman Sachs
 
Hey guys. Thanks so much.
 
I appreciate it. You guys referenced the 
opportunity for consumer buying in the fourth quarter. We saw a really good 
demand in the third quarter from consumers driven by the new products 
that you and Microsoft combined introduced. There were great new pro
ducts 
and the consumer uptick of them is very good. Do you think that impacts 
the fourth quarter versus third quarter buying at all?
 

-
up as part of this question. Do you see 
the iPhone 6 cannibalizing any kind of a noteb
ook demand just given the 

given that most of the top 10 selling notebooks are right around that same 
price point as the notebooks. Do you think there is any cannibalizing going 
on t
here as you get to the fourth quarter; is that part of the guidance? 
Thanks a lot.
 
Brian Krzanich
 


sea
sonal. So what we saw in the third quarter approximately 1% growth as 
we go into the fourth quarter, which is pretty typical if you go back over the 
last three years of what we see Q3 to Q4.
 


years of performance whole through the fourth quarter. Your question about 

space between consumers going out and buying phones versus PCs. And as 
you say, there is a 
big difference in the functionality and usage models 
between those two. And I think people when they want the usage model and 


alue for the functionality on 

demand standpoint.
 
Stacy Smith
 

extraordinary consumer demand in the third quarter
. If you go back to the 

-
party, it 

see anything unusual there. What we saw was some share gain, which 
caused u
s to have a nice bump in billings and we saw kind of a normal 
amount of inventory being put in, in the system relative to last year at the 

stable PC markets and people betting on a 
normal consumer fourth quarter.

The next question comes from John Pitzer from Credit Suisse.
 
John Pitzer

Credit Suisse
 
Yes, 
good afternoon guys. Congratulations on the strong quarter. First 
question is for Stacy. Stacy when you look at the revenue in the PC Client 
Group, I think year
-
to
-

profits are up I think about twice that


and I guess how much more do you have left to drive profitability in the core 
PC Client Group?
 
Stacy Smith
 



I think what you see going on this year is probably three things that are all 
contributing to the operating profit.
 

ve got a great product portfolio. And so when you look at where 



ow
-
end of the market that 
gives them a nice cost structure and allows them to go after a unit growth.
 
So I think this really all starts with the product portfolio. Adding to that I 
think we have a couple of tailwinds on gross margin in 2014. Our 22
-
nanomet

-
end of the 
cycle in terms of how much start up cost flows through and PC Client Group 
picks up the majority of those.
 
And I also think the leadership of that team has done a nice job of 
prioritizing 



out technology that really helps our busines
s while prioritizing within a 

will be part of their investor meeting next month.
 
John Pitzer

up for Brian, Brian you guys have
 
been talking about a stabilizing PC market for the last couple of quarters, 

on developed versus developing and corporate versus consumer. When you 
look at kind of the Q3 results
 
and especially on the ASP line and your 
guidance for Q4, is this just seasonal consumer strength or do you actually 
think that both in the developed and developing market, you can now start 
talking about turning a corner relative to tablet cannibalization
 
and perhaps 
PC stabilization in emerging market consumer?
 
Brian Krzanich
 


--
 
in fact we said that the 
consumer we believe is flat. T
here is seasonal growth as we move into the 

that we talked about in the previous quarters where the mature markets are 
a bit stronger, the U.S. especially, Western Europe though a
s well and the 
emerging markets China, Latin America and some of the others are still soft. 
And so those trends are continuing. And when you look at the consumer as 

consumer side.

The next question comes from Joe Moore from Morgan Stanley.
 
Joe Moore 
-
 
Morgan Stanley
 
Great, thank you. I wonder if I could just push a little bit more on the gap 
between sort
 
of 15% unit growth versus the market. I think you attributed it 
to three factors to share gains to the core base tablet and to the inventory 
environment a year ago. Which of those factors do you think is most 
important just because of such a wide gap betw
een the numbers?
 
Stacy Smith
 

have those kinds of differences from the third parties. I think coming back to 

d of 

amount of inventory you put in the system, you do that math with the third 
element being the core base tablets which I think is going to be relatively 
smaller.
 
Joe Moore 
-
 
Morgan Stanley
 

anything that has a Bay Trail M or Core is considered a PC unit the way that 

 
Brian Krzanich
 

at have a core, I used the Microsoft 
surface as a great example, we classify that in a PC side.
 
Joe Moore 
-
 
Morgan Stanley
 
Got it.
 
Brian Krzanich
 

 
Stacy Smith
 
And IDC would classify that in a different category. So that


difference with the third parties on an ongoing basis. And I think it comes 
down to the breadth of tracking in the white box deep in the emerging 
markets, the tier 3
 
tier 4, very hard to get your arms around that 
holistically. And so we tend to see over long periods of time, we have a 
slightly higher billing number, the nature of the market number and thus we 

ty of the market 

going to be a difference between them.

Hi guys. Thanks for taking my questions. I am sorry to harp on it but I want 

business you think consumer is kind of seasonal and I guess flat
tish for the 
year in Q4 but obviously you must 
--
 
you and I guess your channel partners 
must be expecting a much bigger ramp of consumer in Q4 given how much 
inventory you must have built in the channel in Q3. So I guess how do you 
get comfort that that co
nsumer sell
-
through is going to be there in Q4 and 

-
through is not 
there? Is the corporate uptake still there; is that going to be enough to 
offset or like how do we I guess judge the potential scenar
ios around 
consumer demand in Q4 and the sensitivity of your guidance around that?

this is Stacy by the way and Brian will jump 
in. Bu

pattern and bring inventory levels down. But what we see is kind of normal 

customers think will happ

terms of our seasonal results. You also had a question on consumer versus 

market trends.
 
Brian Krzanich
 

e it back to the inventory comments as well. We do 
what I believe is a really good job of watching our whole supply chain from 
below us looking at things like the motherboard ordering pattern at the 

ls from our 
inventory hubs and a lot of our 
--
 
more than half our product ships out hub 
now and we actually control the inventory on it, so the OEM pulls it at the 
last moment of use. So we see the actual usage rates there.
 





casting for the 


direction.
 
The comment about consumer versus enterprise, as we said, we forecasted 
a stand

season, not a bad holiday season, a standard holiday season for the 
consumer in the PC segment.
 

desktops earlier in the 

the second half of the year as some of the markets that shifted a little bit, 
but overall the enterprise all the way from large enterprise to small and 
medium businesses stayed fairly strong through this 
year, still seeing 
mature market versus emerging markets trend, mature being stronger than 



ght tools in place to watch this.

Got it. So my follow

Thanks for taking my question. Can you talk about the carrier certification 
and some of the compet

And I guess the bigger question Brian there is that other than this rollup off 
the tablet, their contra revenues; are there other actions you can take to 
reduce losses in the mobile division?
 
Brian Krzanich
 
Sure. Let me try and answer your question. There is I believe two questions 
kind of built in there. The first was around where are we with certifications 
on our LTE, so where are we relative to our LTE roadmap?
 
What I would tell you is our 7260, as you hea
rd has had several design wins. 



syste

with a variety of products throughout this year in a variety of other markets 
especially in Asia. So, we feel fairly strong; we also see there is only 
--
 
there 
is only two people out shipp

those two. So we feel good about our roadmap, roadmap moving forward, 
going beyond Cat6 that we feel is highly competitive and keeps us at or near 
the leading edge. So from a modem standpoint, we feel very str
ong right 
now.
 
You asked, is there other things that we can do to reduce our MCG spending, 


our own into the 

are in that space already and have the linkages and the customer 
relationships.
 


other parts of the world, they are 
great supplier to several of the OEMs. And us bringing our SoFIA platform, 

come into our silicon as well. That gives us them and them a competitive 
a
dvantage and a cost advantage we believe and a way to get into those 
markets very cost effective efficient way.
 
Stacy Smith
 
If I could add one thing, I think Brian is talking about 
--
 
the first step is 
great product, second step is getting the right invest
ment level. And I think 

innovation in terms of how we go to market. There is a third piece here too 

creating for the
 
mobile group is useful and in fact becomes a competitive 
advantage across the breadth of our product line. And Brian talked in his 
prepared remarks, if as we think happens over time more of the computers 
of the world, the notebook computers of the world a
re connecting via 

of company synergy associated with us investing and leading in that 
technology?
 
Brian Krzanich

bring some of that innovation and IP like the RealSense cameras and all the 
way through the mobile s
pace as well which will help us differentiate our 
products and working with our partners allow them to differentiate as well.

RBC Capital Markets
 
Hi guys, thanks so much for allowing me to ask you question and congrats 

going on in 
your tablet goal, it does seem I heard a 15 million number for the quarter 
that you shipped, that would mean that you need to ship actually I believe if 
I have added up right about 10 million next quarter. Does that mean that 
the subsidies have
 
peaked in the third quarter or do you think you are going 
to exceed your tablet shipment goal by an equal amount?
 
Brian Krzanich
 

subsidies. Your numbers are very close; you rightly
 
hit about 15 million, we 


2 million. So, my guess is somewhere between 40 million and 45 million is 
w

40, but not there is no need to go well above that.
 
As we said that puts us the largest merchant supplier to the tablet business. 

th our cost reductions 
but also differentiating with products like the Dell Venue which we believe is 
ph [unfinished]. And I have a lot of innovation with the first of the real subs; 
we have other products with our other OEM partners like Lenovo moving 
for

contra.
 
Stacy Smith
 
Yes. So the contra answer is a little bit complex, because keep in mind it has

Hi. Thanks for taking my question. The first ques
tion I had was on the tablet 
market. When you look at the units that you have shipped so far this year 


t
ablets? And has that played out differently than you expected that mix as 
Microsoft seems to have cut the price of the bundle of Windows and Office?

Okay. Thank you. And then the second question if I
 
may, there is a view out 

a Windows XP upgrade cycle. Could you update us on your thoughts on that 

rather inn
ovation driving the demand? Thank you.
 
Stacy Smith
 

or the other but based on what we see in our surveys, there is a variety of 
things that are causing people to go and upgrade the
ir PCs. Certainly the 

PCs and the price points, I think all of that is playing in. And I think when we 
look across the breadth of our SKUs and knowing which of those are going 
into, there is large enterprise, small and medium consumer, we get a sense 

people are upgrading Windows.
 

say i
n the back half of the year believe that the impact that we are seeing 
with XP is probably less than it was in the front half of the year but there is 
likely a pretty long tail that has some positive impact on the market for a 
while to come when you just l
ook at the age of the install base and how 
many of those are now in support of supported operating systems.

forward
-
looking statements based on the environment as we currently see 
it, and as such
, does include risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our 
press release for more information on the specific risk factors that could 
cause actual results to differ materially.
 
A brief reminder that this quarter we have provided both GAAP and non
-
GAAP fin
ancial measures. Today we will be speaking to the non
-
GAAP 
financial measures when describing our consolidated results. The CFO 
commentary and earnings releases, available on intc.com, include the full 
GAAP and non
-

Intel Corp.
 
Thanks, Mark. This summer we celebrated our 50th anniversary, and this 
quarter was the best quarter in our 50
-
year history. Record quarterly 
revenue of $19.2 billion was up 19%. Our operating margins exp
anded 5 
points, and earnings per share of $1.40 was up 39%. Our results were 
driven by incredibly strong demand and customer preference for the 
performance of our leadership products across the business. Our Data 
Center, Client Computing, Internet of Thing
s, Memory, and Mobileye 
businesses all achieved record revenue. We expect 2018 to be the best year 
ever and our third record year in a row.
 
Before we get deeper into the financials, I'll take a few minutes to talk about 
our strategy, our products, and our 
people, first our strategy. We are 
growing share in a larger TAM, driving operating leverage while increasing 
our R&D investments, and delivering attractive capital returns. Our thesis is 
that the massive growth of data worldwide will increase demand for t
he 
analysis, storage, and sharing of data. We are one of the few companies that 
touches every part of the data revolution, and we've invested both 
organically and acquisitively to capitalize on these trends to accelerate the 
growth of the company, while at
 
the same time delivering significant 
operating leverage and exiting non
-
core businesses.
 
Our disciplined focus is delivering outstanding results. Demand and growth 
this year continued to exceed our expectations. Collectively, our data
-
centric 
businesses a
re up 22% year to date, led by growth in the cloud and 
communication service provider segments.
 
In both our data
-
centric and PC businesses, our CPU leadership puts us in a 
great position to capitalize on this massive data opportunity by delivering 
more val
ue to a broader set of customers. We've expanded beyond CPUs 
with memory, modems, FPGAs, and silicon for emerging high
-
growth 
workloads like ADAS, artificial intelligence, and 5G communications.
 
We acquired Mobileye, which has integrated Intel architecture
 
to produce the 
industry's leading ADAS and autonomous driving platforms. Mobileye also 
just announced the ability to fully retrofit existing vehicles to deliver full 
autonomy, moving Mobileye further up the value chain.
 
The acquisitions of Altera and Movi
dius are enabling us to partner with 
customers to expand the markets that they serve. They are developing new 
AI capabilities by combining our Core products with our FPGAs and VPUs. 
This is most evident in computer vision applications, which cut across all
 
of 
our IoT verticals.
 
As a result, our opportunity has never been bigger. We are competing and 
winning share in a $300 billion TAM, transforming from a PC
-
centric 
company to a data
-
centric company in the process. We now expect full
-
year 
revenue to grow mo
re than $8.4 billion over 2017. And in the first nine 
months of the year, we have returned $12.6 billion to shareholders in the 
form of buybacks and dividends, or 112% of free cash flow.
 
We've also achieved outstanding growth in our PC
-
centric business. Af
ter 
seven years of decline, we expect modest growth in the PC TAM this year, 
and we continue to gain share in modems. We focused our investments in 
the PC sector on the areas where we see growth and where our performance 
leadership and differentiation matt
ers most, the commercial, gaming, and 2
-
in
-
1 segments.
 
Second, our products, our strategy is delivering results because we have 
products that are solving our customers' problems. We're making the 
products we have even better and expanding our portfolio to 
deliver more 
value to customers. One of the most important things we do is collaborate 
with our customers and ecosystem partners to deliver exciting new 
computing experiences. We do that broadly with our OEMs. An example in 
our PC business was the launch o
f the stunning new HP Spectre Folio, a 2
-
in
-
1 we worked closely with HP to develop.
 
We leveraged our expertise in thermal tuning and motherboard 
miniaturization while achieving up to 19 hours battery life through power 
tuning and the use of Intel's low
-
pow
er display technology. This sort of 
innovation isn't possible without Intel's exceptionally broad range of IP and 
the scale and expertise to partner deeply with our customers on design. We 
also launched the new 9th gen Intel Core desktop processors, includ
ing the 
world's best gaming processor.
 
In our data
-
centric businesses, we announced 95 new performance world 
records for Xeon Scalable and continue to see strong adoption while we work 
with customers to get ready for the transition to Cascade Lake. Cascade
 
Lake introduces hardware
-
based side channel mitigation, Intel DL Boost with 
11x inference speed
-
up, and a revolutionary new technology, Optane DC 
Persistent Memory. And we're deepening our engagement with customers on 
custom SKUs. In fact, we'll have 60% 
more custom SKUs in the Cascade 
Lake family than the prior generation.
 
We shipped our first revenue units of Optane DC Persistent Memory to 
Google, Microsoft, and Alibaba, and we're already receiving great feedback. 
Microsoft reported a new performance rec
ord of 13.7 million IOPS using 
Xeon Scalable and Optane, a level they said they've never seen with any 
other platform approach.
 
Customers also continue to choose Intel as a partner as they use artificial 
intelligence to transform their businesses. Taboola 
chose Intel Xeon over 
GPUs for a massive inference speedup and scale
-
out across seven data 
centers, delivering 360 billion content recommendations monthly. Rolls
-
Royce will design autonomous ships running inference on Xeon and are 
evaluating more of our po
rtfolio in a multiyear engagement.
 
Mobileye customer momentum continued, with eight new design wins at 
major U.S. and global automakers, bringing our 2018 design win total to 20. 
Mobileye also shipped 3.3 million EyeQ SOCs in the third quarter, bringing 
th
e lifetime total to more than 33 million units.
 
While our current product lineup is compelling, our roadmap is even more 
exciting. We continue to make good progress on 10
-
nanometer. Yields are 
improving, and we're on track for 10
-
nanometer
-
based systems on
 
shelves 
during the holiday 2019 selling season. The breadth of IP we've assembled 
combined with Intel's design, software, packaging, and manufacturing 
capability, gives us an unmatched ability to invent the industry's future.
 
Third and most importantly, o
ur people, Intel has amazing talent, including 
world
-
class scientists and engineers, and we are making excellent progress 
toward our commitment to a fully representative workforce. Intel employees 
are at their best when they're working together to address 
challenges. And 
faced with explosive and unexpected demand this year, they've exhibited 
incredible problem
-
solving skills to deliver this quarter's results.
 
The PC TAM has returned to growth, and our Data Center business is 
growing at more than twice the r
ate we expected in January. Our full
-
year 
revenue outlook is now more than $6 billion higher than our January 
forecast, and we have supply to support this revised guidance thanks to 
outstanding responsiveness from our factory teams.
 
We are focused on doing
 
everything possible not to constrain our customers' 
growth. We've increased our CapEx by $1.5 billion since January to a record 
$15.5 billion. We've repositioned some 10
-
nanometer capacity to 14
-
nanometer, and we're making progress with our 10
-
nanometer p
rocess 
technology.
 
Supply is tightest at the entry level of the PC market and in our IOTG 
business. Within our CPU product lines, we're prioritizing the production of 
our Xeon and Core processors so that we and our customers can serve the 
high
-
performance 
segments of the market. Our biggest challenge in Q4 will 
be meeting any additional PC and IOTG demand beyond our guidance, and 
we do expect fourth quarter upside from here will be limited.
 
Summing it up, our strategy, leadership products, and 
amazing people 
combined to produce the best quarter in the company's history. We're well 
on track to another record year.
 
With that, let's turn to the details. Third quarter revenue of $19.2 billion was 
up 19% year over year. Our data
-
centric businesses we
re collectively up 
22% and our PC
-
centric business was up 16%. Outstanding business 
performance, continued operating leverage, and a lower tax rate resulted in 
non
-
GAAP net income of $6.5 billion, up 34% year over year. EPS of $1.40 
was up 39% year over ye
ar.
 
Year to date, we have generated $11.2 billion of free cash flow and returned 
$12.6 billion to shareholders, including $4.2 billion in dividends and $8.5 
billion in buybacks, repurchasing 167 million shares.
 
We continue to see strong momentum in our bus
iness and are raising our 
full
-
year revenue guide by $1.7 billion to $71.2 billion. We are also raising 
our EPS guide by $0.38 versus July to $4.53 and our free cash flow guide by 
$500 million to $15.5 billion. Our revenue guidance for 2018 is up greater 
t
han $6 billion versus our January expectations, as we focus on a strong 
finish to a record year.
 
Our leadership products continue to win share in our expanded TAM, as both 
our data
-
centric and PC
-
centric businesses grew at double
-
digit rates this 
quarter. 
Our data
-
centric businesses were up 22%, as customers choose our 
performance products to move, store, and process more data faster from the 
cloud to the edge. And our PC
-
centric business was up 16%, as we saw 
continued strength in the commercial and gaming
 
PC segments and grew 
modem share.
 
Operating income increased by more than $2 billion, with margin up 5.1 
points year over year in the third quarter, marking our highest operating 
margin percentage since 2011.
 
EPS climbed to $1.40, up 39% year on year. Our
 
EPS improvement was 
driven by growing demand for high
-
performance products in the Data Center 
and Client businesses, leading to higher volumes and ASPs, continued 
growth in our adjacent businesses, a lower tax rate, and lower share count 
as a result of bu
ybacks.
 
Our focus on operational efficiency continues to produce strong results. We 
now expect full
-
year spending as a percentage of revenue to be 
approximately 29%, down about 7 points since 2015, while R&D is up $1.4 
billion over the same period. We cont
inue to improve our leverage while 
increasing investment in our key priorities, such as product leadership, 
artificial intelligence, and autonomous driving.
 
Disciplined spending with a focus on prioritizing the most important 
investment opportunities is a 
key lever in magnifying our revenue 
opportunities, and it's apparent in our results. Over the last three years, 
we've grown annual revenue by nearly $16 billion while adding less than 
$600 million in spending, resulting in a more than 25% increase in reven
ue 
per employee.
 
Now some Q3 performance highlights by segment, the Data Center Group 
delivered its first $6 billion revenue quarter, as it shipped more than 8 
million CPUs into an annual server, storage, and network and CPU TAM that 
is greater than 30 mil
lion units. Revenue of $6.1 billion was up 26% year 
over year, and operating income of $3.1 billion was up 37% year over year.
 
Q3 operating margin was 50%, and we continued to see strong acceleration 
in both the cloud and comm service providers segments, w
hich make up 
more than two
-
thirds of DCG revenue. Platform unit volume was up 15% 
and ASPs were up 10%. Non
-
CPU adjacencies grew 14% over last year.
 
The cloud business grew 50% year over year, with strong growth trends 
across our diversified customer base.
 
Our comm service provider segment 
grew 30% year over year, as customers continued to transform their 
networks with Intel architecture as they prepare for 5G. And our enterprise 
segment was up 1% year over year, as the strong IT spending environment 
contin
ued, with CIOs prioritizing investment in private and hybrid cloud 
implementations.
 
Our other data
-
centric businesses, IOTG, NSG, and PSG, achieved solid 
growth in the third quarter, and together were up 13% year over year or 
17% excluding Wind River.
 
Our 
Internet of Things business achieved record revenue of $919 million on 
broad business strength, up 8% or 19% excluding Wind River. Operating 
profit was $321 million, up 120% year over year, on growing demand and 
revenue scale. Mobileye had record revenue o
f $191 million, up 
approximately 50% over last year, as ADAS adoption continues to 
accelerate.
 
Our Memory business delivered record revenue of $1.1 billion, up 21% year 
over year, as we continued to redefine the storage paradigm with industry
-
leading, low
-
cost, high
-
density NAND SSDs and the revolutionary 
performance of Optane drives. We have now reached a crossover point, with 
50% of our data center and client SSDs shifted to cost
-
effective 64
-
layer 3D 
NAND, leading to rapidly improving cost per gigabyte. 
At the same time, as 
a result of pursuing 3D XPoint development independently and a tougher 
NAND pricing environment, we now expect NSG to be approximately 
breakeven for the full year.
 
Micron recently announced their intent to call the IMFT factory. Our 
ag
reements with Micron ensure a reliable and cost
-
effective supply of 3D 
XPoint through at least 2020. And we have developed internal manufacturing 
options which can be executed well within that timeframe.
 
PSG's revenue came in at $496 million, up 6% on stre
ngth in data center 
and comm segments. PSG's data center segment was up 45% over last 
year. In the advanced products category, our 28
-
nanometer, 20
-
nanometer, 
and 14
-
nanometer solutions grew 55%. Operating profit was $106 million, 
down 6% year over year.
 
F
inally, the Client Computing Group delivered exceptional results with its 
first $10 billion quarter, up 16% year over year. Commercial and gaming 
demand continued to be very strong. The notebook segment grew 13% year 
over year. The desktop segment grew 9% 
year over year. And client 
adjacencies grew 66% year over year, led by the 131% growth in our 
modem business. Operating profit grew $932 million year over year, while 
operating margin up 3.7 points. Leadership product performance and 
segmentation contribut
ed to strong mix and higher ASPs.
 
The investments we have made in the business organically and through 
acquisition are delivering excellent cash flow generation. Year to date, we 
have generated $22.5 billion in cash from operations. We have invested 
$11.3 
billion in capital expenditures and delivered $11.2 billion in free cash 
flow, up 57% over the first three quarters of last year. During this period, 
we returned 112% of our free cash flow to our shareholders. Buybacks 
totaled $8.5 billion and dividends to
taled $4.2 billion. In addition, 
settlements of our convertible debt reduced fully diluted shares by 22 
million.
 
Now turning to our full
-
year outlook, we started the year in January 
expecting to generate $65 billion in revenue, 30% operating margin, and 
$3
.55 in EPS. Nine months later, the growth that we and the industry have 
seen has been remarkable. We couldn't be more pleased that in an 
increasingly competitive market, our customers are choosing Intel. Our 
leadership products are winning across our data
-
centric businesses, and 
we're seeing strong demand upside in the client business that not long ago 
many thought was in perpetual decline.
 
We are now forecasting revenue of approximately $71.2 billion, up $1.7 
billion versus our expectations in July. This r
epresents a $6.2 billion increase 
versus the expectations we set just nine months ago. We now expect data
-
centric growth to be approximately 20% year over year and PC
-
centric 
growth to be around 9% year over year.
 
Our outlook for operating margin is approx
imately 34.5%, up 2.5 points 
from July, as we now expect to deliver 29% spending to revenue, not only 
hitting our original goal two years early but beating it. We expect a full
-
year 
tax rate of around 12%, down slightly from our prior estimate.
 
Overall, we
 
expect strong top line growth and improving operating leverage 
will drive EPS to $4.53, up $0.38 from our estimate in July. As a result of 
increased demand, we are raising our forecast for gross CapEx to $15.5 
billion, or approximately $14 billion net of 
memory prepayments. We are 
now expecting free cash flow of $15.5 billion, up $500 million from July.
 
For Q4, we are forecasting revenue of approximately $19 billion, up 11% 
year over year. We expect operating margin of approximately 34.5% and 
gross margin 
of approximately 62%. We also expect EPS at $1.22, up 38% 
excluding equity adjustments from business growth, spending leverage, and 
a lower tax rate. We expect DCG to set another revenue record of 
approximately $6.3 billion in the fourth quarter. Due to su
pply constraints, 
we anticipate IOTG revenue will be down approximately 15% sequentially.
 
As we look forward to 2019, we expect to deliver another record year for the 
company. We'll have more to say about 2019 in January, but we're 
expecting that our opera
ting margin percentage will be approximately flat 
next year. We expect gross margins to remain in the upper half of our 
historical 55% to 65% range.
 
While we expect 2019 gross margin percentage to be down slightly from Q4 
2018 levels as we continue to gain
 
share in our adjacent businesses and we 
ramp our 10
-
nanometer process, that will be offset by increasing OpEx 
leverage as we continue to make thoughtful trade
-
offs and invest in R&D 
that will accelerate our growth and profitability. And we expect the full
-
year 
tax rate to be up a couple points following several beneficial discrete events 
in 2018.
 
Five years ago, we set out to transform Intel from a PC
-
centric company to a 
data
-
centric company. Today, our strategy, our products, and our people are 
deliverin
g on that ambition, with strong growth, record results, and the 
largest TAM opportunity in the company's history, and we're just getting 
started.

Good afternoon and congratulations on the solid quarterly execution. On 
the 
competitive front, with your nearest competitor rolling out its second
-
generation 7
-
nanometer server next product year, I guess the first question 
is, is the Intel team still on track to roll out its next
-
generation Xeon family, 
the Cascade Lake, at th
e end of this year? And if you could, just help us 
understand. What are some of the performance and portfolio differentiators 
that are going to help the team maintain relatively strong share in the 
service segment 2019 and beyond?
 
Venkata S. M. Renduchinta

Yeah, Harlan, this is Murthy. Let me take that one. Yes, you're correct. We 
still intend to be making first shipments of Cascade Lakes by Q4, and we're 
really excited with the stockpile of new features we have lined up for that 
platform, p
rimarily the support of our Optane Persistent Memory that we will 
launch in conjunction with Cascade Lakes as we enter early 2019. We 
believe that will be a significant uplift in performance. We will also have 
dedicated instruction set extensions to suppor
t artificial intelligence 
workloads. And we'll have continued generation
-
over
-
generation CPU 
improvements.
 
So all in all, we think that Cascade Lake represents a power
-
packed addition 
to the data center roadmap. And of course, we have further excitement 
to
wards the end of next year as we launch our Cooper Lake platform as well. 
So we're really excited about the lineup we have in our DCG roadmap for 
next year and indeed, as you said, for the end of this quarter.

pEx since coming on board. You talked about further 
leverage into 2019. Can you remind us which areas of the business you're 
deemphasizing from a spending perspective? And how should we think about 
the balance between R&D and SG&A in 2019 and beyond? Thank
 
you.
 
Robert Holmes Swan

Intel Corp.
 
Yeah first, I think that the progress we made has been a team sport. And as 
I indicated in the prepared remarks, we're down 700 basis points from 2015. 
And during that timeframe, it's not been at the expense of R&D. I
t's on the 
contrary, R&D has grown $1.4 billion during that timeframe. So really the 
underlying dynamics is we've made trade
-
offs to invest in higher growth 
segments of the business. That growth is in fact accelerating. And from that 
accelerating growth, w
e've been extremely disciplined on getting leverage 
on our SG&A, and we've exited some what I'd characterize non
-
core 
businesses. During the course of this year, we exited Wind River. We 
reduced our investments in wearables products, and we exited the Saff
ron 
business as well.
 
So as we go forward, we're going to continue to increase R&D, and we're 
going to increase it in the areas that we think can generate differentiated 
growth for us. And from that growth, we expect to continue to get leverage 
as we go in
to 2019.

Yeah, good afternoon, Bob. Congratulations on the strong results. Bob, I 
wonder if you could just comment a little bit on when do you think the 
supply constraints will be over relative 
to your capacity addition plans. And if 
I caught it right, it sounds like in the calendar fourth quarter, you're 
choosing to shortchange the IoT Group. Does that mean that you're already 
caught up in the PC market, or how should we think about that dynamic
?
 
Robert Holmes Swan 
-
 
Intel Corp.
 
First, John, as we mentioned earlier, we were caught off guard a little bit this 
year by explosive growth well ahead of what our expectations were back in 
the beginning of the year, and that growth came from all 
different segments 
of the business. It put us in the unfortunate situation of constraining some of 
the demand signals that we were seeing from the market and our customer 
base.
 
In conjunction with our customers, our teams have done an outstanding job 
in th
e third quarter and we project into the fourth quarter, and that has 
enabled us to increase our revenue outlook for the year by $1.7 billion. But I 
think as we go into the fourth quarter, given the demand signals we 
continue to see across the business, we 
in fact will be constraining growth.
 
Our focus has been prioritizing, in conjunction with our customers, Xeon and 
Core processors. And therefore by definition, the lower end of PC and the 
IoT business is being constrained. So we are in a constraint scenari
o into the 
fourth quarter, both at low
-
end PC and IoT.
 
As we go into next year and the timing, we've put a lot of capital to work 
this year. It's a record year for CapEx for us at $15.5 billion. It's $1.5 billion 
higher than what we expected entering the y
ear, and we have taken some of 
our 10
-
nanometer equipment and tools and began to blow that back to meet 
the increased demand for 14. So we're working extremely hard to get back 
on track in 2019. But at this stage of the game, given the demand signals 
we've
 
seen in fourth quarter, we're going to be constrained a little bit. And 
we're trying to prioritize best as we can with our customers.

Hi, thank you very 
much, Bob. Thanks actually for providing some color on 
2019, but one area you did not touch on was CapEx. And I'm asking if you 
could provide us some directional input on that and what we should expect 
for CapEx, specifically in light of the Micron call op
tion and implications that 
has for your spend on the memory side. Thank you.
 
Robert Holmes Swan 
-
 
Intel Corp.
 
I think on CapEx at the macro level, as we think into 2019, we expect logic 
CapEx to likely be a little higher, and memory CapEx, despite building
 
self
-
sufficiency on Optane, to be a little bit lower. So at the macro level, those 
are the dynamics.
 
In terms of how it plays out on overall levels, it's still a work in process, and 
I'd characterize it, Ambrish, this way. First, it's going to be a functi
on of 
growth. As we get clearer around what growth looks like in 2019 for 14
-
nanometer, that will impact what the overall CapEx level is. Secondly, we've 
made some good progress on 10
-
nanometer yields over the course of the 
last six months. And as we progr
ess through the fourth quarter and into 
2019, if we're further ahead on 10
-
nanometer yields, that will influence the 
amount of CapEx next year.
 
Third, our progress on 7
-
nanometer, how well we progress on 7
-
nanometer 
also will influence how we think about C
apEx. And last but not least, as it 
relates to memory, it's more the customer quals and adoption of our 
leading
-
edge 3D NAND 96
-
layer product. As we continue to make progress 
on developing that, we may deploy that capital, and that pays for itself very 
qui
ckly.
 
So as we sit here today, CapEx, I expect logic to be up, memory to be down. 
And as we look at those four things, all which I'd characterize as being good 
things if we make progress on all four of those, that will influence the rate of 
CapEx spend nex
t year. So we'll try to provide you a little more analytical 
color versus that qualitative color in January.

of Joe Moore from Morgan 
Stanley, your question please.
 
Joseph Moore

Great, thank you. I wanted to get 

 
just give us a little bit more color on the 
PC numbers in the quarter. How much were you constrained by the 
shortages that 
you saw? And I guess it looks like you grew a little bit more 
than seasonal on a sequential basis. And how much of the ASP lift that you 
saw you think was a function of those shortages? And then just any color on 
could those shortages spread higher into th
is product stack over the course 
of Q4?
 
Robert Holmes Swan 
-
 
Intel Corp.
 
Joe, I think as you saw from the IDC and Gartner folks, growth for PC TAM 
in the quarter probably around 1%. Our guess is it was probably a little bit 
stronger than that, 1% to 2% gro
wth. And within that, we delivered 6% unit 
growth, so real strong unit growth and again good ASP momentum.
 
I would say in Q3, largely a function of customer collaboration in our fabs, I 
don't think we were too terribly constrained on the PC side, to be hon
est 
with you. I think as we're going into Q4 is where I think the constraints are 
impacting us a little bit more. So I don't think ASPs or supply constraints 
really benefit. We did not benefit from higher ASPs nor were we constrained 
in terms of unit growt
h in the quarter. It's more a fourth quarter thing where 
demand signals remain relatively strong. And as you saw from our guide, 
while it's good year
-
on
-
year growth, it's relatively flat overall on Q3 to Q4. 
And PCs, low
-
end PCs and IoT will be impacted as
 
we see the demand 
signals at this stage of the game.

Sure, thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to ask a little bit. I guess 
the demand is really good here in the back half of 2019. But with the trade 
wa
r discussions, softening demand in China, some cycle risk indicators, are 
you seeing anything or talking to customers that would indicate that there 
would be any first half 2019 risk to demand?
 
Robert Holmes Swan 
-
 
Intel Corp.
 
It's a great question. I thin
k at the aggregate level, there is what I'd maybe 
characterize as some decent tailwinds as we exit the year and then go into 
2019, but also some headwinds. The tailwinds, as you know, we've been 
talking about an expanded TAM where we play a bigger and bigg
er role in 
the increased needs for data. That larger TAM and the momentum we're 
building across all of our products is a pretty good tailwind as we look at just 
demand for data, whether it's with consumers or with businesses going into 
the new year. That's
 
a tailwind.
 
Secondly, Murthy mentioned a few of the products that we have coming 
down the pike in the fourth quarter and going into next year. And those 
products we believe will deliver more and more performance for our clients, 
which I'd characterize as 
a tailwind.
 
And then third, in somewhat of a perverse way, as you know, when PC was 
70% of the business and when enterprise was 50
-
plus percent of the Data 
Center business and those were declining, it was a headwind for the 
company's growth. But those more
 
recently have been stable. So whether 
it's our expanded TAM, our new products, or the mix of our business, we 
have some tailwinds as we think about 2019.
 
At the same time, to your point, there are some headwinds. And the 
headwinds first, this has been a f
antastic year for us and I think for the 
industry, and that just makes comps a little bit tougher as we go into next 
year. Second, we have growing competition. Growing competition can be a 
headwind for us. And our expectations are we'll deal with that pret
ty 
effectively.
 
And third, just global trade, in particular, as you know, China is a big market 
for us. We've got some important customers there, and it's an important 
part of our global supply chain. So as this most recent round of tariffs play 
out, and w
e're doing a lot of work with our customers to ensure that the 
global supply chain can be adjusted and adapted to deal with any tariffs that 
come down the way. But I think it's going to be a wait
-
and
-
see as we go into 
2019.
 
At this stage of the game, we do
n't see any impact on 2018's results. And in 
2019, we have what I consider a world
-
class supply chain team that can 
manage and weather the dynamics of changes in movement of goods better 
than anybody else in the industry. So I think that would be a competi
tive 
advantage for us as we go into next year.

Thank you very much. I wanted to ask about DCG. You're not specifically 
guiding it next year, but it sounds like you're still pretty bullish. And there 
are a lot of investors I think worried a
bout a hyperscale CapEx slowdown 
next year. So I guess is it that you're bullish on CapEx next year, or is it 
more a commentary on product cycle, maybe Xeon Scalable beginning to 
catalyze the server upgrade cycle? Thank you.
 
Robert Holmes Swan 
-
 
Intel Corp
.
 
I think firstly in terms of growth for next year in the aggregate, we haven't 
really provided any quantitative color, more qualitative color in terms of the 
dynamics that we see. That being said, our DCG growth this year is 
projected to be north of 20%, 
real strong through the first three quarters of 
the year. The fourth quarter we expect really solid demand. But it's on a 
much tougher comp because fourth quarter last year was a great quarter for 
the DCG business.
 
As we go into next year, we've got 

 
Murt
hy highlighted we've got a good 
product roadmap of expanded features for Cascade Lake as we exit this 
year, Cooper Lake middle of next year. And we have a much more diverse 
business now, with obviously cloud has been a big accelerant for us. I don't 
expect
 
that it will grow at 50% forever. 50% was our cloud growth in the 
quarter. But at the same time, our comms and networking business growth 
has been accelerating quite a bit, and the stability we've seen in enterprise 
and government has really helped.
 
So I 
think next year, we have a much more diverse business. We've got a 
good product lineup, and we'll provide a little more color as we get into 
January, but outstanding year this year for Data Center, both top line and 
bottom line.

Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
 
Hi, guys. Thanks 
for letting me ask a question. Bob, I wanted to ask on the 
gross margin side. First, thank you for the color you gave on 2019. But if I 
back it up a step, what's the headwinds in the fourth quarter sequentially? 
And then any big picture moving parts, 10
-
na
nometer yields, mix, what 
have you, that gives you the confidence that you could still stay in the upper 
half of that 55% to 65% range for 2019?
 
Robert Holmes Swan 
-
 
Intel Corp.
 
Yeah, great question. First, a little color on Q3, and then a walk from Q3 to 
Q4 dynamics. As we highlighted in the materials, almost 66% gross margin 
in the quarter is as high as it's been for a very long time, and it was a 
function of a few things: one, continued volume leverage with full factories; 
two, ASPs both on the client si
de and on the data center side. And those 
were partially offset by platform costs going up and changing mix, growth of 
our modem and memory business. So those are the four dynamics that 
played out during the course of the quarter.
 
I would say 66% was artif
icially high, and I'd say that for a couple reasons. 
One, we had, in the NSG business, we earned a government incentive that 
was from scaling our fabs outside the U.S. So that incentive was worth about 
$110 million, so a bit of a one
-
timer that we don't ex
pect to repeat itself.
 
Secondly, sell
-
through of product either, on the CPU side, we are working 
with our customers and shaping demand to where we had inventory. We had 
good sell
-
through for some inventory that was previously partially reserved. 
And then s
econd on our modem growth, our explosive modem growth in the 
quarter, we PRQ'd that product in the third quarter, so we got the benefit of 
previously fully reserved inventory. So what all that means when you adjust 
for one
-
timers, the 66% is closer to 64% 
in terms of a normalized basis 
going into the fourth quarter.
 
Our guide in the fourth quarter, to your question, is 62%. So there's really 
three dynamics that we see playing out in the fourth quarter. One, we 
expect ASPs to be better. And that's going to b
e a little bit of a function of 
the prioritization of Xeon and Core processors, which are higher ASP mix, so 
we expect that to benefit us.
 
But at the same time, there's three other things as we go into fourth quarter 
that I'd characterize as really good th
ings, but will have an impact on our 
gross margin. One is ramping 10
-
nanometer. We're making good progress 
on 10
-
nanometer. Yields are improving, and that's giving us the confidence 
to in effect turn on more equipment and incur the depreciation cost 
associ
ated with that. So that will impact our Q3 to Q4 gross margins. And 
it's a function of the progress we're making on 10
-
nanometer.
 
Second, memory continues to grow, good 21% growth in the third quarter. 
We expect it to continue to grow in the fourth quarter
. And that has, our 
NAND business has been profitable during the course of the year but not at 
the gross margins of our logic business.
 
And then third, we're experiencing explosive growth on modem with some 
really good share gains. And the modem product is
 
also 

 
the combination of 
memory and modem are accretive to our year
-
on
-
year earnings growth but 
dilutive to our gross margins. So that's the Q3 adjusted gross margin going 
into Q4 will likely cost us roughly a couple points.
 
As we then step back and thin
k about 2019, we see those same dynamics 
playing out, primarily 14
-
nanometer volume, so continued good yield, unit 
cost performance on 14
-
nanometer. We don't expect ASPs to be dramatically 
better in an increasingly competitive environment, but we don't exp
ect them 
to be much worse. 10
-
nanometer costs will ramp, and we do expect to 
continue to grow memory and modem that will be accretive to earnings but 
a little dilutive to gross margin.
 
So again, a fairly long
-
winded walk from what drove Q3. The goodness 
op
erationally of what will happen to Q4 gross margins has been our comfort 
that 2019 will be modest degradation. But when coupled with the leverage 
on our operating expense, our operating margins will be roughly flat in the 
34% range.

Thanks for taking my question. Bob, just one more on 10
-
nanometer. You 
mentioned it's on track. Is there a way to quantify progress on 10
-
nanometer over the last three months? A
nd if you were to go back to a 
similar time when you were getting ready to make the jump to 14
-
nanometer, are the 10
-
nanometer yields and costs behaving in a similar 
way? Just any color around progress would be helpful. Thank you.
 
Venkata S. M. Renduchinta

Hey, Vivek, let me take it. This is Murthy. First of all, as Bob said in his 
opening remarks, the progress we've made in the quarter is very much in 
line with our expectations. While we can't give any specific numbers, I do 
believe that th
e yields as we speak now are tracking roughly in line with 
what we experienced in 14
-
nanometer.
 
So we're still very much reinforcing and reaffirming our previous guidance 
that we believe that we'll have 10
-
nanometer shipping by holiday of 2019. 
And if anyt
hing, I feel more confident about that at this call than I did on the 
call a quarter ago. So we're making good progress and I think we're making 
the quarter
-
on

quarter progress that's consistent with prior generations 
having reset the progress curve.

Thank you and congratulations on the 
solid results. Bob, you said that 
progress on 7
-
nanometer will also be a factor driving CapEx next year, and I 
was hoping you could maybe talk about that a little bit more. When you talk 
about progress, is that a statement about yields, meaning if 7
-
nanome
ter 
yields are improving you could potentially deploy more CapEx to ramp that 
process node a little earlier?
 
Robert Holmes Swan 
-
 
Intel Corp.
 
We haven't really given a timeline for 7
-
nanometer, so to say it's ramping 
earlier would be a little bit of a stre
tch. But we've been investing in EUV for 
a while, and we've obviously been investing in 7
-
nanometer. And when we 
step back and think about CapEx for next year, again, it's a function of 
growth on 14
-
nanometer. It's a function of the rate in which we scale 
10
-
nanometer, and it's a function of investments we make to begin to prove out 
7
-
nanometer in a more meaningful way. So those are just the dynamics that 
we're looking at and thinking about as we get closer to giving you a more 
definitive guide for CapEx in
 
2019.

1/20/12,Intel,"Good day ladies and gentlemen and thank you for standing by and welcome 
to the Intel Corporation's fourth quarter 2012 earnings conference call. At 
this time, all participants are in a listen
-
only mode. Later, we will conduct a 
question
-
and
-
answer session and instructions will follow at that time. 
(Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference may be recorded.
 
It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to Mark Henninger with investor 
relations. Please go
-
ahead.
 
Mark 
Henninger
 
Thank you, Huey, and welcome everyone to Intel's fourth quarter 2012 
earnings conference call. By now you should have received a copy of our 
earnings release and the CFO commentary that goes along with that. If 
you've not received both documents,
 
they are currently available on our 
Investor website, intc.com.
 
I'm joined today by Paul Otellini, our President and CEO; and Stacy Smith, 
our Chief Financial Officer. In a moment, we'll hear brief remarks from both 
of them followed by Q&A.
 
Before we begi
n, let me remind everyone that today's discussion contains 
forward
-
looking statements based on the environment as we currently see 
it, and as such, does include risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our 
press release for more information on the specific
 
risk factors that could 
cause actual results to differ materially.
 
If during this call we use any non
-
GAAP financial measures or references, 
we'll post the appropriate GAAP financial reconciliations to our website, 
intc.com. Lastly, I'd like to highlight 
that this year and going forward, we'll 
be holding our Annual Investor Meeting in the fall, rather than in May. We 
will send out a further date notice this spring with all the important event 
logistics and we will look forward to seeing you there.
 
With tha
t, let me turn the call over to Paul.
 
Paul Otellini
 
Thanks, Mark, and good afternoon. In 2012, Intel generated almost $1 
billion of net income every month. This was in an environment of relatively 
soft PC demand and weak macroeconomic conditions.
 
From a pr
oduct perspective, 2012 was a year of significant transitions in our 
markets and a year of important milestones for Intel. I'd like to take a 
moment to recap a few of the most significant developments.
 
The Data Center Group saw a comprehensive refresh acro
ss its product line 
last year. Romley locked the Sandy Bridge architecture to servers for the 
first time. While the launches of Knights Corner and Centerton in the fourth 
quarter expanded the range of DCG Solutions from teraflops to a few watts.
 
Knights Co
rner or Xeon Phi brings 60 cores in the familiar Intel architecture 
programming model to supercomputing applications. At six watts, Centerton 
is the industry's only low power microserver SoC that delivers critical 
enterprise features like 64
-
bit, ECC and v
irtualization.
 
Over the last 12 months, we also worked with our industry partners to bring 
Ultrabooks to the mainstream, ramping from roughly 20 designs to more 
than 140. At CES last week, I was struck by our industry's renewed 
inventiveness. PC manufactur
ers are embracing innovation as we are in the 
midst of radical transformation of the computing experience with the blurring 
of form factors and the adoption of new user interfaces.
 
It's no longer necessary to choose between a PC and a tablet. Convertibles 
and detachable, combined with Windows 8 and Touch, provide a two for one, 
no compromise computing experience. Ultrabooks have also served to 
accelerate the trend towards thinner and lighter notebooks. For example, the 
volume of systems less than one
-
inch t
hink grew 18
-
fold last year in the 
U.S., and we expect to see the same trend continue around the world.
 
Last quarter, our customers also began shipping tablets based upon our 
Clover Trail SoC and Windows 8. These systems boost up to 10 hours of 
battery lif
e, three weeks of connected standby and come in a range of sleek 
ultra light form factors, all while bringing the benefits of software 
compatibility with the millions of Windows applications written for Intel 
architecture. There are now 10 Clover Trail tab
lets shipping today with 
several more launching in the coming months.
 
2012 was a milestone year for Intel architecture and smartphones with our 
customers now shipping seven devices across 20 countries. These phones 
use our 32
-
nanometer Medfield SoC and our
 
extremely comparative with the 
best ARM designs on performance and equal or better power and battery 
life.
 
We saw the introduction of our 22
-
nanometer manufacturing process and 
along with it a revolutionary new tri
-
gate or 3D transistor technology. 22
-
nan
ometer products represented more than half of our volume in the fourth 
quarter as the rest of the industry works to ship its very first tri
-
gate 
designs.
 
In July, we announced an important strategic relationship with ASML, which 
combined with our process t
echnology expertise, will accelerate deployment 
of EUV and 450
-
millimeter technologies helping to ensure the future of 
Moore's Law and our growing manufacturing leadership.
 
Looking ahead to 2013, I am excited about the strong pipeline of our 
products, we h
ave coming to market. In the first half of this year, we will 
launch Haswell, enabling one of the most significant changes to the PC since 
Centrino in 2003. Haswell was designed from the ground up to enable 
breakthrough innovation in form factor, battery l
ife and usability. It will 
deliver the single largest generation
-
to
-
generation battery life improvement 
in Intel's history and it is inspiring a new wave of ultra
-
sleek, convertible, 
touch
-
based designs across our customer base.
 
Later this year, we will sh
ip 22 nanometer versions of our Zion and Atom 
products for the data center, bringing the power, performance and efficiency 
benefits of 3D transistor technology to our entire data center product line. In 
2013, we will also begin to deliver the industry's fi
rst 22 nanometer tablet 
and smartphone SoCs to OEMs. We are now shipping our single mode data 
LTE baseband to customers and over the course of the year will begin 
delivering multimode data and voice modems to customers, giving us a full 
complement of compe
titive technologies to grow our device business.
 
Last, but not least, we will begin our transition to 14 nanometers as we 
begin the world's first 14 nanometer products towards the end of this year. 
We see the industry in a period of transition and hyper in
novation. We are 
well
-
positioned to take advantage of these trends across the spectrum of 
computing from the lowest
-
power portable devices to the most powerful 
data center servers and everywhere in between.
 
With that, let me turn the meeting over to Stacy.
 
Stacy Smith
 
Thanks, Paul. The fourth quarter came in consistent with our expectations 
for 2012. Although our financial results were below our expectations 
entering the year, we launched leadership products in every major business 
segment and we extended o
ur manufacturing leadership. In 2012, revenue 
was $53.3 billion, gross margin was 62%, operating income was $14.6 
billion, net income was $11 billion and earnings per share was two dollars 
and $0.13.
 
For the year, the business continued to generate signifi
cant cash with almost 
$19 billion of cash from operations. We increased the dividend per share by 
7%, resulting in over $4 billion in dividends paid and repurchased roughly $5 
billion of stock. We continue to invest in our manufacturing leadership. We 
purc
hased $11 billion in capital assets, primarily building and equipping 
leading edge factories and made a $3 billion strategic equity investment in 
ASML.
 
Lastly, we took advantage of record low interest rates and borrowed $6 
billion. Total cash investments e
nded the year at roughly $18 billion, up 
approximately $3 billion from a year ago. Revenue of $53.3 billion was down 
1% from a year ago and below the expectations we had at the start of the 
year. Worldwide GDP growth was significantly less than we had thou
ght 
entering the year and the PC market segment with impacted by the growth 
of tablets.
 
Our PC client group was down 3% from a year ago. The data center group 
grew 6% year
-
over
-
year, as a richer mix of products and significant growth 
in the internet cloud 
segment of our business was partially offset by 
weakness in the enterprise server market. Gross margin of 62% in 2012 was 
flat to 2011 at the high
-
end of our historical range for the third year in a 
row.
 
Our investments in industry leading 
manufacturing process technology 
continued to pay off through leadership products and a highly responsive 
factory network. We invested over $10 billion in research and development 
in 2012, up almost $2 million from a year ago. The increase was driven by 
in
vestments in Ultrabooks, the data center, phones and tablets. In addition, 
we made investments in core capabilities, like security, SoCs and extending 
our process technology leadership. Spending, as a percent of revenue, was 
34%.
 
Fourth quarter revenue fin
ished at $13.5 billion, in line with expectations. 
We believe the worldwide PC supply chain saw a continued reduction in 
inventory levels in the fourth quarter as customers reduced inventory of 
older generation PCs. Gross margin at 58% was up one point fro
m 
expectations and down five points from the third quarter. The drop from the 
third quarter was driven primarily by excess capacity charges as a result of 
the aggressive tactical actions we took to reduce inventory levels and to 
redirect space and equipmen
t to 14 nanometer.
 
Our inventories decreased almost $600 million from the third quarter as a 
result of these actions. Separately, we start production on our next
-
generation microarchitecture product code
-
named Haswell, which we expect 
to qualify for sale t
his quarter. This production prior to qualification for sale 
resulted in an increase in inventory write
-
offs. Operating income for the 
fourth quarter was $3.2 billion with earnings per share of $0.48.
 
As we look forward to the first quarter of 2013, we are
 
forecasting the 
midpoint of the revenue range at $12.7 billion, down 6% from the fourth 
quarter. This forecast is in line with the average seasonal decline for the first 
quarter.
 
We are forecasting the midpoint of the gross margin range for the first 
quar
ter to be flat at 58% as the impact of higher factory start
-
up cost and 
lower volumes are offset by lower excess capacity charges and the 
qualification for sale of Haswell.
 
Turning to 2013, we are planning for revenue growth in the low
-
single digits 
and fo
recasting the midpoint of our gross margin range at 60%. Capital 
spending for our core business is expected to be roughly flat to 2012. 
Additionally, we will spend roughly $2 billion to start building our first 450
-
millimeter development facility.
 
We are f
orecasting spending for the $18.9 billion, a $700 million increase 
from 2012. This is the full year impact of the increase to investments and 
R&D that occurred in 2012 and annual salary increases for 2013. As a result 
of the significant progress we made in
 
2012 across all of our product lines, I 
enter 2013 optimistic about our long
-
term prospects.
 
A year ago, we were just introducing the concepts of Ultrabooks to the 
world. Today, the market has been redefined with thin, light, powerful 
Ultrabooks and conve
rtibles. A year ago, Intel was not shipping products into 
the tablet market. Today, we have Clover Trail tablets shipping in the 
market, delivering performance and power benefits versus what our 
competitors can do. And in 2013, we will ramp our next genera
tion tablet 
SoC, codename Bay Trail, in both, the Windows and Android markets.
 
Intel is now inside seven shipping smartphone designs. And here again, the 
third
-
party benchmark show that we are not only capable of matching the 
competition in power efficienc
y, we are leading them.
 
In 2012, we built on the strength of our data center offering and we expect 
to return to double
-
digit revenue growth in 2013. And lastly, we built on our 
manufacturing lead and are well into the ramp of our 22
-
nanometer factories 
an
d will start production on the 14
-
nanometer process this year. This puts 
us significantly ahead of the competition. The combination of new products 
and design wins across all segments and our manufacturing leadership will 
benefit our business in the quarte
rs to come.
 
With that, let me turn it back over to Mark.
 
Mark Henninger
 
All right, thank you, Paul and Stacy. We'll now move on to Q&A, and as is

Yes, sir. Our first question comes from the line of Ross Seymore with 
Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
 
Ross Seymore

Deutsche Bank
 
If I look back between the last
 
two years and then heading into what you 
just guided to for 2013, it seems like your CapEx and your OpEx are 
outgrowing revenues. I guess, if I partner that together with where the stock 
is trading valuation wise, it really looks like investors are dubiou
s as to when 
any returns are going to come from those investments.
 
So, I guess the question after that is, when do you see the investments 
come or the return on these investments coming. How long do you think this 
investment stays last and what are some of
 
the mile markers we should look 
for to see those returns being generated?
 
Paul Otellini
 
Ross, there's two parts to the CapEx this year. I mean, two large parts to 
the CapEx this year, Ross. One is, you are starting to see in our first 
significant investme
nts in bricks and mortar and some equipment for the 
450
-
millimeter transition which happens later part of this decade. We have 
to make to those investments earlier. Now that we've solidified our 
relationship and contractual relationship with ASML, it gives
 
us line of sight 
to that conversion and therefore we're now in a better position to predict the 
exact timing and deploy capital for that, so I would treat that as a more of 
an extraordinary event that's not related to the day
-
to
-
day business in terms 
of v
olume in 2014, 2015, 2016.
 
The CapEx that we are projecting on a base level, $13 billion minus the $2 
billion is $11 billion, which is about what we spent last year. And, as I look 
forward into the business in 2014 and 2015 as we finish up the 14
-
nanometer
 
factories and begin deployment of the construction of and 
equipping of the 10
-
factories, we need those factories principally for our 
view of the computing market, and in that that would include tablets and 
certainly the data center. So as we look at it, i
t gets used.
 
Remember the leading edge capacity is the lowest cost for us on a per unit 
basis, the highest performance and the lowest power. So regardless of what 
you think the size of the market is, the world's leading edge fabs are the 
single greatest as
set that we have.
 
Ross Seymore 
-
 
Deutsche Bank
 
I guess, this is my one follow
-
up, just playing off of that. Is the capacity that 

most of the incremental capacity for your core
 
PC related business? Or when 
you say computing, is it more DCG and I guess, the word computing could 
even include tablets and smartphones?
 
Paul Otellini
 
Yes, when I am talking about that I was specifically including the enterprise 
business, the data cente
r business. The PC business, as we have known it 
and as it's evolving and I would include tablets in that because as we look 
forward, it's very difficult to distinguish between a detachable, clamshell 
notebook and a tablet.
 
The form
-
factors are going to bl
ur here. The performance requirements are 
going to be the same spectrum of performance requirements that we think 
we have seen in the PC space over the last two years. I kept phones 
separately out of that discussion because I think the relative volume in 
p
hones in terms of this deployment of CapEx is still relatively small.
 
Operator
 
Thank you, sir. Our next question comes from the line of C.J. Muse with 
Barclays. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.
 
C.J. Muse 
-
 
Barclays
 
Yes, good afternoon. Thank you 
for taking my question. I guess this is a 
follow
-
up to Ross' question on CapEx. If we exclude that $2 billion on 450 
and we look at the core spending, can you talk about the spending on 
bricks
-
and
-
mortar last year and anticipated this year as a percentage 
and 
also how we should think about equipment spend as part of that.
 
Stacy Smith
 
Sure, Hi, C.J., this is Stacy. I will take that. Let me break out that capacity 
related CapEx in a couple of different ways. First if you look at it by process, 
it's very much 
driven by building for the peak of 14 nanometer and then it's 
the start of the investment and 10 nanometer. So just building on what Paul 
said, if you think about that, it's really building for units that we expect in 

 
start to see the peak of 14 
nanometer and the start of the ramp of the 10.
 
In terms of the breakout between what's for facilities versus what's for 
equipment, as I had showed at the investor meeting back in May, we are 
seeing that the facility related spe
nding is coming back and a higher 
proportion of that CapEx is for equipment.
 
C.J. Muse 
-
 
Barclays
 
And just as part of that, are you capitalizing investment in ASML or the R&D 
investment in ASML?
 
Stacy Smith
 

nvestment expense.
 
C.J. Muse 
-
 
Barclays
 
Great, and I guess as my follow
-
up, in terms of the guidance for low single
-
digit topline growth in '13, can you walk through the underlying 
assumptions, particularly as it relates to your outlook for PCs and the DCG
 
group?
 
Stacy Smith
 
Yes, I said in my prepared remarks, we expect the data center group to 
return to double
-
digit revenue growth and diving into that, it's the cloud 
data center plus our participation in portions of the market like storage and 
some of the 
networking sections of the market. It's both unit and ASP based 
on the strength of our product line and follow
-
up.
 
Then for the core PC market, the traditional PC market, we have pretty 
modest expectations around units and we think where the growth comes 
f
rom are these devices that sit in the middle. So the convertibles, it's the 
best of the tablet and the PC and then our beginning of participation across 
the tablet market.

We
lls Fargo. Please go

David Wong

Wells Fargo
 
Thanks very much. The $2 billion for future 450 millimeter production. Is 
this an ongoing expense? Will you need to put in a similar amount next 
year?
 
Stacy Smith
 
Yes, so as Paul said,
 
what changed over the course of 2013 is the industry 
consortium around 450triangulated on first equipment to be available in 
2015 which is why people are starting to talk about pilot lines in that 
timeframe. Frankly, a lot of that was enabled by our inves
tment in the ASML 
allowed the alignment around that timeline. So when we look at 2015 as the 
time where we can have equipment available, we want to start the 
production of the big construction of a development facility. That's typically a 
couple of year cy
cle and so I would expect some facility related spending 

won't get into the capital related spending for this into the back half of the 
decade, the production related capital spending
 
into the back half of this 
decade.
 
David Wong

Wells Fargo
 
Great, Thanks. The beginning of the 10

nanometer spending that you'll be 
doing this year, does that assume immersion lithography or EUV?

close to the best with those kinds of things for obvious reasons, David.

Thank you, sir. Our next question comes from Vivek Arya with Bank of 
America 
Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.
 
Vivek Arya

Bank of America Merrill Lynch
 
Thanks for taking my question. Paul, there are some reports Intel potentially 
manufacturing some ASICs for Cisco. My question is not about Cisco per se, 
but i
t's really a broader question. Is Intel fundamentally set up from an 
operational or a financial perspective to become a specialized foundry and 
what would be some of the financial metrics and the kind of end markets 
that you would target?
 
Paul Otellini
 
My 
view on this, Vivek, hasn't changed since the Analyst Meeting, Investor 
Meeting in May, so I can reiterate that for you. We are very interested in 
being a selective foundry manufacturer for certain customers. We don't see 
ourselves as a general purpose fou
ndry or competing with the general 
purpose foundries. The kinds of things we would do, we would not take 
business that would enable a competitor. We would certainly consider 
business that would enable and strengthen relationships with strategic 
partners.
 
T
he kinds of things that we've announced so far have been in the 
programmable logic area, which is an area that Intel is not in today, so that 
makes perfect sense and those kinds of companies need leading edge 
technology. So, that's the pattern for which we
 
would do this, so yes, we are 
in a position to be able to handle those kinds of customers. It's we've been 
building up that capability for several years now and we are now going into 
production. I described this I think in May as a crawl, walk, run strate
gy and 
we are still in the crawl part of it.
 
And to the second part of the question around our expectations around 
return, I mean it's pretty simple. To the extent that we engage with these 
foundry customers, we want to make money at it. We want to get pai
d in 
terms of margin and we want to get a return on our invested capital 
commensurate with our technology leadership.
 
Vivek Arya 
-
 
Bank of America Merrill Lynch
 
Thank you. As my follow
-
up, we have recently started seeing an increased 
adoption of ARM's Cort
ex
-
A15 processor and I believe earlier today, DSMT 
spoke about their optimism, but the 20
-
nanometer process ramping next 
year at a faster pace than they had ramped 28
-
nanomer. So, my question is, 
do you see the competition catching up in terms of performan
ce or in 
general how should we view the computing landscape? Thank you.
 
Paul Otellini
 
No, I don't. Now that we've met the power battery life curves and we are 
still on 32
-
nanometers as we move to 22 in 2014, you will see us accelerate. 
We've looked at the 
815, we've looked at the 815 specs and we know our 
own silicon in terms of Bay Trial and Cover Trail Plus, and we are very 
comfortable that we can maintain a performance lead there. Micro 
architecture is hard and it's something we've got 30 years of experi
ence at, 
and these devices are simply becoming very small computers and that's 
what Intel is exceptional at.

Joe Moore

Morgan Stanley
 
Great, thank you. Just a follow
-
up on the foundry question. You did say at 
the Analyst Meeting that you hadn't earmarked any of the capital spending 
for foundry. Is that still the case when
 
you look at the 2013 spending?
 
Paul Otellini
 
Yes. I mean, other than that two or three small customers that you have 
heard of is not driving our CapEx.
 
Joe Moore 
-
 
Morgan Stanley
 
Okay. Great, and if you talking about getting your historic returns, what 
do
es that imply on the price per wafer that you would charge relative to 
what other foundries charge on an apples
-
to
-
apples basis or is that too 
difficult to think about because you are in process node?
 
Paul Otellini
 
Well, I mean, we are pricing real time wi
th customers, so it's not per wafer. 
Most people are now pricing, the foundries are pricing per die or per 
millimeter square and that tends to be the model that we would use here to 
for the most part depending on this level of technology we are talking abo
ut. 
The pricing here is going to be value
-
based pricing. I mean, obviously it has 
to be competitive, but the value that we bring in terms of the technology is I 
think pretty exceptional.

Stacy Rasgon

Sanford Bernstein
 
Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. It sounds to me like you are 
guiding 
traditional PCs down a ton this year and yet you seem to making a 
very big bet on revenue growth in to 2014 because it seems like this flood of 

you need to take, in terms of share wi
thin tablets or how much of that tablet 
market needs to be eaten up by your convertible PCs in order to fill that big 
bet in 2014 that you seem to be making and avoid the underutilization that 
may otherwise happen from the CapEx that you are spending?
 
Stac
y Smith
 
I take issue with the characterization of guiding PCs down a ton and then 
some big snap back.
 
Stacy Rasgon 
-
 
Sanford Bernstein
 
But you said revenues were up of 2% with data center up in the double 
digits and phones and tablets ramping, which implie
s that the core PC 
business is down.
 
Stacy Smith
 
No, so I said for the company its low single
-
digits in terms of our expected 
revenue growth, data center up and back into the double digits. You still end 
up with client growth when you go through that and I
 
think the point that 
Paul was making earlier was a really important one which was the lines 
between a traditional notebook, a convertible, a tablet have blurred to the 

Q1 we think 
is seasonally down.
 

combination of new products in the market and an improving 

the year.
 
As we think, into th
e future, we think of it as just more or less normal 
growth, consistent with what we have historically seen, from a unit 
standpoint. It's just growth across a much wider range of devices than what 
we have historically supported. You want me to add anything
 
to that?
 
Stacy Rasgon 
-
 
Sanford Bernstein
 
Okay, I guess a follow
-
up on that. My math suggests that you are guiding 
depreciation this year at $1.7 billion quarterly run
-
rate, which is flat which 

ctually start 
getting depreciated on next year, which, again, tells me that you are looking 
for a fairly solid amount of growth in 2014 to cover that. At the same time, I 
know you talked about phones and data center and PCs and everything 
adding to that bu
t the data center business, you sell what, right now 16 
million chips a year, something like that which comes from a fab.
 
You have phones which Paul admitted, we are probably sill going to be 
small. Then you have tablets where the dies are a lot smaller. S
o unless you 
are driving tons and tons of volume, it is actually not a ton away for volume. 
So what sort of growth, is your historical level of unit growth enough to fill 
the CapEx you are putting in and what gives you confidence that you can 
you have that
 
same kind of historical level of unit growth?
 
Stacy Smith
 
I think it is and I think that we have line of sight into what our customers 
are designing around Haswell which is this year's innovative new core 
product and Broadwell which is next year. So we kn
ow the specs on those. 
The customers know the specs on those. I have seen the prototypes of the 
industrial designs. They are really exciting products. Our customers have not 
had this level of performance in this kind of form factor before.
 
To some extent, 
we are branch predicting that that level of product will 
generate sufficient excitement to keep the client growth going. In none of 
our numbers are we projecting an inflection point, upwards or downwards. 
We see renewed growth around these new form
-
factors
.
 
Stacy Rasgon

Sanford Bernstein
 
Got it. You have room to modulate CapEx down?

Group. Pleas

Sumit Dhanda

ISI Group
 
A couple of questions. One question on what happened in Q4. It seems like 
your PC client units were down 4%. So third
-
party data for PCs was up 2% 
to 3% sequentially depending on the way you look 
at. Was this mainly an 
inventory drain and perhaps if you could talk just broadly about the 
inventory picture at your customers, Paul, as you exited the fourth quarter?
 
Paul Otellini
 
Yes, I will take that. We think that there was an inventory drain and a 
w
orldwide supply chain for PCs in the fourth quarter. Our channel checks 
would suggest that a lot of older generation Windows 7 PCs were burned off 
in the quarter. When we look overall at inventory levels across all the 

 
healthy level of inventory. It looks 
appropriate for how we see demand and then in terms of our own inventory 
levels, obviously we reduced them significantly in the fourth quarter.
 
Sumit Dhanda 
-
 
ISI Group
 
Okay, and then for my follow
-
up, it's on ASPs. Th
ey are up, both on the data 
center and the PC client group. Any particular dynamic at work? I know in 
the third quarter, data center ASPs are weak because of the mix. If you 
could shed any light on both of those categories? Thank you.
 
Paul Otellini
 
Sure, in the data center, as I said in my comments, the driver was Romley 
was shipping to the Sandy Bridge for server part. That drove the mix up and 
it drove the mix to [MP] up and that helped drive the overall richness of the 
data center business.
 
On PCs
, what we saw was the strength in the core product line principally 
going into Ultrabooks and laptops and little more weakness than we would 
have first thought in the bottom of the PC market in our Celeron and 
Pentium product lines.

Citi
 
Thank you. I guess, question for you Paul on the potential for hybrid or even 
just Ultrabooks in the second h
alf of 2013, and [point] of it, I think we are 
starting to see a bifurcation where we are selling the small tablets and they 
seem to be selling well and actually the tenants tablets may be not selling as 
well as one would have expected and I wonder if that
's somehow opening up 
opportunity for the laptop, the Ultrabook, the hybrid to make a bit of a 
comeback.
 
Paul Otellini
 
Yes. I think coming out of CES, the trends are pretty clear, and certainly in 
Asia in terms of the buying patterns. Phones are getting bi
gger and you saw 
the core tablets, which is a phone tablet sort of form factor emerge which 
are six, even seven
-
inch phones. And then, of course, the shift of tablets 
from 10 to 7 inches, and I think that's probably what you are going to see. 
That the mark
et will bifurcate between sort of the 5 to 7
-
inch type of 
products and the 10
-
plus inch type of products. And then 10
-
plus inch type 
of products, particularly as you get to 12
-
13 inches are going to be more 
classic PC level of performance and now enabled b
y these convertible 
detachable form factors that only get thinner as Haswell and Broadwell come 
on.
 
Glen Yeung 
-
 
Citi
 
Interesting, and maybe to follow
-
up Stacy, just trying to think through the 
cash balance that Intel is comfortable working with, because i
t is a lot of 
spending coming up in a year where it's kind of anemic revenue growth. 
What's the level of cash at which you feel comfortable and is there any 
need? I know you raised that recently any need you think to have to do that 
at some point during th
e course of the year?
 
Stacy Smith
 
Not need, but we would certainly look opportunistically like we have been 
and we certainly have capacity if we ever wanted to, but I think it's 
instructive to just look at where we are. If you take Q4, which we would say 
w
as a relatively tough quarter at the top line, macroeconomic weakness, the 
impact of tablets on our business, we generated $6 billion of cash flow from 
operations, we had $2.5 billion of CapEx, we paid a little over $1 billion in 
dividends.
 
So, we are gene
rating plenty of cash to invest in our business and to pay the 
dividend and protect the dividend. So, I am not worried about it from that 
standpoint, and as I model out 2013, I get to a similar model where I am 
generating more cash than I need for those tw
o things.
 
In terms of the cash balance that I'm comfortable with, I am comfortable 
with how much cash we have today. I could live with a little bit less also and 
we make those decisions tactically as we go forward.

Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my call. I wonder if you could update us on 
your acquis
ition Infineon Wireless. It's been almost a couple of years. And 
specifically, where you are with 4G LTE, where you are with an integrated 
baseband plus Atom part and when we can expect to see more progress in 
handsets? Thanks.
 
Paul Otellini
 
Well, Infineon
 
is doing well. They are well on their way to an LTE solution. I 
talked about that in my commentary, but to reiterate what I said was that 
we are shipping the data mode now, the dual data mode and the voice mode 
shipping later this year.
 
First LTE phones, 
I would expect to have launched early next year, 
principally around MWC
-
14. We believe we have a very competitive solution. 
The Infineon team is known for not necessarily being first to market, but 
being really good at engineering a very solid solution and
 
being cost 
effective and cost competitive and I think that they are doing a very good 
job with respect to this product. In terms of integrated solutions, you'll see 
higher levels of integration from us next year.
 
Stacy Smith
 
Craig, if I could just add to 
that too? Paul talked about our roadmap side. 
The thing I'm struck by in this space is how hungry it is that the customers 

good roll of products across the year and it looks li

up to have us as one of their key partners.

Sorry, we broke off. But I would expect that as the LTE solutions are 

to be much in 
'13 and then it goes from there.

Thanks for taking my question. The question I have is, if you share with us 
you
r view on price elasticity in the client PC market in either and aggregate 
or on the notebook side? I guess what I am wondering is, for the better part 
of last decade, the model seemed to be you drop your price something on 
the order of like 5%, 6% a year.
 
You drive like and then that drove 10% to 
12% unit growth and you got single
-
digit revenue growth. Then in '10 and 
'11, you crushed growth, your prices went up and your unit growth really did 
not. Now in '12, we have a down year, '13 is low single
-
digit g
rowth and I 
am wondering if you think there is elasticity in the market and if you expect 
to drive your ASPs down in order to drive that elasticity. Thank you.
 
Stacy Smith
 

elasticity 
in the classic form factors. If we wind the tape back earlier than 
your comments, what we saw was a similar kind of price elasticity the 
desktop in the 80s and 90s. When PCs broke the $1,000, volume went 
dramatically up and the desktop PC continued to drop
 
down until it stabilized 
at the price points where minimum margin was available for all the players. 
The cheapest desktop was $299 sort of model or something like that.
 
Notebooks went the same way. First notebooks were $3,000 and now 
notebooks are $299 to
 
$1,299 in terms of the sweet spot. I think people will 
buy based upon their need within those price points, but it is very difficult 

support it.
 
What we are likely to see and wh
at we saw in the fourth quarter, in fact in 
the Windows 8, touch
-
enabled models was that people willing to spend a 
little bit more to get a more capable product. That certainly has been true in 
the Apple model for many, many years and I think that there is
 
model of 
getting paid for innovation. Intel's core product line has always shown that. 
Now you are starting to see it in the system
-
level price points as well.

up, if I may. EUV, do you guys have a view on 
when 
you can expect to start putting that into the factories? Thanks.
 
Paul Otellini
 
Again this is like the emergent question. It's why we keep those things 
pretty close to our vest. So it's not what I am prepared to talk about.

Thank you, sir. Our
 
next question comes from Romit Shah with Nomura. 
Please go ahead. Your line is open.
 
Romit Shah

Nomura
 
Thanks a lot. Stacy, if you take the 10
-
year median for revenue growth, 
starting in Q2, I only get the slight revenue growth for 2013. So it looks lik
e 
you are expecting a better than seasonal quarter. Could you talk a little bit 
about just how the year may play out in terms of trajectory?
 
Stacy Smith
 

mean back half gets stronger th
at normal seasonality. Is that what you 
mean?
 
Romit Shah 
-
 
Nomura
 
Right.
 
Stacy Smith
 

to, if you consensus GDP estimates, the consensus today is that there is a 
pretty significant s
trengthening in the worldwide economy over the course of 
the back half of this year.
 
Over that same ten years, the first correlation of our business is GDP 
growth. And then beyond that, it's the kinds of things that Paul has been 
talking about. You 
have Haswell coming into the marketplace, Windows 8 
gaining traction, Touch gaining traction, so you have these great devices 
that are coming in that are convertibles and kind of the best of the PC and 
the tablet experience and then we become more and more
 
represented 
across both, the Windows, tablet section of the market and Android over the 
course of 2013, and the combination of that puts us into a situation where 
we believe we have more than seasonal second half.
 
Romit Shah

Nomura
 
I'm a little confused
 
on how to think about Q2. It seems like seasonality is 
changing and the 10
-
year median is down 1%, but I've noticed just off the 
last couple of years, Q2 has been actually up anywhere from 1% to 5%. 
How do you guys look at it?
 
Stacy Smith
 
We will talk abo
ut Q2 in 90 days.
 
Mark Henninger
 
Excuse me. We are going to go ahead and take two more questions if you 
would please?

Suisse. Please go ahead. Your line is open.

Yes. Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for letting me ask the question. Paul, in 
2011, the emerging market was perhaps a better cushion that investors 
thought for the core PC business. In 2012, it was kind of maybe a bit bigger 
headwind than p
eople thought coming into the year.
 
I am kind of curious when you look at the 2013 guide, how you are thinking 
about emerging market? Was 2012 all just about decelerating GDP, or do 
you think there was some interplay of some white box tablets starting to 
c
annibalize within that region as well?
 
Paul Otellini
 
I think, in particular in China, the market dynamics are not much different at 
least in the Tier 1, 2, 3 cities. It's different than the U.S. so, yes, there is 
clearly some tablet sales that impacted low
-
end or first
-
time buyer PCs in 
China.
 
I think the bigger issue was in China and in Brazil last year, which are the 
two largest emerging countries, was their overall economic health. 
Remember, Brazil started seeing inflation that slowed down PC sales. Chin
a, 
the growth dropped and they had a regime change and we saw people 
stalling around what the policies would be post regime change and so forth.
 
Now, as we look into 2013, as Stacy said, China is still outgrowing any other 
large economy in the world and I 
think will be a driver for PC sales. We've 
been pleasantly surprised by the data center growth in China. They are 
deploying fairly large amounts of servers for infrastructure build out and 
that's helped our overall revenue picture in that country.

Thanks, Paul. That's helpful. And as a follow
-
up, Stacy, on the OpEx side, 
Other IA in the quarter is now annualizing an almost a $2 billion operating 
loss. As you think about kind of the OpEx, is this now the right run rate for 
all the
 
new initiatives and how do we think about that Other IA category 
maybe marching towards a breakeven number as tablets, phones become a 
bigger part of the revenue stream?
 
Stacy Smith
 
Yes. We are not increasing. We're not making incremental investments in 
2
013. And so, if you look at 2013, we expect employment to be pretty flat, 
so I think that the answer to your question is, yes, we think we are investing 
at the right level. We do have an increase in OpEx as we go from 2012 to 
2013 and it's just a full year
 
impact of the R&D investments that we talked 
about in 2012 and that investments are really being driven by Ultrabooks 
and tablets and phones and our SoC capability as well as our process 
technology leadership and it's interesting.
 
I think that when you lo
ok at our performance in the business, we've got 
some great products in the market. I think 2013 will be a year, where we're 
fighting and hopefully winning some big designs. I think you will see many of 
those designs coming to the market in the tablets spa
ces we've talked about 
and the phone space, the volume will grow over time and we expect that the 
business grows into this investment level over time.

Thank you. And our final question will come fro
m the line of Shawn Webster 
with Macquarie. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
 
Shawn Webster

Macquarie
 
Great. Thanks for squeezing me in, guys. First question on gross margins. 
Looks like they are a little bit better. I was wondering if you could share 
with 
us, you said your utilization rates would be below, I think, 50% in Q4. I was 
wondering if you could share with us where they landed and what you 
expect the trajectory to be in Q1 and maybe even beyond if you can?
 
Stacy Smith
 
Sure. Yes. We came in 
at a gross margin level a little bit better than expect 
in the fourth quarter and it played out from a utilization standpoint, pretty 
much as we expected. We brought the loadings out in the factories 
significantly. It was below 50%. We redirected equipment
 
to intercept some 
of the leading edge process technology, and we managed to bring inventory 
levels down on the order of $600 million which was consistent with what we 
said.
 
As we go into Q1, the forecast for gross margin is roughly flat. What you are 
seei
ng there in terms of excess capacity is, we will continue to see an 
improvement in excess capacity and we are going to start to see the 
increase in startup costs. The rough order of those two things offset and 
then there are couple of other puts and takes 
but it ends up with a slight 
gross margin.
 
As I think through in the shape for the year, which was the last part of your 
question, when I get to Q2, I think what happens is we see the further 
reduction in the excess capacity charges. In fact, they will be 
pretty much 
gone in Q2 but Q2 is where we will peak in terms of the startup costs. I 
think that the startup cost impact is a little bit more than the reduction in 
the excess capacity. So I expect gross margin in Q2, everything else being 
equal, to be flat 
to down.
 
Then we put 60% out for the year. So you should think about the second 
half expectations of gross margin back into the low
-
60s. When I think about 

and they start to come
 
down. It increases in volume which would be 
consistent with the seasonal second half. Then our cost comes down over 
the course of the back half of this year. Those are the three tail winds that I 
projected getting back up above 60%.

Okay, great, thanks. If I might, I have a question on some of the other. If 
you reload in the low single
-
digit revenue growth you have for this year, and 
we throw in the double digits datacenter, we throw in the single
-
digit growth 
in PC client, that
 
means the rest of your business must be falling something 
like 8% year
-
over
-
year for calendar '13 and some of these segments like the 
other IAA group includes some of your growth areas like you have been 
talking in tablets and smartphones. Can you share w
ith us your build plan, I 
mean not your build plan but your plan for the year? Or how you are 
thinking about some of these other groups over the course of the year?
 
Stacy Smith
 

about both the PCCG group and we talked about the data center group but 
being back in the low double
-
digits. When we run through the rest of the 
businesses, we would expect to start to see some progress in tablets over 
the course of the year. Phones is goi
ng to be, we will be winning designs but 
it is not going to move the needle from a revenue standpoint.
 
We talked about IMC in terms of the growth returns to that business as LTE 
ramps which is really in time. We are at the end of this year and in to next 
y
ear. We expect embedded will see some growth. It's been a nice growth 
engine for us. We think NAND will grow.

Thanks, Mark and good afternoon everyone. Our third quarter results came 
in slightly above our revised guidance as PC related billings improved in 
September over the July and August levels. We believe that Q3 PC sales 
grew approximately half of the seasonal norm and reflected flat enterprise 
sales. The billings upside we saw la
te in the quarter reflected our customers 
beginning their system production in advance of the Windows 8 launch later 
this month.
 
As we look into Q4, we believe that the overall PC business will grow at 
about half of what we would expect from normal seasona
lity. Our revenue 
forecast growth is below these levels as our customers are taking a cautious 
inventory approach in the face of market uncertainty and the timing of the 
Windows 8 launch. Our forecast assumes an incremental decrease in 
inventory at our cus
tomers going into year end.
 
Our Data Center business saw the Corporate Server segment softening over 
the course of the quarter, with the Cloud segment growing 50% over last 
year and storage revenue growing 27% to a new record. During the last 
month, I have
 
met with all of our major customers and while the market 
remains tough, I have been encouraged to see a renewed appetite for 
innovation across the entire ecosystem.
 
Our customers are designing entirely new categories of PCs that will take 
advantage of our
 

enabled Windows 8 operating system to bring dozens of beautiful new 
tablet, convertible and Ultrabook designs to the market.
 
In the coming months consumers will see tremendous form factor and 
industr
ial design innovation. There will be more than 140 Core based 
Ultrabooks, more than 40 of which will have touch. This will include more 
than a dozen convertibles that combine the productivity of the laptop with 
the convenience of a tablet.
 
Many of the Ultr
abook SKUs will hit the mainstream $699 price point with 
some Burst SKUs well below even that number. Q4 will see more than 20 
Atom based tablets from six or more leading OEMs using Clover Trail. Clover 
Trail is a brand new SoC that will enable tablets as 
thin as 8.5 millimeters 
and as light as 1.5 pounds.
 
With three weeks of connected standby battery life and all of the 
compatibility that Windows users and Intel customers have come to expect, 
I am excited about the these products and the capabilities they 
bring to 
consumers and the enterprise.
 
Last month at IDF, we shared details of our next
-
generation Core processor 
codenamed Haswell. Originally targeted at 15 watts, we have made 
significant advancements in micro
-
architecture and process technology that 
wi
ll allow us to move Haswell down into the 10 watt envelope fostering even 
more innovation in form factor as well as new usage models like gesture 
computing and voice recognition.
 

RAZR 
i, the world's only two gigahertz smartphone that delivers better 
battery life than similar computing devices. In general, I see the computing 
market in a period of transition, but also a period of breakthrough innovation 
and creativity.
 
Intel has a histor

better and stronger. With the hardware and software roadmap that spans 
the smallest portable devices to the most powerful datacenter servers and 
world leading silicon process technology, we are excite
d about the future 
and confident in our strategy and prospects in all the markets we serve.
 
With that, let me turn the call over to Stacy.
 
Stacy Smith
 
Thanks, Paul. Third quarter revenue came in at $13.5 billion flat from the 
second quarter and slightly be
tter than our revised expectations. For the 
fourth quarter of 2012, we are forecasting the midpoint of the revenue range 
of $13.6 billion, up 1% from the third quarter. This slight increase in 
revenue in the fourth quarter reflects the caution we are seein
g in the order 
patterns of our customers as a result of concerns about the global 
environment, ongoing consumer softness in mature markets and a slowing 
enterprise market segment.
 
As a result of weaker than expected demand environment, we are taking 
severa
l actions. We significantly cut factory loadings at the end of the 
quarter and we will maintain low factory utilization rates throughout the 
fourth quarter. We expect these factory adjustments to help bring down our 
total inventory levels by approximately 
$0.5 billion. Additionally, we are 
redirecting equipment and space to 14
-
nanomter from older generation 
technologies. The result of this is a $1.2 billion decrease from our July 
forecast for capital spending with the midpoint of our capital spending 
foreca
st for the year now at $11.3 billion.
 
Moving to gross margin; third quarter gross margin of 63% was slightly 
better than the midpoint of our revised guidance and flat to the second 
quarter. We are forecasting the midpoint of our fourth quarter gross margin
 
range to be 57%, down 6 points from the third quarter. Two
-
thirds of the 
gross margin decline is a result of that excess capacity charges. In addition, 
we expect an increase in inventory reserves as we start production on our 
next
-
generation micro
-
archite
cture product codenamed Haswell which we 
respect to qualify for sale in the first quarter of 2013.
 
Taking a look at the balance sheet, total cash investments ended the quarter 
at $10.5 billion, down approximately $3 billion to the second quarter. We 
genera
ted over $5 billion in cash from operations; paid approximately $1 
billion in dividends; repurchased nearly $3 billion in capital assets and had 
roughly $1 billion of stock repurchases. In addition, we closed our $3 billion 
strategic equity investment in A
SML.
 
As a result of lower than expected sales in the third quarter inventory grew 
by approximately $400 million. More than all of the increase in inventories 
came from the Ivy Bridge product ramp with an offset as we reduced 
inventory levels of older gener
ation products.
 
We are taking aggressive tactical actions to reduce inventory levels and 
redirect space and equipment 14
-
nanometer and we are also seeing some 
important positive trends in the markets. In the client space, we are seeing 
innovative products 
coming to the market with Intel Inside, ranging from 
Ultrabooks, to smartphones to tablets.
 
In the Data Center, we expect to continue to benefit from the dole out of the 
Cloud and a substantial performance cost and power benefit that our 
enterprise custome
rs get from our leadership products. Underlying all of 
this, our manufacturing advantage is extending over the rest of the industry 
as we start to ramp
-
up Haswell, our new micro
-
architecture on 22
-
nanometer and begin to build
-
out our 14
-
nanometer factory n
etwork. The 
combination of the tactical actions we are taking coupled with new products 
and design wins across all segments and our manufacturing leadership will 
all benefit our business over the coming quarters.
 
With that, let me turn it back over to Mark

question and just one follow
-
up if you have one. Patrick please go ahead and 
introduce our 
first questioner.
 
Question
-
and
-
Answer Session
 
Operator
 
(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Ambrish Srivastava 
from BB&T [BMO Capital Markets]. Your line is open.
 
Ambrish Srivastava 
-
 
BMO Capital Markets
 
Last I checked, I was from BMO, hi 
guys. First question is Stacy, just on the 
startup cost cadence, given that you are moderating the 14
-
nanometer a 
little bit. Typically, if I remember correctly, it's a two quarter cadence, how 
does that play
-
out this time around?
 
Stacy Smith
 
I am not seei
ng anything that would cause it to be off of historical patterns. 


pretty significantly in Q1, goes up some
 
more in Q2 and then it will start to 
come down from there. So I am not seeing anything that would cause that 
to be different from historical patterns.
 
Ambrish Srivastava

BMO Capital Markets
 
And then my follow
-
up is on the CapEx Stacy, does that change f
rom what 
you had given us during the 2012 Analyst Day for 2013?
 
Stacy Smith
 





in on 2013 number.
 
Operator
 
Our next question comes from Doug Freedman from RBC Capital. Your line is 
open.
 
Doug Freedman 
-
 
RBC Capita
l
 
Stacy, you gave a number at the Analyst Day regarding full year 2013 gross 
margin. Can you give us some idea what range you are looking at now that 
you are taking the actions you are presently communicating today?
 
Stacy Smith
 
Yeah, we will provide a fore
cast for 2013 when we get to January, so again 


through Q4 first.
 
There is a couple of things that I 

helpful, we've just talked about the startup costs. We are starting up 14
-
nanometer, so historically that's worth two to three points of gross margin.
 
In terms of excess capacity charges that we are taking, we ar
e taking a lot 

we get to Q2, I don't expect really any excess capacity charges. So yeah, 
you will see that play out.
 
And just to size those two things in Q1, I think the exces
s capacity charges 
and the startup costs are kind of roughly similar orders of magnitude; so 
those two things should offset. Beyond that, wait till we get to January 
because there are just many other moving parts for 2013.
 
Doug Freedman 
-
 
RBC Capital
 
So as
 
my follow
-
up, on the revenue side we did see some movement this 
quarter, probably not completely expected, PC Clients a little bit better than 
maybe you might have expected when you pre
-
announced. The Data Center, 
however, though has seen some ASP movemen
t that caused that revenue to 
be soft. Can you communicate to us what your outlook is as far as the 
revenue mix for next quarter and maybe what that might do to our gross 
margin number?
 
Stacy Smith
 

l answer your 
question on Q4. What we saw specifically in the Client side, it played out 
roughly as we thought when we did the preannouncement and if you step 
back from that, what we saw was some growth in consumption. But our 
customers continuing to manag
e inventories very lean, and in fact we saw 
across the worldwide PC supply chain, we actually saw a reduction in overall 
inventory levels in Q3, and normally in Q3 you would see an increase, so 
you can kind of get a sense of how lean they are managing thin
gs.
 
In the Data Center, what we saw was strong growth in the internet IP 
datacenters, the Cloud, that was up actually 50% from a year ago. It was 
offset, but we started to see some weakness on enterprise side and that's 
where you are seeing the lower ASPs 
just because of the difference in ASP 
between those two segments.
 

to the gross margin recon, there is an issues there with the excess capacity 
charges. We have some builds on Ha
swell; really ASP is not impact any 
gross margin and so you can take from that that we expect it to continue to 
be kind of similar mix in a roughly benign ASP environment.
 
Operator
 
Our next question comes from John Pitzer from Credit Suisse. Your line is 
open.
 
John Pitzer

Credit Suisse
 
Paul, how do you assess how much of what's going on in the PC market right 
now; is macro, timing of Windows 8 versus kind of the more structural 
bearish view that tablets and smartphones are just plain and simple eating 
in
to PC TAM. How do you think about those dynamics?
 
Paul Otellini
 
I think it's a bit of each and I would be reticent to quantify it John. Clearly, 
we saw a softening in the consumer segments. We talked about that when 
we did the pre
-
announcement about a mont
h ago and the surprise there was 
that China which had been very strong in those current week on us on top of 
continuing weakness in the mature markets of U.S. and Western Europe.
 
However, having said that, we do believe that when the numbers are all in, 
th
e PC consumption did grow in Q3 at about half the normal seasonal rate 
and will also grow in Q4 about half the normal seasonal rate. How much of 
that happening is macroeconomic versus the timing of the Windows 8 builds 
and the share of wallet, war for tabl

lot more about that 90 days from now after the Windows 8 launch, after we 
see Intel based tablets start shipping, when people start playing with the 
operating system and have all the touch based Ultrabooks out there.
 



 
John Pitzer 
-
 
Credit Suisse
 
And then guys as my follow
-

to talk about next year CapEx,
 
but underutilization in Q4 is clearly helping 

CapEx base, I think the underutilization is around the credit crisis saved you 
about $1.5 billion in capital spending. Is this go
ing to hold where as we go 

you are twice the base then can we think about $3 billion number in total?
 
Stacy Smith
 
I am not going to get to that level of granularity. You can see 
that 2012 
capital spending is down $1.2 billion from what we thought a quarter ago. 
Although, we have some indications that we were trending down a little bit 

January.
 
Operator
 
Our 
next question comes from David Wong from Wells Fargo. Your line is 
open.
 
David Wong 
-
 
Wells Fargo
 
Thanks very much. You commented on Clover Trail tablet; are you seeing 
many Ivy Bridge tablet designs in addition to the Microsoft Surface and can 
you give us
 
some idea of how many tablet makers you are currently working 
with on Haswell tablets for the future?
 
Paul Otellini
 
I can help you on the former, not the latter. On Ivy Bridge, you know, there 
is, I would say, a handful, five to eight, something like that
 

the top of my head. And for Haswell, it's too soon to tell, I mean we have, 
when you start seeing an Ultrabook with a detachable touch screen, is it a 
tablet and it's based on Haswell, so the tablet is an Ultrabook or is it a 
convertibl
e, you know, I don't know; lots of inventive names for these things 
as we go along. What I can tell you is that the level of innovation there is 
really unbounded; I haven't seen this in a long time.
 
But, I think in terms of, just little bit near term selli
ng season, there are 
some Ivy Bridge ones. They tend to be skewed more towards to the 
enterprise, where our customers believe that their customers, the CIOs of 
the world want a high performance tablet that is compatible, that is secure 
and that runs all th

those migrate versus I think Clover Trail stuff which was going to be a bit 
more consumer centric.
 
David Wong 
-
 
Wells Fargo
 
Great. And, you said you expect to qualify Haswell in the March quarter,
 
will 
Haswell be appearing in systems in the March quarter or should we look for 
that a bit later in the year?
 
Paul Otellini
 
The first half.
 
Operator
 
Our next question comes from Christopher Danely from JPMorgan. Your line 
is open.
 
Christopher Danely 
-
 
JPM
organ
 
Thanks guys. So Paul can you just give us maybe just your take on what you 
think is going to take to pull the PC industry out of this slunk? And do you 

never going to see the gr
owth in PCs we used to; is it going to be something 
lower than what we have been used to?
 
Paul Otellini
 

year in PCs as a function of which of those variables that we talked about 
ea




e last several years is the end state of 
computing.
 
The innovation is going to start pouring in now that you have widely 
available SKUs on a widely distributed operating system that will come from 
multiple vendors that can unleash their creativity. And, wh

is what form factor is going to win here, but I do think that some of these 
things that have sort of the best of both worlds, the performance and the 
capability of a laptop and the form factor and convenience of a tablet, are 
likely to b
e the things that are most high volumes earners, but we honestly 
won't know for 12 months.
 
Christopher Danely 
-
 
JPMorgan
 
Thanks. And a follow
-
up question for Stacy, just a clarification on the Q1 

utilization rates, 
underutilization cost look like. If we look at typical seasonality for Q1, you 
guys are probably down like a $1 billion or something like that. So if sales 
are down $1 billion and depression is up a little bit and startup costs are up, 
c
an the margins be flat with current utilization rates and what would 
inventory look like?
 
Stacy Smith
 
You are trying to back me into a forecast, a few lines and I hear that, I 
would maybe make a couple of comments though to your thesis. One is, 
based on wh
at we are seeing in the back
-
half of this year I am less 
convinced that normal seasonality is a great guide. What we are seeing is 
that the customers are managing things very cautiously; depending on how 
sales go, you know I think yeah, multiple different 
outcomes for Q1 and we 
will get there in a quarter.
 
In terms of inventory levels, we are too high today, because the unit volume 
that we expected in September didn't materialized, we were under on what 

inging that the 
utilization down; lowering inventory levels down significantly in Q4 back into 
a healthy range and our intent would be to keep them in that range.
 
Operator
 
Our next question comes from CJ Muse from Barclays. Your line is open.
 
CJ Muse 
-
 
Bar
clays
 
Yeah, thank you for taking my question. I guess just as a follow
-
up on the 
inventory side. Can you discuss what you have seen downstream particularly 
in China and then also as part of the healthy days, my math suggest exiting 
December at roughly 75 d
ays. Is that kind of the new normal we should 
think about for you guys in a lower PC growth rate environment or do you 
think that you need to be some thing lower?
 
Paul Otellini
 
Let me try the China one CJ, and Stacy will come to the inventory.
 
Stacy Smith
 

 
Paul Otellini
 
I was just in China a week and a half ago, so there is a fairly current view. I 
see the same situation. China as a manufacturing center is reflecting the 
comments that we had in our commentary which is that the O
EMs are being 
very cautious with their inventory comments at this point in time for all the 


 
In terms of the channel 
inventory, there really isn't very much. I went into 

People are generally 
--
 
I think most of our customers worldwide spent a lot 
of Q3 thinning out their Windows 7 inventory, so
 
they wouldn't have an 
overhang at the launch. And that accounts for a lot of this inventory shipped 
of our billings versus the consumption that we've been talking about. And 
now with the launch of Windows 8 coming in a week or so, you'll see a new 
round o
f build and hopefully consumption.
 
Stacy Smith
 
Yeah and
 
in terms of the inventory targets, the number you threw out is in 
the 70s is where we're planning to get to in Q4. Just to put that in 
perspective maybe two other comments on what we're doing. One is 
we are 
taking down utilization in the factories down to sub 50%, again to take 
inventory out and free up the opportunity to move both space and 
equipment and redirect that to 14
-

series of actions. And I also want to 
point to the inventory that we have in 


salability of the inventory, but I do want to bring the Ivy Brid
ge inventory 

 
Operator
 
Our next question comes from Kevin Cassidy from Stifel Nicolaus. Your line 
is open.
 
Kevin Cassidy 
-
 
Stifel Nicolaus
 
And maybe along those lines of the utilization or underutilization
, in last 

around the risk of too much capital spending and that Intel had one more 
fab building that needed what we would do; is this part of that plan; are you 
mothballing one buildi
ng?
 
Stacy Smith
 

that we're constantly trying to match our capacity that's in place to the 
demand. We are putting in capacity for bigger second half than we got. We 
are going to now m
ake adjustments, so that we can move capacity to 14
-
nanometer and bring our inventory levels down.
 

make sure we have the ability in terms of what we call white space to some 
unallo
cated factory space as well as some equipment to respond to upsides. 
The risk of being caught short and the cost of being caught short is much 
more than the cost of being long, because as you can see when we get a 
little long, we can take actions and withi
n a six month period, we can get 
back aligned. If you are sure it can take you two years to get caught back 
up.
 
Kevin Cassidy 
-
 
Stifel Nicolaus
 
And with the reuse of equipment, can you give an idea what percentage that 
is that can be reused from 22
-
nanomet
er to 14
-
nanometer?
 
Stacy Smith
 

range of 80% to 90% of the equipment that we buy and 22
-
nanometer is 
usable at the 14

When you talk about clearing inventory, does pricing come into play in any 
fashion on the PC, just talk about pricing a little bit on the Data Center side, 
clearing inventory on either the consumer side or 
the enterprise side, is that 
helping? And then follow
-
up also a little bit on an earlier question, is there 

sort of Microsoft take matters a bit into their own hands with some of the 
designs that they are trying to sell; is pricing help you spur demand or is 
there something else that you can do?
 
Paul Otellini
 
The short answer to your question is no on pricing. We do forward pricing 

o move into the 
mainstream price points in terms of the stuff I talked about. If you look at 
our PC group numbers quarter
-
over
-
quarter, the ASP was about flat year
-
over
-
year. It was down a bit, mobile was down a bit. What that reflects was 
really us going 
after some incremental share at the bottom of the market, so 


the driver on that side.
 
In terms of demand s
timulation, a lot of what we are doing is really to make 


our customers and the ecosystem just, for exampl
e, bring the touch SKUs 
in. So six to eight months ago that we did not have line of sight to 40 out of 
a 140 SKUs of Ultrabooks being touch enabled, it was probably five or 10; 

So
 
working with the vendors and the glass manufacturers to bring the cost 
of touch as an increment down has been one of the key things we think we 
can do to drive demand.

And related to pricing, you've obviously got a 
wounded competitor out there 
now. Are you seeing that competitor get aggressive on pricing, especially in 
this environment? Your competitor talked about a big inventory write
-
down 
in its negative preannouncement; are you seeing lower pricing there and is 
t
hat in any way impacting you?
 
Paul Otellini
 
I think you would have to ask them their strategy for pricing. As Paul said, 

the lower end of the market; that's our strategy here. So you

them the question about their pricing strategy.

Guys, kind of a question stand on the margins. In the context of cyclical 
history, what we are seeing here isn't too unique from the standpoint of the 
margins usually decline pretty significantly on the other side of the big 
CapEx cycles. I think the average margin decline is 700 basis points. The 
peak is 1,300 basis points. You
 
are down about 1,000 basis points now from 
the peak gross margins, so pretty normal. Is there anything you see in that 
context that would cause this margin decline to be worse than some of the 

 
Stacy Smith
 
R
ight;
 
I think that when you go back and look across the long range of 
history, when we have seen a situation where the industry got a head on 
capacity, the time that it took to get things realign typically was much longer 
than two quarters. I think we have
 
done a lot to improve the 
responsiveness, and I think that has been helpful and you saw that in 2009, 
but if you go back before that as opposed to a couple of quarters, you are 
sometimes starting at couple years to get capacity back in line. I think that'
s 
different.
 
And then the other thing I would point to that's different is while the decline 
is significant and we are taking some excess capacity charges, if you 
compare what we're going through now with 2009, in 2009 we were into the 
mid to high 40s; now
 
we're in the mid to high 50s and I think that really 
points to the structural improvements we made in our business in terms of 
cost and mix and the competitiveness of our products, and so while it may 

ster and we are still 
maintaining a higher gross margin.
 
Jim Covello

Goldman Sachs
 
So my follow
-
up question stands specific to the Data Center Group, some of 
the ARM based server players are arguing that they can now address a 
significant part of the wor


seeing in that area or do you think that ARM still isn't competitive in that 
realm?
 
Paul Otellini
 
They need to add features sets like 64
-
bits
 
and ECC and RAS features to be 
particularly in those environments to be considered, so that maybe a 
roadmap planning opportunity that they are pushing but the products that 
are being shipped today certainly don't have those feature sets.
 
You can look at s
ome of the workloads, things like Hadoop, Jim that would 
be conducive to let me say in a ray of micro servers, and those can easily be 
run on Atom; we've got our second generation of the Atom micro server 
chips out now, the first one is on 32
-
nanometers. N

the 22
-

push Atom as hard as possible in this space and have it be a better offering 
for our customers than having to switch all their software and worry about 
all the reli
ability features.

Our next question comes from JoAnne Feeney from Longbow Research. Your 
line is open.
 
JoAnne Feeney

Longbow Research
 
Yeah, I was hoping you can elaborate a little bit more on what you are 
seeing and what you saw last quarter and
 
what you expect this quarter in 
terms of the mix of demand, both across consumer and enterprise 
geographically and then PC, you know, notebooks, desktops; just some 
more color if you would on what kind of mix you are seeing out there and 
where you expect 

inventories clear say by the beginning of 2013?
 
Paul Otellini
 
Well, let me start with the last part. The inventory, I thing is straight 
forward. The work
-
in
-

expecting to 
come down over this quarter are our Ivy Bridge products which is the 
mainstream high
-
end product we have today. And as the market picks up, 
Windows 8 launches, Ultrabooks pick up and so forth then that just 
consumes that inventory. And as I sa

our OEMs are running very lean right now. So any kind of demand blip would 
cause us to be able to reduce that even more perhaps.
 
In terms of the mix, there is really not much more to add than we put in our 
pre
-
releas
e and in the comments today which is that the U.S. and Western 
Europe PC markets remained soft in terms of consumers. The change that 
we have seen and we talked about at the pre
-
announcement was that the 
enterprise PC market has gone relatively flat now an

reflection of large corporations making hard decisions on CapEx versus 
people, and where they want to put their investments and now that seems 
to have spilled over from the client side of the enterprise also the data 
center server p
art of the enterprise. And you know I think we will see how 
that sorts out over the next quarter or so as CEOs and CIOs make their next 
round of decisions.
 
In terms of China, the slowdown there was 

 

business and the slowdown th
ere was in consumer notebooks.
 
Stacy Smith
 

over the course of the quarter weakening in the large enterprise purchases 
of server chips. So the mix there was more towards the Cloud.
 
Pau
l Otellini
 
Mix had been strong in the first half.
 
Stacy Smith
 
Mix had been strong in the first half, yeah.
 
JoAnne Feeney

And then as a follow
-
up, Stacy could you let us know what happened with 
units versus ASPs in PCs versus servers last
 
quarter?
 
Stacy Smith
 

units up 1% versus the prior quarter and datacenter units were also up 1%. 
This is a quarter
-
on
-
quarter compare.
 
JoAnne Feeney

Longbow Research
 
Sorry, and th
e ASPs?
 
Stacy Smith
 
The PC ASPs were down 1% and the server ASPs were down 7% based on 
the mix kind of things that I have been talking about.

Great, thanks so much. First question, I want to see if we can go back to 
China and Paul may be kind of recap some of the feedback you are hearing 
from those meetings you did have, because it seems like the slowdown in 
China is really impactin
g global PC demand and weakness out there. So just 
curious what the latest you are hearing?
 
Paul Otellini
 

macroeconomic cycle slowing down, I mean the GDP forecast for the year 
have c
ome down for next have come down. There is also a reasonable 
amount of anxiety around the change in government and that tends to put a 

of that clarifies after they change, because 

who is coming in. The issue is what are the policies, in terms of stimulus and 
taxation and so forth. They have been pretty generous the last year or so, a 
year or two rather, in terms of stimulating domestic consumption an
d the 
question is will those polices continue or not.
 
Patrick Wang

Evercore Partners
 

right now are down since the last quarter; I am just kind of curious how you 
see that over 
the next couple of years, because when we take a lot at your 

about 50% growth last quarter. As that continues to really outstrip growth 
from your more traditional server customers, wh
at kind of impact does that 
do to your blended ASPs?
 
Paul Otellini
 
Well, I think the better comparison for us the Data Center is year
-
on
-
year, 
for which the ASP was up a bit, up 1%. The down a bit was really a big shift 
in the mix between what would be nor
mal enterprise growth and of slowing 
in the enterprise growth. In general, for storage, for networking and I think 
for some aspects of the internet data center the mix was actually quite good. 
Sometimes they 

 
two way machines versus four way machines, but
 
they 
tend to be fairly high mix and one of the fastest growing elements of the 
business is high performance computing which buyers buys at the top of the 
line of our skews. As those product lines get flushed out more and more, I 
really don't see the mix s

this year; I see the current mix being a bit of an anomaly as a result of the 
softness of corporate datacenter server purchases.

Stacy, maybe the first question for you. As you sort of think about your 
capacity for 2013 and you are obviously taking action now, what kind of PC 
environment are you notionally targeting and maybe just in up or down is 
sufficient unless you want to be more specific?
 
Stacy Smith
 
Yeah, I am going to be less specific. If you wanted the other, yeah either up 
or down; hold off on triangulating on a capit
al forecast or on a unit growth 
until we get to next quarter. The CapEx number as I said is going to be 


curren
t quarter; I want to have the 90 days to really think about what we 
want to put in place.

see when we have an operating transition like we're seeing a spark to PC 
d
emand and yet we don't seem to be seeing that and I wonder if you could 

happening?
 
Paul Otellini
 

this new opera
ting system. As I said earlier, it brings touch into the 
mainstream for the first time and we know that in the last couple of years 
the tablets have changed the paradigm for people to use computers, they 
like touch, they like to make the photos get larger 
with their fingers and 
everything else is good about that. And so I think we haven't had a chance 
to really judge how the consumers will embrace this in the mainstream PC 
space or not.
 
I am very optimistic as we've been playing with these things and we see
 
the 
products being built and we take them out for testing to consumer and 
we've now on test on Windows 8, touch enabled Ultrabooks in number of the 
major cities around the world, across multiple demographics. The feedback 
is universally positive. So I thi


now.

Yes hi, two questions. First question for you either Paul or Stacy, you know 
you noted that inventories are lean and you expect half the normal seasonal 
growth in PCs, but you're dialing down that number. If the se
t up is lean 
from an inventory perspective, why are customers choosing to take down 
inventories even further or is that just a cushion you are building into your 
forecast for the fourth quarter?
 
Stacy Smith
 
I think it's just caution. We're seeing a very ca
utious environment there. But 
I think it's a combination of what they are seeing from macro standpoint and 
a slowing enterprise and operating system transition and weak consumer 
mature market segment, I think all of that is just leading people to be 
cautio
us. Ultimately, I think leaner inventory levels are healthy, but that's 
what we're seeing right now.

My second question was actually a follow
-
up on the server ASP stuff that 
was talked about earlier on the call. I guess my question was I
 
think you 
talked about the fact that you have twice as many SKUs with Romley with a 
sort of $1,000 mark from a processor pricing perspective. Has the uptake on 
the higher SKUs stalled and I guess sort of in line with this question, I was a 
little confused
 
by why the Cloud mix would be so much poorer versus the 
enterprise mix, because I would have assumed that the uptake in Cloud 
would be a richer mix and that would actually help your ASPs relatively 
(inaudible)?
 
Paul Otellini
 
A lot of the cloud is two way 
versus enterprise at four way. That will add

So with that, let me hand it over to Paul.
 
Paul S. Otellini
 
Thanks, Mark, and good a
fternoon, everyone. Against a backdrop of mixed 
macro economic trends, our business in the second quarter played out 
largely as we expected. We continue to enjoy a rich mix of products in both 
the PC and data center group, and our distributor channel had i
ts best Q2 in 
five years.
 
Our Technology and Manufacturing Group once again delivered fantastic 
results. Our 22
-
nanometer process health is ahead of where a 32
-
nanometers was at the same point in its ramp, and ahead of our own plans. 
That enabled us to ram
p Ivy Bridge to nearly a quarter of our PC volume, 
our fastest ramp ever.
 
We also announced an important agreement at the ASML last week that we 

and EUV Lithography technologies by 
up to two years, and deliver significant 
value to our shareholders.
 
Ultrabooks continued to build momentum, and achieved our volume goals 
for the first half. We are very pleased with the level of innovation and 
invention being brought into this category, a
nd are now tracking over 140 
Ivy Bridge base designed in the pipeline. Of those, more than 40 will be 
touch enabled and a dozen will be convertibles.
 

$699 systems at retail this f
all. We are also tracking more than 20 Windows 
8 Tablet designs based on our low power and low cost Clover Trail Atom SoC 
in addition to a number of core based tablets.
 
In our data center business, volume growth combined with a rich mix drove 
record server
 
revenues. In fact, the mix up to our highest performing 
[Walnut] products was more than two times that of the prior
-
generation 
Westmere at the same point in this ramp. DCG grew 15% over the second 
quarter last year with cloud volume growing at more than t
wice the rate of 
the rest of the server market segment. Those figures put the data center on 
track to the growth targets that we shared with you in May.
 
High
-
performance computing continues to be one of the fastest growing 
segments within our data center b
usiness. And earlier this quarter, we 
announced more technical details behind our new Many Integrated Core Co
-
Processor throughout later this year. Branded Xeon Phi, this new product 
family will combine the throughput of highly parallel computing with the 
familiar programming models of the Intel architecture. Phi will be an 
impressive product for the HPC market segment with more than 50 cores 
manufactured on our 22
-
nanometer Tri
-
Gate process technology. We already 
have more than 40 customers bind up to supp
ort the architecture.
 
In the smartphone space, we saw the launch of Medfield
-
based phones from 
Lenovo, Lava and Orange to great reviews. These launches further 
established Intel in the market building on the wide presence we have in 
baseband.
 
Overall, our 
business in the first half was consistent with our expectations. 
As we look ahead at to the second half of the year, consumer market growth 
in Western Europe and North America is not forecasted to recover as fast as 
we had anticipated. Worldwide enterprise
 
demand is growing as expected.
 
Emerging markets, especially China and Brazil are still growing nicely, but 
are moderating due to GDP adjustments and currency fluctuations. Taken 
together, these factors have led us to adjust our expectations for the second
 
half. We are now expecting full
-
year revenue growth in the 3% to 5% range 
versus our prior expectation of high single digits.
 
Our results in the second quarter demonstrates, that having a deep and long 
established presence in every geography, combined wit
h leading technology, 

especially valuable in the mixed market we are now experiencing. With the 
wide range of Ultrabooks and Intel
-
based tablets expected to be available 
this year, an
d an exciting Windows 8 launch just around the corner, we 
remain optimistic about our future.
 
With that, let me turn the call over to Stacy.
 
Stacy J. Smith
 
Thanks, Paul. The second quarter results came in largely as expected. 
Second quarter revenue came in
 
at $13.5 billion, up 4% year
-
on
-
year.
 
Enterprise in emerging markets contributed to the year
-
on
-
year growth 
somewhat offset by continued weakness in mature markets. The core 
business came in as expected though we saw softness in our NAND memory 
business. 
At the segment level, the PC Group grew 4% from a year
-
ago and 
the Data Center Group grew 15%.
 
Inventory levels across the worldwide PC supply chain are healthy, but are 
being managed below historical averages based on macroeconomic 
uncertainty and ahead o
f the Windows 8 operating system release. For the 
third quarter of 2012, we are forecasting the midpoint of the revenue range 
of $14.3 billion, up 6% from the second quarter, which is at the lower end of 
the historical range.
 
Moving to gross margin, second
 
quarter gross margin of 63% was slightly 
better than the midpoint of our guidance and down slightly from the first 
quarter. Our forecast for 2012 is unchanged at 64% gross margin for the 
year and our gross margin forecast for the third quarter is 63%.
 
As 
expected, the fast ramp of Ivy Bridge resulted in a cost increase in the 
second quarter. We expect that the second quarter was the peak in terms of 
platform unit costs with cost coming down in the third quarter and more in 
the fourth quarter. For the secon
d quarter, spending was in line with 
expectations with $4.6 billion. Based on the macroeconomic environment, 
we have taken actions to slow hiring and as a result, by lowering our 
spending forecast for the year to $18.2 billion. We expect spending in the 
th
ird and fourth quarters to be flat to the second quarter.
 
Taking a look at the balance sheet, total cash investments ended the quarter 
at $13.6 billion approximately flat to the first quarter. We generated 
approximately $5 billion in cash from operations, 
paid approximately $1 
billion in dividends, purchased nearly $3 billion in capital assets, and had 
roughly $1 billion of stock repurchases.
 
Inventory grew by approximately $400 million. More than all of the increase 
in inventories came from the Ivy Bridge 
ramp, but then offset as we reduced 
inventory levels of older generation products.
 
While macroeconomic weakness and our expectations that our customers 
will continue to maintain lower inventory levels has lead us to reduce our 
expectations to 3% to 5% 
revenue growth for the year. We continue to 
make great progress in the market. Both Romley and Ivy Bridge ramps are 
significantly faster than their predecessors. We are winning significant 
designs in Ultrabooks, phones and tablets. And our manufacturing le
ad 
continues to generate leading products and low costs.
 
With that let me turn it back over to Mark.

Our first question comes from the line of Glen Yeung, Citi.
 
Glen Yeung 

 
Citigroup Inc.
 
Thanks very much. I think my 
first question is about the distributors, I think 
Paul you said that they had their best future in the five years. Anyone if you 

 
Paul S. Otellini
 
Well, over the 

 

everal years, our 
distribution channel role has shifted and evolved quite a bit. If you take a 
snap shot five years ago, most of the business was then distributing desktop 
microprocessors, and mother boards, and then went into white box builds. 
And as the 
PC market shifted from desktops to notebooks they became less 
of a driver of the PC volume. They picked up skill sets to do systems 

distribution channel has sort of reinvented itself and 
is now a fairly 
significant force in not just the desktops, in emerging markets or pre
-
assembled notebooks, but increasingly for servers and storage systems.
 
Glen Yeung 

 
Citigroup Inc.
 
Got it. All right, thanks. And as a follow up, maybe for Stacy, lookin
g at the 
gross margin guidance and looking at your reconciliation in the printed 
commentary, it sounded like the only negative impact to gross margins in 
Q3 would be these other cost of sales, and I wonder if you could just explain 

?
 
Stacy J. Smith
 

opportunities to take some 32
-


year. And 
so we are taking some of those factories off and so you will see a 
little bit of demolition costs and some of those things that flows through 


in gross margin in the third quarter.
 
Glen Yeung 

 
Citigroup Inc.
 

 
Stacy J. Smith
 

demand coming in less than expec
ted and I actually talked about it in the 
investor meeting, we look for opportunities to take the older generation 
capacity offline and because we can reuse that equipment at the leading 
edge, we just take advantage of those opportunities.

Your next question comes from the line of Sumit Dhanda, ISI Group.
 
Sumit Dhanda 

 
ISI Group, Inc.
 
Yes. Hi, guys. First question, Stacy, could you just tell us in terms of yo
ur 
expectations in the channel refill that you talked about on the previous call, 
are you shipping back to demand levels, the 3% rise in PC Client units 

thinking about that into the t
hird quarter?
 
Paul S. Otellini
 
Yeah. So generally in the second quarter, the core business came in as we 
expected when we started the quarter, that being slightly below the 
midpoint was really entirely due to NAND, which I can talk about 
separately 
later in the call. In terms of what our expectations are for the inventory 
pipeline, I think we saw more than in Q2 than we expected. And as we look 
into the back half of the year, our current expectations that some of you are 
hearing from custo
mers is, based on macroeconomic uncertainty and the 



rd quarter.
 
Sumit Dhanda 

 
ISI Group
 
Okay. and then as my follow
-
up, just a question on the 

 
what seems to be 
a pretty significant dichotomy between notebook volumes and desktop 
volumes sequentially, especially, given that you said kind of price was 
decen
t. so I would have thought desktops might do a little better, but 
curious to hear what your explanation on that is if any?
 
Paul S. Otellini
 




done a really good job of driving segmentation. And so, again, even with 

of that
 
is segmentation and ASP uplift.
 
Sumit Dhanda 

 
ISI Group
 
Thank you.
 
Operator
 
Your next question comes from the line of Daniel Berenbaum, MKM Partners.
 
Daniel Berenbaum 

 
MKM Partners LLC
 
Thank you. Maybe actually just a follow
-
up on that, when you talk ab
out 
segmentation and the ASP uplift that also leads it to the competitive 

competitor just based on their recent news. can you talk a little bit about 
why you think that is with the P
C space, you mentioned a little bit that 

emerging markets or is it more really with the data center, can you help us 
understand that?
 
Paul S. Otellini
 
Well, if I understand their
 
pre
-
announcements, well, we did a little bit better 
than them. We thought this quarter was probably in the low
-
end desktop 
and notebook business. So we probably took back a little share at the 
bottom of the PC SKUs, I think our position in the servers is 
really 
unchanged and is really quite good.
 
Daniel Berenbaum 

 
MKM Partners LLC
 
Okay. And then going back to the inventory question, you talked about the 
inventory and the channel being a bit low, but your own inventory is quite 
high. Understand that a lot 
of this is coming from the ramp of new products, 
but what gives you the confidence in guiding to relatively high gross margins 
for the rest of the year, for the full year, are you 

 
what are the puts and 
takes there and what should we be concerned about or
 
what are you 
concerned about potentially with that inventory build?
 
Paul S. Otellini
 
Yeah. So, let me take those as two separate things. The inventory build is 
directionally what we expected. I think the one thing that we are able to fill 
Ivy Bridge a lit
tle faster than we thought and Ivy Bridge, it accounts for all 
of the inventory growth, its both the units and dollars this quarter. And when 
I look across CPU inventory level, Ivy Bridge is not more than half of the 
inventory that just sitting in there. A
s I think about the next quarter, I think 

of inventory will start coming down from here would be my expectation. 
With the gross margin story for us really is a cost story and I
 
talked about 

factories at the same time on 22
-
nanometer. Those early products coming 
out of the factories are pretty expensive products that led to a peaking cost 
in Q2.
 
As we move into
 
Q3, we now have the phenomenon where cost comes down 

our volume in Q2. We are going to more or less double that volume in Q3, 
and so yeah, this phenomenon where cost come down
, but the volume 

point, and then I get more cost good news in Q4, as that ramp starts to 
flatten out a bit.
 
And so, really the thing I mentioned on gross margin is, are we on the p
ath 

the cost, with ramp rates little ahead of forecast, that gives me the 

and that gets me to 64% for the
 
year.

Our next question comes from the line of Christopher Danely, JPMorgan.
 
Christopher B. Danely 

 
JP Morgan Chase & Co.
 
Thanks guys. First question for Paul. Paul, can you just
 
talk about maybe put 
a little more color around the macro slowdown you are seeing, when it 
happened, was it just a sudden jump down, has it been a slow erosion, but 
maybe going to the geos a little bit, which has been more impacted or less 
impacted?
 
Paul 
S. Otellini
 
Sure. Well, first of all, let me color it by saying that we still see growth in all 

half, and gave the year
-
over
-
year numbers. What we had expected, that we 
would see 
by now is that the U.S. and Western Europe consumer businesses 

quarters. And as a result of not seeing that, two things are happening: one, 

we first thought, but the 
inventory replenishment coming off of the hard drive shortage is not as deep 
as we thought or as large as we thought, because people are expecting to 
sell into a smaller overall TAM growth.
 
In terms of China and Brazil, which I si
ngled out, but I could have also 
spoken a little bit about maybe Russia and India. In some of the countries 

fluctuations against the dollar. Most PC components including ours are sold 
g
lobally in dollars, and the PCs are typically priced in dollars. So 

 
at least to 
the distributors in those countries, so the price goes up as the currency 
changes.
 

abatement of the GDP growth and sort of 8.8% in the quarter down to 7.7% 
in the quarter. And while we still see growth there, we don't see quite as 
much as we first thought. So we add all those together plus the fact that the 
enterprise is doing pretty goo
d, you come down to a more muted growth 
scenario than we first thought.
 
Christopher Danely 

 
JPMorgan
 
Thanks. And as my follow
-

somewhat back to normal. Is that because you expect Win 8 to drive PC 
demand or some i
nventory replenishment or well your tablet and handset 
efforts start to be material, can you just go into detail on that?
 
Stacy J. Smith
 
I think if you take 

 
Chris, if you take the midpoint of our revenue guidance 

s kind of seasonal on the back of the 

seen. Specifically, to your question, no, it's not predicated on doing more 

 
those 


momentum that builds into 2013.
 
Christopher Danely 

 
JPMorgan
 
So then why Q4 back to normal then?

inventory levels. You have refresh with Windows, and we have seen over 20 
years of history, a pattern in the back half sales tend to larger than front

Your next question comes from the line of Romit Shah, Nomura.
 
Romit Shah 

 
Nomura Equity Research
 
Thanks. There have been reports over the last month or so that Intel has 
been cutting prices on Ivy Bridge, I was hoping you could just comment on 
that. Is i

 
Paul S. Otellini
 
No. Our pricing strategy is unchanged and Ivy Bridge is coming in at the top 
of the scale. What those reports may 

 


in more price 
points with Ivy Bridge, but we have not reduced our price points.
 
Stacy J. Smith
 
As Paul said, by the way, the place where we probably won some share and 
where we are seeing kind of robust pricing as more at the very lower end of 
PC market is
 
not where Ivy Bridge is pointing.
 
Romit Shah 

 
Nomura Equity Research
 

you highlight lower platform ASPs, could you give us some color there?
 
Stacy J. Smith
 
Yeah. And we 


that has caused me for that forecast though. First, Q3 tends to be a larger 
consumer quarter, where you see a little
 
bit of a mix impact associated with 
that, again, not changing our price point is just a mix of what we think sells 
through in the third quarter.
 

probably gaining some share at th
e low
-

to continue into the third quarter, but fairly muted impact. So all of this is in 
the context of what I articulated at the beginning of the year of a pretty 

auses me to 
change that view.

John Pitzer 

 
Credit Suisse
 
Good afternoon, guys. 
Congratulations. Stacy, you guys are kind of 
controlling OpEx relative to the slightly weaker than expected demand 

the financial crisis as moving some spare capacity forward. But you 

changed the overall CapEx number for the year. Is that because this is 
predominantly brick and mortar, and does that give you more flexibility on 

 
Stacy J. Smith
 

ending CapEx on this year is really kind of building that 
22
-

nanometer, and that capital is 
appropriate to invest really in any economic climate. So the change in the 

t to the 22

That said, as I said earlier, we are seeing some opportunities to take some 
older generation capacity offline and roll forward. My guess is, as we work

John Pitzer 

 
Credit Suisse
 
And then Paul, relative to the Win 8 launch, Microsoft did now come out and 
decided they wan
t to be a tablet company with the Surface products, and it 
sounds like their intent is not to use that as a Reference Design for other 
OEMs to follow, but actually try to make a real business out of that. What 
kind of impact do you think that might have on
 
the traditional PC business, if 
any?
 
Paul S. Otellini
 
Well, I think you again have to ask our customers that question. From our 


ome time since 

their plans deeply enough in terms of this, flagships skew or they tend to 

question has to go to t
hem and to our customers.

Your next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya, Bank of 
America/Merrill Lynch.
 
Vivek Arya 

 
Bank of America/Merrill Lynch
 
Thanks for taking my question. First, your 
PC client ASPs are staying within 

curious, is there some scope of benefit from becoming a little more 
aggressive on pricing to stimulate demand or is this a very price inelastic 
market? T

to be somewhat more aggressive because you do have cost leadership and 
flexibility?
 
Paul S. Otellini
 

start with
 
the core product line, the Core i3, 5 and 7s is still pretty good, and 

prices are going to be $699 and in the sweet spot. If there was that kind of 
elasticity, which we have not seen 
then I would expect some of the thin and 


that in the time of tight consumer budgets people buy quality and 
they tend 
to buy the high
-
end of the line or reasonably high
-
end of our product lines.
 



t come up yet is, the Win 7 to Win 8 transition. And as we have 
done in the past in terms of working with Microsoft, the units that are 
shipped now in the marketplace are Win 8 ready. And they have programs, 
incentive programs to be able to buy the upgrade
 
with the coupon at a 
discount.
 
Vivek Arya 

 
Bank of America/Merrill Lynch
 
All right. Thanks, Paul. And for my follow
-
up, I think you had mentioned 

wondering what role are tablets playing
 
in that and how soon can we look to 
Clover Trail based tablets to somehow help reserve back the trend? Thank 
you.
 
Paul S. Otellini
 
Yeah. Well, certainly over the last couple of years as tablet volumes have 
ramped up, they do present and have 
presented an alternative for consumer 
share of wallet, particularly at the time when consumer share of wallet is 

here, which is that that these are incremental machines for the most
 
part, 
people still have primary computers in the likes most people do, much like 
they did that we saw when the netbooks ramped up several years ago. As 
Intel based tablets are shipping both on Windows 8 and Android, we expect 
to be able to participate in 

numbers are going to be material this year. I think that just because of the 
start on, the timing of the start is going to be a slower ramp, and Stacy 
really addressed it earlier in his comment on phones an
d tablets.
 
Vivek Arya 

 
Bank of America/Merrill Lynch
 

aggressive after that Windows 8 tablet market and why Microsoft did not 
launch a Clover Trail based or did not announce a Clover 
Trail based tablet? 

 
Paul S. Otellini
 
I think you need to 

 
they talked about core
-
based machines more like an 
Ultrabook, those convertible kind of machine, which I think is actually a 
pretty good machine. And, so no co
mpromise device. So my term is when I 

 
Stacy J. Smith
 

 
Paul S. Otellini
 
Yeah, at launch.
 
Stacy J. Smith
 

t made in terms of their 
read to the market at a higher performance, more like an Ultrabook device is 
what they wanted to lead with.

Guys, thanks. I was just wondering when you look at the inventory side, 
obviously came up and you mentioned this Ivy Bridge. How much of it was

Stacy J. Smith
 
I think you 
mean units or costs right?
 
Vijay Rakesh 

 
Sterne, Agee & Leach
 
Yeah. How much of it was, if you could break it out, the pick up between unit 
versus pricing?
 
Paul S. Otellini
 
Yeah, I think last quarter I said that unit growth was relatively muted and 
that w
as really cost. This quarter where its units primarily I mean and cost is 
secondary. So about to get that level of granularity, but you should kind of 
visualize it as we are 

 
our inventories we are reducing units on older 
generation products and we are re
filling our inventory pipeline with Ivy 


 
Vijay Rakesh 

 
Sterne, Agee & Leach
 
Got it. And one last ques
tion is on the Ultrabook side and you mentioned you 
expect pricing to go to 699. What are the dollars you see there, because of 
SSD pricing, NAND pricing has gone starting to extrapolate that to red zone?
 
Paul S. Otellini
 
Well, NAND pricing is not been 
stable, coming to some of the reasons we 


about over 140 designs, some of them are aiming at a prem
ium segment 
and higher prices using SSDs. Some of them are using these ultra low
-
profile very high capacity drives, which are now becoming available, which 

nice way to hit lower
 
price points.

Windows 8 next year in terms of traditional, historical operating system 
cycles? Thanks.
 
Paul S. Otellini
 
I don't know how much of the 

 
was 

 
for the air pocket is Windows 8 
versu


chips in to our customers in advance of the operating system being loaded. 
But having said that, since the 
last Windows release, we've moved to more 
of a hub model with our chips, so that means people can draw these bit 

to use your phrase in Q3, but I think that gets filled up pretty qui
ckly in Q4, 


 
as I said earlier, a lot of people buy the Win 7 machines with the 
coupon and then upgrade?

Okay. And then, for next year?

James Covello 

 
Goldman Sachs
 
Thanks
 
so much for taking the question, I appreciate it. Somewhat related to 
John Pitzer's question, Stacy, you have presented some slides at the Analyst 
Meeting, that I think you said kind of hold on tax, what if our view on unit 
growth changes, and then you pr
esented a very helpful responsiveness case 
study. Is what you described to John relative to ramping down some older 
products and fabs and putting newer products in that and being at the low 
end of CapEx, is that the responsiveness case study or would that 
be 
another step altogether?
 
Stacy J. Smith
 
No. it all falls under that general category of responding to changes in the 
demand environment. We're kind of constantly looking at demand. Now we 
realized, we are 

 

 
wh


-
nanometer capacity offline, and roll it forward, then it offsets capital that we 
would have had to buy for 22
-
nanometer. The case study I shared was one 
where you see a dramati
c shift in demand levels that happens as a result of 
a financial crisis that takes everything down in a very faster rate of time. 

some incremental opportunities to start to react 
that way.
 
James Covello 

 
Goldman Sachs
 
And so I guess as my follow
-
up, I mean what do you think about factory 
loadings or utilization as you go through the third quarter as your outlook for 
the year changes and some of capacity from the previously spent C
apEx kind 
of ramps up, you think the factory loadings will remain at high level 
utilization stays at the same level or do you begin to bring that down some?
 
Stacy J. Smith
 
At 22

full. W

through the inventory replenishment to get the production stuff in the

Craig Ellis 

 
Caris & Company
 
Thanks for taking the question. Paul, 
just back on Ultrabook topic, as you 
look to end of the back half of the year, how do you see the Ultrabook mix 

a 40% of consumer notebooks by the end of this year. is that still
 
a 
reasonable number or how are you looking at that?
 
Paul S. Otellini
 

give us confidence there. One is, first half shipments on Ultrabooks were 
essentially right on our expectation 
set over six months ago. And the design 
pipeline for what we see in the second half, and the price points that we see, 
we think will get as there. In a softer selling season, I think these machines 
become even more attractive. And so, I'm fairly confident,
 

volume goals of this in terms of percent mix for the consumer notebooks.
 
Craig Ellis 

 
Caris & Company
 
(Inaudible) and then switching gears, Stacy you have mentioned in earlier 

think, I heard 
you do that, so I'd just not give you an opportunity to make any comment 
that you might have?
 
Stacy J. Smith
 
Yeah, I was assuming someone is going to ask me the question. Yeah, we 
saw NAND soften in Q2, we saw on our commentary and as Paul a
lluded too, 
I don't think its just as, I think you're seeing that from other company, it led 
to us being a little lower in revenue, I think that continues as part of the 
lowering of expectations into the back half, you know there is a chunk of 

 
NAND related.
 
I want to contrast it, it's really different compared to the last downturn we 
went to, which I think it was about four years ago, you can really see the 
impact of the strategy that we've been pursuing in that business. The fact 
that we now h
ave process technology leadership, and we've transitioned all 
of our shipments to higher margin segments of the NAND market, like SSDs 


ositive profit, and its still 
generating positive cash flow. As a fairly new CFO, the last big downturn hit 
NAND and it was quite different, because we didn't have that cost 
leadership. And we were shipping into the commodity segments of the 
business. So, 
I think it's a real testament to what they have accomplished in 
the business, but it's definitely soft.
 
Craig Ellis 

 
Caris & Company
 
And nice going with that business. And thanks very much for answering the 
questions guys.

4/20/11,Intel,"Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Q4 2010 Intel 
Corporation earnings conference call. My name is Marcello, and I'll be your 
coordinator for today. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any 
background noise. After the 
speakers' remarks, there will be a question
-
and
-
answer session. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay 
purposes.
 
I would now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today's call, 
Mr. Kevin Sellers, Vice President of Investo
r Relations. Please proceed, sir.
 
Kevin Sellers
 
Thank you, Marcello, and welcome everyone to Intel's fourth quarter 2010 
earnings conference call. By now you should have received a copy of our 
earnings release and the CFO commentary that goes along 
with that. If 
you've not received both documents, they are currently available on our 
Investor website intc.com.
 
I am joined today by Paul Otellini, our President and CEO; and Stacy Smith, 
our Chief Financial Officer. We will follow our normal practice by 
hearing 
brief prepared remarks from both Paul and Stacy after which we'll be happy 
to take questions.
 
By way of announcement, Intel will be hosting our annual investor day at 
our headquarters here in Santa Clara, California, on Tuesday, May 17, 2011. 
We lo
ok forward to seeing many of you here.
 
Before we begin, let me remind everyone that today's discussion contains 
forward
-
looking statements based on the environment as we currently see it 
and as such does include risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our
 
press 
release for more information on the specific risk factors that could cause 
actual results to differ materially.
 
Also if during this call we use any non
-
GAAP financial measures or 
references, we will post the appropriate GAAP financial reconciliation
s to our 
website intc.com.
 
So with that, let me now hand it over to Paul.
 
Paul Otellini
 
Thanks, Kevin. Our fourth quarter results represent the third consecutive 
record quarter for the Company and bring to a strong close the best year in 
Intel's history.
 
R
evenue was up 24% for the year, and we crossed over the $40 billion mark 
for the first time ever. We exceeded previous records for gross margin, 
operating income, and earnings per share as well. The PC market grew 
approximately 17% worldwide in 2010. Not o
nly is the market expanding, 
but our customers and end users are embracing our performance leadership 
and purchasing a richer mix of our products, which led to a rise in our ASP in 
2010.
 
One of the notable standout performers in the fourth quarter was our 
Data 
Center Group. The world of PC, plus new emerging computing devices is 
increasing the demand for servers of all types. Our Data Center Group had 
yet another terrific quarter, with revenue up 15% sequentially and annual 
revenue up, a very strong 35%. So
, what is driving this growth in servers 
and will it continue?
 
Let me share with you some data that can help put the server market in 
perspective. In 2010, total traffic crossing the internet was roughly 245 
exabytes. This is greater than all the previous 
years combined. Over the 
next five years a billion more people will join the global online community, 
with 15 billion new connected devices including PCs, smartphones, tablets, 
embedded devices and smart TVs.
 
We estimate this will increase the data footpri
nt across the Internet to over 
1,000 exabytes, more people, more devices, more usages. This dynamic will 
require high
-
performing servers from Intel for years to come. It is not just 
servers.
 
Intel continues to grow its presence in the Data Center with proc
essors for 
storage systems and networking infrastructure, with plans to refresh the 
entire Xeon server product line in the first half of 2011. Intel is very well 
positioned to benefit from the growth of the Data Center and the build out of 
cloud computing.
 
Next, I want to comment on our Atom business. The industry shipped 
around 37 million netbook units for the year, which represents a 20% 
growth rate. In 2011, Intel plans to bring some unique innovations to 
netbooks to keep the category growing, including 
increased feature sets in 
products for mature markets, and lower price points in emerging markets 
that will attract first
-
time buyers. But Atom is much more than netbooks.
 
We exit 2010, with excellent momentum in our embedded business, with 
over 4,900 tota
l design engagements and over 1,700 design wins for 
Embedded Atom devices. It's notable that nearly one half of all the Atom 
embedded design win activity is coming from China. I mentioned this 
momentum to highlight that the main drivers of our success with
 
Atom in 
the embedded business segment are very applicable to the smartphone, 
tablet and consumer electronic market segments.
 
Software comparability, performance, power and architectural consistency 
really matter to our customers, and the success we're hav
ing with Atom in 
the embedded segments is an excellent proof point of our value proposition. 
Many of the wins in this space are architectural conversions against ARM and 
MIPS. In 2011, you will also see Atom in a wider ray of tablets running three 
differen
t operating systems, Windows, Android, and MeeGo.
 
Seven of these tablets have been announced by their manufacturers with 
many more in the pipeline for rollout this year. In 2011, you will also see 
Atom processors appear in smartphones, operating at very co
mpetitive 
power levels with performance that will lead the industry, demonstrating 

 

better. The economy is forecasted to improve, 
our product line refreshes 
from top to bottom and our addressable market expands. With the PC 
industry now shipping over 1 million units a day, we entered 2011 by 
launching the best microprocessor we have every built.
 
As you are all aware, we introduced ou
r Sandy Bridge processor family at 
CES last week. We think this ultimately will be as transformational to PCs as 
Nehalem been to servers. With over 500 design wins, our customers are 
embracing this product. When you get your hands on a Sandy Bridge PC, 
you
 

visually stunning computing experience.
 
The combination of an improving economy and the best product line
-
up in 
our history, gives us confidence that we can grow our revenues by 
a
pproximately 20% in 2011, and this forecast is before any contributions 
from the proposed acquisitions of the Infineon's Wireless Solutions division 
and McAfee.
 
As we approach our 22
-
nanometer transition, we are increasing our 
investments in manufacturing 
to capture what we believe is a significant 
opportunity for growth. Stacy will walk you through more details in just in a 
moment, but in short the market opportunities for our 22
-
nanometer 
products are outstanding. As a result, we are growing from the mode
l of 
three high volume leading
-
edge manufacturing fabs to four
 
Our 22
-
nanometer process will be the foundation for growing PC and server 
segments, as well as a broad family of Atom
-
based SoCs, serving 
smartphones, tablets, smart TVs, and other embedded dev
ices.
 
Many of you have asked us questions about how we will compete with ARM 
in the new segments of mobile computing. Our answer is very simple. As we 
have done for decades in the traditional computing markets, we will apply 
the world's most advanced silic
on transistor technology to these new 
segments to deliver the lowest power, highest performance, lowest cost 
products on the planet.
 
When these chips are combined with our support for the world's leading 
mobile operating systems, our proven ability to crea
te broad ecosystem 
support and our growing software capabilities, I'm confident we will be very 
successful in these segments. These investments are the strongest possible 
statement of our confidence in our business model and our growth 
opportunities, and w
ill extend our technology advantage even further.
 
With that, let me turn it over to Stacy.
 
Stacy Smith
 
Thanks, Paul. I just want to clarify one thing real quick. We're all getting 
used to saying 2011 over 2010. Paul meant 10% revenue growth in 2011 
over 2010 is the expectation that we're setting. So, 2010 was the most 
profitable year in our history, as the trends we discussed at the May Investor 
Meeting played out.
 
The emerging markets, notebooks, and server demand, all exceeded 20% 
growth year
-
on
-
ye
ar. The consumer market, despite a mid
-
summer pause, 
driven by the European debt crisis, still grew at a mid
-
teens growth rate. All 
of these demand drivers led to an $8.5 billion increase in revenue to $43.6 
billion, up 24% year
-
on
-
year and our best year e
ver.
 
Our manufacturing process technology lead extended in 2010, enabling a 
next generation of leadership products, which drove higher average selling 
prices year
-
on
-
year. Our continued focus on factory reuse and efficiency 
drove cost down again in 2010 li
fting gross margin to a record 66%. A 
noteworthy achievement is that as a result of the combination of our 
responsiveness of the downturn and our focus on factory productivity, we're 
able to offset almost half of the required capital investment at 32
-
nanom
eter 
through reuse of equipment.
 
Spending as a percent of revenue dropped year
-
on
-
year to 29.5%. We also 
saw significant improvements in our NAND business. All of these things 
contributed to making 2010 our most profitable year ever. While revenue, 
gross m
argin, operating profit, net income and earnings per share were all 
records, two metrics worth highlighting are that we achieved operating 
income of $15.9 billion, 32% higher than the next highest year and our best 
ever revenue per employee of 529,000.
 
The
 
fourth quarter was in line with our expectations and was a good finish to 
an outstanding year. We achieved record quarterly revenue of $11.5 billion 
despite continued softness in the consumer market segment.
 
Demand was strong in the enterprise market, spe
cifically for servers. The 
quarterly gross margin at 67.5% benefited from both lower inventory write
-
offs as we qualified the Sandy Bridge product line for sale, and slightly 
higher average selling prices due a richer mix of server products.
 
Operating inco
me was $4.3 billion, 38% of revenue. Net income of $3.4 
billion and earnings per share of $0.59 were both records. The strength of 
our business can be seen in the balance sheet. Total cash investments ended 
the year at $21.5 billion, $1.2 billion higher th
an the third quarter and $7.6 
billion higher than the end of 2009.
 
For the year, we generated approximately $16.7 billion in cash from 
operations. We purchased $5.2 billion in capital assets, paid $3.5 billion in 
dividends, and repurchased $1.5 billion in 
stock. We returned over $5 billion 
of cash to shareholders in 2010.
 
For the year, we increased the dividend by 12.5% and resumed stock 
repurchases in the fourth quarter. We also announced an incremental 15% 
increase in the dividend that will go into effect
 
in 2011.
 
Turning to 2011, we are planning on continued growth in our core 
businesses resulting in approximately 10% revenue growth. We are 
forecasting continued strong gross margins with the mid
-
point of our annual 
range at 65%.
 
In support of expected str
ong unit growth in our core businesses and the 
movement of graphics transistors to our leading edge process technology, 
we're forecasting an increase in capital spending to $9 billion as we build and 
equip an incremental high volume manufacturing factory a
t 22
-
nanometer.
 
We are also forecasting an increase of over $700 million in research and 
development investments as we look to extend our leadership in PCs and 
servers and design further generations of products to increase our offerings 
in adjacent market 
segments like smartphones and tablets.
 
2010 reinforced our view that the demand drivers that we talked about in 
May, emerging markets, notebooks, consumers and servers translate into 
significant revenue growth for Intel and that the work that we have done 
on 
our cost structure translates into exceptional financial results.
 
As we move into 2011, we are planning for an even better year. As we start 
the year, the product line in our Core business is outstanding as Sandy 
Bridge ramps into the marketplace. Our c
ost will come down even more in 
2011. Our manufacturing advantage will continue to extend, which coupled 
with our roadmap of low
-
power products will expand our participation in fast 
growing segments of the market for devices that compute and connect to 
the
 
internet.
 
With that, let me turn it back over to Kevin.

(Operator instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Alex Gauna 
with JMP Securities.
 
Alex Gauna 

 
JMP Securities
 
I wanted to start by asking how you feel the OEM partnerships that y
ou have 
are distinguishing between the roadmaps on the Sandy Bridge architecture 
from what you've got on Oak Trail and Atoms? I say that because I've 
noticed at CES you do have your first tablet win for Sandy Bridge on the 
Core i5 and I know you're moving 
ahead pretty aggressively on your process 
geometries.
 
Paul Otellini
 
At this point the only people I'm aware of using Sandy Bridge or Core 
processors in tablets are those focusing on Win 7 tablets. The design 
momentum that I've seen in Android and in MeeGo 
is focused more on kind 
of an iPad apps
-
centric model, applet
-
centric model. Those that are doing 
real Windows and one that have the Windows compatibility and the full 
Windows stack, there's a few of those like the one you mentioned and then 
also the Acer 
one with the two screens, which is sort of a tablet
-
laptop 
combo that are running Core
-
based products.
 
Alex Gauna 

 
JMP Securities
 
A follow
-
up if I could. How are the Android developer partners you have 
differentiating between what they can do with the Ato
m or Oak Trail 
roadmap versus with the ARM
-
based systems?
 
Paul Otellini
 
Well, at the OS level there shouldn't be any difference. We should both run 
the same operating system, the same interfaces, the same access to the 
marketplace applications and so 
forth. Our value proposition is really twofold 
for the OEMs. One, we believe that we will offer higher performance in 
comparable battery life configurations, and number two, by designing an 
Atom
-
based tablet they have the opportunity to run multiple OS's o
n it, 
which is I think a unique value proposition with Intel at this point.
 
Operator
 
Your next question comes from the line of Craig Ellis with Caris & Company.
 
Craig Ellis 

 
Caris & Company
 
On the 10% growth for this year, can you provide us with some of 
the gives 
and takes you should think about parts of the portfolio that could do 
potentially better than that, and then what would be below the 10% line?
 
Stacy Smith
 
Yeah. I probably won't get to that level of specificity. I'll go back to what we 
said at th
e Investor Meeting in May. The drivers of our business right now 
are emerging markets. It's the consumer segment of the market. Then we're 
seeing a build out of that cloud infrastructure, which is driving our server 
results. I'll really highlight the emerg
ing market piece of this because if I 
just look at the business it's 2 to 1 in terms of unit growth coming from 
emerging markets versus mature as we think out over the next several 
years. The dynamic that's going on there, it's a simple one of economics 
fr
om my perspective. The price of technology has come down to the point 
that billions more people can afford that technology and that's highly 
desirable and if I may, I'll use China as the example. If you go back to the 
mid
-
90s, it was on average of 175 week
s of income for somebody to be able 
to afford a notebook computer. If you fast forward to 2010, it's now seven 
weeks of income in China on average for somebody to afford the computer, 
see a 1.4 billion people that where the price of computing is coming int
o a 
range that is affordable and it's a big deal to them, because it's how they 
move into the knowledge
-
based economy. So, that I think is the big driver of 
our business, and has been last few years. It's likely to be over the next 
several years.
 
Paul Otel
lini
 
If I could just tag onto that Stacy, Greg for planning purposes inside of our 
number set that we've, the 10% that we forecasted, we're assuming a low 
to mid
-
teens PC market growth rate in units.
 
Craig Ellis 

 
Caris & Company
 
Paul this at low to mid
-
te
ens growth rate include tablets or exclude tablets?
 
Paul Otellini
 
Exclude.
 
Craig Ellis 

 
Caris & Company
 
As a follow
-
up, as we think about the design wins that the Company has in 
tablets and we can certainly count numbers that are in the 10s to 20s, as we 
look at our own research. When do we hit the sweet spot of the ramp for 
Intel in 2011 for the tablet products that it'll be shipping into?
 
Paul Otellini
 
I think its operating system dependant. Unlike bringing up Sandy Bridge, 
we've got an installed base of
 
PC software, right. It's just ready and able to 
take advantage of it. These things have to be tuned to their unique 
environments. So, from a launch perspective, the ones that have been and 
I'm not going to give you launch dates, but the ones that have bee
n 
announced so far, are on Windows 7 and on Android and then in the second 
half of the year, you will see MeeGo. So, it really is a building momentum 
over the course of the year on all three operating systems.
 
Operator
 
Your next question comes from the lin
e of Shawn Webster with Macquarie.
 
Shawn Webster 

 
Macquarie
 
Paul, can you share with us your thoughts, I guess longer term on capital 
intensity. The capital expenditure new guidance you gave as $9 billion at 
roughly 55% of your expected cost of goods sold
 
or so is pretty high. Do you 
expect this to be a peak over this cycle or longer terms, because of the 
graphics and some of the other things you mentioned, do you expect it to be 
at a higher level than what we're used to seeing?
 
Stacy Smith
 
Let me first ta
lk about what's driving the increase in capital and then, I'll end 
with a few words on capital intensity, if you'll allow that, Shawn. The primary 
driver of what's taking us from a three factory model, three high volume 
manufacturing models to four high vo
lume manufacturing model is the unit 
growth that we've experienced over the last couple of years and that we 
expect going forward. I think you can really see how our business is growing 
when you look out what's happened over the last couple of years. In 20
10 
and with our focus for 2011, we're growing our revenues by $13 billion, 
that's more than a one
-
third growth versus where we were in 2008, where 
we were in 2009. So, you can see that businesses growth is a primary driver 
of what's taking us into a four f
actory model. Behind that what you are 
seeing as that we're being very aggressive of moving transistors to that 
leading
-
edge process technology and we do that, because we get paid for 
that process technology leadership. We get paid in terms of having lower
 
costs. What was really striking in 2010, as we started the transition of 
graphics processors to that leading edge, we got paid in terms of the rising 
ASP because of the performance of the products. So, there is very high ROI 
for us that we are uniquely si
tuated to take advantage of because of our 
process technology leadership. Those two things in conjunction take us from 
three to a four factory network.
 
Shawn Webster 

 
Macquarie
 
My follow
-

week in
 

your view on it and what are your responses?
 
Paul Otellini
 
I view it as being not a lot of new news and I can see positives and 
negatives for Intel in this announcement. Historically, Microsof
t has only 
supported ARM in their phone OS and in their consumer electronics OS. So 
they have had ARM support for some time. In fact, in big Windows it had 
support for Alpha, PowerPC, MIPS and at one point ARM on the Vista 
program that they dropped. So thi
s is nothing really new from that 
perspective. The plus for Intel is that, as they unify their operating systems, 
we now have the ability for the first time, one to have design from scratch, 
touch enabled operating system for tablets that runs on Intel tha

have today. Secondly, we have the ability to put our lowest power Intel 
processors running Windows 8 or next generation Windows into phones, 
because of the same OS stack and I look at that as an upside opportunity for 
us. On the downside there i
s a potential given that Office runs on this 
products for 

 

skeptical of that for two reasons. One, that space has a different set of 
power performance requirements where Intel is exceptionally g
ood. 
Secondly, users of those machines expect legacy support in terms of 
software and peripherals that has to all be enabled from scratch for those 
devices.
 
Stacy Smith
 
I just want to go back. You let me off the hook a little bit too early there in 
terms of the increase in capital, when you look at 32 versus 22. So, I also 
want to put that in perspective. It was in my written remarks, but I want to 
make sure it's clear. One of the benefits that we had at 32
-
nanometer was 
that as the downturn hit us, 
we were able to very quickly take capacity that 
we had put in place for 45 nanometers, factories that we had put in place for 
45
-
nanometer and upgrade those to offset some of the required investment 
at 32. I think that was a level of responsiveness that yo
u haven't seen out of 
Intel in the past. We take advantage of the fact that we build in that 
backwards compatibility in our capital model of record, and we were actually 
able to offset half of the capital required at 32 by utilizing investment that 
we had 
already made in factories for 45
-
nanometer. What that means is, at 
32 we got in essence three factories for the capital cost of two, and then it's 
the unit demand and the movement of transistors to a leading
-
edge process 
technology that then takes us from 
three to four. That helps you put in 
perspective the size of that job as you go from the 32
-
nanometer node to 
the 22
-
nanometer node.

Your next question comes from the line of Mark Lipacis with Morgan Stanley.
 
Mark Lipacis 

 
Morgan Stanley
 
When do 
you expect to start shipping the 22
-
nanometer products into 
production systems? Paul, you may have mentioned this, I think I may have 
missed it, can you help us understand to what extent do you think about 
using the incremental 22
-
nanometer capacity for PC
 
microprocessors versus 
tablets or cell phone microprocessors?
 
Paul Otellini
 
Well, we haven't given out the product schedules for 22
-
nanometer. So let 
me give you a status at least in much detail as I'm willing to get to make 
public. We have finished devel
opment of the process. We are in yield 
learning deployment right now, running test ships in there, ramping the 
yields up on the technology. We have completed the design of our first 
microprocessor and have working microprocessors on that technology. At 
thi
s point in time our plan is to ramp production wafers of that technology in 
the second half of this year with products launched at some point to follow.

n
anometer?
 
Paul Otellini
 
Yeah. We're building some on 32 now and then the initial products on 22 will 
be the mainstream microprocessors, because we want to use every early 
wafer we can for those products, but we will move as rapidly to 22 as 
possible for th
e non

PC part of the product line.

If I could just follow
-
up, the CapEx, how should we think about that getting 
cut between the faster depreciation schedule for equipment versus slower 
depreciation schedule for buildings?
 
Stac
y Smith
 
The lion's share is going to be equipment. That investment bucket, the lion's 
shares equipment, you'll see a little more factory spending than what you've 
seen in the past, but it's the equipment to fill the factory that ends up being 
expensive, an
d you can see that in the depreciation forecasted goes up from 
$4.2 billion in 2010 to $5 billion in 2011.
 
Operator
 
Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Cassidy with Stifel Nicolaus.
 
Kevin Cassidy 

 
Stifel Nicolaus
 
Maybe just to ask a little mor
e about the 22
-
nanometer conversion with the 
SoCs, are you comfortable, you have the design wins now to fill that fab?
 
Stacy Smith
 
The 2011 capital spending of $9 billion is the dollars are really being driven 
by the server and PC business. That's what's d
riving the increase in the unit 
CAGR. Those are big die. Remember the products that we have in 
smartphones, the products that we have in tablets by design are very small 
die. It doesn't drive a big capital spend for us. Don't take from that though 
that it'
s not important to get those products to 22
-
nanometer that process 
leadership is what lets us bring down the cost, bring down the power and 
provide more performance at any given level of power. So, it's strategically 
really important, but it's not the driv
er of the $9 billion of capital in 2011.
 
Kevin Cassidy 

 
Stifel Nicolaus
 
If I could just follow up with, you're saying mid
-
teens in unit growth, it's 
assuming ASPs will come down, they were up last year, why do you think 
ASPs will down in 2011?
 
Stacy Smith
 

growth for 2011 and 10% revenue growth, you still get to the same 
question, which is, that would suggest ASPs come down a little in 2011 to 
kind of make that revenue number 

place where I have been wrong over the course of 2010. I did not anticipate 
ASPs going up to the extent that they had, the Company has surprised me 
positively the ability to extend the technology leadership over
 
the 
competition and get paid for that leadership. That said, my thesis on the 
market is that the areas where we see robust growth. So remember what I 
said, emerging markets 2 to 1 over mature; the consumer market 2 to 1 
over the business market. Those are
as benefit from the standpoint that 
system price points come down over time, and we get a little bit of a mix 
down. So I believe that we're going to see, just based on that mix effect 
pricing coming down over time. I'll also say it's one of those places wh
ere I'd 
love to be wrong. The Company is working hard to try to prove me wrong, 
but inherent my forecast is that pricing comes down some based on growth 
in consumer and growth in emerging markets in 2011, and I think that trend 
is the one I'm betting on fo
r the next several years.

My first one, I just want to think a little bit about the enterprise refresh 
cycle. You guys had a pretty g
ood year last year. Client was clearly a bit 
softer. Just curious how far you think we're into the current upgrade cycle 
for enterprise? Also where do you think you'd actually see strength in the 
client or consumer side over the course of 2011?
 
Paul Otelli
ni
 
It's hard to put a number on it. My sense is given that the corporate refresh 
started not on the first day of last year is that we're not halfway yet. There 
is a whole bunch of people that have not upgraded to Windows 7 and that 
intend to. I do think th
at Sandy Bridge there may be some momentum built 
up ahead of that in terms of people wanting those products. Remember the 

or August
-
September timeframe. So you really have the t
ailing edge of the 
IT shops, the ones that wait for SP1 still to go and so implicit in our numbers 
when I gave low
-
to
-
mid teens is a pretty robust corporate refresh cycle 
continuing in 2011. In terms of client parts of the business next year or this 
year r
ather, I think Stacy nailed it. We look for consumers and particularly in 
emerging markets continuing to be the driver of that part of the business in 
notebooks rather.
 
Stacy Smith
 
If I make one other point on the server market, which I was struck by when 
I was looking at our 2010 results and Paul touched about in his speech, I 

infrastructure and while that still is a relatively small percentage of the total 
of our server business, it

that it generated one
-
third of the unit growth in servers from 2009 to 2010. 

moves to the cloud, all these devices compute and co
nnect. I think that 
continues to driver server results for a number of years.
 
Patrick Wang

I also want to talk a little bit about chipset. In the fourth quarter chipset for 
your client business was down 4% sequentially. Can you 
talk about what you 
saw there and given that there should be an impact from the ramp to Sandy 
Bridge and upgrading chipset to the 67, 66 series, how you feel about that 
tracking here in the first quarter?
 
Stacy Smith
 
I think it was as simple as what we sai
d at the beginning. The quarter 
actually unfolded very much like we expected which is nice when that 
happens. We saw people bleeding off some of the older generation 
technology from an inventory standpoint, which impacted our sales that's 
why we're below s
easonal, that's why chipsets were below seasonal. I think 
one of the things you have to think through as the world moves to notebook, 
the chipset is a leading indicator that thesis no longer exists. You don't have 
nearly a larger marketing where people are
 
populating a motherboard with 
the chipset and everything else, and waiting for a CPU. It's all happening in 
Taiwan and its being integrated commensurate with each other, and so it's 
not the leading indicator that we believed in the 90s.

Your next
 
question comes from the line of John Pitzer with Credit Suisse.
 
John Pitzer 

 
Credit Suisse
 
Paul, when you look at the Data Center Group and the sequential growth in 
the fourth quarter, I'm wondering you can help me understand how much of 
that was unit ve
rsus ASP and as you look at the balance of 2011, is there a 
lot that mix can do to help average selling price, as you look at that market 
unfold this year?
 
Paul Otellini
 
I'm not giving a lot of granularity there, John. I can tell you that over the 
course o
f the year, one of the reasons that we did increasingly well in Data 
Center was the shift to MP, as the MP products we're shipping and that 
includes those Internet Data Center deployment that Stacy was just talking 
about. Most of the big portals used four
-
way machines running, 6
-
cores now 
going to 8
-
cores this year, so there is about the most power compute
-
intensive consumers we have on the planet. So, going into 2010, I think 
that's still a driver, I think that the Nehalem value proposition is still very 
c
ritical for, let me say, classic Data Centers, Enterprise Data Centers we still 
haven't finished anywhere near swapping out all the old systems. The same 
kind of ROI that we saw work in 2010 will apply in 2011 for those 
companies.
 
Stacy Smith
 
It was one of
 
those great years, we saw a strong unit growth and strong ASP 
increases based on our technology in the Data Center Group and that drove 
the strong year

on

year results.

As my follow on, when you look at Sandy Bridge and its imp
act on the 
discrete graphics market. What's your view as this year unfolds and I guess, 
if Sandy Bridge starts to allow OEMs to take discrete graphics cards out of 
systems, and yet still, provide to capture some of the ASP benefit of the 
graphics capabilit
y from Sandy Bridge, how much ASP leverage do you think 
you can get out of that product cycle?
 
Paul Otellini
 
I think it's healthy, but the biggest leverage, I mean, given that I'm quite 
confident that Sandy Bridge is going to be a home run, in fact, at CES
, I said 
that, in 2011, Sandy Bridge alone will represent over 30% of Intel's 
corporate revenues. So, we're very, very confident of the product and its 
acceptance. The biggest thing for us is sell
-
up inside the Sandy Bridge 
family, because as we 

 
we will 
populate Sandy Bridge across multiple price 
points over the course of the year, but we'll maintain some of the premium 
feature sets, like the Intel Insider for high
-
value content that we announced 
at CES. We'll maintain those at the Core i5 and i7 brands. 
So, we'll do sell
-
up in those over the course of the year. That will be the focus versus, can 
the OEMs shave a bit off the building materials. They will certainly do that, 
but as everybody does that, that just brings the pricing to equilibrium.

ur next question comes from the line of Doug Freedman with Gleacher & 
Company.
 
Doug Freedman

If I could start with just how are we to think about the impact of the extra 
week, and if we're to assume sort of a full 7% revenue 
impact, I get 
somewhere between $700 million and $900 million impact to Q1. Should we 
think about that, and then how do we think about that going forward to Q2, 
both on the revenue and OpEx lines?
 
Stacy Smith
 
So, the beauty, as we know what the extra week 
was, because what we're 
doing as we're resetting the calendar such that our year end is more towards 
New Year versus Christmas, and we know what the billings were between 
Christmas and New Year. As you can imagine, it's not an average week, it's 
a low week
. So, when you take into account, the actual billings we saw that 
we 

 
what you'd say about Q1 is because of the ramp in billing of Sandy 
Bridge, it's a bit about seasonal. More granular on that I'm not going to get, 
I'm not going to provide a forecast yet
 
for Q2. We want to get through Q1 
and then we'll have that conversation.
 
Doug Freedman 

 
Gleacher & Company
 
How about on the OpEx side, would we think that you capture an extra week 
of OpEx that the OpEx goes away in Q2?
 
Stacy Smith
 
OpEx is much more pred
ictable like that, because you do 

 
people actually 
want to be paid, even though we're adding an extra week. So, we know that 
we have more OpEx in Q1 and we have a week less in Q2, and our spending 
pretty much will reflect that.

If I could for my follow

up, move on to a different topic. Acquisitions, there 
has been some issues, trying to get some of them closed by the end of the

the commentary that 
no big further acquisitions were planned. I wanted to 
see if I could get you to repeat that statement and give us an update on 
where you stand?
 
Stacy Smith
 
So, first the status of acquisition in Infineon, we expect that it's closing in 
the next several wee
ks, all the regulatory approvals that have been received 
on that. On McAfee is going to be dependent on whether we get a request 

Q1, if we do it's likely to move in the Q2. I was r
eally clear on the call last

Your next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon with Sanford C. 
Bernstein.
 
Stacy Rasgon 

 
Sanford Bernstein
 
Just a brief one on the 2011 gross margin guidance. I was wondering if you 
can give us a little bit of feeling on where you might see th
e most volatility 
in terms of those drivers. What are the things you think are pushing towards 
the higher end of that, versus the lower end of that? What will be the bigger 
drivers for that for 2011?
 
Stacy Smith
 
Let me just start by doing 2010 to 2011 reco
nciliation in currency, and 
currently how I am thinking of gross margin. In 2010 it was 66%. We are 
forecasting 65% for 2011. As is pretty predictable, because we are on a two
-
year cadence of process technology, 2011 is year where we are going to see 
eleva
ted start
-
up cost. So that takes me down about 3 points of gross 
margin. As my unit costs come down and my CPUs and chipsets, and my 
platform business, that gets back about a point of gross margin. Then I am 
expecting higher revenue in my platform business


volatility, the start
-
up costs are pretty predictable. The thing that got me in 
2010 was ASP and based on where we're seeing growth, in which segments, 
that co
uld be off on ASP based on the competitive dynamics, that could be 
off on ASP. So that tends to be the thing that is most volatile. Then behind 
that is business levels. If business is robust and we're running factories, it's 
beneficial to gross margin. If 
we have an economic shock that causes 
demand to fall, we'll see a decline in gross margin. So those two things are 
likely I think to cause some volatility to gross margin as we go forward.
 
Stacy Rasgon

For my follow up, you've got Atom 
revenues that are it looks like pretty 
much flat for the quarter. So it doesn't look like netbook sales necessarily 
are falling off the cliff like people might be afraid of. But I was wondering if 
you could give us some feeling for how much of those Atom r
evenues might 
be netbook versus non
-
netbook related. Is the non
-
netbook portion material 
enough where you feel comfortable giving us at least just a ballpark 
estimate of how much it might be?
 
Stacy Smith
 
It's relatively small. The underlying growth rates o
f things like Atom that's 
moving into embedded applications is very high. We've talked about the 
progress that we've made in the back half of this year of winning the 
category of smart TV, and so if you look at first half versus second half, you 
see a high
 
category in that unit growth rate, but it's still a relatively 

 
Paul Otellini
 

may remember, a year ago, we had a problem in the fourth quarter of '09, 
where people bought ahead o
n chips from Intel, netbook chips from Intel 
and sales slowed down in the first quarter. So there was an anomaly. So 
what I've talked about in my commentary was the consumption of netbooks 
that we believe was 20% year
-
over
-
year, and actually it was probabl
y up a 
bit in the fourth quarter as it is the seasonally strongest quarter for netbooks 
and even devices like tablets as some people buy them as Christmas 
presents. So looking into next year, what we forecast and project is yet 
another year of growth in ne
tbooks.

Your next question comes from the line of Daniel Berenbaum with Auriga.
 
Daniel Berenbaum 

 
Auriga
 
On operating profit, I mean just looking at the model or the guidance you've 
given for gross margin for R&D, it looks like operating margin w
ould likely go 
down next year. When we think about 

 
do you think about 2011 as more of 
an investment year or how should we think about what operating margin 
performance might look like over the course of the next couple of years? Or 
how we should think ab
out a longer term model there?
 
Stacy Smith
 
First, I think your math is correct, right, gross comes down a point, we offset 
some of that 

 
actually if we get a little better in terms of spending as a 
percent of revenue, but it doesn't offset that full 
point. That said, the 
operating margin is historically at high levels. I mean, we're running a gross 
margin that's in the mid
-
60s and our spending as a percent of revenue, as 
we've communicated our strategy of driving efficiency continues to improve. 
We ar
e making significant investments in 2011 and they are investments 
that are really important to us. If you look onto the covers of the increase in 
spending from 2010 to 2011, it's predominantly R&D, that R&D is split 
between investments in our core business
, investments in some of the 
important adjacencies like tablets and phones. We're investing more in 
process technology. We're investing more in software capabilities to bring all 
these devices together. So certainly Paul and I are looking at 2011 as a 
year
, where we're making some big important investments that we think 
generate great returns for us in the future.
 
Daniel Berenbaum 

 
Auriga
 
So are those multiyear investments or is it sort of a big rebuilding year or 
investment year or is it a multiyear inves
tment?
 
Stacy Smith
 
I think you can look backwards and say we started making significant 
investments last year. Our investment profile increased a lot in '10. It's 
increasing more in '11. We'll make the decisions for '12 when we get there.
 
Daniel Berenbaum 

 
Auriga
 
To follow
-

 
Stacy Smith
 
Yeah, but I do want to just say one thing. You might have taken from what I 
just said that we're backing off from the commitment to continue to drive 
spending as a perce
nt of revenue. We're not backing away from that 
commitment, so we're taking advantage of a robust market in '10, a robust 
market in '11 to make some important investments, but we as a Company 
continue to have efficiency and productivity as one of the thing
s that's got to 
be embedded in everything we do because it's critical to win in some of 
these new segments. So I just want to make sure that was clear from my 
prior statement.
 
Daniel Berenbaum 

 
Auriga
 
On the capital side of your investment, you talked abo
ut the rationale for 
adding a fab is really being unit driven for your core business, but is there 
any foundry CapEx in there? You've actually talked about starting to do little 
bit of foundry work for some small customers. Was any of this specifically 
tar
geted at expanding your foundry business?
 
Stacy Smith
 
No, don't take from that again that we're not focused on that business, but it 
is nowhere nearing being a driver of CapEx for us in 2011. We're at a scale 
of $9 billion. It's not a driver.

I guess my follow
-
up question is kind of circling back on the chipset question 
that somebody else asked. The chipsets as a percent of the CPU revenue or 
the Data Center Group has declined over
 
the last eight quarters. It used to 
run about 20% of the total revenue and now they're running into mid
-
teens. 
Can you explain what that is, and is it going to bottom around here on the 
mid
-
teens?
 
Stacy Smith
 
I think off the top, it's the shift from DP to
 
MP. More of the mix goes to MP, 
so you have more processors for chipsets.

Securities.
 
Romit Shah 

 
Nomura Securities
 
If your assumption is for ASPs to be down this year, why is that
 
not factored 
into your gross margin reconciliation?
 
Paul Otellini
 
It's an interesting phenomenon in that we had ASPs up in '10 and so it gets 
a little 

 
it's kind of counterintuitive because we don't see that a lot. So, if 
you think about the world 
from the standpoint of year
-
on
-
year change, it 
looks like the average for 2009 is about what the average is for 2010 and it 
doesn't pop out in the 

 
I'm sorry, the average for '11 is about what the 
average was in 2010, and so you don't see it in the year
-
o
n
-
year recon. 
What you have to keep in mind is, over the course of 2010 our pricing went 
up, and so I ended at a higher level than my average, and from that I come 
down some over the course of 2011. Again, that's a place where we're 
fighting hard to make t
hat not be true, but that is my expectation inside of 
the gross margin forecast.

Just on the server business, several quarters a very good growth including 
Q4 and Paul, you highlighted some of the strong secular tailwinds. Ho
w does 
this segment influence your Q1 outlook and is there any seasonality in 
servers now?
 
Paul Otellini
 
I haven't dug into that for a while. I don't think so. We're seeing just pretty 
consistent growth. It tends to go in cycle, the cycle start up with Neh
alem 

 
seven quarters ago, I don't see it abating. It is historically, if I go back 
before the Internet Data Center bubbles, strong growth, the fourth quarter 
was always the strongest quarter for servers because, capital budgets 
expired, people brought ser
vers before the year changed. I haven't seen 
that as being the driving trend for several years now.
 
Stacy Smith
 
I also agree. I don't think there is strong seasonal pattern to severs, but I 
will say, in Q1 in the guidance, the thing that causes us to be a 
little better 
than seasonal, once you adjust for that fourteenth week is the ramp in sales 
of Sandy Bridge. That's the driver in Q1 and that's not yet in the server 
market. So, you should assume from that, that it's the ramp in Sandy Bridge 
which is notebo
oks.
 
Romit Shah 

 
Nomura Securities
 
So the fact that servers have been strong for so many quarters that trend 
doesn't concern you that a slowdown is eminent?
 
Stacy Smith
 
We do not see a cycle here where people finish the refresh and then we have 
a dip. 
The underlying traffic growth over the Internet and the shift to cloud 
data and services is its own trend and that alone will drive nice continued 
growth in the business.

1/14/11,Intel,"Good day, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the Quarter 1 2012 Intel 
Corporation Earnings Conference Call. My name is Misty, and I will be your 
coordinator for today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference 
is being recorded for replay 
purposes. I would now like to turn the 
presentation over to your host for today's call, Mr. Mark Henninger, Director 
of Investor Relations. Please proceed, sir.
 
Mark Henninger
 
Thank you, Misty, and welcome, everyone, to Intel's First Quarter 2012 
Earnings Conference Call. By now, you should have received a copy of our 
earnings release and the CFO commentary that goes along with that. If 
you've not received both documents, they're currently available on our 
investor website, intc.com. I'm joined tod
ay by Paul Otellini, our President 
and CEO; and Stacy Smith, our Chief Financial Officer. In a moment, we'll 
hear brief remarks from both of them, followed by Q&A. A brief reminder 
that we'll be hosting our Annual Investor Day at our headquarters in Santa 
Clara on Thursday, May 10, and we look forward to seeing many of you 
there.
 
Before we begin, let me remind everyone that today's discussion contains 
forward
-
looking statements based on the environment as we currently see it 
and, as such, does include risks
 
and uncertainties. Please refer to our press 
release for more information on the specific risk factors that could cause 
actual results to differ materially. Also, if during this call we use any non
-
GAAP financial measures or references, we'll post the app
ropriate GAAP 
financial reconciliation to our website, intc.com.
 
So with that, let me hand it over to Paul.
 
Paul S. Otellini
 
Thanks, Mark, and good afternoon, everyone. The first quarter played out 
much as we expected, with ongoing strong demand in emergin
g markets 
and in the enterprise being offset by continuing softness in the mature 
market consumer segments. PC consumption in the BRIC countries 
experienced solid double
-
digit growth over the first quarter of the year 
--
 
of 
last year. In addition, we see c
ontinued momentum in IP Data Center 
solutions, from servers to networking to storage, across both mature and 
emerging markets.
 
Our commitment to long
-
term research and development is paying off. We 
are beginning a year of major product and technology trans
itions that will 
have a very positive impact on our company and the industry. I'd like to 
highlight a few examples. We are ramping our 22
-
nanometer manufacturing 
process into high volume. This revolutionary technology uses our third
-
generation, high
-
k meta
l gate and the industry's first 3D Tri
-
Gate 
Transistors.
 
The move to Tri
-
Gate Transistors delivers roughly twice the improvement in 
transistor performance over conventional planar scaling when applied to low
-
power applications like smartphones and Ultraboo
ks. We combine our 
process technology, manufacturing and design to produce a highly leveraged 
business model that is becoming increasingly rare in our industry. That 
model allows us to do things others can't, like advancing our Atom roadmap 
at twice the ra
te of Moore's Law through 2014.
 
We're doing this at a time when the rest of the industry is struggling to ramp 
older technologies that lag our prior
-
generation, 32
-
nanometer process. Our 
research on 3D transistors began over 10 years ago, and advancements 
like 
this don't come easily. In fact, they're getting harder and harder to achieve, 
and our lead over the rest of the industry continues to grow, giving us 
product advantages in power, performance and cost.
 
Ultrabooks are reinventing computing with new for
m factors, high 
performance, better battery life, advanced security and other exciting new 
features. With more than 21 designs already shipping and more than 100 
designs in the pipeline for 2012, we're very pleased with our progress. And 
yet, this is just 
the beginning. Earlier this month, we launched our largest 
advertising campaign in a decade. And over the next few months, we expect 
Ultrabooks to reach mainstream price points. By the holiday season, we 
expect the touch interfaces and innovative new hybri
d designs will combine 
the convenience of a tablet with the performance and productivity of a 
notebook for truly no
-
compromise devices and experiences.
 
Global trends in data centers also continue to look favorable. We expect that 
by 2015, IP traffic will t
riple and data storage needs will grow by about 50%. 
This isn't just a mature market phenomenon. Data centers in China have 
grown at 8x the worldwide average over the last 5 years, making it the 
second
-
largest server market in the world.
 
The Xeon E5 proces
sor, code
-
named Romley, was engineered with exactly 
these trends in mind, improving performance up to 80% and performance 
per watt more than 50% over the prior generation. One month after launch, 
Romley has shipped nearly twice the volume of Nehalem at the
 
same point 
in its ramp.
 
At IDF Beijing last week, we also provided details about our upcoming Atom
-
based microserver System on Chip, code
-
named Centerton. Centerton will 
launch in the second half of the year with 2 cores, 64
-
bit capability, ECC and 
virtua
lization technology, all in a 6
-
watt power envelope delivering 
outstanding performance and power efficiency with unmatched software 
compatibility.
 
This quarter, we made significant progress in smartphones as well. Following 
our announcements with Lenovo an
d Motorola at CES, we followed on at 
Mobile World Congress with announced designs with Orange, ZTE and Lava, 
as well as a strategic partnership with Visa for mobile payments.
 
And finally, McAfee posted its best first quarter bookings in the company's 
histo
ry. McAfee's Deep Defender security product, the first fruit of McAfee 
and Intel's collaboration, also successfully blocked the day
-
0 Cridex worm 
attack, missed by many other antivirus systems, demonstrating the value of 
our hardware plus software security
 
strategy.
 
Looking ahead, our expectations for 2012 remain unchanged, and Q2 will 
bring several exciting announcements. We've already begun high
-
volume 
shipment of Ivy Bridge products, and you will soon see system availability. 
Ivy Bridge will be our faste
st ramping product ever, comprising nearly 1/4 of 
our microprocessor volume in Q2 alone and crossing over 50% of our 
microprocessor shipments this fall. And we expect to see another important 
milestone for our business later this week with the launch of th
e world's first 
Intel architecture
-
based smartphone.
 
Q1 was a solid quarter, and it provides a great step up 
--
 
setup for the year 
of important transitions built on a foundation of growing process technology 
leadership and the performance, compatibility an
d power efficiency of Intel 
architecture.
 
With that, let me turn the meeting over to Stacy.
 
Stacy J. Smith
 
Thanks, Paul. The first quarter results came in slightly better than our 
expectations. From a revenue standpoint, the first quarter came in at $12.9 
billion, slightly better than expected. Similar to the fourth quarter, our 
business was negatively impacted by hard disk drive shortages and the 
resulting additional reduction of inventories across the supply chain. Despite 
this discontinued reduction in i
nventory levels, it is our belief that the 
shortage did not impact actual sales of personal computers in the first 
quarter, with demand trends playing out as expected. Our expectation of 
high single
-
digit revenue growth for 2012 is unchanged.
 
For the secon
d quarter of 2012, we are forecasting the midpoint of the 
revenue range at $13.6 billion, up 5% from the first quarter and a return to 
year
-
on
-
year growth. This is better than the average seasonal decline of 
down 1%, as we see the beginning of the refillin
g of the PC supply chain as 
hard disk drive shipments recover.
 
Moving to gross margin. First quarter gross margin of 64% was slightly 
better than the midpoint of our guidance and down slightly from the fourth 
quarter. Our forecast for 2012 was unchanged at
 
64% gross margin for the 
year, and our gross margin forecast for the second quarter is 62%. As we 
move into the second quarter, we will be ramping up our Ivy Bridge 
production in 3 new 22
-
nanometer factories, resulting in an increase in unit 
costs.
 
As we 
progress through the year, we expect unit costs to come quickly down 
the cost curve, resulting in second
-
half gross margins improving from the 
first half.
 
For the first quarter, spending was in line with expectations at $4.4 billion. 
We are maintaining our
 
spending forecast for the year at $18.3 billion. As we 
move into the second quarter, we are forecasting a $200 million increase to 
spending when compared to the first quarter, primarily driven by the start of 
our Ultrabook marketing campaign. We expect sp
ending as a percent of 
revenue to come down in the second half.
 
Taking a look at the balance sheet, total cash investments ended the quarter 
at $13.8 billion, down $1.1 billion from the fourth quarter. We generated 
approximately $3 billion in cash from ope
rations, paid approximately $1 
billion in dividends, purchased nearly $3 billion in capital assets and had 
$1.5 billion of stock repurchases.
 
Inventory grew by approximately $400 million, with more than all of our 
growth attributed to our ramp of Ivy Bridg
e. On a unit basis, our 
microprocessor inventory went down from the fourth quarter.
 
Our first quarter results and our forecast for the second quarter are 
consistent with our expectations at the start of the year and reinforce our 
expectations for 2012. Aga
inst the backdrop of the worldwide shortage of 
hard disk drives and continued macroeconomic weakness in the mature 
markets, our execution remains strong.
 
We are in the midst of an unprecedented refresh of our product line across 
segments of our business. Both Romley and Ivy Bridge ramp rates will be 
significantly faster than their predecessors. Our manufacturing lead 
continues to extend with 3 new 22
-
nanome
ter factories ramping in the 
second quarter and a fourth factory ramping in the second half. Additionally, 
we are winning designs in embedded smartphones and tablets that will add 
to our growth rate over the long term. We are making investments in our 
busi
ness which bring us competitive advantage, and we are using the cash 
flow we are generating to increase shareholder returns. We will talk more 
about all of these trends at our next month's investor meeting.
 
With that, let me turn it back over to Mark.
 
Mark
 
Henninger
 
All right. Thank you, Paul and Stacy. We'll now move to Q&A. [Operator 
Instructions] Now Misty, please go ahead and introduce our first questioner.
 
Question
-
and
-
Answer Session
 
Operator
 
[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the l
ine of John Pitzer 
with Crédit Suisse.
 
John Pitzer

Stacy, just a follow
-
on to the gross margin in Q2. It sounds like the entire 
hit is just the ramp of the Ivy Bridge. I just want to get a little bit of 
understanding. 
Was this an unexpected unit cost uptick? Or is there 
something different going on with the yield curve with Ivy Bridge at 22 than 
you had anticipated?
 
Stacy J. Smith
 
No, it's absolutely consistent with my expectations when I started the year. 
Maybe it's wo
rthwhile. It's been 2 years since we've gone through a process 
transition; that was the 32
-
nanometer transition. So let me just take a 
second to go through a tutorial on how the cost accounting works as we go 
through one of these. We have 3 new 22 nanomete
r factories. And at the 
beginning of that ramp, the first units that go through those factories in 
essence absorbs all of the cost of those factories. So that is, by far, the most 
expensive part of the ramp. Those are the products that are today sitting in
 
inventory. And as we ramp up sales in Q2, those will be the products that we 
sell
-
through. And so the result of that from a cost accounting standpoint is 
we'll have a peak in unit cost in the second quarter, and then we come down 
nicely in Q3 and nicely a
gain into Q4 as those factories ramp. And as I said, 
it's consistent with what I thought at the beginning of the year, and it's 
consistent with what we saw with 32 nanometer. If you go back and look at 
the same quarter, you'll see that same peak in unit co
st. The difference 
there was it was 2 factories and today it's 3 factories because of the speed 
at which we're ramping Ivy Bridge.

And then guys, as my follow
-
up, Paul, just recognizing that sometimes 
thing
s don't happen nicely within a 4
-
quarter period, you guys have talked 
about DCG 
--
 
that DCG would be about a 15% long
-
term growth CAGR on 
top line. To achieve that this year, given the March quarter run rate, it kind 
of implies a pretty healthy ramp to abo
ut $3 billion a quarter for the next 3 
quarters. Is that kind of how we should expect the Romley ramp to play out? 
Or if you can give us some guidance around that, that'd be helpful.
 
Paul S. Otellini
 
I'll give you a little color around it, then I'll let St
acy handle the CAGRs and 
the dollars per quarter. We went into very high volume production on the 
enterprise version of Romley, which is the EP version in March, and that was 
the data point I gave you in terms of 2x the volume of Nehalem. In 
anticipation o
f that, I think there was a bit of a lull on Nehalem shipments in 
the first part of Q1 from our customers as they knew this transition was 
coming. So that was really part of the profile of the quarter. And particularly, 
if you look year
-
over
-
year, remember
 
last year, we had some large 
deliveries of products to some Internet data center customers that 
--
 
I think 
Stacy described that as being very lumpy in terms of their demand. And 
that's Q1 of last year, as well as the 14th week. So when you adjust for 
thos
e factors, I really don't see anything on our Data Center business that 
puts us off
-
track from the numbers that we committed to in terms of the 
15% CAGR. And yes, we do expect double
-
digit growth in the second half of 
the year for this product line.
 
Stacy 
J. Smith
 
Yes. Actually, I'd just add to that. I would expect the Data Center Group 
--
 
I 
think Paul did a really nice job of describing the Q1 compare. As I think 
about Q2, we would expect the Data Center Group to get back to double
-

Your next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon with Stanford

Stacy A. Rasgon

Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division
 
I had a question on the impact of hard driv
es and seasonality. So you 
obviously got hit by it in Q1. You're seeing a bit of a snapback in Q2. You 
said you're not 
--
 
in your CFO commentary, you said you weren't forecasting 
any more negative impact. But is a possible 
--
 
is a positive impact possible?
 
Have we seen all the snapback you think that we're going to see from the 
hard drives coming back? Or is there potential for further
-
above seasonal 
growth coming in the back half? How should we think about overall 
seasonality in the wake of the hard drive 
situation through the rest of the 
year?
 
Stacy J. Smith
 
Yes, great question. Thanks. This is Stacy. And actually, I'd characterize Q2 
as being 
--
 
our forecast is pretty consistent with underlying demand, and 
that I think the inventory replenishment really k
icks in as we get into Q3. So 
let me kind of talk through what I think hard disk drives have done to the 
shipment of PCs. Q4 was obviously impacted significantly as the impact of 
the Thailand floods reduced the amount of hard disk drives out there. And as 
we said on the January call, people weren't buying processors because they 
couldn't marry that with a hard disk drive and make the system. And so we 
saw a significant reduction of inventory levels. I think that reduction actually 
continued into Q1. So we s
aw further reduction of the worldwide supply 
chain. What you see in Q2, I believe, is pretty indicative of in
-
demand, just 
the fact that you have a Q1 that's depressed because of that contraction in 
the supply chain. And then what I think happens in Q3 is 
that's where you're 
going to really start to see the replenishment of the worldwide supply chain 
for PCs, and it's a combination of: they're going to replenish the supply 
chain with Ivy Bridge as opposed to doing it with older
-
generation 
technology, and it
's anticipation of a good Q4. We have lots of catalysts in 
the marketplace that we think are driving a reasonable amount of 
excitement for how sales could go at the end of this year.

Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division
 
Got
 
it, that's helpful. And for my follow
-
up, another question, I guess, on 
gross margins. So this quarter, gross margins came in a little bit better than 
expected, and it looked like it was because your platform unit costs were 
better than expected. Next qua
rter, on at least versus where the Street was, 
it looks like gross margin is coming a little worse, and it looks like it's 
probably because of higher
-
than
-
expected gross margins 
--
 
higher
-
than
-
expected platform and unit costs. I know there have been some f
luff floating 
around of push outs on Ivy Bridge. Is this 
--
 
should we take this as, I guess, 
some sort of evidence that the initial ramp of Ivy Bridge actually did see a 
bit of a push up from Q1 into Q2? I mean, how did that ramp versus what's 
going now co
mpare with your original expectations as in back in January 
when you gave the gross margin guidance for the quarter?
 
Stacy J. Smith
 
Yes. If you remember during the quarter, we were pretty public that we 
shifted the ramp of Ivy Bridge out 3 weeks. That was 
to make sure that 
there was enough inventory in the pipeline...
 
Paul S. Otellini
 
Shifted the launch out.
 
Stacy J. Smith
 
I'm sorry. We shifted the launch of Ivy Bridge out 3 weeks, yes. And so what 
that means is we sold through a little less Ivy 
Bridge in Q1. Those products 
were in inventory. And then that's the Q2 impact that I talked to you on 
cost. So Ivy Bridge really explains the little bit of good news in Q1 and then 
the Q2 gross margin forecast. And again, that Q2 margin forecast is 
consist
ent with what I thought when I started the year. It's just Q1 was a 
little better.

I was wondering if you could help us understand some o
f the moving parts 
within desktop and notebook for the quarter and what your expeditions are 
going into Q2.
 
Stacy J. Smith
 
The 
--
 
yes, we don't forecast at that level of granularity. But what we're 
seeing 
--
 
and remember, we're comparing to a 14
-
week quart
er back in Q1 
of '11. But in general when you step back and look at what's happening in 
the different businesses, what we see is that the notebook segment of the 
market continues to grow nicely on a unit basis. Emerging markets continues 
to grow, and that 
tends to be a bit more desktop
-
centric. Enterprise was 
relatively strong and then we saw some weakness in mature
-
market 
consumer. Those kind of play through the different segments. But if your 
question is are we continuing to see notebook market growth, we
 
did in Q1 
when you look at the actual demand for computers relative to where we 
were a year ago and relative to what you'd expect seasonally.
 
Paul S. Otellini
 
I would add on top of that, that the first versions of Ivy Bridge that we're 
shipping are quad c
ores, and then bulk of those are going into desktops. And 
there's a lot of interest in these new generation, all
-
in
-
one desktop. If you 
haven't seen them, they're pretty attractive machines. And then the second 
launch of the products is in the dual core, w
hich is the mainstream 
notebooks. So I think that helps put a profile over the course of quarter as 
well.
 
Shawn R. Webster

Macquarie Research
 
And then I guess as a segue from the mix perspective and the pricing, 
pricing was roughly flat for you guys in Q
1. Do you expect it to remain kind 
of flattish over the course of the year? Or are there some things happening 
in terms of your ramps that you're expecting more pricing could actually 
maybe increase over the next quarter or 2?
 
Stacy J. Smith
 
No. I characte
rize the pricing environment in January as 
--
 
I think the word 
is ""relatively benign,"" based on the process technology leadership we have 
and the strength of our products relative to competition. I haven't seen 
anything that would cause me to change my vie
w. I think 2012 will be a 
relatively benign pricing environment for us.

Uche X. Orji

UBS Investment Bank, Research Division
 
Paul, can I just ask you a 2
-
part question on the Ultrabook
s? You talked 
about being able to achieve mainstream pricing in a few months. Can you 
just talk about where you were able to make changes 
--
 
helping your 
customers make changes in the bill of material? I know you said up 
--
 
a 
$300 million fund to help achi
eve some of those improvements. Given the 
way these Ultrabooks look compared to regular PCs, I just kind of want to 
know how much were you able to achieve improvements to achieve those 
mainstream pricing. And how much of those improvements are proprietary 
to Intel, given your investment in taking costs down?
 
Paul S. Otellini
 
Yes. The Ultrabook fund really hasn't kicked in to where it's yielding near
-
term bill of materials reductions, Uche. We're making those investments 
now. Some of them have to do with cap
acity that's coming online for the 
second half of this year, particularly around capacitive touch screens, to be 
able to make sure that those come down in price. The biggest changes are, 
quite frankly, just competition. When you 
--
 
I talked about 21 design
s 
shipping now, another 
--
 
over 100 more coming through the second half of 
this year. That's driving volume and it's driving people to be competitive on 
some of these previously niche sort of technologies. And I'll give you one 
example. ASUS is now shippin
g a very low profile, 500
-
gig hard drive into an 
Ultrabook, something that we didn't think was possible. Yet they've found 
the technology to do this, and that helps give them an advantage. And I 
think you'll see other customers do that. The biggest change 
and the one 
that we're really focused on is trying to make sure that we intercept the 
Windows 8 launch with sufficient quantities of Ultrabooks that have touch 
enabled. And up to now, touch has been a fairly 
--
 
almost a $100 adder to 
cost, the bill of mate
rials cost, and we've seen that come down very 
dramatically over the last 60, 90 days. As we've worked it and as more and 
more customers have committed to SKUs, that drives the volume. So the 
combination of all of these things, of the OEMs and Taiwan Inc. 
aiming at 
these volume opportunities is really what's driving prices and costs down.
 
Uche X. Orji

UBS Investment Bank, Research Division
 
That's great. Any 
--
 
do you feel 
--
 
think you'll be able to achieve 40% of 
consumer notebooks and Ultrabooks exiting 
in 2012? And any update as to 
enterprise adoption of Ultrabooks? I know it's probably early days to say, but 
any sense as to what you can give us, that'd be helpful.
 
Paul S. Otellini
 
On the 40%, yes. I'm still very confident we can do that. All the signs a
re 
tracking there. I mean, everything we've looked at since we first gave that 
number set has gotten more positive. More designs, better price points, et 
cetera, et cetera, lower costs. So all the first derivative indicators are very 
positive around that. 
In terms of enterprise adoption, enterprise tends to be 
a little bit slower. A lot of enterprises like our vPro technology, the vPro
-
based SKUs for Ultrabooks I think come out this summer, first ones, and 
then start ramping over the course of the year. I w
ill say that hasn't stopped 
the people in this room from having Ultrabooks. As I look around the table, 
most of them are Ultrabooks. So this enterprise, for one, is adopting them.

d, though, that the die size on Ivy Bridge is 
about

for a quad core, is about 160 square millimeters, quite a bit less 
than the quad core die size of a Sandy Bridge. So does that mean that the 
Ivy Bridge platform cost, when you've got your cost normaliz
ed, will actually 
be quite a bit less than Sandy Bridge too?
 
Stacy J. Smith
 
Yes, I'll talk more about long

I kind of talked about the cost accounting of these

n Ivy Bridge. I'll end 2011

JoAnne Feeney

Longbow Research LLC
 
I was hoping you could perhaps give us some insight into the mix you 
anticipate for corporate versus consumer this year. What kind of demand are 
you seeing out of the emerging markets? 
And what kind of demand are you 
seeing out of the more industrialized markets right now?
 
Stacy J. Smith
 
We don't get into that level of detail on a forecast basis. I'll say for Q1, 
JoAnne, our mix was quite healthy. We didn't see any significant shift in m
ix. 
Generally I think as we progress through the year, what we're going to see 
is relative strength based on the strength of the Ivy Bridge product line and 
the Romley product line in their respective segments. And then we're likely 
to see some price compe
tition at the low end of the market that all kind of 
plays into my benign pricing environment that I expect for the year. But we 
don't get into that level of detail typically on a forecast.
 
Paul S. Otellini
 
But I'd add, though, JoAnne, that typically, the 
enterprise SKUs, particularly 
in notebooks, tend to be about 1/3 of the business. And that's been true sort 
of year in, year out for a long time. The trend that is underlying that, 
though, is that more and more businesses are allowing their employees to 
br
ing any kind of computer they want into the office. And so you're seeing a 
bit less rigidity around that number than we've seen in the past, and it tends 
to get a little bit more mixed. We think that we've got some ideas on how to 
improve those

the secu
rity and manageability of those machines over 
time, while still giving the employees the choice of what they want to bring 
in.
 
JoAnne Feeney

Longbow Research LLC
 
Great, and I 
--
 
a nice segue into the follow

up. On the margin front, how do 
you see the PC 
CPU margins? I know you had said overall pricing is expected 
to be benign. I'm thinking more about next year. How do you see those 
margins differing between, say, your standard notebook and your Ultrabook 
and your tablet? Do you see mix as a threat to over
all margins or as, 
perhaps, a helping factor?
 
Stacy J. Smith
 
I think our mix has been very strong. And I'll talk more about the segments 
of the business in May. But between Ultrabooks and the rest of the client 
business, we've got a great cost structure an
d a rich mix. And I think you 
can kind of see it in the overall results. If you just do the gross margin math 
for the company between our Q1 actual, our Q2 forecast, we kind of average 
63% for the first half. To get to a 64% gross margin for the year, it s
ays we 
have to be up around 65% on the back half. And that's 
--
 
as we're ramping 
Ivy Bridge, it says we're seeing Ultrabook volumes really ramp

up.

Paul, I have a longer
-
term question. It's clear the emerging markets have 
been driving a lot of PC growth. I'm curious, longer
-
term, do you think these 
emerging markets go more towards Ultrabooks or towards tablets?
 
And what 
implications will that have on Intel's pricing?

I don't think anyone in the world knows the answer to that question, Vivek. I 
think a lot of that has

has to depends on 
--
 
if you look at people buying 
tablets today, particularl
y in the iPad arena, there are people that have 
started out PCs and very often still use PCs. And it's a complimentary device. 
How that unfolds 2, 3 years from now, I don't think anyone knows. What I 
am very excited about, and I alluded to this in my openi
ng comments, is this 
notion of bringing the convenience, the thin
-
ness, the instant
-
on capability 
and the touch of a tablet combined with the productivity, the compatibility 
and the usefulness of a keyboard into the same device. And you'll see a 
number of 
these shipping second half of this year as the energies of our 
OEMs and the ODMs gets unleashed into this category. And I think that it's 
way too early to have a debate on Ultrabook versus tablet because in fact, in 
my view, the long
-
term form factor is pr
obably somewhere in between those 
2 devices.

Got it. And Paul, secondly, on your smartphone and tablet strategy, I mean, 
if I look at the industry, it's clear that Apple and Samsung are now 
accounting for an increasing number of units and even more, almost half of 
the industry sales. So does that leave enough room in the market for you to 
go after and have an impact on your sales and profitability? Is it enough 
potential for you to go after t
his market?
 
Paul S. Otellini
 
Well, sure. I mean, any numbers that we look at going forward has 
smartphones, going from sort of $450 million to close to $1 billion as 
smartphones, as most phones become smartphones. And even if you take 
out half of the 
market, which I would be loath to do, but even if you take it 
out, it's still a very large number. I'd point out, too, that those are both 
companies that we are continuing to have dialogue with in terms of our 
product line. And Samsung doesn't universally 
use its chips in its phones. 
They use other vendors, and that's certainly an account we would love to 
win for phones. And I can't ever speak for Apple, but we know where they 
are and they know where we are.

--
 
yes, the CapEx that we're 
spending is more to transition from one g
eneration to the next. There is 
some capacity growth in there, but it's probably less than you're thinking.

Q2 where we're selling every Ivy Bridge unit we can make, and we thin
k that 
continues.

-
up, can you help us understand, I think 
depreciation is supposed to be $1.6 billion in the second quarter. Where 
might that go in the back half of
 
the year as any additional 22
-
nanometer 
factories turn on?
 
Stacy J. Smith
 
I think you can kind of see the 
--
 
you can interpolate the depreciation 
number because you've seen Q1 actual, Q2 forecast and then the back half 
or 
--
 
then the forecast for the year
. I think at the base of your question, it's 
probably going up less than you were anticipating. This comes back to my 
comment in the January call. You have to keep in mind that a pretty large 
proportion of our capacity or our CapEx in 2012 is in building f
actories, and 
that has a much longer depreciation schedule than does putting equipment 
into the factories. I think back in January I said it was over 1/3. I actually 
refined that later in the quarter and said it was more like 40% of the total 
amount of Cap
Ex that we're spending this year is going to be on buildings 
and fabs as opposed to equipment. So I think that's why you're seeing less 
of an impact to depreciation than maybe your historical models would 
suggest.

line of Glen Yeung with Citi.
 
Glen Yeung 
-
 
Citigroup Inc, Research Division
 
The first one is just looking at this idea of high single
-
digit growth for the 
year, it implies that the back half is at least seasonal. Actually, it should be 
higher than normal 
seasonal. And I've heard your comment on Data Center 
being very strong. But if we looked across PC clients, maybe a potential for 
handsets or a micro server or maybe software, where do you see the above 
seasonal strength coming from in the back half of the
 
year?
 
Stacy J. Smith
 
I think the biggest part of this is that we're exiting Q1 with historically low 
levels of inventory. There's not much of a replenishment in Q2. And then as 
Ivy Bridge ramps in, as people gear up for the kind of normal Q4 
selling 
season, we expect inventory levels to replenish some in the third quarter. 
That's the biggest shift and we talked about that at the beginning of the 
year. That's what kind of causes the shift of units to the back half.
 
Glen Yeung 
-
 
Citigroup Inc, R
esearch Division
 
Okay. Fair enough. Second question, Paul, is for you. As you talked to your 
customers or your potential customers in handset, can you talk about to 
what extent 2 things matter to them? One, your technology roadmap, 
particularly as you're a
ble to talk to them about 14 nanometer? And then 
two, just the fact that you actually have or will have the capacity available 
--
 
because obviously elsewhere, we're seeing very tight supply on what's now 
28
-
nanometer.
 
Paul S. Otellini
 
Well, the roadmap is 
certainly the best door opener we have in talking to 
these customers, but it's not the only asset we have here. Then there's 2 
classes of handset customers. There's obviously the traditional OEM 
manufacturers, and we've announced a number of those; but the
re's also 
carriers that are interested in doing a private label, and we've announced 
one of those with Orange in Europe. And the relationships that we have with 
carriers globally are pretty strong, and they go back a number of years. And 
those are 
--
 
those
 
have to do with a lot of the work that Intel has done in 
their data centers and in the reconfiguration of the cellular network 
infrastructure. As both classes of customers look at the handset roadmap, 
what they want to do is find ways to provide different
iation from what's out 
there and service platforms for themselves. That's where the other element 
of our strategy, the non
-
silicon element of our strategy, becomes much 
more critical. And so what's our security roadmap as it relates to that? 
What's our loc
ation
-
based services capability? What kinds of sensors can we 
build into the handset? All of those are really hardware
-
centric features that 
employ software that allow someone to create a service annuity stream. 
That discussion is much more sophisticated a
nd complex than just showing a 
roadmap. And that's the level that we're at today with most customers.

would start growing double

digits. Did you mean year

over

over

quarter in that second quarter comment? And how should we think 
about the contribution of the network and storage tractio
n that you really 
hadn't been addressing as much in the past?

Year
-
over

year. And thanks for the opportunity to clarify that. So yes, when 
I think about BCG, I'm always doing year
-
over
-
year comps because of the 
growth rate of that business. 
And I'll hold off, I think, on going through the 
various segments of the BCG business. We will talk a lot about that in May. 
But if I take you back to what we said last May, which I still believe to be 
true, we're seeing secular demand drivers that are dri
ving the classic server 
business, and that's the build
-
out of these big IP data centers. And then 
from an Intel perspective, we're benefiting by the fact that our architecture 
is now extending into things like storage and networking and even some of 
the ba
ckplane infrastructure in the data center, and so that's giving us 
added growth. But we'll go through that in a lot more detail in May.
 
Ross Seymore

Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division
 
Great. And the follow
-
up question is one for Paul, and it's a bigger
-
picture 
manufacturing one. In your preamble, you mentioned about Intel being able 
to do things others couldn't from a manufacturing point of view. To that end, 
as you're able to pull further ahead of the competition on Moore's Law, how 
should we think abou
t that benefit manifesting itself, either strategically for 
Intel or on the types of markets you can address, the revenue growth 
margins or even the business model implications that you can do with things 
like potentially entering the foundry business, et 
cetera?
 
Paul S. Otellini
 
Well, the business model that we have today is one that I'm extremely 
comfortable with and we're working as hard as possible to maintain, which is 
--
 
and I described this last year in the analyst meeting. As compared to 
other non
-
i
ntegrated device manufacturers, we get paid twice for our 
products. We get paid the equivalent of a foundry margin, and we get paid 
the equivalent of an architectural margin and that allows us to generate 
fairly nice margins. So as long as we can fill up a
ll of the factories we can 
build with Intel products at those kinds of rewards in terms of the ROI, that 
makes the most sense for us. Are there opportunities out in time to take 
advantage of the lead that we're building in areas like foundry? Yes, 
perhaps,
 
and I've said that before. And you've seen some small 
announcements to that effect, where we've signed up some companies for 
some foundry activity over the next several years. I would look at those, and 
I would ask you to look at those as being learning e
xperiences for us. A lot 
of the work we're doing here is to build the libraries, the tools that allow us 
as a company and our designers of the company to be able to use quick time 
to market, quick derivative capabilities, modularity for our SoC businesses 
going forward. And the best way to test those is to have some third
-
party 
customers to really validate how good they are, how 
--
 
or where they need 
some work. So it's a learning expense for us. It is for profit, it is not done 
strictly for

just to get t
o know how to do this. And in terms of where it 
goes long term, I'll leave that point open.
 
Stacy J. Smith
 
And if I can maybe just add, one of the tactical benefits we see being an 
integrated design and manufacturing house is the speed at which we can 
ramp
 
these factories. We'll have 25% of our shipment volume in Q2 coming 
from Ivy Bridge on 22 nanometer. And it's just an incredibly fast ramp rate. 
And even compared to what we did on 32 nanometer, that's a lot faster than 
what we're able to do. So we can ju
st transition the market to these great 
new products. And I think you've seen some of the non
-
integrated models 
where they really struggle with ramp rates and yields and things like that. 
So it's a benefit in the long term to the product lineup, and it's a
 
benefit 
tactically to our ability to transition the product line.

Actually, Paul, just a follow up on Ross
' question. I mean is there anything 
that would prevent you from getting Apple's processor business for the 
foundry or QualComm's business? I mean, it would be kind of competing 
against the Atom. But is that theoretically possible? Are you opposed to 
anyth
ing like that?
 
Paul S. Otellini
 
Well, anything is theoretically possible. The things that would stand in the 
way with that, both of those, would be the right commercial agreement. I 
have to say that from a 
--
 
from the kind of taste it would leave my mouth,
 
the Apple win would be a little bit 
--
 
a lot more attractive than the 
QualComm win.

Something tells me it will help the stock, too. As my follow
-
up, can you just 
maybe give us your sense of j
ust the trend in PC demand out there? And in 
particular, if you could just spend a little time on the various deals, what you 
see happening in China and North America and Europe? Is it seasonal yet? Is 
it better than seasonal? Worse than seasonal? Getting 
better or getting 
worse? Any words would be appreciated.

Our geo managers are in this week, and we're going through the reviews. 
And the question I've been asking everyone as they come through here is do 
you see the year any differently th
an you did 3 months ago, the last time we 
were all together face
-
to
-
face? And the answer is universally no. It's 
--
 
this 
is playing out exactly as we had predicted so far. It's only 3 months into the 
year. But given that we now have line of sight to Q2 and
 
we've sort of 
worked our way through the HDD morass, it's feeling pretty good. As I look 
out towards the second half of the year, it doesn't take a lot to deliver the 
kind of numbers we're talking about. Stacy gave an indication of our view of 
some invent
ory refill around Ivy Bridge as that ramps up. I'll remind you 
that we are going into a new 
--
 
a year where we have a new version of 
Microsoft operating system, and that traditionally has been very strong for 
the industry. And this particular version gives
 
us the opportunity to 
participate with a mainstream operating system around touch, and I'm very 
excited about that. So you add those things up, and I think the battle for the 
consumer dollars even in a soft consumer environment can be 
--
 
is not going 
to b
e as clear anti
-
PC as it perhaps was last year. And lastly, we're not going 
to get trapped into giving numbers, but we do feel a little bit validated about 
the fact that the third
-
party analysts raised their numbers to equal ours, 
particularly around the d
esktop business, which has been a point of 
difference between us. Also, we're looking for a relatively decent year with 
strength in emerging markets in all segments, strength in enterprise globally 
and continuing softness in the Western Europe and potentia
lly United States 
markets.

Your next question comes from the line of Jim Covello with Goldman Sachs.

Stacy, relative to the balance sheet, you guys have done an absolutely 
terrific job returning cash to shareholders, dividends and buybacks, and you 
certainly have a terrific capital position. But cash is coming down because 
your free cash flow is 
kind of neutral. And then obviously, with the dividends 
and buybacks, that's drawing the cash level down. How low do you feel 
comfortable drawing down the cash and still feeling like you're in a 
tremendous capital position that gives you an advantage?
 
Stac
y J. Smith
 
Well, one cautionary note. I think you want to be a little careful on the free 
cash flow generated in Q1 relative to the long
-
term trend. You have a couple 
of issues in Q1. First is it's pretty depressed, given what happened with hard 
disk drive
s. And as our business recovers, the cash flow is going to improve. 
And then secondly, remember there's things we accrue for all year long. We 
have big payments in Q1. That's kind of a couple of billion dollars worth of 
shift in free cash flow. So that's o
n the free cash flow side. In terms of cash 
balances, what 
--
 
we don't peg a specific number out there, although I think, 
as you know, we have very specific conversations with the board. I think you 
can see in the first quarter, we're obviously pretty comf
ortable with our cash 
balances. They changed a little bit, but we've kind of been now bouncing 
around this number for a couple of quarters.

Okay. And then if I could ask for my follow
-
up, relative
 
to the view that 
Ultrabook adoption will pick up steam as the price points get down to a 
""mainstream price point,"" if I look at consumer activity today, the iPad 3 is 
already at a higher price point of where Ultrabooks are today and obviously, 
had tremend
ous adoption almost immediately. So how do we get 
comfortable that it's really a price point issue and not a product preference 
issue?
 
Paul S. Otellini
 
I don't think 
--
 
I'm not a subscriber that it takes mainstream price points to 
get us to high volume. I 
mean, I think this is 
--
 
that just helps. And what 
you're going to see is an incredible amount of differentiation from $699 to 
$1,299. And I love that. People are doing different experiments with 
different screen sizes. I talked earlier about convertibles 
and hybrids and 
slide
-
out keyboards and things like that. Some people are putting touch in, 
which is a cost adder. I really don't see the need to get to those price points 
to deliver the value proposition. The price points make everything work 
better becau
se it lowers the bill of material's cost on some of these 
previously very expensive niche components.
 
Mark Henninger
 
Right. One last question please, Misty?

Your final question comes from the line of C.J. Muse with Barclays.

I guess first question, as you think about a PC recovery in the second half, 
curious what you think will be a bigger driver there between Windows 8 and 
Ultrabooks?
 
Paul S. Otellini
 
I think it's way too 
--
 
it's a little h
ard for us to predict that. I mean, the 
Ultrabook, even as we hit our numbers, we said that's going to be 40% of 
consumer notebooks at year end. So that's still not the majority of PCs. I 
think the general issue is that this has been a market which, as we'
ve talked 
about, has not had a lot of new and exciting products the last few years. And 
so this year, you've got a one
-
two punch with Intel and Microsoft both 
delivering dynamite products that are the result of years of innovation and 
lots of R&D. And we'r
e hoping 
--
 
we are optimistic that the combination of 
those 2 will bring growth.
 
Christopher J. Muse

That's helpful. And as a quick follow
-
up, you talked earlier about your 
manufacturing leadership and clearly, no doub
t there. I'm curious if you 
could provide an update on your plans for 14
-
nanometer ramp in terms of 
equipment, installation and when you think you'll come to market there?
 
Stacy J. Smith
 
No.
 
Paul S. Otellini
 
We'll give you some 
--
 
better granularity to tha
t in the Analyst Meeting in 
May. But generally, it's every other year. From a rule
-
of
-
thumb standpoint, 
that's as granular as I think I want to be right now.

Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the AT&T 
second quarter 2017 earnings call. At this time, all lines are in a listen
-
only 
mode. Later, we will conduct a question and answer session. Instructions will 
be given at 
that time. And as a reminder, this conference is being recorded.
 
I'll now turn the conference over Senior Vice President, Investor Relations 
Michael Viola. Please go ahead, sir.

Okay. Thank you, Kathy, and good afternoon, ever
yone. Welcome to the 
second quarter conference call. Like Kathy said, I'm Mike Viola, Head of 
Investor Relations at AT&T. Joining me on the call today is John Stephens, 
AT&T's Chief Financial Officer. John is going to cover our results, and he'll 
also prov
ide an update on technology and infrastructure as well as an update 
on Time Warner and the FirstNet process. And then we'll follow with a Q&A 
session.
 
As always, our earnings materials are available on the new Investor 
Relations page of the AT&T website. T
hat's going to include our news 
release, 8
-
K, investor briefing, associated schedules, et cetera.
 
Before we begin, I'd like to call your attention our Safe Harbor statement 
that's on slide 2. The Safe Harbor statement says that some of our 
comments today m
ay be forward
-
looking. As such, they're subject to risks 
and uncertainties. Results may differ materially, and additional information 
is available on the Investor Relations website.
 
So now let me turn the call over to AT&T's CFO, John Stephens.

Thanks, Mike, and thank you all for joining us on the call today. Let's first 
look at our consolidated financial summary on slide 3. We included both a 
quarterly and a year
-
to
-
date view. While the second quarter provides a good 
snapshot,
 
the year
-
do
-
date view actually provides a more complete picture 
of how we are performing in a challenging and competitive environment.
 
Year to date, revenue has been pressured by fewer phone upgrades and 
declines in legacy services. At the same time, our 
cost containment efforts 
are paying off, and it's showing up in our margins and our earnings. What 
we're doing on the cost side drove a 120 basis point improvement in 
adjusted consolidated operating margins year to date.
 
Earnings were strong. After adjustm
ents, second quarter EPS was $0.79, up 
almost 10% for the quarter and up 7% year to date. There are a few things 
driving this strong EPS performance; first, as I just mentioned, lower costs. 
We're taking out operating costs and at the same time providing c
ustomers 
with a better experience through more automation, more digital interactions, 
more software and analytics, and more of our network functions being 
virtualized.
 
Second, our international operations are becoming more profitable. Our 
satellite busines
s in Latin America continues to be profitable in a tough 
environment, and we are past the heaviest investment cycle in Mexico.
 
And finally, there were a few one
-
time operational items in the second 
quarter such as operating taxes that did help results. But
 
we also normalized 
more than $0.03 of items that would have helped even more, including gains 
from a spectrum slot, asset sales, and a one
-
time benefit savings. Even with 
all these moving pieces, we continue to expect adjusted EPS growth in the 
mid
-
single
-
digit range.
 
At the same time, year
-
to
-
date cash from operations is solid. Our increased 
capital spending is reflected in our free cash flow. But once again, the 
guidance is unchanged. We continue to expect free cash flow in the $18 
billion range for the 
year, albeit at the low end of the range. The timing of 
the FirstNet expenditures and reimbursements are expected to impact that 
number. And we still expect capital spending in the $22 billion range, subject 
to the FirstNet timing. Some of the differences 
between adjusted EPS and 
cash from operations in the second quarter and for the year reflect the 
depreciation changes we've previously discussed.
 
I want to say we saw some (4:20) working capital lumpiness in this quarter, 
inventory and vendor payment chang
es, which we would expect to sort 
themselves out as we work our way through the rest of the year. In 
addition, integration costs, inclusive of the Time Warner deal, have been 
adjusted out of net income, but still impact free cash flow, same for the 
settlem
ent payments for our pre
-
merger DTV legal case with the FTC that 
was previously announced and accrued. All these impacted the quarter, but 
we don't expect a repeat for the rest of the year, and we continue to 
maintain our $18 billion range guidance for fre
e cash flow.
 
Let's now take a look at our operations, starting with Wireless. Those details 
are on slide 4. As a reminder, AT&T's domestic mobility operations are 
divided between the Business Solutions and Consumer Wireless segments. 
For comparison purpose
s, the company is providing supplemental 
information for its total U.S. Wireless operations.
 
It was another highly competitive quarter in Wireless. Our competitors tried 
just about every promotion in the marketing book. In fact, one of them even 
offered to
 
give away their service for free for a year. We were prudent with 
our promotional activity. Instead, our focus was on giving customers a great 
video entertainment experience bundled with mobility. Our results speak for 
themselves. We grew our domestic bra
nded phone base by 178,000, 
including 267,000 prepaid net adds. We grew our smartphone base by more 
than 0.5 million. We had a strong year
-
over
-
year and sequential postpaid 
improvement. We added 2.3 million subscribers. And customer loyalty was 
terrific, w
ith our lowest
-
ever postpaid phone churn for any quarter at 0.79%.
 
At the same time, our EBITDA margin matched last quarter's all
-
time high of 
41.8%, and our EBITDA service margin was the best ever at 50.4%. These 
results speak to the fantastic job our Wir
eless teams are doing with cost 
management as well as the underlying strength of our Wireless customer 
base and business.
 
Now, let's move to our Entertainment group results at the bottom of slide 4. 
Revenues and margin were relatively stable. Growth in IP 
and video services 
revenue offset legacy declines, and cost synergies and efficiencies offset 
pressure from content increases and startup costs for DIRECTV NOW. 
AdWorks revenues are [up] nearly 15% year over year. We continue to do 
well in addressable and 
local ad sales, utilizing our customer insights data. 
Addressable and local ads can generate CPMs that are 3 to 4 times that of 
our national sales, and we've been shifting more ad inventory to these areas 
to further improve our top line performance.
 
Total 
broadband grew for the third straight quarter, overcoming what is 
normally a seasonally slow second quarter. The strategy to simplify pricing, 
cross
-
sell broadband with TV and wireless service, and expand our fiber 
footprint has been paying off. We're far 
down the road in completing our 
legacy DSL conversions to IP broadband. That conversion, combined with 
extending fiber to more than 5.5 million customer locations, is strengthening 
our broadband position. In fact, the number of broadband subscribers on 
spe
eds 18 megabits or higher has increased by nearly 1.6 million in the past 
year.
 
Traditional video losses continued their recent trends. The second quarter 
traditionally has seasonal pressures, but we also are feeling the impact of 
the overall industry tren
d of more customers wanting mobile and over
-
the
-
top offerings. The pace of that change seems to have picked up a bit so far 
this year.
 
We continued to improve our traditional TV offers by simplifying the pricing 
and bundling TV with broadband and wireless,
 
but we also know that 
traditional TV service is not for everyone. Many are choosing our over
-
the
-
top offering, DIRECTV NOW. Half of our DTV NOW subscribers are coming 
from traditional pay
-
TV, mainly from our competitors, and the other half had 
no pay
-
TV s
ervice at all. We introduced this service at the end of last year 
and have now reached nearly 0.5 million subscribers. This has helped us 
keep our total video base essentially flat from a year ago.
 
We continue to refine and improve DIRECTV NOW service. We 
recently 
launched our app on additional streaming devices, and we're continuing to 
increase the number of local channels that are available. And we're also beta 
testing a new platform that will include a cloud
-
based DVR. We'll broaden 
availability of this 
new video platform later this year.
 
Speaking of our Entertainment group, it's been two years since we closed 
our acquisition of DIRECTV. You can see the progress on slide 5. One of the 
opportunities we highlighted two years ago was the potential of bundlin
g 
services and its impact both on subscriber trends and churn. Our results tell 
the story. For example, the number of wireless subscribers who also have a 
TV service from us has increased by more than 4 million, or up 31%, since 
the close of the DTV deal. 
Conversely, TV subscribers with wireless plans 
have increased by nearly 1 million, or 18%. And the number of TV 
subscribers in our footprint with high
-
speed Internet service has increased 
by 10%.
 
While this is impressive when you look at all traditional TV
 
subscribers, it's 
even more so when you break out our DIRECTV and DIRECTV NOW 
customers. This includes those who have migrated from our IP TV service, 
which is something we intended. The number of wireless subscribers with 
DTV has increased by 72%, while 
the number of DTV subscribers with AT&T 
Wireless has increased by 1.7 million, or 52%, and the number of our DTV 
subscribers in our wireline footprint with our IP broadband has grown by 
more than 2.7 million, to 67% of DIRECTV customers.
 
Bundling obviously
 
helps subscriber and revenue growth, but perhaps the 
biggest impact is on wireless churn. We've seen postpaid churn fall 25 basis 
points since we closed the DIRECTV deal. We're doing this in one of the most 
competitive environments we've ever seen, and a 
big reason for this is the 
increasing attractiveness of our wireless and video bundles. In fact, if you 
look at any bundled customer, churn is lower when compared to customers 
with just a single service. These are our most valuable customers. We use 
the co
mbined appeal of wireless, video, and broadband services to offer 
compelling packages that can't be easily replicated. It's a great way to 
differentiate our services in the noisy and competitive wireless and video 
marketplaces.
 
We also have been making gre
at headway with our fiber build. We have the 
largest fiber footprint in the country, and we are ahead of the plan to reach 
our 12.5 million new fiber customer locations FCC commitment by mid
-
2019. 
In fact, by the time it's all said and done, we could be lo
oking at around 14 
million fiber
-
to
-
the
-
prem customer locations.
 
We're also on track to meet or beat the expected cost synergies from 
DIRECTV. We hit a $1.5 billion run rate with cost synergies at the end of last 
year, and we're on track to reach a 
$2.5 billion
-
plus synergy run rate next 
year.
 
Now let's look at Business Solutions results on slide 6. We continue to see 
the similar historical pressures in our Business segment. Strategic Services 
and Wireless are working hard to overcome legacy wireline
 
losses. We 
continue to make incredible strides in cost management while increasing the 
percent of revenues that come from Wireless and Strategic Services. That's 
driving higher margins even with wireline revenues declining.
 
Let me give you one example of 
what we're talking about. Our legacy voice 
and data revenues were down more than $500 million year over year. But 
even with that pressure, EBITDA grew by more than $70 million, and 
EBITDA margins improved by 150 basis points. We're doing this by driving 
ha
rd on cost management initiatives. Our focus is having the industry's best 
cost structure, and one way to do that is by implementing process 
automation and service efficiencies.
 
Our industry leadership in software
-
defined networking also supports our 
cost 
management goals. More than 40% of our network functions are now 
virtualized, and by year end it should be 55%, with a long
-
term goal of 75% 
or better.
 
Moving to our international operations at the bottom of slide 6, we saw solid 
improvement across our ope
rations. Revenues grew and margins improved 
in both our Latin America and Mexico operations. In fact, EBITDA and 
EBITDA margins for our international segment have more than doubled year 
over year.
 
We did see an EBITDA benefit from a one
-
time item in Brazil
 
during the 
quarter. In Mexico, revenue grew and margins improved both sequentially 
and year over year. Revenues were up about 10%. We added close to 
500,000 new subs in Mexico in the quarter to pass 13 million. Our LTE 
network now covers more than 88 mill
ion people, or just about 75% of the 
country.
 
Looking further south, our Latin America pay
-
TV revenues were up more 
than 11%. Net adds were down, due mostly to seasonality in Argentina and 
losses in Brazil, but our video business in Latin America continues
 
to be 
profitable and generate positive free cash flow.
 
Before we get to your questions, we'd like to provide an update on several 
topics that many of you have asked about. Our business update is on slide 
7.
 
First, the Time Warner review process at the DOJ
 
continues. We still expect 
to close the deal by year end, and we have the financing set up to do so. 
And our merger integration team is nearly complete with its plans for 
opportunities that this deal will make possible in advertising, bundling, and 
provid
ing customers choice. Our goal is to hit the ground running once we 
receive final approval and build our leadership in the telecom, media, and 
technology space.
 
Second, we continue to invest and improve our integrated networks. Our 
wireless networks reach 
more than 99% of all Americans. Our spectrum 
position is broad and deep. In the top 100 metro areas today, we have 
about 100 MHz of spectrum deployed. This spectrum capacity helps us meet 
the tremendous demand that the new unlimited plans provide.
 
At the s
ame time, we have about 60 MHz of additional spectrum. We'll 
deploy all these bands simultaneously with the FirstNet build. As you know, 
the cost savings from touching the tower only once are significant.
 
Our evolution to 5G is underway. While 5G standards
 
are still being finalized, 
we're laying the foundation for tomorrow's faster wireless speeds today with 
5G Evolution.
 
We also completed a successful trial of LTE
-
LAA, reaching peak speeds of 
750 megabits. This is one of our first steps towards 5G and will
 
provide 
faster wireless speeds and an enhanced experience for our customers who 
use our LTE network.
 
We've already launched 5G Evolution in Austin and Indianapolis and expect 
to be available in more than 20 markets by year end. We also launched the 
second
 
fixed wireless trial using Millimeter Wave technology to deliver an 
ultra
-
fast 5G network experience to more locations in Austin. The trial 
participants can stream live TV on the DIRECTV NOW app and experience 
faster broadband services, all over a fixed w
ireless 5G signal.
 
By the end of 2017, we also expect to deploy LTE License Assisted Access 
and four
-
way carrier aggregation in areas of some 5G Evolution metros. LTE
-
LAA combines unlicensed spectrum with licensed spectrum through a carrier 
aggregation to 
increase network capacity, providing faster speeds and a 
better customer experience. We recently tested this technology in San 
Francisco, where we observed peak speeds of more than 750 megabits in a 
trial setting. We plan to expand LTE
-
LAA testing to addit
ional areas of San 
Francisco and Indianapolis in the coming weeks.
 
We continue to move software functions deeper into our network. This gives 
us incredible flexibility to change network functions almost instantly while 
providing better customer service and
 
driving cost efficiencies.
 
We've also embraced edge computing, which will drive low latency for 5G 
applications such as self
-
driving cars, augmented and virtual reality, robotic 
manufacturing, and much, much more. We're just scratching the surface 
here. C
ustomers demand a powerful network with a seamless integrated 
solution. This makes our integrated network a powerful advantage for us.
 
Now, I would like to update you on FirstNet, where we're really off to a fast 
start. That update is on slide 8. The timel
ine has been set and the opt
-
in 
process is underway. We delivered plans to each state last month. They can 
opt in at any time. Already, five states have said they're in, Arkansas, 
Kentucky, Iowa, Virginia, and Wyoming. And we are looking forward to 
announc
ing a number of additional states in the near future.
 
These states are anxious to get started, and so are we. They want the 
highest quality network available for their first responders as soon as they 
can get it, not to mention the investment and jobs crea
ted by our FirstNet 
builds. We continue with our discussions with the other states and territories 
in this initial 45
-
day review period for the states.
 
It will be followed by another 45
-
day response period for FirstNet to answer 
any questions or concerns t
he states may have. This will conclude by mid
-
September. Once that's completed, the official 90
-
day clock begins for states 
to make a decision. This is expected to start in mid
-
September, with final 
decisions due by mid
-
December.
 
Work on the FirstNet netwo
rk can begin once the state opts in, both 
hardware and software, and we're setting up a new business operation, 
sales, marketing, customer care, to serve these customers.
 
The advantage for the states that opt in quickly are many. First responder 
subscriber
s will have immediate access to AT&T's existing nationwide LTE 
network. Those subs will immediately receive quality of service and priority 
access to AT&T's $180 billion network. Those subscribers will also have 
preemption status on our network, which is e
xpected to be in place by the 
end of the year.
 
FirstNet and AT&T take on all of the financial requirements of the build. No 
additional financial resources from the states are required. All of this is a 
powerful incentive for states to opt in.
 
The FirstNet 
build will be an important event for the country, first 
responders, and the industry. We see this as a great opportunity for efficient 
expansion, not only by deploying 60 MHz of spectrum, but also by changing 
the curve of increasing tower costs. The build 
will require equipment 
installations and new towers. We've closely watched unit costs and have 
been focused on creating a diverse community of suppliers and tower 
companies to increase competition and reduce costs.
 
We're studying our options. We're looking
 
hard at new relationships. We're 
open to new or independent operators who may want AT&T as a customer 
and support a new model. The point is there's more than one way to get this 
work done, and we are committed to finding a way that meets the needs of 
our 
customers while keeping costs in line with industry economics.
 
So in summary, we had a very good quarter. Our teams are doing a great 
job of executing in a very competitive environment. Our cost containment 
efforts are paying off both in margins and earnin
gs, and we're off to a great 
start with FirstNet.
 
With that, Mike, I will turn it back to you for our Q&A.

Thank you. Our first question will come from Amir Rozwadowski with 
Barclays. Go ahead, please.

Hi, folks. John, I was wondering if we could chat a bit on the progress that 
you guys are seeing in bundling v
ideo and wireless. You folks saw a material 
reduction in postpaid phone
-
only churn. Is there any way to quantify how 
much benefit you've received from bundling DIRECTV NOW in those 
promotions?
 
John J. Stephens 
-
 
AT&T, Inc.
 
First of all, thanks for the ques
tion, Amir. I think the way to look at it, it's 
really as we displayed on slide five. You can see that overall reduction in the 
total postpaid phone churn, and you can see the dramatic improvement over 
the, if you will, two years since the merger. And in t
hose two years, another 
major activity that's gone on is dramatically increased competition, pricing 
that's somewhat challenging, people giving away service for a year free. So I 
think that slide, that presentation, shows it.
 
If you look up and see the det
ails that we provided or the details I provided 
in my comments, it's pretty clear this ability to bundle, whether it be TV 
Everywhere, whether it's DTV NOW, whether it's the ability to get all of your 
video on your phone is making a huge difference.
 
Amir R
ozwadowski 
-
 
Barclays Capital, Inc.
 
Excellent, that's very helpful, and then just a quick follow
-
up, if I may. How 
should we think about the different puts and takes on the opportunity set for 
continuing to expand your margins? We continue to see improveme
nt on 
wireless margins as a whole. It does seem as though there is an investment 
taking place on the video side with respect to DTV NOW, and then there is 
continued margin progress in the international operations. But if we think 
about the progress and the
 
capabilities going forward, can you walk us 
through the opportunity set you still see going forward?
 
John J. Stephens 
-
 
AT&T, Inc.
 
Sure, let me go through it this way. On a longer
-
term view, we're going to 
continue to see wireless revenue opportunities in
 
prepaid. We're going to 
continue to see them in connected devices. Quite frankly, for us we're going 
to continue to see real opportunity not only in the immediate future but over 
time in FirstNet and what it provides. So those will be very important. And 
quite frankly, when you have churn at these levels, if you can maintain it, 
it's a gift that keeps on giving with regard to revenues and margins.
 
Secondly, if we think about this movement to equipment installment plans, 
we've essentially gone through that 
process and have completed that, which 
had some changes in our service revenue metrics. We've made it through 
the vast majority of that. So then you go through the next process we're 
going through with this move to unlimited, and we certainly have been 
thr
ough the higher dollar amounts, if you will, on the customer base by that 
because our customers are smart and they move quickly. And so that's 
occurred.
 
Now we're going through the transition with more customers, some of which 
who are doing it and causing 
us, if you will, eliminating some of their 
overage cost, but some of those customers who are buying up into a little bit 
of a bigger package just don't have to worry about overages. So that 
conversion is well through, and we'd expect to see that complete o
ver the 
next year or so. So from a revenue perspective on a longer
-
term basis, we 
feel good.
 
On the wireless side on the expense piece of it, we still have a significant 
opportunity. From an overall perspective, we have about 40% of our 
network functions v
irtualized, both wireless and wireline. You've seen what's 
happened and the progress we've made in just getting from 34% to 40%, 
and we'd expect to get that to 55% by the end of this year and 75% or 
better by the time we complete. So there's more opportuni
ty with that as 
well as automation, digitization.
 
Quite frankly then, as you put all that together, from a total company 
perspective, our data insights opportunity, our advertising opportunities are 
significant. And quite frankly, as you saw this quarter, 
our international 
operations were getting through the investment cycle. It's gone as we 
expected. They're particularly in Mexico adding a great number of 
customers, but across Latin America also. So we're doing well. We just need 
to get through that proces
s, and those are the opportunities to see costs be 
managed very well and margins continue to grow.

Please go ahead.

Hey, guys. Thanks. John, maybe just a quick comment on the phone adds 

 
phone losses rather on the postpaid side, a bit better than we were 
expecting 
there. But I was just thinking about the feature phone base 
generally. Is there a level at which you think the pressures will start to 
subside in a much more meaningful way and we can drive towards positive 
phone adds?
 
And then maybe just a quick comment o
n the DIRECTV sub weakness you're 
seeing there. Obviously, you called out a few things. Where are those 
customers going? It seems like there's an investment in time and everything 
else to have the satellite put on the roof. Are these cord cutters, or are t
hey 
moving to a cable offering?
 
John J. Stephens 
-
 
AT&T, Inc.
 
So let me take the first. First of all, Mike, and I don't want to be stirring turf 
(28:56) here, but AT&T added contract phone customers for the quarter 
because our postpaid phone adds in Mexico
 
were positive 100,000 or more. 
And when you put those together with our domestic base, we were actually 
positive postpaid phone customers, just to clarify.
 
On the domestic side, we did see significant improvement sequentially and 
year over year, over 
about 250,000 improvement sequentially and about 
100,000 improvement in customer count year over year. And really we're 
seeing that from bundling of services and being able to put this video and 
other services together with it. So it's working well. As eve
ryone knows, you 
saw it in the churn numbers. And the best customer is the one you've 
already got and the one you can hang on to, and that's the most efficient.
 
With regard to feature phones, we are well through the process. I monitor, if 
you will, the per
centage which is in the mid
-
90s of phones that we sell every 
quarter that are smartphones. And it's in that mid
-
90% range. And then I 
compare that to our base. And over the last few years, we made significant 
progress in getting those numbers aligned.
 
So I
 
think we are getting close to the point where we are through that 
migration. It's not complete, but I would tell you we made significant 
improvements over the last few years. Because of that, we retain or have 
optimism going forward on the ability to show
 
some improving service 
revenues, and quite frankly, be able to continue to keep churn down 
because we have customers operating on smartphones and taking 
advantage of the quality service. So we feel good about that.
 
And yes, I think, maybe not now, but may
be in the next year or so, we 
should see a feature phone level that is much more constant and have 
gotten through this migration. I relate it in a similar way to what we're 
seeing on the consumer side with DSL broadband, where you've seen we 
made great str
ides converting to IP broadband and are getting to a point 
where we're dramatically through that conversion, which is optimistic for all 
of us.
 
On the sub weakness, as I said in the first quarter and will say again, we 
had a significant number, a higher nu
mber than normal, a higher number 
year over year of involuntary churn. And so we went through that process 
and decided to take action on those customers. That's one.
 
Two, we are seeing on an out
-
of
-
footprint basis where we don't have fiber, 
we're seeing su
b losses to competitors where they can bundle. We believe 
we're going to, if you will, arrest that or address that situation as we 
continue to build out fiber. And quite frankly, not only just the, if you will, 14 
million or so fiber
-
to
-
the
-
prem locations 
we'll get to, but as we mentioned, 
as we develop 5G wireless technologies that allows for efficient delivery of 
video over our wireless networks, we'll be able to compete in that 
environment like no one else on a nationwide basis.
 
Those are the two things 
I'd point out to you, Mike, on the sub weakness. I 
will point out we did have some good growth in DTV NOW, for the over
-
the
-
top product pretty much offset the DIRECTV satellite base wireless 
customers.

And, John, just r
eal quick on the NFL Sunday Ticket, obviously you're going 
to be coming up in the third quarter with NFL kicking off. Anything we can be 
expecting unique on the bundling with that particular product, whether it be 
with DIRECTV NOW or wireless or anything u
nique?

Hi, John. Thanks.

Hey, Phil.

First to follow up quickly, of the DTV NOW customers, how many of those 
are bundled with other products that you sell versus standalone? And are 
you reporting just paying customers, or is it all on the platform?
 
And then second
 
on FirstNet, with states that are opting in now, when could 
you start rolling out that new spectrum? And can you talk about the offer to 
public safety customers in those states? How do those compare to consumer 
prices? What should we be thinking about in 
terms of adds coming on as 
those FirstNet offers start to hit? Thanks.
 
John J. Stephens 
-
 
AT&T, Inc.
 
So the DTV NOW customer rates we're giving is paying customers that 
bundle with in many cases a large, large percentage of it, top of the head. 
But we 
can make sure we get that out appropriately in a post. But the vast 
majority of those are bundled with our wireless services. But as you know 
too, it gives us the opportunity. A significant amount of these, 50% or so are 
customers who have never had a payi
ng video product before or haven't had 
a pay
-
TV product, so we're getting the opportunity to not only provide them 
video but provide them wireless, in some cases broadband, apartment 
dwellers and others. But we're counting paying customers, not promo 
custo
mers.
 
Secondly, we will have the capability to roll out the spectrum once the states 
opt in. The challenge will be to get the plans finalized and to incorporate the 
final agreements with the states on coverage and towers and build
-
out and 
some of the negot
iated terms and make sure we have effective plans for 
those. But I would certainly expect that we will have the ability to start 
rolling out spectrum this year. Until the plans are complete, I don't want to 
predict what we'll have rolled out or how much. W
e'll certainly do that as 
soon as we're confident of it, but we'd expect to do that right away.
 
Secondly, I think the offers will be attractively priced because there will be 
large numbers of devices, not only phones but cameras and other connected 
devices
 
that add the ability for us to get good economics on good price 
points for fire departments, EMTs, police departments, and so forth.
 
But as much as that is very important to us, the opportunity to then utilize 
this as a footprint or a starting point to ge
t into smart cities, to be able to 
help these state, local municipal governments manage other parts of their 
activities are really important and provide us a great opportunity, as well as 
just the fact that the increased coverage that may be required by Fi
rstNet 
will provide us an increased opportunity to sell services to other customers, 
to provide other IoT services, or quite frankly, to reduce what might be 
minor amounts in the scheme of things but reduce whatever roaming costs 
we have left here on the d
omestic side. But I would expect the prices to be 
competitive, and certainly today's consumer prices qualify as such.

o John Hodulik with UBS. Please go ahead.
 
John C. Hodulik

UBS Securities LLC
 
Great, thank you. John, maybe first a quick question on the fall
-
off on the 
video side. How far through the involuntary churn on the DIRECTV satellite 
side do you think we are? 
And then with DIRECTV NOW, given the 
enhancements, the new content and the DVR, do you think you can get to a 
point where, given those two issues, you can start to see a blended video 
sub growth at some point? That's number one.
 
And then maybe longer term,
 
you guys have talked about a number of 
initiatives on this call, the spectrum deployment around 5G and FirstNet, 
edge computing, 14 million customer locations. And I know that SDN plays a 
role in this, but you spent $22 billion in CapEx it looked like thi
s year, last 
year. Can you do everything you're talking about doing within that budget, 
or should we expect spending to ramp as we exit the year? Thanks.
 
John J. Stephens 
-
 
AT&T, Inc.
 
First and foremost, yes, I'd expect we can do it within those kinds of l
evels. I 
don't want to give guidance outside of this year, but I don't want to signal in 
any way, shape, or form any significant changes in CapEx. I certainly believe 
we can.
 
I'll note to you that on the FirstNet side, there is a significant amount of 
effi
ciency that is achieved by doing this at once, all of the spectrum at once, 
all the tower climb, all the deployment and so forth. And then secondly, 
there's a significant co
-
pay from the FirstNet organization, $6.5 billion. So 
absolutely we're going to be 
in a position to do this.
 
With regard to the video involuntary churn, I would expect we'll see some of 
this through the remainder of the year, and we would expect that it would to 
start to ebb as we go through the year. But I would expect we'd have some 
of
 
it through the rest of the year. And certainly based on what the team has 
developed, what they've taken from customer insights and customer input, 
we believe that DTV NOW can certainly grow. And the cloud DVR and a lot of 
the other features that are comin
g out are in response to the studies the 
team has done with regard to what customers want and what would make 
the product better.
 
And so absolutely, we've grown 500,000 customers in seven months. It's 
pretty dramatic growth, particularly when we gave a cou
ple, three months 
rest there while we tested the platform and really put it through 
performance testing. So I think there's clearly a demand for it, an 
opportunity for it and for us that allows us to get to a lot of customers we 
don't normally serve today,
 
MDUs, millennials, people who haven't bought or 
haven't been able to have the creditworthiness to buy our premium 
products. So for us, it's a really attractive next step. Into the future the data 
insights that we'll be able to get and the ability to add a
dvertising and other 
sources of revenue off of this will make this profitable while still being able 
to give consumers great choice and great cost efficiency for them as well as 
a good product for us.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Simon Flannery with Morgan 
Stanley. Go ahead, please.
 
Simon Flannery

Great, thanks. Hi, John.
 
John J. Stephens

AT&T, Inc.
 
Hi, Simon.
 
Simon Flannery 
-
 
Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
 
On FirstNet, have you finalized how the accounting is going to work? You 
talked about the $6.5 billion co
-
pay. So how should we think about it? Is this 
is going to be grossed
-
up CapEx, how the puts and takes? I thi
nk you made 
some reference to a working capital impact maybe around the turn of the 
year. And then there were some media stories about potential org structures 
after the closing of Time Warner. Maybe you could just address that. Thank 
you.
 
John J. Stephens
 
-
 
AT&T, Inc.
 
So let me just say this on the org structures. Randall Stephenson is still the 
Chairman and CEO of AT&T, and I expect him to do that for a long time. I 
don't expect any changes there before or after the Time Warner merger. 
With regards to the
 
structure of the organization after Time Warner, I think 
Randall and Jeff Bewkes are going through that, working that process out. 
And I will definitely leave that to them I think to discuss. Oftentimes, stories 
are very premature. Those decisions are the
irs, and we'll leave it at that.
 
With regard to the FirstNet, what I expect that we would do is we would 
disclose the gross amount of CapEx we spend inclusive of FirstNet amounts, 
then show to the investment community the reimbursement amount that 
would be
 
recorded 

 
would be expected to be recorded as a, so to speak, 
contra
-
CapEx account or reducing the total amount because it's not a cash 
outflow. It will be a cash inflow to offset the expenses, the expenditures we 
made, but we would expect to get both of
 
that. Some amount of that $6.5 
billion will be allocated to expense, and that expense would go in the same 
way we would expect to disclose it, give full information about it, be 
transparent about it. And that would be, if you will, a contra
-
reduction in o
ur 
expense lines.
 
The customer count information and normal service revenues where we 
record like other customers, and then it's working out with regard to the 
accounting for the valuation of the licenses that we receive and the 
payments that we're require
d to make, the sustainability payments that 
we're required to make under the fund, and we're working through that. As 
you can imagine, this is a first of its kind public
-
private partnership, so we're 
working with our accounting firm to make sure we have cl
arity on that as we 
finalize numbers. We don't have those numbers finalized. We won't have 
those finalized until the state opt
-
in 

 
or state and territory opt
-
in process is 
complete. So before that time, the actual numbers that we're going to be 
using will
 
be still uncertain.
 
Simon Flannery 
-
 
Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
 
And did you mention some timing difference perhaps in the fourth quarter?
 
John J. Stephens 
-
 
AT&T, Inc.
 
So what I'd expect at this time, for example, we want to build a cell site and 
put up 
equipment and it costs us $500 and it's reimbursable from the 
FirstNet fund. We may finish that in month 11 and send a bill in the normal 
course, just normal processing. We don't get paid for that bill until month 
one of the next year or month two of the n
ext year. We don't know how that 
will work yet. We haven't been through that. FirstNet has been very 
cooperative. We're dealing with this. I'm just suggesting that those may not 
match up exactly. We just want to be transparent about that. I don't have 
any 
prediction that they won't, but just wanted to make sure that this is a 
case of first impression not only for AT&T but for the FirstNet administrators. 
So while we've got a great collaboration going on, it's not done yet, and so 
we want to be careful.

Thank you. Our next question is from Brett Feldman with Goldman Sachs. 
Please go ahead.
 
Brett Feldman 
-
 
Goldman Sachs & Co.
 
I'll go ahead and stick with the FirstNet theme. So thanks for taking
 
the 
question. You talked a lot about the timing around starting to build out the 
network. With states already opting in and with you making your existing 
network available to the states, when can you actually start marketing the 
product and bring customer
s online? Essentially what has to happen 
between opt
-
in and going to market? And do you have any estimate for what 
the addressable market of incremental customers to your business could be 
over time? Thanks.
 
John J. Stephens 
-
 
AT&T, Inc.
 
So we can start se
lling into the states. We started making those sales calls 
right now into the states that have opted in, and they certainly have an 
organization that was already set up, already ready to run, so to speak, fully 
prepared to go in our Business Solutions orga
nization, have a whole team 
ready to do that, and they've been working on it. So, if you will, those sales 
activities start now, and I will tell you the sales activities work with industry 
groups already. So that could involve already making contacts, meet
ings 
with sales pitches, maybe not specific proposals, but sales pitches to 
industry groups and departments across the country. So that's been a very 
active process.
 
If you will, we haven't given out any specific numbers. I would tell you the 
opportunity i
s not only in the millions of potential customers out there with 
fire, police, safety, and other departments, but also quite frankly for all the 
related uses and whether we utilize this for a friends
-
and
-
family opportunity, 
whether we utilize this to sell 
smart cities, whether we utilize this to go in. 
and where we have an improved network coverage and speed situation 
because of FirstNet, we go back in and double down on our sales efforts into 
the existing marketplace. That's what this provides. Whether onc
e we have a 
FirstNet build complete, what part of that build would be able to handle 
video. Does this extend our ability to do fixed
-
to
-
wireless local loop that 
we're already doing through the CAF II program and so on and so forth?
 
So I'm not giving any sp
ecific guidance, but I would suggest to you that it is 
real and it is something that we are excited about, specifically with regard to 
the police, fire, EMT, what I think people would most think about when they 
think about first responders. Now we do not h
ave a very large percentage of 
that market share. We certainly underserve it, just like years ago we 
underserved prepaid and we've had some great success with Cricket and 
AT&T Prepaid. Just like our DTV NOW product is getting us into being able to 
serve cu
stomers in the video space where we were very much underserved, 
FirstNet is going to provide a lot of opportunities for us, but one of them is 
to serve a market where today we are underrepresented and we believe we 
can do a great job for those folks.

Goldman Sachs & Co.
 
Just a quick follow
-
up question, are there any product bottlenecks? In other 
words, do you have devices you can offer now that support the new 
spectrum? Is that necessary? Or is this really as quickly as the opt
-
in states 
dec
ide they want to go with you, you can start lighting people up?
 
John J. Stephens 
-
 
AT&T, Inc.
 
Yes, there are devices that are ready today, but there will be new devices. 
The team has been working with the manufacturers. We work in partnership 
with Motorola
 
and others on developing new devices, new services, whether 
they be video
-
placed, camera location
-
based services, other, whether it be 
allowing for the devices to actually become report writers or, if you will, 
event reporting devices to allow the police 
officers to have more time on the 
street than back on the desk writing up reports, all of those things that 
we've been actively working on since the day we started this process, and 
we feel very optimistic about that. There are products today that we belie
ve 
we can use to serve. There will be a whole lot more products, a whole lot 
more products and equipment out there as time goes on.

Thank you. Our next question is from David Barden with Bank of America. 
Please go ahead.
 
David Barden

Bank of America Merrill Lynch
 
Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. John, a question on ARPU, it was 
a noisier than normal quarter with t
he full quarter effect of the unlimited 
plus whatever benefits you're getting from tailwinds there, seasonal forces, 
the EIP migration. But the net of it was it picked up, and we saw one of 
those last year in the second quarter. I was wondering if you can 
unpack the 
moving parts and what we should expect to see that number potentially do 
over the course of the year, given where we are.
 
And then the second, if I could, just a housekeeping item. I think, John, you 
called out two things, taxes and Brazil, as g
iving some tailwinds in the 
quarter that weren't normalized. If you could elaborate on those, that would 
be great. Thanks.
 
John J. Stephens 
-
 
AT&T, Inc.
 
So thanks, David. On Brazil, with regard to it, there was a Supreme Court 
ruling on a value
-
added tax m
atter that was not our case, but it was a case 
that we also had in front of them. It provided about 

 
right around $60 
million worth of benefit to us in the quarter. It's an item that we had been 
accruing and depositing cash for while we disputed it.
 
We no
w determined that we should win that case based of the Brazil 
Supreme Court ruling, and we booked that through the international LatAm 
results. We did not receive the cash for that. But it is an item we had been 
accruing for some time. And the, if you will
, expense pressures have been 
going through, some in 2017, but certainly the vast majority in prior years. 
So that was that call
-
out. That is really the major item. But in a company 
where you file 250,000 tax returns and you operate all across the planet, 
you've always got tax disputes going on, and sometimes they go in your 
favor and sometimes they don't. That is what we were trying to say and 
make sure we were just straightforward.
 
If you look at our effective tax rate on the income tax side, it's a littl
e bit 
low, but it's all good work. All the things have been working. We just had a 
couple of things come together with regard to working some things out with 
the taxing authorities, but we were just trying to be transparent with that.
 
David, with regard to
 
ARPU, let me try to go about it this way. First and 
foremost, the shift last quarter to unlimited had an immediate impact of 
impacting our overage revenues because the folks most impacted by 
overage were the ones quickest to go into the unlimited. We've g
ot smart 
customers. There were also some promotional activity impacts in both 
quarters. In this quarter, though, we're starting to see those immediate 
impacts slow down, and now we're starting to see we believe some of the 
customers, some of the customers 
buy up to have protection from overage 
charges. They may have been on a lower plan, but they now seem to want 
to buy up. Those are a couple of the moving parts.
 
I will also tell you we are continuing to get further and further towards 
completion of the equ
ipment installment plan process. I know we've been 
talking about that for three years now or more. But quite frankly, it isn't 
complete, but it's near complete, and so that completion helps us compared 
to the rest in the industry. On the other side, our th
ings like our insurance 
rate and insurance claim 

 
or insurance processes, we're participating in 
insurance programs, and some of the administrative charges have helped 
our ARPU as those things have improved or increased, so that side of it.
 
On the rest of
 
the service revenues, you'll see that we moved away from 
reseller, and you've seen that all year 

 
all this year but last year on our 
reseller counts. We have moved away from that, and that is having a 
pressure on the overall service revenues. Likewise, w
e've been having gains 
in prepaid throughout last year and this year, and that's helping with regard 
to total service revenues outside the ARPU discussion.

Thank you. Our next question is from Matthew Niknam with Deutsche Bank. 
Please go ahead.
 
Matthew Niknam 
-
 
Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
 
Hey, guys. Thank you for taking the questions, just two, if I could. One on 
enterprise, particularly on the 
fixed side, you called out weakness in 
investment and some technology transitions. Just wondering if you can 
comment on what you're seeing on both the macro and competitive front.
 
And then secondly on wireless upgrade rates, again you're at record lows. 
Ma
ybe, John, just wondering if this is more of the new normal, or whether 
you're expecting maybe a bigger pickup later in the year given some pent
-
up demand? Thanks.
 
John J. Stephens 
-
 
AT&T, Inc.
 
Sure. So on the upgrade rates, you're right. They were low. Th
ey've been 
low for the six months. For the full year, I would suggest to you, I would 
expect a pickup in the second half of the year as new devices come out. But 
I would tell you once 

 
and quite frankly, the longer we get through the 
equipment installment
 
plan cycle, the more we get back to a normal level 
where there are enough phones that are three, four 

 
whatever the term 
might be 

 
years old and need to be replaced, whereas in the first couple of 
years the phones were still new, and so customers weren'
t necessarily 
needing to do it.
 
Quite frankly, the transparency to customers with regard to what these 
things cost is impacting their decision
-
making. It's made it their pocketbook 
decision. While we would expect those to pick up in the second half of the 
year, and on overall basis, I wouldn't be surprised next year if it picks up 
from where it is today. But we would not expect it to go back to pre
-
equipment installment plan levels. I just wouldn't expect that to happen. For 
the rest of the year, prediction
s on what the rate would be would be 
inappropriate. We don't know how customers are going to take to the new 
devices, the new offerings and so forth, so we'll wait and see how that will 
come out.
 
I will tell you with regard to the new technology aspect, fo
ur
-
way carrier 
aggregation, the MIMO effect, some of the other things that we're doing with 
really upgrading our network and improving it, many of those can be taken 
advantage of with the new handsets. And so we are watching it carefully 
because we think t
hose customers are going to have an even better 
experience with the investments we've been making on our network.
 
With regard to enterprise, what we're seeing is a couple things. There are 
these annual contracts, whether they be Q3, some are a little bit l
onger. But 
as they come up for renewals, there's a step down in these traditional prices. 
So we've seen a lot of that with regard to voice. And so we're just taking it 
slow, and we're just going through that. That's one aspect of it. Two, we're 
able to com
pete. I don't see it as a losing to competition aspect, but it's just 
the new pricing levels. Three, we're seeing very little business fixed 
investment in this space that's generating demand for us or anyone else for 
that matter. And I think the government
's GDP programs, it's why we're so 
strong on tax reform. It's why we continue to push for tax reform because 
we think that will generate that investment and help us generate revenue on 
the top line.
 
Lastly, I will tell you that we continue to be very favor
ably received on the 
combination of our wireless and wireline at the business level, the ability to 
provide IoT devices and other wireless connections to employees, 
customers, engineers, HR departments, and so forth, to help them do their 
jobs, that we are
 
doing what I consider to be just a very good job of 
continuing to fight the fight and keep customers happy, keep them in their 
relationship with us, and driving cost out at the same time to actually grow 
margins. But it's a tough enterprise environment an
d it's a tough legacy 
environment. And the team's doing really well to shift that to those Strategic 
Services into wireless.

Thanks. Maybe back to the bundle, can you talk about how adding content 
he
lps upsell your bundle, I guess specifically the HBO upsell that you started 
in April? And any early thoughts on what Time Warner brings, any proof 
points as to what content does for the bundle, and perhaps next steps to the 
deal and sticking points on con
ditions? Thank you.
 
John J. Stephens 
-
 
AT&T, Inc.
 
On the Time Warner deal, I won't talk about any sticking points to the 
transaction. We'll leave that for another day or to when we get it approved. I 
will make this comment with regard to 

 
Time Warner has 
got great quality 
content. Everybody knows that. I think it's undisputed. And so that's going 
to be great for us to bundle with our products but also great for us to sell to 
others who may want to bundle their products.
 
With regard to HBO, quite frankly, c
ustomers like it. Customers like the 
opportunity to have that with their phone. So we're just trying to provide 
what customers want. I would suggest to you 

 
once again, I know this is 
simplistic, but the best proof we can give is the ability to look at th
at churn 
and see where that smartphone churn has gone, and knowing that a lot of 
that has to do particularly in this competitive environment. It's a very 
competitive environment, and why are people staying with us? I think in part 
it's because they like th
e ability to bundle, so we are seeing that quite well.

Thanks, guys. Thanks, John. It sounds like out of region you want to go with 
a quad
-
play wireless product, obviously with DIRECTV. Any sense h
ow long 
this might take? I know you've done a couple 5G trials, or maybe even can 
use LTE out of region. I know you said basically half the DIRECTV customers 
were not paying for TV before. Do you have a sense of maybe what 
percentage of the customers that 
are with DIRECTV NOW that are wireless
-
only?
 
John J. Stephens 
-
 
AT&T, Inc.
 
I don't know, so let me say this. You're hitting it right with the fact of the 
question of can we generally 

 
I don't want to be on an absolute basis, but 
generally on a national ba
sis, we use our wireless network starting with our 
LTE and LTE
-
LAA with carrier aggregation and so forth, can we provide a 
connection that would allow for sub (1:00:18) video transport? And we 
believe we can. The tests that we've done have shown that. Now 
those are 
just tests, they're trial markets, and we need to expand them. As you 
combine the FirstNet build with this, you get more opportunistic because 
you're going to be out in the network, and you can take advantage of that 
touches to do whatever else y
ou need to do to improve those capabilities.
 
Likewise, as we have talked about before, we are a big player in the CAF II 
funding, and are building a lot of that, and so there's a lot of other items to 
coordinate with FirstNet with our existing LTE network.
 
We have the 
technology developments with, if you will, 5G Millimeter Wave, but yes, we 
can. So that is, if you will, our goal to take this 14 million fiber
-
to
-
the

across the m
arketplace and be able to provide not only great wireless, but 
video and other services, mobile broadband and so forth.
 
Tim, if I could, I think this is near you. We just got word that New Jersey has 
now become the sixth state to opt in to the FirstNet. So
 
we continue the 
momentum, and I wanted to point that out while we're on the call.

Thanks, congratulations. Maybe lastly on the expense front, it looks like the 
trends have gone a little better on expense management.
 
And I think in the 
past, you guys have said when you get over 50% virtualization you can 
really start to see some of the expense benefits. Just maybe any color on 
your confidence 

 
basically because it sounds like you're sounding more 
confident on the abi
lity to 

 
virtualization to really reduce expenses?

Tim, we are confident. I think it's a large part the technology, our network 
guys, as well as our business operations guys, but we are seeing it. It's 
already happening. The issue with regard to 50% for me, Tim, is the math 
exercise that we've got most of 
the investment dollars behind us to get it to 
50%. So then we can see the compounding of the savings going forward 
because we've got so much already done, if you will, in the book, completed. 
And so it's easier to build on that, whereas today while the tea
m's doing a 
really good job getting it up to 34% at the end of last year, they were 
reinvesting to get there, and they're reinvesting money this year to get to 
50% 

 
55% by the end of the year. So it is absorbing some of the cost 
efficiencies. It's well wo
rth it, great investment. But once you get over that 
50% level, it becomes more of a pure 

 
the benefits will exceed any of that 
additional investment in a clearer picture.

Okay, Kathy. John, do you want to make some closing comments?

Folks, I appreciate everybody's time, and I want to thank you personally for 
being on the call today, just a few comme
nts before we go. It continues to 
be a highly competitive environment, but our cost containment efforts are 
paying off, and you've seen that in our margins and our earnings. The 
prudent management of our wireless business led to branded phone growth, 
recor
d low postpaid churn, and best
-
ever EBITDA margins.
 
We also posted solid year
-
over
-
year and sequential postpaid phone 
improvement, and we are really excited about the transformation of our 
broadband business and the inroads DTV is making as well as the 
dev
elopments in our international businesses. Our strategic moves with Time 
Warner and FirstNet along with these quality current assets, employees, and 
customers that we already have are separating ourselves from our 
competitors and positioning AT&T for the f
uture, so we're very excited about 
what's yet to come.
 
Lastly, one last thought before we go. As you make your way home tonight, 
please remember, no text is worth a life. It can wait.
 
Thanks again for being on the call and thanks for your interest in AT&T 
and 
good night.

Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the AT&T 
third quarter 2017 earnings call. At this time, all lines are in a listen
-
only 
mode. Later, we will conduct a question
-
and
-
answer session. Instructions 
will be given at 
that time. And as a reminder, this conference is being 
recorded.
 
I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Michael Viola, 
Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.

Okay, thank you, Kathy,
 
and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to our 
third quarter conference call. I'm Mike Viola, Head of Investor Relations for 
AT&T. Joining me on the call today is John Stephens, AT&T's Chief Financial 
Officer. John is going to cover the third quarter result
s and then provide 
several business update. And we'll follow that with Q&A.
 
As always, our earnings materials are available on the Investor Relations 
page of the AT&T website. That includes our news release, our 8
-
K, investor 
briefing, associated schedules
.
 
Now before we begin, I'd like to call your attention our Safe Harbor 
statement. That's on slide 2. The Safe Harbor statement says some of the 
comments today may be forward
-
looking. As such, they're subject to risks 
and uncertainties. Results may differ m
aterially, and additional information 
is always available on the Investor Relations website.
 
And so with that, I now would like to turn the call over to AT&T's CFO, John 
Stephens.

Thanks, Mike, and thanks for everyone for join
ing us on the call today. Our 
financial summary is on slide 3.
 
Before we get to the results, this was an unprecedented quarter when it 
comes to natural disasters. Hurricanes pounded Texas and Florida and 
caused historic damage to Puerto Rico and the U.S. V
irgin Islands, and 
earthquakes and storms devastated Mexico. Our hearts go out to all those 
that are impacted. Our team has coordinated with federal, state, and local 
officials to maintain and restore service throughout the impacted areas. I've 
heard some 
remarkable stories about the lengths our employees went to, 
not only to restore service, but also just to help others. Our legacy of service 
spans more than 140 years at this company, and it's being kept alive by 
dedicated employees dealing with situations
 
like this. Senior management 
just wants to make a special thanks to all our employees for what they've 
done through these challenging times.
 
Now turning to our results, we've once again included both a quarterly and a 
year
-
to
-
date view to give you a more 
complete perspective. We continue to 
track well against our full
-
year guidance, and we continue to invest for the 
growth of our business and remain focused and optimistic about our long
-
term opportunities. After adjustments, third quarter EPS was $0.74, st
able 
with last year and up more than 4% year to date. The adjustments include 
the impact of higher interest expense for the pre
-
funding of our Time Warner 
transaction and storm
-
related costs.
 
Revenues continue to be pressured by slow equipment sales and wh
at were 
legacy services. We've had about 2 million fewer phone upgrades so far this 
year when compared to a year ago. That has a big impact on revenue but 
also reduces expenses. But year to date, adjusted consolidated operating 
margins were up 80 basis poi
nts over last year and third quarter margins 
were stable year over year, thanks to record margins for Mobility and solid 
performance from our Business Solutions group.
 
Cash flow also continues at a very strong pace. Cash from operations is up 
for both the 
quarter and year to date. That's helping us handle increased 
capital spending so far this year. Capital spending was $5.3 billion for the 
quarter and $16.5 billion year to date. Free cash flow was $5.9 billion in the 
quarter, or up more than 13% year over 
year. That's one of our highest 
quarters ever and provides ample support for our attractive dividend. It's 
even stronger when you consider the impact of FirstNet on free cash flow. 
Year to date, we've invested more than $200 million in FirstNet, with 
reimb
ursement for most of that to be received in the coming months.
 
Now let's take a look at our operations, starting with Mobility. Those details 
are on slide 4. As a reminder, AT&T's domestic Mobility operations are 
divided between the Business Solutions and 
Consumer Wireless segments. 
For comparison purposes, the company also is providing supplemental 
information for its total U.S. wireless operations.
 
Mobility turned in another great quarter, as we continue to execute 
efficiently and effectively while increa
sing the number of customers on 
mobile with video bundles. Margins continue to come in at record levels, 
helped in part by excellent cost management. We had our best
-
ever EBITDA 
margin of 42%, and service margin was also a record at 50.4%.
 
Postpaid phone c
hurn set another record for the third quarter at 0.84%, and 
we continue to add branded phones and increase our smartphone base. 
Revenue was impacted by fewer equipment sales. Customers are holding on 
to their phones longer, and others are bringing their ow
n device, which 
shows our plans are providing customers the choices they want. Service 
revenue continues to be impacted by customers choosing unlimited plans 
and eliminating overage charges as well as some lower resale revenues.
 
While it's easy to get caug
ht up in the day
-
to
-
day noise in the wireless 
marketplace, look at the bar charts where we show a two
-
year view of our 
Mobility operating statistics. During that time, our postpaid smartphone base 
is increasing, up by more than 1.5 million customers. And o
ur prepaid phone 
base has the highest growth rate in the industry. We added 3.5 million new 
prepaid phone subscribers in the last two years.
 
Branded smartphones are our most valuable customers, and we've increased 
that base by about 6 million in the last t
wo years. We've also lowered churn 
in that time, setting record low postpaid phone churn levels quarter in and 
quarter out. As you take a look on the lower right where we show historical 
service revenue for the four largest carriers, we've not only held ou
r own 
when it comes to industry service revenue share during the last two years, 
we've increased it. And we've been very successful in convincing our feature 
phone customers to move to higher ARPU smartphones.
 
So in the last few years, as wireless companie
s have intensely battled for 
market share, we've grown our smartphone base, expanded margins to 
record levels, reduced churn, and grown our share of wireless industry 
service revenues. We're well positioned to compete and respond to 
customers' needs for th
e long term.
 
Now let's move to our Entertainment Group. The results are on slide 5. You 
know the headlines of our Entertainment Group from our 8
-
K filed earlier 
this month. Revenues were slightly down. Growth in IP, video service, and 
advertising revenues 
offset most of the legacy voice declines. But margins 
were under pressure in the quarter. Increased content costs, promotional 
activity, and video platform expenses impacted results. Management's 
decision to tighten our credit policy and focus on overdue a
ccounts impacted 
customer counts. That and the losses from severe storms explain nearly half 
of our traditional TV decline. While these efforts are impacting customer 
counts, these steps are the right long
-
term approach for the business.
 
Even with these im
pacts, we expect a net addition to our total video 
customer base in the fourth quarter, with improvement coming from linear 
TV. While we continue to work to improve our linear video, we are very 
encouraged by the rapid deployment of our DTV NOW offering. W
e added 
nearly 300,000 DIRECTV NOW customers in the third quarter and have 
nearly 800,000 subscribers in total. That's incredible scale in less than a 
year of operation, and we expect that growth to continue. And most of those 
customers are new to our TV s
ervice, new to AT&T, about 700,000.
 
We continue to evolve our video model at this time. We've kicked off our 
beta trial for the next
-
generation software platform. This will enhance ARPU 
and margins and include additional functionality, such as cloud DVR, 
a
dditional streams, pay
-
per
-
view movies and events. We expect to launch 
this new platform widely in early 2018.
 
We also have another revenue opportunity with targeted ads. We're very 
committed to building a data Insights business, which takes our scale and 
resources to give our customers and ourselves a very competitive targeted 
opportunity. In fact, we established a new organization and brought in Brian 
Lesser, one of the top minds in the advertising business, to help us build this 
business.
 
And DIRECTV NOW
 
is only getting better. We've added live local channels in 
more than 75 markets, with more than 30% of the country now receiving all 
four of the major networks. And customer acquisition costs are a fraction of 
a traditional TV gross add. And while we incr
ease our capabilities and ad 
reach even more, there will be some twists and turns along the way in this 
evolution, but we're confident in the direction we're heading.
 
At the same time, consistent with the original DTV merger plan, we're 
having success with
 
our integrated offers. Our sales channels are great at 
coordinating bundled sales. Despite traditional video losses, we grew both 
the number of TV
-
and
-
wireless and TV
-
and
-
broadband customers. The 
number of TV
-
and
-
wireless bundles have grown by 20% since t
he DTV deal 
closed. Those 6.5 million video customers represent more than 20 million of 
our wireless postpaid subs. We only have about a quarter of the video base 
in these bundles, so we see considerable opportunity in our future. And that 
is significant b
ecause the churn rate of our DIRECTV homes who also have 
wireless is nearly half that of the standalone satellite subscribers, and it's 
about 30% lower when we bundle with IP broadband. And as you've seen 
previously, this is impacting our record low wirele
ss postpaid phone churn as 
well.
 
We also had another solid quarter of broadband growth. Total broadband 
subscribers grew for the fourth straight quarter. We also added 125,000 IP 
broadband subscribers in the quarter and nearly 600,000 in the last year. 
Eve
n more exciting are our plans to step up our high
-
speed Internet 
deployment and reach more than 50 million customer locations with 
competitive broadband speeds over the next few years. This includes our 
previously announced plan to reach 14 million custome
r locations with fiber
-
to
-
the
-
prem, our existing VDSL footprint, where we offer speeds of at least 
50 megabits or higher, and the existing 8 million businesses who are either 
using or within 1,000 feet of existing fiber capabilities.
 
But it also includes a
 
planned high
-
speed 5G deployment on a national basis, 
capitalizing on our dense fiber footprint across the country. This will make us 
one of the country's largest, if not the largest, high
-
speed Internet service 
provider, with more than half of those loca
tions seeing near
-
gigabit speeds 
and strengthening our nationwide wireless and video bundles even more. 
We're seeing the impact of faster Internet speeds already. Penetration rates 
in markets where we have offered fiber for more than 24 months are 
approach
ing 50%, so we see a healthy growth opportunity developing there.
 
Now, let's look at Business Solutions results on slide six. Structural changes 
in the Business Solutions segment are impacting results, as we continue to 
make gains in margins even as we 
deal with legacy revenue pressures. 
Wireline revenues were down, as gains in strategic services helped offset 
some of the declines in legacy voice. Lower equipment revenues also 
pressured results. But we continue to drive hard on cost management 
initiative
s while increasing the percent of revenues that come from wireless, 
and those two things together are driving higher margins.
 
EBITDA for the quarter was stable at $6.8 billion, with EBITDA margin 
improving by 150 basis points. Our move to software
-
defined 
networking is 
making an incredible difference with our cost efforts. About 45% of our 
network functions were virtualized at the end of the third quarter, and we're 
on track to reach 55% by the end of this year, with a longer
-
term goal of 
75% or more.
 
Movin
g to our international business at the bottom of slide 6, we saw solid 
growth across our operations. Revenues were up nearly 12%, as both Latin 
America and Mexico showed gains. EBITDA did decline year over year, due 
primarily to additional customer acquisi
tion expenses in Mexico and foreign 
exchange impacts in our DTV Latin America operations.
 
In Mexico, revenue grew both sequentially and year over year. Revenues 
were up almost 27% year over year. We continue to add subscribers in 
Mexico, about 700,000 new 
customers in the quarter, with a total 
approaching 14 million customers in service. We were able to accomplish 
this at a very difficult time for Mexico. The earthquake devastated parts of 
the country and some of our operations. We do expect fourth quarter 
sales 
to be strong and so forth to pressure 

 
have some impact on margins. But 
we also expect to turn the corner with positive EBITDA in the next few 
quarters. At the same time, our Latin American satellite operations continue 
to be profitable. Revenues we
re up about 5%. Revenues were up more than 
12% if you back out the impact of foreign exchange.
 
Let's now move to our business update on slide 7. First, we continue to 
expect to close the Time Warner deal by the end of the year. Brazil 
regulatory authoritie
s have approved the deal, with approval from the 
Department of Justice the last step. The financing is set, and we're ready to 
close once we receive DOJ approval. And once the deal closes, we plan to file 
pro forma financial statements. These will include 
detail on intangible 
amortization, deferred production cost, and the impact of inter
-
segment 
eliminations. In the meantime, Time Warner continues to perform well, even 
better than our expectation. That's a tribute to Time Warner's management 
team and the q
uality of that overall company.
 
Next, the FirstNet opt
-
in process is underway. We've had a tremendous 
response so far. Already, 27 states and territories have opted in, and we are 
just a month into the 90
-
day opt
-
in window. The deadline for opting in is 
De
cember 28. States that don't take action by that time will be automatically 
opted in. We expect to hit the ground running and issue work orders in 
January after the opt
-
in period closes. We've already committed more than 
$200 million in capital to the proj
ect in preparation for its start.
 
Third, in anticipation of the Time Warner deal closing, we have reorganized 
our business. We're streamlining our corporate functions and pushing costs 
directly to the business units to drive efficiencies and respond more q
uickly 
to customers' needs. And we've established a new advertising and analytics 
organization to enhance our overall business opportunities.
 
We also continue to review our portfolio of assets. We're always evaluating 
opportunities to monetize non
-
core ass
ets such as real estate. We continue 
to have great optionality with our international portfolio and has been our 
practice for years. We manage our spectrum portfolio, adding to and 
divesting when the right opportunities develop.
 
The recent storms showed ho
w well our network performs in challenging 
situations and bodes well for FirstNet. Our employees made heroic efforts to 
get cell towers operating virtually overnight, clear central offices, and 
restore services to literally millions of people. We've been t
hrough a lot of 
challenges, but I've never seen our teams work as hard to maintain and 
restore our vital services for our customers.
 
And while much of the media attention was focused on the U.S. mainland, 
the damage caused by hurricanes in Puerto Rico and 
the U.S. Virgin Islands 
was unprecedented, and so was our response. Recovery is progressing, with 
additional equipment arriving daily. We are seeing traffic grow daily on our 
network as service is restored. We currently have wireless services to about 
two
-
thirds of our customers in Puerto Rico and 93% of our customers in the 
U.S. Virgin Islands, with daily call volumes now nearing three
-
fourths of the 
level of pre
-
storm activity.
 
We're doing whatever it takes to reconnect customers; working with 
authorities
, competitors, and even new experimental ways of providing 
service. It's still a long road ahead for the people of Puerto Rico, but we plan 
to be there every step of the way. Sometimes an opportunity comes from 
difficult events, and that is how we are seei
ng our rebuilding efforts. This will 
be an opportunity to review our build plans and potentially replace older 
infrastructure with the latest technology. This will provide a more resilient 
network with more speed and capabilities for customers.
 
Moving to r
egulatory and tax reform, as you know, we're always keeping an 
eye on what's happening in Washington. We see a change in the mindset 
across DC in promoting lighter
-
touch regulation and pro
-
growth initiatives. 
We think this is incredibly positive for our co
untry and could catalyze the 
economic growth we're looking for and the country desperately needs. The 
regulatory authorities have led the way with several positive moves. 
Controversial rules around business data services and set
-
top box 
regulations are off
 
the table in support of the repeal of data privacy rules 
that apply only to ISPs and not other Internet companies. And there are 
hopeful signs that the FCC is going to reverse its controversial decision to 
extend the 83
-
year
-
old Title II regime to broadba
nd services.
 
At the same time, we continue to be strong advocates for tax reform. The 
United States is not competitive with the world when it comes to the tax rate 
American companies pay, which is encouraging the placement of investment 
and jobs outside th
e U.S. We have the highest corporate tax rate in the 
developed world, and this is a once
-
in
-
a
-
generation opportunity to level the 
playing field for American workers and the businesses that employ them. If 
we can get this right, we not only help U.S. busine
sses compete globally, but 
it will drive greater investment and job creation here at home. It should shift 
investment to the U.S. and help generate revenue growth for U.S. service 
providers. This is the key to driving greater productivity and GDP growth.
 
T
ax reform is the catalyst we need to spur investment. AT&T already invests 
more in the United States than any other public company, but we're ready to 
invest even more if tax reform becomes law. This is an opportunity that we 
can't let slip through our fin
gers. Recent developments are very 
encouraging, and we'll continue to work with Congress on this as well as add 
our voice to the business community supporting tax reform.
 
Now before we go to your questions, let's look at a quick recap of the 
quarter on sli
de 8. Obviously, it was another full quarter for AT&T. We have 
a lot going on in our business, but we are on track with all of our full
-
year 
guidance. Adjusted earnings and operating margins were stable, even as we 
dealt with pressures from legacy services
 
and the Entertainment group. Cash 
flow continued at robust levels, including nearly 13% year
-
over
-
year growth 
in third quarter free cash flow. And our team is doing an incredible job 
handling the impact from natural disasters. Our Mobility group continues
 
to 
turn in record EBITDA margins and the lowest
-
ever phone churn while 
growing our postpaid smartphone and branded phone base. And at the same 
time, our broadband business is showing growing momentum, and we're on 
track to deploy one of the largest high
-
s
peed Internet footprints in the 
country.
 
The video model is evolving, and we are very encouraged by the rapid 
deployment of our DTV NOW product. Our bundling strategy is working and 
gives us a unique value
-
creating opportunity. Our continued success with 
t
argeted data analytics and advertising is another positive sign. And with the 
closing of our Time Warner deal, we will gain significant scale in that 
business to build out new and innovative platforms and services. And we are 
very pleased with the momentum
 
the FirstNet process is showing. We look 
forward to completing the state opt
-
in process at the end of this year.
 
We have a lot of work to do as we close this year and prepare for 2018. 
There are always challenges in our business, but we remain optimistic 
not 
only for the future, but also very confident that we will get this job done.
 
With that, Mike, I will turn it back to you for Q&A.

A
ll right, thank you. Our first question will come from John Hodulik with 
UBS. Go ahead, please.
 
John C. Hodulik

Great, thanks, a couple of questions on the wireless market. First, John, 
service revenues have been accelerating 

 
or the 
decline has been 
accelerating for the last couple of quarters, but the sub trends have 
improved a bit. Can you talk a little bit about whether we should expect to 
see that line stabilize 

 
the service revenues that is? And then talk a little bit 
about the 
competitive environment here in wireless as we head into the 
iPhone X launch. Do you think that's going to drive volumes and drive more 
promotions? Just what you're seeing in the market would be great. Thanks.
 
John J. Stephens 
-
 
AT&T, Inc.
 
So, John, let me
 
take the first question. First of all when we came out with 
Unlimited 

 
when Unlimited came out in the plans, we've got really smart 
customers, very direct, very simply we have real smart customers. Those 
that had overages quickly went to the Unlimited, a
nd that's what generated 
some of the service revenue pressure. It's also generated high satisfaction 
and low churn, but it did generate some of the service revenue pressure. 
What we're also expecting is that some of the customers on some less 
expensive buc
keted plans will buy up to the Unlimited plans and generate 
some revenue increases for those customers for us. That will come over time 
as data usage increases, as the capabilities of our network continue to 
improve and as well as customers use them. So we
 
would expect that step
-
up and customer count step
-
ups to help service revenues going forward.
 
Secondly, as you've seen in our reseller business, we have chosen not to 
pursue some reseller accounts and to make sure we kept capacity available 
for our busine
ss. It was a better use of it for our smartphone customers than 
for reseller customers. And so we saw some pressure this year from reseller 
revenues. We'd expect that to ebb as we go into 2018 and improve. So from 
both those perspectives, there's some opti
mism on service revenues and 
changing in that trend.
 
With regard to the competitive environment, so far we've seen some rational 
activity through the iPhone 8 launch and most recently the activities that are 
going on, so we're optimistic. We're 
certainly ready. And as you can see, our 
margins are very solid and the performance has been great. But we believe 
we can compete and win based on our product offerings and that 
promotional activity of an extensive nature is not necessary.

Thank you. Our next question is from Phil Cusick with JPMorgan. Please go 
ahead.
 
Philip A. Cusick 
-
 
JPMorgan Securities LLC
 
Hi, John. Thanks. I 
wonder if we can talk about the video strategy. First, I 
guess the comment that traditional TV will improve in the fourth quarter, is 
that from typical seasonality, or do you plan to promote even more 
aggressively? Because it seems like you guys have been 
pretty aggressive 
for the last few months.
 
John J. Stephens 
-
 
AT&T, Inc.
 
So based on what we see in the marketplace, what our marketing studies 
tell us, it's also based on getting through the losses. About half the losses, 
or just under half the losses thi
s quarter were from involuntary churn 
because we tightened our credit policies. They were from the storms and the 
customers that we lost because of the storms that we just did not 

 
that we 
took off the rolls, because those houses were gone and so forth. A
nd also 
because on the gross add basis, when we tightened credit policy, we shifted 
some of those gross adds towards DTV NOW as opposed to the linear. We 
see those impacts easing in the fourth quarter, as we also see some 
opportunities to grow the net add 
numbers 

 
or improve, I should say, the 
net add numbers.
 
I wouldn't suggest it's from a significant change or movement in our 
competitive process or offerings or promotions. It's just what we are seeing 
in the marketplace. As I say, one of the key things i
s that the unusual or 
high nature of this quarter's losses had to do with some management 
decisions with regard to credit metrics and cleaning up some involuntary 
churn matters.
 
Philip A. Cusick 
-
 
JPMorgan Securities LLC
 
Okay. And then if I can follow up, 
maybe the DIRECTV NOW side, how many 
of the new customers came in on that $10 add
-
in? I was surprised that 
700,000 of those customers are new to AT&T. And so that would indicate 
that it didn't impact churn that much. So has this been more of a gross add 
en
gine than a retention engine?
 
John J. Stephens 
-
 
AT&T, Inc.
 
It has been more of a gross add engine, more than 

 
I don't think we're 
giving out details, but I'll say this. More than half of those customers, for 
example, are not bundled with our wireless ser
vice. That's a real opportunity 
for us going forward, but they're not as of today. And I think 700,000 of the 
800,000 are new, what I would call new to AT&T, so this is definitely that 
opportunity.
 
We think as we look at it, of the customers that we have c
oming in, about 
half of them come from our competitors, switching off a paid TV service from 
our competitors. The other half 

 
10% or so come from ourselves, migrating 
from one of our services, U
-
verse or DTV. But the rest of it are cord
-
nevers 
or the MDU 
news (30:29), just a variety of opportunities that we had not 
previously tapped into.
 
I would suggest to you, though, going forward, we may more assertively 
utilize this for calls into our call centers for the full DTV. For those customers 
of a certain cre
dit quality, we might look to push them or move them 
towards DTV NOW, just like we've done in the past with our successful 
offering of prepay, where we've looked to make sure that we have value
-
conscious customer offerings in both wireless on the prepaid s
ide and in the 
DTV NOW offering on the video side.
 
Philip A. Cusick 
-
 
JPMorgan Securities LLC
 
Okay, so you're seeing customers call up for existing DTV customers and 
moving to NOW, but that's only about 10% of NOW.
 
John J. Stephens 
-
 
AT&T, Inc.
 
Not extensi
vely. You're right, what you just said is right generally. 10% of 
those customers we don't think of as a significant level at this current time. 
But yes, it was about 10% or so.
 
Philip A. Cusick

JPMorgan Securities LLC
 
Okay. Thanks, John.
 
John J. Stephen

Thank you. Our next question is from Amir Rozwadowski with Barclays 
Capital. Please go ahead.
 
Amir Rozwadowski 
-
 
Barclays Capital, Inc.
 
Thank you very much. John, I wonder if we can continue on discussing the 
video business a bit. If we think about the margin pressure we've seen on a 
year
-
over
-
year basis, one would assume that's due to some of the 
traditional video offers that you mentione
d, and also the transition 
increasingly to an OTT
-
centric business model. How should we think about 
the margin trajectory for the business going forward? You had mentioned 
that there are some new service launches going forward, the opportunity set 
around a
dvertising, so I would love to hear your thoughts around that.
 
John J. Stephens 
-
 
AT&T, Inc.
 
So on a long
-
term basis, when we come out with the new platform early in 
2018, think about the opportunity on DTV NOW to get pay
-
per
-
view events, 
whether they be m
ovies or some of the other events that are out there. 
Think about being able to provide features like cloud DVR, additional 
streams. And with all those opportunities go additional opportunities to raise 
revenues, and revenues that customers would be willin
g to pay for and 
improve the quality of the service. That gives us 

 
that's how we're thinking 
about it long term.
 
In addition, the ability to get the data insights, to learn about what 
customers are watching, what's necessary, will help us put together ne
w 
packages and packages more directed towards what customers 
-
we think 
that will help us take market share and also help improve the financial 
results as we structure those packages.
 
And then third, all those data insights, whether it's information we take
 
to 
improve our own marketing, we have a large marketing budget here. And if 
we could take that data insight and get that information and make it more 
effective, that's a huge opportunity for us for a company of our size, as well 
as selling digital ad inse
rtion and doing digital advertising on the DTV NOW 
platform in selected situations. We believe that that is an opportunity.
 
So those are all the things that we look to as we, more importantly, build 
this platform and get the volume base of this platform up
 
as we approach 

 
approaching 1 million customers here, as we close out the quarter 800,000, 
and then building on that and having the scale to effectively do these other 
things. That's how we're thinking about it on a long
-
term basis.
 
I will tell you the q
uarter 

 
your comment, Amir, on the video losses did 
affect the margins for the quarter is correct. The NFL coming out on a 
sequential basis, this being the NFL season, affects them. But I can also tell 
you we continue to spend money on platforms and impro
vement of the DTV 
NOW as well as our other activities. And so that as well as promotional 
activities also had an impact on margins, just to complete that story.
 
Amir Rozwadowski 
-
 
Barclays Capital, Inc.
 
That's helpful, and then one question on the mobile s
ide of the business. If 
we look at your year
-
over
-
year declines in phone
-
only net adds are easing, 
how should we think about the prospects for returning to growth, 
particularly as your smartphone base continues to expand?
 
John J. Stephens 
-
 
AT&T, Inc.
 
So o
n postpaid, we're growing customer base. If you look at postpaid 
phones, if you take out the feature phone losses, we're essentially at flat or 
slight growth. So if you think about it from that way, we believe that we are 
getting to that turning point when
 
you 

 
the reason for the slide that shows 
that 92% of our phones are smartphones comes down to the fact that our 
flow share on smartphones versus feature phones is about 95%. That 
differential used to be about 10 percentage points or 1,000 basis points. I
t's 
down to about 300 or 3%, so we're getting to that point. That leaves us 

 
provides us great optimism about the health of the business and about 
moving it forward. And when you put on top of that the margins we're 
seeing, we're really encouraged.
 
The bu
ndling strategy, the video bundling with DTV is working, and we'll 
continue to use good judgment in providing customers what they want. But 
that's how I think about the mobile business. It's really quite stunning 
results when you think about EBITDA margins
, EBITDA service margins, 
churn. It's really quite encouraging.

Thanks a lot, good afternoon. John, can you talk a little bit about 5G in more 
detail? You've got a number of trials going on. It looks like you're basically 
committing to a nationwide rollout
 
here. So how are the trial results going, 
and how should we think about the shape of your deployment 2018, 2019, 
and 2020? It looks like you're increasing your locations, the high
-
speed 
locations 20 million, 8 million of those come from fiber. The balance
 
of 12 
million is I guess a mix of some of the things you describe, but it seems like 
5G is going to be a big part of that. So talk us through what we've seen so 
far that gives you the confidence. And then what's the shape of that and the 
investment over t
he next couple of years? Thanks.
 
John J. Stephens 
-
 
AT&T, Inc.
 
So we've done a couple of test overlays 

 
more than a couple, a large 
number. We used LTE
-
LAA and other capabilities in our network out in San 
Francisco and got 750
-
meg speeds on the tests we d
id out there. Even if you 
take 10% of that to be normal fully loaded network speeds, you'd still have 
75
-
meg speeds. We think that's pretty tremendous. We did a testing in 
Austin too, one in the same base where we combined carrier aggregation, 
MIMO, I thin
k we used LTE
-
LAA there. And when we did that, we had 
phenomenal speeds, even I think as good if not better than we had in San 
Francisco. In addition, we did a millimeter wave, 28
-
gig millimeter wave test 
there and got a point
-
to
-
point test over 1
-
gig spee
d. So all of these things 
are things that the network team has already done, they've already been 
successful with.
 
Based on the tests that we ran in Austin and San Francisco, we're deploying 
out to 20 cities right now. We hope to have them done by the end 
of the 
year, near the end of the year. These capabilities with carrier aggregation, 
LTE
-
LAA, and MIMO capabilities, and with those we are optimistic that we're 
going to get flow
-
through speeds that could cap 400 megs even by the end 
of the year and with th
at, on a fully loaded market, use a lower percentage. 
But those things are going on now. When you take those plans out a few 
years, we have a plan to hit the largest 30 cities with that capability. That 
5G capability will overlap some of the, if you will, 
IP fiber
-
based services we 
have. So we didn't want to double count, so those numbers are overlapping, 
but it will be very great.
 
When you talk about 5G from a millimeter wave perspective, we expect to 
continue testing that as we have in Austin and other pl
aces. I think everyone 
is aware we've got a transaction waiting for approval in front of the FCC on 
the significant holdings of a 39
-
gigahertz millimeter wave spectrum. We're 
moving forward on that. We expect the standards to be out in 2019 and 
equipment t
o be out. Following that, that is one that we will be one of the 
leaders on, and it will be in addition or in connection with the cities build
-
out 
that I just described. So I hope that gives you a sense of why we're so 
comfortable with putting that in grea
ter than 50 million locations. Some of 
them will be served with both wireless or fiber
-
to
-
the
-
prem or fiber
-
to
-
the
-
business. But we are confident that in total, counting each of the locations 
only once, we'll have over 50 million.
 
Simon Flannery

Morgan S
tanley & Co. LLC
 
Okay. And so you have you proved out the business model on the millimeter 
wave yet, or is that still something you still need to work through?
 
John J. Stephens 
-
 
AT&T, Inc.
 
I'll say it this way. I think we proved out the business 
model that businesses 
need speed and capacity. That's been proven out. We need to do more 
specifically with the 39
-
gigahertz build
-
out. But from what we've learned in 
our Austin trial, we're optimistic that it will work out. Now remember, we 
have extensive
 
fiber throughout the country, not only in our local exchange, 
our traditional service areas, where we have extensive fiber, fiber into 
neighborhoods, fiber nodes, fiber to businesses. But even on a national 
footprint, we have extensive fiber because of ou
r legacy companies. And so 
we have a unique benefit compared to many others as we build out a 
wireless IP capability. Others do not have the ability to rely on the built
-
in 
fiber holdings that we have, and I think that's a unique advantage. We will 
continu
e to modify and adjust the build plans and the product offerings as 
customers direct us, but we're confident we're going to be able to do this in 
a very profitable way.

Thank you. Our next question is from Vijay Jayant with Evercore ISI. Please 
go ahead.
 
James Ratcliffe 
-
 
Evercore Group LLC
 
Good afternoon, it's James Ratcliffe for Vijay., two if I could. First of all on 
targeted advertising, I under
stand in theory how you would target ads in the 
platforms you control. Can you talk about what the opportunity to target ads 
or improve CPMs is on the portion of TWX viewing that doesn't come over 
DIRECTV platforms?
 
And secondly, any thoughts regarding pot
ential consolidation in the satellite 
business, now that you're fully into DIRECTV? It seems like the DIRECTV 
satellite business is likely to be shrinking over time. Thanks.
 
John J. Stephens 
-
 
AT&T, Inc.
 
No comment on the satellite business.
 
With regard to
 
the advertising opportunity set, let me say this. With the data 
insights we have off of our satellite
-
delivered video, off our wireline or IP 
video, off our wireless
-
delivered content, and over our broadband networks, 
we have extensive data. We can now ma
rry that with a data insights 
business capability that we've been building over four years, a big data 
company. We're now hiring those quality resources under Brian Lesser to get 
the quality and the talent that knows this business and takes this business 
a
nd develops the products and services that we'll be able to first, quite 
frankly, use internally. We are a very large advertiser, if not the largest in 
the United States. And so the efficiency opportunity of taking this new 
information and using it effecti
vely is enormous inside our four walls.
 
But secondly, that also helps us with marketing activities. It helps us with 
efficiency in choosing content, making content choices, even marketing our 
programs, our films and so forth, because we have that knowledge
. That's 
all internal and that's a very big deal. But if you think about the ad 
impressions that come over with Time Warner and add those to the 
impressions that we have on our network, they are literally, literally in the 
billions.
 
If you want a proof poi
nt insight that's out there, you can just look at our 
advertising business, and it's growing in double digits. And that's from the 
initial use here of addressable advertising focus with some additional data. 
I'd suggest to you that's, if you will, the best
 
way to think about it and the 
way to analyze it. If we could get those kinds of advertising revenues that 
we are getting on the DTV and U
-
verse IP platform growth on the Time 
Warner business, that would be very, very good. And that's just if we can, 
but I
'm not going to give you specific targeted numbers. But I would suggest 
to you the indications are that this can be effective based on what we've 
seen in our Ad Tech business and our Entertainment group on the 
advertising side.

Thank you. Our next question is from Brett Feldman with Goldman Sachs. 
Please go ahead.
 
Brett Feldman 
-
 
Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
 
Thanks, a couple follow
-
up questions around the 
broadband strategy that 
you outlined. I'll go slow here. You're talking about getting to delivering 
competitive speeds to 50 million customer locations. How many customer 
locations do you currently deliver those types of competitive speeds to? So 
in other 
words, how much do you think you're expanding your addressable 
market through the project? And then just along with that, can you break 
that down at all between in
-
footprint versus out
-
of
-
footprint? I've got to 
imagine some of that is outside your traditio
nal footprint.
 
And then the last part of it would be you have to do 12.5 million fiber 
locations. Is that where you're going to stop, or do you think of that 50 
million, maybe more than 12.5 million will ultimately be served by fiber? 
Thank you.
 
John J. St
ephens 
-
 
AT&T, Inc.
 
Sure. Sure, Brett. Let me try to answer this as directly as possible. First of 
all, we're going to do the 12.5 million because we committed to do that and 
we're on track and we're ahead of that schedule. Secondly, because of the 
way the
 
12.5 million is counted 

 
and there are some limits on greenfield 
build, there are some limits on overbuild of existing capabilities and so on 
and so forth, I'd suggest when we're done with that we're going to be closer 
to 14 million. And I'm using that a
s a rounded number, but let's call it 14 
million on that fiber
-
to
-
the
-
prem.
 
Secondly, we're right now at about 8 million business customer locations, 
business locations that either have fiber that's active in their buildings or 
within the industry
-
standard
 
1,000 feet where it's very effective to just go in 
and connect them. So that takes it up to 22 million. We have a VDSL 
footprint that serves at over 50 megs 

 
or 50 megs, I should say, or better. 
Today, that's about 20 million. So those are the pieces. Th
e additional pieces 
will be covered by 5G, and we're not going any higher than that.
 
To back up though and start, right now we're at 6 million I think with fiber
-
to
-
the
-
prem. We're at 8 million with business fiber. With business, that's 14 
million. We're a
t 20 million with VDSL. That's 34 million. And we're not 
claiming today to be any 5G on the wireless, although we have some builds 
that have been effective in that area, as I described earlier. That's the 
starting point.
 
The additions, as I mentioned, will get up to 14 million with 8 million. The 20 
million may change on the VDSL because we may upgrade it with fiber. We 
may do other things with it. So we'll see what happens with that. And then 
lastly is the 5G overbuild, w
hich quite frankly might cover much of those 
same locations but won't be counted twice. We're only counting additional 
coverage.
 
Brett Feldman 
-
 
Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
 
And what's the timeline you think it's going to take to get to the 50 million, 
includin
g all of those techniques?
 
John J. Stephens 
-
 
AT&T, Inc.
 
I think we put in there that it would be around 2020 or thereafter, and I feel 
real comfortable about saying that's the way it's described on that on the 
slide. I feel very comfortable. The team is w
orking very hard. The thing 
everybody's got to remember that one of keys to all of this is we're going to 
be out on our network doing FirstNet work. We've got 27 states and 
territories that have already opted in. We're 27
-
for
-
27 so far, and so we're 
going 
to have this opportunity 

 
requirements to build out the 12.5 million, 
requirements to build out for FirstNet, but the opportunity to coordinate 
those builds and do it very effectively at the same time. So we're pretty 
optimistic with it, not to mention I'
m optimistic because of the $6.5 billion 
contribution we get from FirstNet to fund this build.

Thank you. And we now have a question from David Barden with Bank of

David Barden

Bank of America

Merrill Lynch
 
Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. I guess two, if I could. John, just 
a higher
-
level question, I think a lot of people who watched your go
-
to
-
market evolution over the course of the summer and are lo
oking at these 
results here would say that it appears that you've been willing to make an 
investment on the entertainment and video side, perhaps at a loss, in order 
to try to create a gain on the wireless side in terms of improved postpaid 
phone net adds,
 
margin, churn, et cetera. And I guess if that's accurate, I'm 
wondering if you could grade yourself. How happy are you now with what 
you've achieved? And then is this the strategy that you want to keep doing 
at the rate at which you're doing it on a go
-
fo
rward basis, thinking ahead to 
Time Warner?
 
And then the second question would be Business Services obviously is down 
year over year. But if you look first quarter to second quarter to third 
quarter, it's actually been pretty stable across the fixed line s
ide of the 
house. So I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about if we've found a 
plateau in that, or if we should see some drop
-
off as other forces are at 
work. Thanks.
 
John J. Stephens 
-
 
AT&T, Inc.
 
So let me take the last one first. We are start
ing to see some green shoots 
with regard to the pricing activity in
-
business. I'd suggest to you that there's 
more to come, but we are starting to see that. We continue to be optimistic 
about our product portfolio. We have a challenging business because we
've 
got a lot of legacy voice and legacy analog data. But we continue to be 
convicted with regard to 

 
and convinced that our IP
-
based products and 
services are a good long
-
term strategy. And as you point out, we are seeing 
some improvement in the pricing 
area. That's one.
 
With regard to our strategy, we are in a bundled strategy. We are not in a 
strategy to trade one business off against the other. What we are in a 
strategy to do is to utilize all of our assets to benefit our customers and 
grow our busines
s. And so bundling of wireless and video, bundling of 
broadband and video, bundling of broadband, wireless, and video is 
definitely the strategy. We definitely believe that works, and we definitely 
believe that can add value for the overall customer base, 
shareholders and 
customers alike. So that is what we're doing. And we'll continue to believe in 
that. We think it's the right strategy and we think it's working for us.
 
I don't want to suggest, David, that there are any trade
-
offs or there are any 
views in
 
that in the sense that we are looking at one business more 
favorably than the other. We look at the total value creation for the business 
and try to focus our minds on what the shareholders and the best long
-
term 
health of the business. And you know what,
 
the strategy we established was 
the one we established when we closed the DTV merger. We expected, we 
hoped, and we planned that churn would improve, that broadband 
deployment would improve, that wireless would improve, and we're seeing 
all those things h
appen. So we feel good about that.
 
With regard to this quarter's video, linear video losses, remember the point. 
About half those losses were a decision based on creditworthiness and credit 
policies and credit standards as well as some pain from natural di
sasters. We 
still believe those were the right decisions in the long
-
term interest of 
business, but those are different decisions than others would imply, and I 
want to make sure that's clear.

And, John, if I 
could, just a very quick follow
-
up, so just to be clear, so when 
you bundle a $10 DTV NOW package that maybe has, many estimate, $30 
or slightly higher in terms of content cost, that $20 a month that you're 
investing to subsidize that DTV NOW product, you'
re seeing the financial 
returns on the wireless side.

Our wireless customers are really valuable in the extension of their life 
through the lowering of their churn, and the ability to get entire families or 
entire groups of ph
ones is really important to us. And so we strongly believe 
that that is value
-
accretive to the total operations of the total organization, 
and we monitor it on a very regular basis.
 
I will tell you, though, to make sure we have a 

 
going back to a comment 
I 
think that Phil may have asked me about, and that is remember, these DTV 
NOW customers, much of them are new to us. And so not only do we have 
that new customer on the video side, but now we're going to get the 
opportunity to potentially get their wirele
ss business and to potentially get 
their broadband business if we're in a position to do that. So we're very 
encouraged about that kind of opportunity that goes the other way, but we 
are convicted in the business proposition.

Thank you. Our next question is from Frank Louthan with Raymond James. 
Go ahead, please.

Great, thank 
you. Thank you very much. Can you give us an idea of your 
longer
-
term trends on the prepaid and on the wireless side in wholesale? 
Where are you trending? You said you made the decision to step away from 
some the wholesale providers. Are you looking to bac
k off on that? And how 
quickly can you redeploy some of the network assets for your own brands?
 
John J. Stephens 
-
 
AT&T, Inc.
 
The capacity is immediately re
-
deployable as it changes, so that's ongoing. 
With regard to the prepaid trends, we're continuing to
 
see, as you saw, 
strong growth in our prepaid numbers. What we are seeing, for example 

 
and we mentioned this in the 8
-
K with the reclass of our customer counts, if 
you think about it, we built this platform of a connected car. So we have 
millions and mi
llions of connected cars out there, over 10 million connected 
cars out there. So we built this platform, and those are down in our Internet 
of Things in our connected device category.
 
But now what we're finding is that 65% of the people who drive cars aren
't 
our wireless customers, so we're finding a real opportunity to connect tens 
of thousands of those, almost 100,000 this quarter, with a prepaid offering 
to the connected car. And when they do that, they will pay us. It's not a $4 
or $5, it's a $15 or $20
 
connection. And so it not only gives us a really great 
revenue opportunity and high margin, and that's a lot better than a resale 
opportunity at a much lower, but it's also an opportunity to show them what 
we can do and then potentially get the rest of th
eir wireless business or get 
the rest of their video business.
 
So that's how we're thinking about prepaid. It's not just the continued 
growth in the smartphones and the continued expansion of the base, as 
we've shown, 3.5 million customers in the last two 
years, pretty good 
numbers, but also in now building on these other platforms that we've built 
and use that as the opportunity, just like DTV NOW, to go out and see if we 
can make those customers a bundled or a complete customer of AT&T. And 
that's an oppo
rtunity that we're going to continue to pursue. That's a real 
value
-
creating and a win
-
win for the customer and for the shareholder.

Hey, guys. T
hank you for getting me in, just one on bundling. If you can, 
help us maybe first think through satellite video performance, how that 
differed inside and outside of your ILEC footprint. And then maybe more 
broadly, in order to better bundle with a broadban
d product outside your 
footprint, how do you think about accelerating efforts like your G.fast trials 
and 5G, which you talked about a little bit earlier, to maybe go to market 
with a broadband pipe beyond the ILEC footprint and potentially better 
bundle r
elative to maybe a video and wireless bundle? Thanks.
 
John J. Stephens 
-
 
AT&T, Inc.
 
Great. If I can, let me answer your question by just modifying it a little bit. 
It's not just inside or outside the footprint. It's really that ability, as you 
point out, a
s a standalone product, we have higher churn. As we pointed out 
in the slides, when we bundle satellite with wireless, the churn drops by 
50%. When we bundle it with broadband, it drops by 30%. So either one of 
those, as you suggest, are very, very good st
rategies.
 
From a wireless basis, we've got a national footprint, so the opportunity to 
do that is there. The need to continually improve speeds and throughput on 
the wireless network is there. But first, that gives us the solution to do that 
and some finan
cial wherewithal to do that. So the network team is working 
very, very hard. That's why our finance guy can talk about the tests that 
they've already run in Austin and San Francisco and Indianapolis so easily 
because the network team has been on this. And 
that's exactly what they're 
thinking about.
 
With regard to 

 
and they'll do that across that national footprint. And then 
we will do inside. We believe that there's that opportunity to get these IP 
broadband speeds in that footprint, the 50 million build t
hat we're talking, or 
50 million potential or more really goes to exactly what you're talking about. 
So that is what we're trying. We're evaluating those builds on a regular 
basis. We're trying to balance capital needs and capacity capabilities as well 
as 
the desire to go out and build it once as opposed to build it with a 
tentative technology and then have to rip it out, as some would suggest, 
with regard to their claims to building out on millimeter wave even before 
standards are set. So it's balancing al
l of that. But you're right, that is what 
we're doing. That is our goal of enhancing speeds and coverage to more 
than 50 million locations.

Excellent. Thanks, John.

Thank you. Wi
th that, folks, I want to thank you all again for being on the 
call today. In closing, we had a strong quarter, and our quarter and our 
year
-
to
-
date activities are on track to meet guidance. Our Wireless business 
is performing at record levels. Our DTV NOW
 
offering is growing extremely 
rapidly. Almost 800,000 customers for a business that's less than a year old 
is pretty dramatic. We've got work to do and plans in place to improve our 
linear TV business. Our business solutions and our international continue
 
to 
meet expectations and perform extremely well. And we're excited about the 
opportunity that our data insights ad tech business and Time Warner will 
provide.
 
We continue to have strong cash flows, and we view that very positively, 
particularly as we have
 
great coverage on our dividend. And as we go to that 
time of year, we want to make sure that we continue and we will be able to 
continue to provide our board the opportunity to continue raising our 
dividend if they so choose for the 34th consecutive year.
 
We are positive 
about it, the future. We're optimistic. We've got to continue to work hard, 
but we believe strongly in what we're doing and our strategy.
 
With that being said, we thank you for your time and look forward to 
working with you in the future. 
Take care.

Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the AT&T 
first quarter 2017 earnings call. At this time, all participants are in a listen
-
only mode. Later we will conduct a question and answer session. 
Instructions will be 
given at that time.
 
I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Michael Viola, 
Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
 
Michael J. Viola

AT&T, Inc.
 
Okay. Thank you, Kathy, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to the
 
first quarter conference call. Good to have everybody with us today. Joining 
me on the call is Randall Stephenson, AT&T's Chairman and Chief Executive 
Officer; and John Stephens, AT&T's Chief Financial Officer. John's going to 
cover our operational result
s first. Randall's going to follow that with an 
overall business strategy update, and then we'll get to the Q&A session. As 
always, our earnings material are available on our Investor Relations page. 
You can find that on att.com/investor.relations.
 
I need 
to call your attention to two Safe Harbor statements before we begin. 
That's on slide 3 and slide 4. They say that some of these comments today 
may be forward
-
looking, and as such they're subject to risks and 
uncertainties. Results may differ materially, a
nd additional information is 
available on AT&T's and Straight Path's SEC filing and on the Investor 
Relations page of each company's respective websites. And, finally, we still 
remain in the quiet period for the FCC spectrum auction.
 
And so with that I'd l
ike to turn the call over to AT&T's CFO, John Stephens.

Thanks, Mike, and thanks to all of you for being on the call. Before I turn it 
over to Randall, I'd like to provide you a brief overview of our first quarter 
results.
 
We 
opened the year on a very competitive note. The wireless market moved 
to unlimited, several over
-
the
-
top video players launched new services, and 
a major cable company announced plans to offer wireless service in an effort 
to duplicate the integrated exper
ience we offer today. All this reinforced our 
belief that we are the best prepared for the new world, where capacity, 
networks, and entertainment intersect.
 
A year from now, we may look back on the return to unlimited plans as the 
moment when the battle fo
r network reach and capacity began. In a world of 
unlimited plans and growing mobile video usage, you need a network and 
the capacity to handle the load and meet customer expectations for quality 
service. We have just that, and Randall will talk more about
 
that in just a 
few minutes, but let's first look at the results for the quarter.
 
Consolidated revenues were pressured by record low postpaid upgrade rates 
in wireless and pressure in legacy wireline from grooming, but at the same 
time, we continue to oper
ate efficiently and drive costs out of the business. 
Adjusted consolidated margins were up 80 basis points year over year to 
20.7%. Credit for this goes to our entire management team but especially to 
our technology and network ops group and their work on 
automation, 
digitization, and network virtualization. We're well on our way to virtualizing 
55% of the network functions by the end of the year, and we are seeing the 
cost and capital savings from those efforts.
 
We grew adjusted earnings. Our adjusted EPS 
for the quarter was $0.74, up 
about 3%. That includes about $0.02 of pressure from storm damage on the 
West Coast and legal settlements. Also during the quarter, we wrote down 
the book value of our legacy publishing investment. That was partially offset 
by
 
gains from a spectrum swap with Verizon. Both of those items were 
adjusted for EPS purposes.
 
Cash flows continue to be strong. Cash from operations reached $9.2 billion. 
Free cash flow was $3.2 billion, the same as last year, even though we 
increased capi
tal spending to $6 billion for the quarter. We had improved 
working capital and lower tax payments in the first quarter and chose to 
reinvest those efforts in the business. While this made first quarter capital 
spending levels higher year over year, our Ca
pEx guidance remains 
unchanged.
 
This also was a key strategic quarter for AT&T. We made several significant 
moves that put us in a strong spectrum position for the future. We signed an 
agreement to acquire FiberTower, a holder of 39 gigahertz millimeter wa
ve 
spectrum, and we were awarded the FirstNet contract to build and operate a 
national first responders network. And earlier this month we announced our 
intention to acquire Straight Path. We have now been informed by Straight 
Path that their board has rec
eived a superior proposal. Under our existing 
contract with Straight Path, we have the right to negotiate with the company 
over the next five business days to match or exceed the new bid. We will 
evaluate the situation and make a decision in that timeframe
. And we also 
received the expected $1.4 billion refund of our deposit from the FCC 
broadcast auction last week. Randall will provide more insight into our 
overall strategy in a few minutes.
 
Now let's look at our operations, starting with wireless. Those d
etails are on 
slide 6. As a reminder, AT&T's domestic Mobility operations are divided 
between the Business Solutions and Consumer Wireless segments. For 
comparison purposes, the company is providing supplemental information 
for its total U.S. Wireless oper
ations.
 
The reintroduction of unlimited plans made an already competitive market 
even more so. We were disciplined with our response, which was to launch 
new Unlimited Plus plans that give customers a $25 credit for bundling 
DIRECTV or DIRECTV NOW with the
ir mobile service. And earlier this month 
we announced a limited promotion for free HBO for our Unlimited Plus 
customers. The changes in the market did impact our postpaid net adds, 
especially in the first part of the quarter before we began offering our n
ew 
Unlimited plans. Our moves to combine the value of mobile with video have 
had the desired positive effect. In fact, trends are now back to where things 
stood before Unlimited plans were reintroduced by our competitors back in 
February.
 
Revenues were als
o impacted by fewer phone sales. We had our lowest ever 
postpaid upgrade rate of 3.9% in the quarter, selling 1 million fewer phones 
than a year ago, while bring
-
your
-
own
-
device customers remained strong. 
This obviously impacted equipment revenues and to a
 
lesser degree some 
service revenues. But, despite all the competitive noise in the quarter, we 
turned in our best
-
ever EBITDA margins. Our EBITDA margin was 41.8% 
with wireless service margins of 49.3%.
 
Postpaid phone
-
only churn was also a record first qu
arter low of 0.90%. But 
with the lower phone sales, we also had fewest postpaid tablet net adds in 
more than five years, adding about 100,000 new tablets. We did add more 
than 2 million subscribers, as record connected device net adds and a solid 
prepaid q
uarter helped to offset tougher postpaid and reseller results. We 
also continue to grow our branded smartphone base, adding nearly half a 
million smartphones in the quarter.
 
Our Entertainment group also saw competitive pressure. Revenue and 
margins were re
latively stable. West Coast storms did drive up expenses by 
about $100 million in the quarter, with about two
-
thirds of that allocated to 
our Entertainment group and the rest to Business Solutions. But these costs, 
along with higher content costs and our i
nvestments in DIRECTV NOW, were 
largely offset by merger synergies and disciplined cost management. Linear 
TV subscriber gross adds were consistent with previous quarters, but with 
annual price increases due to content costs going up. Churn was up, 
particu
larly in markets where we don't have broadband to bundle with video. 
Competitive pressure from cable and the increasing number of over
-
the
-
top 
video alternatives resulted in our video subscribers declining in the quarter. 
We're taking steps to address the 
situation, including simplifying offers and 
bundling with unlimited wireless.
 
At the same time, DIRECTV NOW is an important part of our strategy and 
continues to add customers. We deliberately pulled back on marketing to 
give the platform time to mature an
d improve, and we're seeing just that. 
You should expect us to be more aggressive with DIRECTV NOW in the 
second half of the year, with additional features and content. Last week we 
added 14 FOX affiliates to DIRECTV NOW. You should expect we will be 
targe
ting those cities with additional marketing. We're still only five months 
since the DTV NOW launch, but we like what we see and feel very good 
about the service and where it's headed.
 
Broadband had a very strong quarter, with 115,000 subscribers added. Our
 
moves to simplify pricing are paying off, and our fiber deployment is making 
inroads. AT&T fiber is now in 52 metro areas and marketed to 4.6 million 
customer locations. We expect to add 2 million fiber locations this year, to 
reach 6 million by the end o
f the year, and to meet our 12.5 million merger 
commitment goal by 2019.
 
Now let's look at Business Solutions on slide 7. In the business segment, we 
saw weaker demand than we expected. U.S. business investment as a 
percent of GDP continues to be low. Grow
th expectations in the economy 
have been rising, but we've yet to see that translate into economic gains or 
demand. We're still hopeful that growing consumer confidence and the 
possibly of tax reform will turn into increased business investment later this 
year, but the near
-
term view is cautious. We also continue to see the impact 
of technology shifts away from the traditional voice lines and other legacy 
services.
 
Customers are still buying our strategic business services, which were up 
more than $200 mill
ion in the quarter. And wireless service revenues grew in 
the quarter, but lower equipment sales pressured overall results. Like in 
other parts of our business, we stayed ahead with a relentless focus on cost 
efficiencies. You can see that in our margins. 
Margins actually expanded by 
90 basis points and were the highest in four years, and that included 
improvements in both wireline and wireless margins. Our business team is 
doing a good job in a tough situation. Increasing profitability in a challenging 
rev
enue environment is not easy.
 
Meanwhile, our international businesses had a very good quarter. We grew 
revenues in both our Latin American and Mexican operations, improved 
margins and added customers. In fact, EBITDA has more than doubled year 
over year. W
e've made a lot of headway in building our network and our 
brand in Mexico. We now reach 85 million people with our LTE networks; 
we've rebranded, updated, and opened new stores and trained our people. 
We are now actively scaling our customer base to match
 
those investments.
 
We added 3 million subscribers last year, and we had a good start to this 
year by adding more than 600,000 new customers in the first quarter. That 
brings our customer base to 12.6 million. Revenue grew and margins 
improved both sequent
ially and year over year. Latin America satellite 
operations also showed revenue growth and margin expansion. Revenues 
were up more than 10%, even when excluding the foreign exchange lift in 
the quarter. The bottom line for our video business in Latin Amer
ica is that 
it's profitable and continues to generate positive free cash flow.
 
Now, before I turn this over to Randall, let me quickly review our outlook for 
the year. As we told you earlier in the year, when the FirstNet contract was 
officially awarded, w
e would update our 2017 guidance, and we'll update 
again following the close of the Time Warner acquisition. Because the 
FirstNet state opt
-
in process is expected to flow into the fourth quarter, 
FirstNet is now expected to have little impact on our 2017 P
&L results. That 
being said, the FirstNet build efforts and reimbursement process might have 
a manageable impact on CapEx and cash flows, depending upon the timing 
of FirstNet reimbursement. So as it relates to guidance we're still expecting 
adjusted EPS g
rowth in the mid
-
single digit range. We're expecting adjusted 
operating margin expansion even in the current competitive environment. 
Our capital spending guidance remains in the $22 billion range, but with 
FirstNet it could be at the higher end of that $2
2 billion range. And free cash 
flow is expected to be in the $18 billion range, and it may be a little bit on 
the low end of the range with the timing of the FirstNet reimbursements.
 
You'll notice that we have stopped providing revenue guidance. The reason
 
is pretty simple: Upgrades rates are hitting record lows. Our revenue 
forecasts depend on how many phones we expect to sell during the year, 
and that's uncertain. And we don't know how much demand there will be for 
any of the new product offerings that co
me out. Changes in customer phone 
buying habits have minimal impact on our profitability, but it does make 
revenue forecasts more unpredictable.
 
With that, I would now like to hand this over to Randall Stephenson, who is 
going to provide a 
strategic update on our overall business. Randall?

Thanks, John. Listen, I thought what we'd do before we get into the strategy 
update is just 

 
I wanted to just give you my take on the quarter, and 
there's just a handful
 
of things that stood out. And the first was that churn 
was up significantly on our standalone pay TV product, and that's where TV 
isn't bundled with our other services. And that's really what's behind the 
decline in TV subscribers for the quarter. And so 
you should expect us to 
make some adjustments in the market to address that as we move into the 
rest of the year.
 
The second thing I'd call out is the performance in cost management. And to 
grow EPS 

 
and John pointed this out, but to grow EPS and cash flo
w and 
expand margins in this kind of competitive environment I think is 
noteworthy, and it doesn't happen without some really terrific execution in 
driving costs out. And it's that execution on the cost side that gives us a lot 
of confidence to reaffirm ou
r profit outlook for the year, and that's a big 
deal.
 
My third observation is one that John talked at length about, and that's the 
return of unlimited plans. And obviously this has made an already 
competitive market even more so. And our response to the un
limited data 
plans was probably a little slow. And we lost some share in the quarter, but 
it was really important that our unlimited offers be unique and play to our 
strengths. And John talked about this as well a little bit. But we're combining 
our unlimi
ted with some significant discounts on TV and free HBO, and as 
these offers are now in the market our subscriber metrics have returned to 
kind of the same levels they were before all these unlimited offers began.
 
And kind of the sum of it is it appears the
 
industry has gone through a lot of 
activity during the quarter and has essentially landed back in the same place 
where it started. So what the return of unlimited really highlights, and that 
is the industry's position in terms of network capacity, because
 
if the 
industry is going to stay with unlimited, we're prepared and can probably 
sustain it better than anyone else because of our spectrum position. And it is 
the best in the industry.
 
And this would probably be a good place to talk about the foundation 
that 
we've built for a world of intense video consumption in the world of mobility, 
and so let's go to slide 10. This network we've built, it was designed for 
video. And our LTE network covers more than 400 million people in Latin 
America, and this morning
 
we announced that we're significantly increasing 
the network speeds in several major cities this year as part of our 5G 
evolution. And Austin is now live. Indianapolis will turn up this summer, and 
then at least 18 additional markets will be turned up lat
er this year. And 
then we have the new Samsung Galaxy S8, which is the first device that's 
going to be able to take advantage of these higher speeds.
 
Obviously our satellite distribution is very well
-
equipped for a world with 4K 
video, and it covers the U.
S. and most of Latin America. We have the largest 
fiber footprint in the country. We pass nearly 6 million business locations 
with fiber today, and we're in the process of deploying fiber to more than 
12.5 million customer locations by 2019. Now, this fibe
r footprint is proving 
to be a huge competitive advantage as the industry is moving towards 5G. 
We're also leading the industry in software
-
defined networking, and this is 
the driving force behind our cost structure. And it's also changing how we 
deliver n
ew services.
 
And then on spectrum, it became clear several years ago as we began to 
anticipate a world of premium mobile video that spectrum would be the 
difference maker. So we took a deliberate strategic approach to building up 
our position, and today we
 
have the leading spectrum position in the U.S., 
and I'm going to discuss that more here in a moment.
 
All these investments are creating a very unique platform for what we think 
is a very unique customer base. It's 147 million mobile subscribers, 47 
millio
n pay TV subscribers, a fast
-
growing OTT video service, and 16 million 
broadband subscribers.
 
And if you look at slide 11, I now want to drill down on this spectrum 
position that we've spoken of a lot here on this call. We picked up 20 
megahertz of nationw
ide mid
-
band spectrum with our WCS acquisition back 
in 2012. Recall this is where we picked up a lot of companies and the FCC 
helped us get these licenses for mobile broadband. Then we bought another 
20 megahertz of mid
-
band spectrum in the 2015 spectrum a
uction, and that 
block covers virtually the entire country. Then after extensive assessment of 
the FirstNet RFP, we set winning the contract as a top priority for this 
company. We worked it hard, and our effort paid off last month. And along 
with winning F
irstNet, we get another 20 megahertz of premium low
-
band 
spectrum to build this network. And then any surplus capacity can be used 
for our commercial customers. And then finally we shut down our analog 2G 
network last year, and we're redeploying that spect
rum nationwide as well.
 
So you add it all up. We now have more than 60 megahertz of fallow 
spectrum that we're ready to light up, and we'll be deploying all the bands 
simultaneously starting this fall when states begin to opt in to the FirstNet. 
The effici
encies we'll gain from climbing the tower once to put up multiple 
bands of spectrum, those efficiencies are significant. And we're going to see 
those cost savings and the network performance materialize immediately 
and then throughout the life of this mult
iyear buildout.
 
And so with that, let's talk about 5G. As you know, it requires higher band 
spectrum that can transmit huge amounts of data over very short distances. 
So earlier this year we announced our first millimeter wave acquisition with 
FiberTower. 
And this gives us a very nice nationwide deep footprint in the 
higher bands. We filed for the license transfer, and we expect the FCC to 
approve this in late summer. Then a few weeks ago we announced our intent 
to acquire Straight Path and its nationwide m
illimeter licenses, and there's 
now a competing offer, as John pointed out, and we're going to be 
evaluating that over the next few days and decide how to respond. The 
bottom line: We've built the overall leading spectrum position that's going to 
allow us 
to fulfill our goal. And our goal is to put 1 gig speeds in our 
customers' hands no matter where they are on our network.
 
Before I get to your questions, I'd like to briefly address what's been going 
on in Washington, and there's an outline of that on slid
e 12. It's obviously 
been an amazing few months in our industry. And there's clearly a return to 
a lighter touch pro
-
growth regulatory philosophy, and that's not only in our 
industry but it's across all industries right now, and we think this is 
incredibly
 
positive for our country and that it could catalyze the economic 
growth all of us have been looking for.
 
On the Time Warner deal approval, it's moving along as expected. The 
European Commission has approved it. The Department of Justice is now 
reviewing i
t, and we're working closely with them to answer any questions 
that they may have. On the FCC side, since there are no license transfers 
involved, we don't anticipate the FCC will review it at all. So bottom line, we 
continue to expect approval of the deal
 
end of this year.
 
On regulation in general, the changes at the FCC have been quite positive. 
The controversial rules around business data services that had been 
proposed earlier have been abandoned, and they've been replaced by a 
logical, commonsense appr
oach that preserves competition. The proposed 
set
-
top box regulations are now off the table.
 
On data privacy, the president has signed legislation that should give us a 
consistent set of rules that apply equally to all companies. And then Title II 
regulati
on is under review, and I want to be real clear about this. We do 
continue to support fundamental tenets of net neutrality, and we remain 
committed to open Internet rules that are fair and equal to all players. 
However, we do continue to think it's illogic
al to regulate the Internet using 
rules that were put in place 83 years ago for the rotary dial telephone. We're 
hopeful the FCC will follow through on that as well.
 
On corporate tax reform, we continue to believe that something does get 
done this year, bu
t the timing and the magnitude of it are anybody's guess. 
But achieving competitive corporate tax rates, this is probably the biggest 
catalyst available for our public policymakers if they want to increase capital 
investment and job creation, so we think t
his is really important.
 
And so with that, Mike, I'm going to hand it back to you, and we can go to 
questions.

you. Our first question will come from John Hodulik with UBS. Go

John C. Hodulik

Okay. Thanks, guys. Maybe first on the

Randall L. Stephenson

AT&T, Inc.
 
Hey, John.
 
John C. Hodulik

UBS Securities LLC
 
Hi. Hey. How 
you guys doing? First on the satellite business, or the linear 
TV, are you guys seeing cannibalization from the DIRECTV NOW product? 
And the churn you mentioned, is there a way you could ascribe it to maybe 
traditional competitors versus these over
-
the
-
top
 
guys? And have you seen 
that accelerate since the launch of YouTube TV a few weeks ago? That's first.
 
And then maybe on the Straight Path and FiberTower deals, could you just 
comment on how quickly you think that gets deployed? And is the holdings 
of the 
millimeter wave spectrum that you would have if you were able to 
successfully complete the Straight Path transaction, is that sort of what you 
need to sort of fulfill your sort of 5G initiatives? Thanks.
 
Randall L. Stephenson 
-
 
AT&T, Inc.
 
I'll start, John,
 
and I'll let John Stephens clean up after me, okay? On the 
satellite question, there's obviously some cannibalization of DIRECTV NOW, 
but it's fairly nominal, to be quite honest with you. The satellite churn that I 
referenced, I mean, it is heavily concen
trated, John, in those customers 
where we just have a standalone TV product. It's not bundled with 
broadband or it's not bundled with our wireless service. And so obviously it's 
a world where the integrated offers are what's winning in the marketplace. 
And
 
so you can figure out who we're losing those subscribers to; it's 
traditional cable players.
 
And so this is where we're going to have to get aggressive in a number of 
areas, moving aggressively on bundling these satellite customers with our 
wireless offer
s and also doing some new things in the marketplace that we 
think can shore this up. But it's no secret where these are coming from; it's 
coming from integrated offers from other players in the market. And where 
we have multi
-
product bundles in the marketp
lace, those customers, the 
churn rates continue to be very strong. And in fact you saw our postpaid 
phone churn, 0.9%. You put TV or broadband with it, and those churn rates 
just get even better. So we continue to be big, big advocates of the 
integrated bu
ndle and multiple service bundles. And so we don't see that 
changing. It's going to require us to get a little more aggressive in those 
single
-
play, standalone TV offers.
 
On Straight Path and FiberTower, so we've talked at length about when the 
standards a
re going to be out for 5G. I think we're now in 2018 time 
horizon.
 
John J. Stephens 
-
 
AT&T, Inc.
 
2018.
 
Randall L. Stephenson 
-
 
AT&T, Inc.
 
And so having equipment and handsets, we're talking 2019 before we start 
deploying in 2020 when you probably have what
 
I would call scaled 
offerings. If we get both Straight Path and FiberTower accomplished, it 
pretty much fills our spectrum requirements we need for a long period of 
time as it relates to 5G deployment, John. So right now this is all preparing 
for the futu
re of 5G, and the standards are on track, and we hope to be 
deploying and putting this spectrum to work in the 2018
-
2019 timeframe, 
scaling in 2020.
 
John J. Stephens 
-
 
AT&T, Inc.
 
John, with regard to that on 

 
as Randall said, the FiberTower itself gives u
s 
a base of 39 gigahertz nationwide to really build on and plan on. And so that 
in and of itself is a great starting point and gives our network team an 
opportunity to incorporate that planning into our project evolution and this 
next
-
generation network. W
hen you look at Straight Path, it really has two 
holdings, the 39 gigahertz, which would complement FiberTower's and give 
us that depth that we would prefer, and so that would be great, but it also 
adds a strong 28 gigahertz piece, which we could incorpora
te into our 
network and use that way, or we could, as we've done in the past, use as an 
opportunity for spectrum swaps to take advantage of other opportunities.
 
I can give you a perfect example; this last quarter I mentioned that we had 
about a $100 millio
n gain on the spectrum swap with Verizon, where we 
traded some PCS and AWS 

 
three licenses to get both of ourselves in a 
better position to serve our customers. So that's where I'd leave us. The 39 
gigahertz would be a great depth of position, and quite f
rankly with 
FiberTower an opportunity to really plan on that build as we go into project 
evolution.

Thank you. Our next question is from Phil Cusic
k with JPMorgan. Please go 
ahead.
 
Philip A. Cusick

JPMorgan Securities LLC
 
Hey, John. You mentioned project evolution. Can we talk about the timing of 
the FirstNet process and evolution? My impression is you have a lot of 
pressure to get that deployed, a
nd given the timing of the state build 
process it could take a while. What are the things we should be watching to 
see this ramp up, and what happens in states where you don't get the state 
to come along on your FirstNet effort? And then, Randall, can you 
just talk 
quickly about 

 
how do you see 

 
I guess this is also for John, though. Any 
big issues in the corporate tax discussion that you might see out there, that 
we should be sort of cognizant of? Thank you.
 
John J. Stephens 
-
 
AT&T, Inc.
 
So, hey, Phil, g
ood afternoon. First of all, in the FirstNet process, we'll post 
the state plans here in June, open up the opportunity for the states to opt in. 
We'll actively work with the states, try to answer any questions, concerns 
they have, stay and (30:06) work wit
h them and with the FirstNet 
organization, who have been really good to work with, and convincing the 
states that opting in is the right answer. So we'll go through that process 
through the summer and hope to get the states to move as quickly as 
possible w
ith the, if you will, encouragement, that we are ready to go, and 
the first ones that opt in are going to get that first investment in their state, 
that build in their state, that job creation in their state. So we think that's a 
good strategy.
 
Secondly, w
ith regard to your question about opting out, there's a couple of 
things that make it challenging, I think, for a state to go down that route. 
One is, there is a collection of funding that's related to the contract winner, 
ourselves, with regard to setting
 
some national standards, setting up portals 
and other abilities to communicate with FirstNet responders, to communicate 
with states, to set national standards of interoperability, and so forth. Those 
monies are committed to the award winner and not to the
 
states. Secondly, 
if the states choose to go it alone, they take the risk of any project cost 
overruns. And third, they generally don't have 

 
and quite frankly one of our 
largest competitors doesn't have any owned network in the states to rely on, 
so the
y have a huge catch
-
up to do with a company like ours.
 
So we feel really good about the process and think that we are going to 

 
we'll be very cooperative, we'll be very encouraging with the states to work 
with them, to make sure they feel comfortable. But
 
our target is all 56 

 
50 
states, five territories, and the District of Columbia. We want to win them all, 
and that's our goal, so that's how we'll go about it.
 
Randy, you want to take corporate tax?
 
Randall L. Stephenson 
-
 
AT&T, Inc.
 
I'll talk 
corporate tax. We can tag
-
team this one, too, because John is 
actively involved with folks in Congress on this. But, look, there appears to 
be significant motivation and significant interest by all parties to get our 
corporate tax rate to a more competitiv
e level, and you can't find anybody in 
Washington 

 
you might be able to find one or two, but it's rare to find even 
somebody in Washington who would argue that our tax rates are 
uncompetitive on corporations. So there is a definite interest in seeing this
 
move.
 
From a business standpoint, what we're all advocating is really simple: It's 
got to be a competitive rate, and it needs to be a territorial system for 
taxing profits overseas. And if it was just a matter of trying to get to a 
competitive rate, that 
is probably achievable in short order. If you said 
what's a competitive rate, 25%, 26%, 27%, that's probably inherently 
achievable, and that would be very advantageous to the U.S. But I think 
there are some who aspire to try to do better than that, and you
 
heard the 
president just this week articulate a desire and in fact challenged his team in 
the White House to get to a 15% rate.
 
Now, we would obviously stand up and cheer; we'd be huge advocates of 
that. But I think the practical reality of getting to 15%
 
is you have to get 
yourself reconciled to some level of deficits for a period of time as you get 
the economic stimulation. So can you get some fashion of dynamic 
scorekeeping to justify it? The second is to get to a 15% rate without just 
blowing out the b
udget, you probably have to consider things like either 
VATs or border adjustment taxes, and we know the emotion that those are 
met with across the country. Now, we would probably be supportive, 
candidly, AT&T, if we could get a tax rate to 15%, we would b
e supportive of 
those kind of vehicles to make it happen, but we as a business may be in a 
minority in terms of entities receptive to those kind of vehicles to help get 
the tax rate down.
 
So there's going to be a lot of thrashing on this in Congress and wi
th the 
White House in terms of really what is the objective and if the president is 
committed to a 15% tax, it's going to have to 

 
it's going to take some kind 
of really serious changes in how we tax corporations to get there. Which we 
happen to think wou
ld be quite positive to economic growth and capital 
investment in this country. What would you add, John?
 
John J. Stephens 
-
 
AT&T, Inc.
 
Yeah. I mean, with that economic growth, capital investment drives revenue 
for us, and that's really as important as the
 
tax savings that driving those 
revenues would really be significant. And we would be able to invest with the 
cash flow benefit on a more rapid pace than even we are now.
 
Randall L. Stephenson 
-
 
AT&T, Inc.
 
What's interesting is 

 
you remember the Dave Camp
 
proposal. You can get 
to a 25% to 28% rate just by getting rid of all the loopholes and exclusions, 
and that would be nice, that would be really helpful, but 

 
and I think it 
would stimulate some growth. It's just not game
-
changer, if you will.
 
John J. St
ephens 
-
 
AT&T, Inc.
 
So let me make one other comment about FirstNet to make sure (35:22). 
We'll make some investments here starting right away with regard to the 
portals, with regard to the interoperability standard, that kind of equipment, 
that kind of in
vestment, and that could affect our operating expenses and 
our CapEx. But we'll get reimbursements from the FirstNet fund, and we're 
expecting those to kind of generally offset in this year. Secondly, the reason 
for the not
-
significant impact on our financ
ial results in 2017 from the 
overall is that 

 
two things. One, the states opting in probably in the fourth 
quarter timeframe, at least in large numbers. And two, the spectrum being 
put to use generally being up and running in probably 2018 and at the 
earl
iest late 2017, but probably more like 2018.
 
In the accounting world, those two things will drive the accounting activity, 
and so the accounting for the spectrum costs and other things that are 
involved in this really don't start until you place that spect
rum into service or 
until you've got completion of the state opt
-
in process. That's why we're 
saying, while there may be some impact, it's not going to be material. But I 
will add, if we were convinced that a state was opting in, if they had elected 
so and
 
we had appropriate approvals from the state and the FirstNet 
authorities, we would be willing to start that investment process right away. 
We are anxious to get going, and we have the vendors lined up and the 
opportunity lined up to get it done.

Mike L. McCormack

Jefferies LLC
 
Hey. Thanks, guys. John, maybe just a qui
ck comment on the wireless share 
loss, where you're seeing that. Is it more family share plans, or is it single 
lines and feature phones? And then on ARPU, what should we think about 
going forward as far as stabilization?
 
John J. Stephens 
-
 
AT&T, Inc.
 
Yeah
, sure, Mike. Let me say on the share loss, the feature phone continued 
to lose, but quite frankly with the unlimited plans being announced, we did 
see an uptick in the family plan losses and the attention on that. As we've 
come back with these unlimited p
lans and specifically with the offers to give 
the (37:43) $25 credit on DTV or DTV NOW and the opportunity for the HBO 
feature. We have seen the plans come back down, and we believe that part 
of the reason that's coming back to, if you will, normal or to p
re
-
unlimited 
offer rates is because it's holding onto the families. We still need to go 
through that. It's been just a couple, three weeks, so it's early. But, yes, we 
did see some impact on both the standalone, if you will, feature phone type 
that we've s
een in the past and the family plan.
 
With regard to ARPU, I would suggest to you we still have a little bit to go 
with regard to ARPU because we have really smart customer base, and they 
go through this process of figuring out which is the best plan for th
em and 
going to it, and that'll continue on. Secondly, we still have some customers 
on plans that have overage. And, as I said, if they're smart customers, they 
will migrate over to these unlimited plans and work through that.
 
But we are 

 
I will tell you,
 
if you look at our service revenues for the 
quarter, about 1% of the decline was really related to a decision we made 
last year to get out of the resale business in one of our specific large resale 
contracts, or to reduce that business, because the prices
 
just weren't 
appropriate, and capacity was going to be important to us for our quality 
customers. And so we've seen some of the service revenue declines based 
on our decisions to back off of that reseller market, and I think you saw that 
in our customer c
ounts. You saw it in our customer counts this quarter, but 
you saw it in our customer counts at the end of last year in the reseller 
market. And that was just a solid business decision we made based on 
realization 

 
ARPU and per meg realization.

Thank you. We now have a question from David Barden with Bank of 
America. Go ahead, please.
 
David W. Barden 
-
 
Bank of America Merrill Lynch
 
Hey, guys. Thanks for 
taking the questions. I guess my first one would be, 
John, for you. If we kind of look at the mid
-
single digit earnings per share 
growth target, it kind of implies that we've got to maintain this $0.74 level 
of earnings for most of the rest of the year, an
d coming off the kind of all
-
time low handset upgrade rate, it's more likely than not it's going to be a 
headwind as we go into the Galaxy and then the iPhone later this year. Can 
you kind of walk us through the geography of the income statement, where 
we 
offset those headwinds and generate the kind of positive mid
-
single digit 
earnings growth? And then the second question, if I could, would be maybe 
either for you or maybe Randall, just on this SD
-
WAN. It's a big emerging 
topic, a big conversation about wh
ether it's a threat or an opportunity, 
especially for an incumbent like yourselves. And finally how real it is as a 
technology in the world. That would be super helpful. Thanks.
 
John J. Stephens 
-
 
AT&T, Inc.
 
Sure. Let me try the EPS question first, Dave. L
et me go to this. If I harken 
back to a comment I made in a presentation that we had about a penny 

 
$0.02 of pressure in the quarter, a penny from some legal settlements, 
some IP, and other issues; and quite frankly a penny from some storm 
costs. And we d
id not adjust for them. But if you look at our results, taking 
those out, you see the quarter of $0.76, and you can understand then that 
the growth rate goes up to just under 6%, and you can understand how we 
would feel that that quarter supports an ongoin
g activity.
 
You're right; we could have a step up in equipment sales and upgrade rates. 
We're just admitting that we can't predict that at this time. But generally 
speaking, if that happens, we have significant offsets, whether it be the next 
accounting, w
hether it be the revenue recognition, or quite frankly if it's just 
the benefits of having customer additions and the additional service 
revenues and so forth. So that's something that does not scare us, so to 
speak. We can manage through that.
 
The third t
hing is, as we mentioned, the entire team here has been really 
focused on costs. But as we go quarter by quarter, we continue to increase 
the network function virtualization percentages, and we're on this march 
from 34% at the end of last year to 55% at th
e end of this year. So that's 
just going to continue on in generating savings, and we're getting to that 
point where the mass or the base of savings that we have, getting it to 40% 
and 50%, starts overcoming the reinvestment dollars that are required to 
gr
ow it. So all that put together, that's why we feel comfortable about 
staying in the hunt for that guidance and keeping things moving forward.
 
Randall L. Stephenson 
-
 
AT&T, Inc.
 
On the SD
-
WAN, yeah, it's real. It tends to be real down
-
market, David, and 
yo
u should assume that we're developing capability ourselves, because it's a 
viable offer down
-
market. We're seeing some effect from it. It's not material 
yet, but we think it's a legitimate capability. We need to be there; we need 
to have it. And so up
-
mark
et, the traditional VPN capability is always, we 
think, is going to be the enduring capability. But down
-
market, we're going 
to have to be prepared to compete with this kind of offering.
 
John J. Stephens 
-
 
AT&T, Inc.
 
David, Mike just reminded me 

 
one othe
r thing I'll mention to you is that if 
you noticed that improvement we had in the first quarter in Mexico and the 
fact that that customer base is now close to 13 million 

 
I think we're at 
12.6 million. And it was an investment cycle all of last year, and 
it's starting 
to turn. The team down there is doing well. But I'd suggest to you that's 
another support for our business proposition for the year. We need to keep 
working at it, and we need to keep that market strengthening, but we feel 
good about the fact
 
that that provides us another opportunity.
 
Secondly, I will tell you that the DIRECTV Latin America properties are just 
really 

 
it's a lot of elbow grease. It's a lot of hard work, but they're doing 
well for us in what is challenging environments. But th
ey are producing, and 
that's helping, too. So they may not be the focus of most of our discussions, 
but they sure are helping with our efforts this year.

Thank you. Our next question is from Brett Feldman with Goldman Sachs. 
Please go ahead.
 
Brett Feldman 
-
 
Goldman Sachs & Co.
 
Thanks for taking the question. I'd like to go back and talk a little bit about 
some of the elevated churn you 
signaled where you have an unbundled 
video product. I think it's easy to envision some of the corrective measures 
you could take within your traditional landline region, especially in light of all 
the fiber that you're deploying. So I was hoping we could m
aybe just spend 
a little bit more time talking about how you think about fortifying the bundle 
that you can offer outside that traditional region. You talked a little bit about 
some of the millimeter wave licenses, but is there really a broader set of 
opti
ons you think you have to go into the market to make sure your bundle 
remains differentiated nationwide?
 
Randall L. Stephenson 
-
 
AT&T, Inc.
 
Yeah, there's a few things, Brett. In the short run, obviously it's bundling 
DIRECTV standalone with wireless outsid
e of our traditional footprint where 
we don't have a broadband product. So bundling with wireless is really, 
really important. That is a part of the customer base, the standalone that 
has been also somewhat sheltered 

 
is that the right word? 

 
by virtue o
f 
being rural in nature. And so being rural in nature, it's harder to find an 
opportunity to bundle. Well, we have CAF II funding. We are turning up right 
now, wireless local loop is the term we use, but basically it's a wireless fixed 
broadband solution. 
400,000 that we're turning up. We have an opportunity 
to turn up a lot of these. As we build FirstNet, by the way, we have to turn 
up significant improvements to our entire rural footprint, and so having a 
wireless opportunity to provide a broadband bundle
 
into rural America really 
can shore up this customer base.
 
And so traditional wireless 

 
go immediately with bundling traditional 
wireless. Obviously there are some things we could do just on price, and 
we'll do some promotional things. But then getting o
ur fiber local loop 
product that is being rolled out right now, being introduced as we speak, 
getting it targeted to these customers, can also shore this up. So it's a 
multi
-
pronged effort.
 
And then longer term, you mentioned it. Longer term, 5G. This is t
he 
nationwide broadband opportunity. As we turn up 5G, we can now have a 
very high speed, competitive
-
with
-
cable broadband offering in all the major 
metropolitan countries where we don't have traditional fixed line footprint. 
So it's about to be a new comp
etitive game as we get into the world of 5G, 
and we're getting very, very enthusiastic about it. And just what I would call 
fixed type configurations of 5G will come out before mobile configurations. 
So 2018, we'll be doing some fixed line deployments of 5
G, and you'll be 
seeing some of that. And even the offerings, the speed increases we're doing 
right now in Austin that we just announced, we're talking competitive to 
cable speeds on our wireless network in Austin, soon to be Indianapolis and 
18 other mark
ets this year.
 
So the competitive landscape is changing, and I think 

 
we are convinced it's 
going to change faster than a lot of people believe it will, that we're going to 
have some truly substitutable capabilities in the wireless infrastructure with 
som
e of our fixed line competitors. So we're optimistic, and we still think the 
bundle offering is going to be very, very important in the long term.

Thank you. Our next question is from Amir Rozwadowski with Barclays. Go 
ahead, please.

Hi, Amir.

Hey, Amir.
 
Amir Rozwadowski

Barclays Capital, Inc.
 
Understanding that fluctuations in handset sales are the primary driver for 
your shift in your top line guidance policy, I was wondering if you could 
provide some color on how you think
 
about the cash flow trajectory of the 
business? John, I know you mentioned there are some fluctuations 
depending on the timing of FirstNet reimbursements this year, but how 
should we think about the long
-
term ability to grow cash flow organically 
against 
this evolving competitive landscape, and potentially inclusive of Time 
Warner?
 
John J. Stephens 
-
 
AT&T, Inc.
 
That's a good question, Amir. I mean, I feel really good about our 
opportunities to carry cash flow. And the best way I can explain it is what we 
s
aw on margins. The margins improvement was up and down from this cost 
initiatives, whether we talk about network function virtualization, whether 
we talk about digitization, whether we talk about automation, whether we 

 
even as we have some challenges wit
h regard to our legacy revenues, we 
have opportunities then to shed legacy costs.
 
So I'm comfortable with where we're at on cash flows for the year. I will also 
tell you, the oddity of it is, handsets slow down, we have the outlay for 
handsets on an up
-
fro
nt basis, and then receive monthly payments for the 

 
payments over time. So, as that happens, even with our next financing with 
the banks, it actually can relieve some of the pressure off of the companies 
because the next outlay for, if you will, the equi
pment outlay for handsets, 
actually slows.
 
You guys know the background on the Time Warner and its capability to 
generate cash, and its much different capital intensity structure, as well as 
its great margin business, so we're very excited on being able to
 
combine 
the two, about being able to farm out some growth initiatives and some cost 
savings, and so we look forward to that. We are still on a track to grow cash 
flows that we believe is so important, to not just 

 
and not at all 

 
I mean, 
it's very impor
tant to sustain and continue to grow the dividend. But not just 
that, but to create real wealth and opportunities and flexibility for the 
company on a going
-
forward basis.
 
Amir Rozwadowski

Barclays Capital, Inc.
 
Great. And then just one follow up, if I m
ay. Seems like we're beginning to 
see demonstrable shifts in the regulatory landscape. For example, as you 
mentioned, Randall, we saw recent developments in BDS legislation, and it 
also seems like we may see some updated thoughts on the future of net 
neutr
ality in the coming days. How do you feel about the prospects of your 
integrated service provider offering against this shifting regulatory 
backdrop? In other words, are there new opportunities for monetizing your 
portfolio of assets in ways that previousl
y may not have been available?
 
Randall L. Stephenson 
-
 
AT&T, Inc.
 
Yeah, it's an interesting question. I would tell you the area that we are most 
focused on, and we're obviously very cautious about ensuring that we get 
our customers' consent to use data. Bu
t as we bring Time Warner into the 
family at AT&T, we are convinced that we can really enhance Time Warner's 
advertising revenue streams by virtue of some of the customer data, the 
viewership data, that we have on the distribution side of the house.
 
And, a
s an example, we have a little advertising business on the AT&T side 
today. It's about a $1.5 billion business, and it's growing at double digits. 
And what we're doing with customer consent where appropriate, we're doing 
addressable advertising, and gettin
g very localized on the advertising that's 
delivered to our customers. And we're getting revenues per impression that 
are 3x and 4x what you would consider traditional revenue per impression in 
this industry.
 
Well, to what extent can we have that same type
 
of impact on the Time 
Warner, the Turner Network advertising revenues, which are much more 
substantial than the AT&T revenue streams? And so there are some 
opportunities there. As the rules are clarified as it relates to the utilization of 
data, and then 
we have our own policies in terms of getting customer 
consent and working hard to get our customer consent to do this. But this 
provides new opportunities for new revenue streams and just improving 
yield on existing revenue streams.
 
And then obviously ther
e was a lot of consternation at the end of last year 
with the former FCC surrounding things like sponsored data and set
-
top box 
and so forth. Well, all of those issues and those concerns are now gone, and 
so the ability to do some unique pricing on sponsor
ed data and so forth are 
now in front of us and available to us, and in a world of unlimited it changes 
how that looks and so forth. But as we have the need to use flexibility to 
differentiate our offers, it gives us some new opportunities to do those 
thin
gs. So we're actually very positive.
 
The thing I'm most encouraged about, though, with the new tone in the FCC, 
is it probably, Amir, doesn't offer a whole lot of new opportunity for new 
services, but it takes a decision point out of the investment philoso
phy. If 
you want to invest in a new capability, if you want to invest in fixed wireless 
local loop, if you want to invest in 5G, you don't have this stop, pause, how 
is this going to be regulated? We have a pretty good idea now that it's going 
to be regula
ted with somewhat of a light touch as long as there's 
competitive alternatives in the marketplace, and that just changes the whole 
investment philosophy, and I think it's going to free up investment as we 
move forward. And you combine that with tax reform,
 
I think even this 
industry that has been the top investor in the country for the last five years, 
this industry can actually go higher in investment if you get these kind of 
changes.

Thank you. Our next question is from Jennifer Fritzsche with Wells Fargo. 
Please go ahead.
 
Jennifer M. Fritzsche

Wells Fargo Securities LLC
 
Great. Thank you for taking the question. I wanted to ask about fiber. With 
Verizon's announcement last week, it's kind of a game
-
changer, as you 
alluded to, in terms of out
-
of
-
network footprint. And as you expand fiber, I 
assume it's easier to do so in yo
ur own ILEC footprint. What are your 
thoughts on outside that ILEC footprint? Will you pursue a similar path? And 
does that require further fiber investment or possible acquisitions? Thank 
you.
 
John J. Stephens 
-
 
AT&T, Inc.
 
So, Jennifer, let me take a stab
 
at it, and I'll ask Randall to comment on it. 
But first and foremost, I think we need to get some clarity with regard to 
how we measure fiber and whether you measure it by miles of fiber covered 
or by strands within the payer, within the fiber itself. Tha
t gives a 
differentiating aspect to the magnitude of the dollars being talked about in 
the marketplace. But you're right, we're on a significant investment in fiber 
with the 12.5 million fiber
-
to
-
the
-
prem, but quite frankly, because of our 
legacy of our bu
siness, both the local exchange business which we've held 
onto in that historic Bell operating company business which gives us a 
tremendous footprint, but also the legacy Long Lines business, which had 
fiber throughout the country. And so we do have more f
iber than anyone 
else as it exists today.
 
What we look at, though 

 
and we're open. We make evaluations on build or 
buy all the time with regard to backhaul for towers and that kind of fiber 
initiatives. What we will do is we will look at all the opportuni
ties out there 
and decide whether it's going to be cheaper to buy or build. But we are open 
to it. We believe we have a big lead because of what we've been doing over 
the last five years in our VIP investments. We believe we have a big lead 
because we have
 
the largest, if you will, legacy consumer business and the 
footprint associated with the Bell operating companies, and we also have a 
big lead with regard to the extensive fiber that was part of the AT&T Long 
Lines business. So when you put all of that to
gether, we feel very good 
about it. We continue to invest, I would suggest, at 

 
as much as, if not 
more than anybody's investing right now in fiber. It's very significant.
 
Randall L. Stephenson

AT&T, Inc.
 
I mean, we've talked about this for many years, 
Jennifer, and obviously, we 
gave some thought and consideration to would we create value if we 
separated our fixed line and our wireless business a few years ago. And I've 
got to tell you, the thing that caused you the greatest pause as you thought 
about d
oing those things was this wireless business is going to need the 
fiber access. It's going to need that last mile fixed line access. And so having 
a big footprint of fixed line access was always going to be critical.
 
And as we now move into the world of 5G
, as we're deploying fiber to 12.5 
million homes, it's just 

 
you're looking for the capillaries. If you deploy to a 
home, what capillaries does that make available for deploying small cells? 
What capillaries are now being run to businesses? And so it's ju
st 

 
it begins 
to feed on itself and the incremental costs of that next kind of layer of fiber 
goes down. And then, as John said, we make literally daily decisions outside 
our traditional footprint on lease versus buy, and there's plenty of fiber 
available
. Dark fiber is available in virtually all metropolitan areas, and so 
our ability to buy access to fiber for 5G is readily available. And where the 
cost or the availability isn't there, we will run fiber. So I think the U.S. is 
going to see a lot of fiber 
being deployed over the next few years as a 
byproduct of 5G, and I like where we stand in that race. I think we start with 
a head start.
 
John J. Stephens

AT&T, Inc.
 
Jennifer, one other thing I'd add is, and this could be repeated kind of on 
every questio
n we've had, but the FirstNet contract award and the 
requirements that it provides to build out a nationwide first responder 
network and the funding that it provides to do that, gives us a great 
opportunity to incorporate 

 
and the team has done this 

 
inc
orporate fiber 
builds and fiber requirements both 

 
not only for FirstNet in and of itself but 
anything they can leverage off of that. And we do this with building 

 
as 
we've talked about before with the one tower climb and putting the AWS
-
3, 
the WCS spect
rum to use at the same time we're doing the 700 MHz, but in 
all aspects of the FirstNet contract, it's providing us a real opportunity to 
leverage off the existing fiber and then to further add to what we consider to 
be the lead in that market that we have
.

John and Randall are taking too much time answering questions, aren't we?
 
Operator
 
Okay. Thank you. Then our final question will come from Simon Flannery 
wit
h Morgan Stanley. Go ahead, please.
 
Simon Flannery

Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
 
Thanks a lot. Many thanks. So, John, I understand the uncertainty around 
the phone sales. Maybe you could just talk a little bit about what exactly are 
you hearing from the field
? Is this the natural impact of EIP? Is this people 

 
just no form factor change? Do you expect this to come back? The Galaxy's 
obviously been delayed. Any more color around should we be thinking about 
there's something that has changed dramatically or thi
s is just a pause and 
we'll get back to some more normal rates? And then, Randall, just 
continuing on the fiber, you've talked about the 12 million. What's the 
strategy for the copper getting the speeds up to have a competitive 
broadband product there wher
e you may not be planning to roll fiber right 
now? What can you do with those lines to stay competitive? Thanks.
 
John J. Stephens 
-
 
AT&T, Inc.
 
Let me take the phone sales first, Simon. And quite frankly, you made a lot 
of the right points. The first thing 
is we are seeing a change with regard to 
next, if you will, and the impact that customers have 

 
are understanding 
the costs of a phone differently; they're reacting differently. We're saying 
that not only in the slower (1:00:44), but we continue to have i
n this kind of 
400,000 or 500,000 a quarter BYOD devices. So not only are they 

 
when 
they do buy another phone, they are holding onto the other one and handing 
it down, giving it to someone else to use. And so we're seeing that. That is 
an impact of it.
 
T
here has been a lot of discussion that most of the changes in the phone's 
capabilities are software enabled. We talk about it wanting to do it from our 
network perspective. We're seeing a little bit of it in the handset business, 
where the upgrades to the 
capabilities are software focused as opposed to 
form factors. So that's it. We are actually seeing, so to speak, a slowness in 
overall consumer activity. It seems like while the consumers 

 
the 
economics and the consumer world may be improving, it seems li
ke they're 
being very careful, and so that's a third thing.
 
We have studied it, everything from the amount of tax refund dollars that 
impacts and when that comes in to all those things we've looked at. I would 
suggest to you I think it is a more permanent 
change in the environment 
because of the change in who pays for it. I don't believe 

 
I'm not trying to 
suggest it's going to stay at this 30.9% rate. I would expect that it will come 
back, not only for new phones coming out but quite frankly, for example,
 
as 
we, if you will, get our network even hotwired more than it is as the Austin
-
type situation, where you can get multiple hundred meg speeds on your 
phones, you'll see people want to get those devices, so I think that'll help. 
But I clearly believe it is
 
a permanent change from where we were in the 
subsidy model, and I believe that the upgrade rates will be down on a 
permanent basis.
 
Simon Flannery 
-
 
Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
 
Okay.
 
Randall L. Stephenson 
-
 
AT&T, Inc.
 
And the copper plant, Simon, it's 
real simple. It's wireless. It's 5G and that's, 
I mean, we'll continue to push the envelope with fiber deeper and deeper, 
but you get to a place on the fixed line side where it doesn't make sense to 
keep running fiber and economically. And our default arch
itecture long
-
term, 
default architecture, is a wireless architecture, and so the world of 5G, that's 
when the copper gets replaced with a high
-
speed wireless offering to the 
home.
 
Simon Flannery 
-
 
Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
 
How close does the fiber have to g
et to the home for that vision?
 
Randall L. Stephenson 
-
 
AT&T, Inc.
 
It obviously depends on what speeds you want, right? But if you think about 
where we have copper today, you don't have a ton of situations where you 
need a gig of bandwidth. But, as we said
, our objective is to get a gig of 
bandwidth to everybody we touch. And so in a world of 5G, you should think 
of a 200
-
meter propagation, all right, so that takes a lot, but you don't need 
in suburban and rural America those kind of bandwidths to be compet
itive. 
And so you can go to your traditional cell structure, use more traditional 
spectrum positions, and get very competitive speeds in those areas with 
wireless, even with an LTE arrangement.
 
So think about the configuration in Austin. You're going to ge
t some serious, 
serious bandwidth there. You have the potential for 500 or 600 meg. Now, 
obviously on a loaded network you're going to get about a tenth of that, but 
50, 60 meg? That's a competitive offer, and we think we have a lot of legs 
with that and t
hat over time just keep pushing the small cell structure 
deeper and deeper.
 
John J. Stephens 
-
 
AT&T, Inc.
 
We haven't mentioned, and I think you all know this, but with the move 
towards carrier aggregation and four
-
way, which the Galaxy S8 has the 
capabilit
y of doing that, with regard to MIMO and the ability to have the on
-
 
and off
-
ramps operate much quickly and move into that QAM 256, all three 
of those things are now available for us, and we're working this true 
(1:04:49) our Austin, and we're seeing treme
ndous, tremendous results 
there. So that's what's so encouraging about us, particularly about this 
continuation of wireless and this opportunity to support an overall broadband 
solution, as well as coordinate it with a FirstNet build that is consistent wit
h 
the government's requirements.
 
Randall L. Stephenson

AT&T, Inc.
 
Okay. Thanks, Simon, I appreciate the question. With that, I want to thank 
everybody for being on the call and just a couple closing comments. It was a 
competitive quarter, both in wireles
s and video for us, and we took some 
steps and made some adjustments in the market to try and address this, 
and we'll continue to do that. But at the same time, we were able to grow 
adjusted earnings and adjusted margins in this environment as we drove 
cos
t out of the business, kept going hard on software
-
defined networking, 
and a year from now I think we're going to look back on the return to 
unlimited plans as the moment when the battle for network reach and 
capacity really began. And we're prepared for t
he fight, we're ready to go. 
And so, thanks again for being on the call, and as always, thank you for your 
interest in AT&T.

Welcome to the AT&T Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call. At this time, 
all participants are in a listen
-
only mode. Later, there will be a question
-
and
-
answer session. Instructions will be given at that time. [Operator 
Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.
 
I would now like to turn the conference over to your host Michael Viola, 
Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please, go ahead.
 
Michael Viola
 
Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Wel
come to our fourth quarter 
conference call. I'm Mike Viola, Head of Investor Relations for AT&T. And 
joining me on the call today is Randall Stephenson, AT&T's Chairman and 
CEO; John Stankey, Chief Operating Officer for AT&T; and John Stephens, 
AT&T's Chie
f Financial Officer.
 
Randall will begin the call with a brief overview of the 2019 accomplishments 
and a look at our three
-
year plans. John Stephens will then discuss fourth 
quarter results and then John Stankey will walk you through key areas of 
our 2020 
operating plan. John Stephens will then close the presentation with 
an update on our capital allocation plan and 2020 financial guidance. Then 
we'll take your questions.
 
Before I begin, I want to call your attention to our safe harbor statement, 
which says
 
that, some of our comments today may be forward
-
looking and 
as such, they're subject to risks and uncertainties. Results may differ 
materially and additional information is available on the Investor Relations 
website. I also want to remind you that we're 
in the quiet period for the FCC 
Spectrum Auction 103, so we cannot address any questions about that 
today. As always, our earnings materials are available on the Investor 
Relations page of the AT&T website. That includes our news release, investor 
briefing
, 8
-
K and other associated schedules.
 
And so, with that, I'm going to turn the call over to Randall Stephenson. 
Randall?
 
Randall Stephenson
 
Thanks, Mike. I want to start on slide three to close out 2019. And coming 
into 2019, we laid out a detailed plan fo
r the year and that plan was the 
series of specific steps necessary to exit 2019 on a path of sustained growth. 
A simple summary on slide three is that we met or exceeded every single 
one of those objectives and the road map is set for the next three years
.
 
I told you that our top priority for 2019 was to reduce our debt and exit the 
year at around 2.5 times debt to EBITDA, done. We have now reduced net 
debt by about $30 billion since we closed Time Warner. And at the end of 
2019, our net debt to adjusted E
BITDA was about 2.5 times.
 
We gave you the formula for exactly what it would take to get to this debt 
level. First, we would need to generate $26 billion of free cash flow, done. 
We exceeded that handily, generating a record $29 billion for the year. 
Secon
d, we would need to monetize non
-
strategic assets and generate $6 
billion to $8 billion of cash, done. We actually generated nearly $18 billion, 
more than double our target. And we've already announced an additional $2 
billion, which will close in 2020.
 
On
 
adjusted EPS, we came in right on plan, low single
-
digit growth. At 
WarnerMedia, we achieved the 2019 merger synergies and we're preparing 
to launch HBO Max in May. Growing wireless service revenues was critical 
and those revenues were up nearly 2% for th
e full year.
 
We stabilized Entertainment Group EBITDA and brought in our capital 
investment right on plan. And after sustained investment in our network, 
AT&T exited 2019 with the best and fastest wireless network in the United 
States. Our 5G network cover
s 50 million people today and we expect to 
have nationwide 5G coverage in the second quarter. As we look forward, our 
2019 performance positions us well for the next three years.
 
Our plan is very straightforward and we've laid it out for you on slide four.
 
We see revenue growth every year and expect a 1% to 2% three
-
year CAGR 
through 2022. By 2022, adjusted EBITDA margins expand by 200 basis 
points, adjusted EBITDA grows by about $6 billion, free cash flow is between 
$30 billion and $32 billion and adjusted
 
EPS grows to between $4.50 and 
$4.80.
 
This is a plan that generates a lot of cash over the next three years. And the 
Board has developed a very thoughtful capital allocation approach that will 
maintain a solid balance sheet and drive shareholder value. Fi
rst, we'll 
continue to invest aggressively and at top
-
tier levels into our core 
businesses. We expect to invest $20 billion in 2020.
 
Leading in 5G is critical for AT&T and we're not slowing down. We're more 
than 75% complete on our FirstNet build and that 
will continue. And we're 
continuing to deploy fiber. In terms of our capital structure, over the last 18 
months we've retired the lion's share of the debt we issued to acquire Time 
Warner. And we'll continue to pay down debt, but at a much slower pace. 
Our
 
cash will be focused over the next three years on retiring the shares we 
issued to acquire Time Warner. By the end of 2022, we will have retired 
100% of the debt and 70% of the shares from our Time Warner transaction. 
In fact, we retired 56 million of the
se shares in 2019.
 
We also plan to retire about 100 million more in the first quarter of this year 
to a $4 billion accelerated share repurchase agreement. By 2022, our 
leverage target is a very comfortable net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio of 
2.0 to 2.25 t
imes. You can also expect us to continue streamlining our 
portfolio as we monetize additional assets of $5 billion to $10 billion this 
year. And as I said earlier, we've already executed agreements that will 
generate $2 billion this year.
 
John Stephens wil
l cover the specific steps in the plan later. But first, he's 
going to cover our fourth quarter results. So I'll turn it over to you now 
John.
 
John Stephens
 
Thanks, Randall. Let me begin with the financial summary on slide 6. As 
Randall mentioned, we hit o
r exceeded all our 2019 targets. Let's take a 
closer look. We grew earnings. Adjusted EPS was $0.89, up 3.5% for the 
quarter and up 1.4% for the full year. Cash from operations came in strong 
at $11.9 billion for the quarter and $48.7 billion for the year.
 
Free cash flow 
was a record $29 billion for the full
-
year, up 30%.
 
The addition of WarnerMedia made an impact as did adding their receivables 
to our securitization efforts. Our ability to generate cash continues to provide 
a strong foundation for our capi
tal allocation plan. We continue to 
aggressively invest. CapEx was nearly $20 billion for the full year and total 
gross capital investment was $23.7 billion, when you include our 
investments in FirstNet and other vendor payments.
 
And without the impact of 
foreign exchange and forgone licensing revenue in 
advance of our HBO Max launch, fourth quarter and full year revenues would 
have been $48 billion and about $184 billion, representing growth in both 
the quarter and the year. Even with these items, operatin
g income margins 
were stable in the quarter and up 70 basis points for the year. All in all, a 
very good year as we hit our 2019 targets.
 
Let's now look at our segment operating results starting with our 
Communications segment on slide 7. In our Communicat
ions segment, 
mobility continues to build momentum and deliver solid results. Service 
revenue grew by about 2% in the quarter and for the year. EBITDA grew 
both in the quarter and for the year. And EBITDA margins expanded by 40 
basis points for the year, w
hile service margins were stable even with a 
heavily promotional fourth quarter.
 
Postpaid phone growth was solid adding 229,000 in the quarter. For the 
year, we had about one million phone net adds both postpaid and prepaid. 
This strong performance was dri
ven by our industry
-
leading network and 
came even while postpaid phone churn was up as competitors ramped up 
promotional efforts. You should note total churn postpaid and prepaid 
combined improved year
-
over
-
year by 12 basis points.
 
As Randall mentioned, ou
r Entertainment Group hit its full year target of 
EBITDA stability. Long
-
term customer value continues to be our focus as we 
head into 2020. That focus has helped drive growth in video and IP 
broadband ARPUs. AT&T Fiber continues to grow adding nearly 200,
000 
customers. That brings us to nearly four million AT&T Fiber customers and 
we have lots of room left to grow.
 
Premium video net losses improved sequentially by more than 200,000 
subscribers, but video losses continue to impact our broadband numbers, 
esp
ecially our bundled customers. Our new simplified video offerings position 
us for the long term and our subscriber trends are improving.
 
Let's turn to Business Wireline. The trends in Business Wireline continued to 
improve. Revenues grew sequentially and w
ere down just 1.7% year
-
over
-
year. And when you include wireless, Business Solutions grew 1.1%. EBITDA 
was relatively steady in the quarter and EBITDA margins were up 40 basis 
points.
 
Let's move to WarnerMedia and Latin America results, which are on 
slide 8. 
WarnerMedia had a great quarter when you consider the decision to forego 
content licensing revenue. Subscriber revenue growth at both Turner and 
HBO combined with lower film and television production cost at Warner Bros. 
helped to offset that pres
sure.
 
We made the strategic decision to give HBO Max exclusive streaming rights 
for top programs including Friends, Big Bang Theory and other popular 
shows. In the past, we would have sold these externally.
 
Looking at the impact on the fourth quarter, Warn
erMedia revenues would 
have grown by about 10% if these shows would have been sold. In fact that 
10% organic growth would represent WarnerMedia's best growth rate in 
three years. And EBITDA would have increased by about $300 million or 
about 11%. Obviously
 
this has an upfront cost for us, but we see this as an 
investment that makes HBO Max even stronger and will pay off over the 
long
-
term.
 
The big news in our Latin American operations is Mexico turning EBITDA 
positive in the quarter. The team has done an ex
cellent job of reducing costs 
and growing revenue in a challenging environment.
 
Fourth quarter Mexico EBITDA improved nearly $200 million year
-
over
-
year 
and improved by more than $300 million for the full year. We continue to 
press for further gains.
 
A new
 
wholesale agreement with Telefónica will add to both revenues and 
EBITDA. Going forward we expect continued improvement. Vrio continues to 
work against economic and foreign exchange headwinds. But even in this 
environment, it continues to be profitable an
d generate positive cash flows.
 
Now, let me turn it over to John Stankey to cover our 2020 operating plan 
and then I'll come back and discuss a capital allocation update. John?
 
John Stankey
 
Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. Starting on slide 10. Th
ese are 
the four key areas of our 2020 operating plan where we'll be focused in 
executing to drive our performance.
 
I'll go into some detail on each of these over the next few minutes but I'll 
give you the headlines first. Number one is continuing our mome
ntum in 
mobility because we expect mobility will continue to be the biggest driver of 
revenue growth and profitability and be a key factor in meeting our 2020 
goals.
 
Second, a successful launch of HBO Max is critical to our plans in each of the 
next three 
years. Many of you are with us for the Analyst Day in October and 
have seen firsthand why we're so excited about HBO Max and the 
opportunities it gives us. We're right on track to launch it in May.
 
Third, is growing our broadband revenues by increasing our
 
fiber 
penetration. Key to this will be bundling our fiber broadband offer with AT&T 
TV, which is delivered over our software based video architecture.
 
And finally, we're laser focused on improving both the effectiveness and the 
efficiency of our overall o
perations and as a result, driving additional costs 
out of the business.
 
Let me dive into each of these four drivers beginning with mobility on slide 
11. Last year our wireless network was recognized as the nation's best and 
also fastest thanks in part to 
our FirstNet build. In fact, we did a few of our 
own spot test in December to see how our existing nationwide 5G evolution 
network compared to the 5G network one of our competitors rolled out last 
month.
 
In three out of the four test cities, our network ha
d faster speeds and lower 
latency on average. The point is our strong spectrum position gives us a leg 
up and allows us to execute a different 5G deployment strategy than our 
competitors. We have the low and mid
-
band spectrum to deploy 5G 
nationwide. We co
ver 50 million people today and expect to be nationwide in 
the second quarter.
 
We also have the millimeter wave spectrum we need to deploy 5G+ and its 
gigabit speeds and super low latency to more densely populated cities. We're 
in 35 cities today and we're
 
adding more this year. There's an important 
point to be made here once we have 5G nationwide. As you know 
smartphone upgrades across the industry have been down for a while now. 
In fact, we're coming off a record low upgrade rate for any fourth quarter in
 
our history.
 
But fast forward to the back half of this year when popular 5G smartphones 
and devices should be more available at scale, you can expect higher 
upgrade rates and equipment revenue growth.
 
The timing for this upgrade cycle couldn't be more per
fect when you 
consider that we'll be offering HBO Max on our highest ARPU wireless plans 
with features tuned for premium media consumption and at a time when 
people are coming into our stores to upgrade.
 
It's a natural opportunity to further the distributi
on of HBO Max, while 
adding new mobility subscribers and improving our wireless ARPUs. HBO 
Max's content has something for everyone in the family and that makes it a 
natural fit for our nearly 25 million postpaid accounts that average more 
than three lines
 
per account.
 
As a result, we expect our wireless service revenue growth rate to be higher 
in 2020. And after adding nearly 1 million phone net adds in 2019, both 
postpaid and prepaid, we expect 2020 will be an even better year for net 
adds.
 
FirstNet plays
 
an important role here. We now serve more than 10,000 first 
responder agencies and more than 1 million connections with FirstNet. We 
expect those numbers will grow nicely as our FirstNet deployment reaches 
80% in new devices and capabilities come to marke
t in the coming months.
 
We also expect a higher adoption of our unlimited plans. We're at a little 
more than 50% penetration today, but we expect the 5G device upgrade 
cycle will bring into our stores lots of customers not on unlimited plans 
today.
 
Increas
ing the adoption of our best unlimited plans is obviously an ARPU 
growth opportunity for us. And when you add into the mix the customers on 
select unlimited plans will get HBO Max for free, it's a great opportunity to 
also improve our overall churn which w
e've seen happen from giving HBO to 
current unlimited customers.
 
A reduction of one basis point of wireless churn across the base is worth 
about $100 million to us annually. Sum it up; we're expecting growth of 
more than 2% in mobility service revenues thi
s year.
 
Let's go to Slide 12 and the headlines for why we believe HBO Max will be a 
game
-
changer for our customers and for AT&T. I expect many of you were 
at the HBO Max Analyst Day in October and you heard me talk about the 
three pillars required for succ
ess in streaming; premier content; the 
technology platform; and marketing and distribution. Only AT&T has a space 
with a solid footing in all three.
 
My excitement and confidence in the HBO Max opportunity have only grown 
since then. The team has made treme
ndous progress in every area and 
we're on track to launch in May with a unique offering. Quite simply, we 
believe HBO Max will be the highest quality premium SVOD in the market 
with a great experience, better curation, and higher percentage of culturally 
r
elevant offerings than competing products.
 
We're excited to launch HBO Max coming off the tail end of one of our 
strongest awards seasons ever with new and exciting breakthrough offerings 
leading the way. We captured an industry
-
leading 34 Emmys and six Go
lden 
Globe awards. Joker had more Academy Award nominations than any other 
film, highlighting our deep and diverse theatrical content.
 
The awards are only the latest indicator that we continue to create high
-
quality culturally relevant content that appeals
 
to a broad consumer base. 
And our additional investment in great content is only going to expand the 
appeal of the service. With HBO Max, we'll offer consumers more than twice 
the amount of programming for the same price as HBO today.
 
We're making 
great progress on the HBO product platform as well. Our 
controlled nonpublic beta is getting solid reviews and we're gaining 
invaluable feedback on important but subtle issues like user navigation and 
screen layout. This work is no less important than awar
d
-
winning content.
 
Finally, we continue to fine
-
tune our go
-
to
-
market plans consistent with the 
unique position with which we enter the market, leveraging our extensive 
AT&T distribution and embedded base of more than 30 million domestic HBO 
subscribers. W
e're in active discussions across our potential distribution 
partners both digital platforms and MVPDs. We're making progress and we 
expect we'll have deals to announce prior to launch.
 
Our focus continues to be on providing a compelling value proposition 
for our 
HBO distribution partners and our mutual customers. Our more than 10 
million HBO subscribers on AT&T distribution platforms will be offered 
immediate access to HBO Max at launch, so we'll get off to a fast start.
 
To drive incremental growth, we hav
e unique advantages when combining 
media and distribution including our 170 million direct customer 
relationships across mobile, pay TV and broadband. Plus, we have 5500 
retail stores who will be focused on driving incremental HBO Max adoption 
by bundling 
it with premium
-
tiered wireless, broadband or pay TV offers.
 
And we'll use AT&T customer insights for WarnerMedia advertising analytics 
and curation. We have very high expectations for HBO Max. And at the same 
time we're thrilled about the possibilities of
 
increasing the adoption of higher 
ARPU services and strengthening the long
-
term value proposition of our 
highest quality and highest ARPU customers. We fully expect HBO Max will 
have a positive and immediate impact on the stickiness of our wireless and 
pa
y TV and broadband offerings.
 
Now let's look at Entertainment Group. Those details are on Slide 13. Our EG 
team delivered our target of stable EBITDA last year. In 2020 you're going 
to see us apply the same high
-
value customer
-
centric focus, while increasi
ng 
our fiber customer base and launching AT&T TV. We'll see higher 
amortization cost in the video business in the first quarter which creates 
some tough year
-
over
-
year comparisons for EG EBITDA but on a cash from 
operations basis we expect EG to be stable 
in 2020 versus last year.
 
We believe the greatest opportunity within EG is to significantly grow our 
AT&T Fiber customer base and broadband revenues. We have 4 million fiber 
customers today and our recent fiber expansion gives us 14 million locations 
to se
ll into. Based on our fiber sales experience we expect to exit 2022 with 
about 3 million more fiber customers than we have today or a total of about 
7 million. This will be a significant lift in market share compared to our 
traditional performance in our l
egacy hybrid fiber copper
-
based footprint.
 
It represents an organic market share growth opportunity on an existing 
product that I've never experienced in my career. Where we offer 
competitive broadband speeds you can expect that we'll lean into video 
acqui
sition given the better economics of our improved product portfolio 
including AT&T TV and HBO Max all software
-
based products with low 
acquisition costs.
 
Within our broadband footprint expected as we exit the year our premium 
video subscriber declines will
 
be more in line with overall video industry 
trends. Looking at our total premium video customer base, we expect year
-
over
-
year improvements in the subscriber losses.
 
Now let's turn to Slide 14 to talk about our efficiency and cost initiatives. 
New work to
 
improve the overall efficiency and effectiveness of our 
operations has progressed over the past few months. We previously shared 
with you that we're targeting an additional 4% reduction in labor
-
related 
costs including benefits and contract employees in 2
020 alone.
 
That work will ramp quickly and we plan for it to deliver $1.5 billion in 
additional cost savings. In fact we've already identified and implemented 
about half of those savings. Another significant opportunity for us is product 
information techno
logy rationalization. We feel comfortable that we can 
generate another $2 billion of annual run rate efficiencies exiting 2022. This 
will come from thinning our product portfolio, simplifying our market offers, 
rationalizing call centers, modernizing our i
nformation technology and 
enhancing the level of customer self support.
 
In addition, streamlining will have the added benefit of enhancing our 
market agility and ultimately lead to improved market effectiveness. Our 
assessment work continues and I expect i
n the next 90 days we'll have 
additional efficiency initiatives underway for some of our network, corporate, 
sales and procurement functions.
 
I'll turn it back to John now for his look at capital allocation 2020 financial 
guidance.
 
John Stephens
 
Thanks, Jo
hn. Strengthen our balance sheet was our top priority last year 
and our teams did an excellent job of reducing debt and monetizing our 
asset portfolio. This allowed us to begin retiring shares at the end of last 
year while still meeting our net debt ratio 
goals.
 
In 2020, you can expect that momentum to continue. It all starts with 
strong free cash flows. We had record free cash flow last year and expect to 
be in a similar range this year. We achieved this even with some voluntary 
funding for retiree medical
 
costs and higher tax payments in the fourth 
quarter.
 
We also overachieved on asset monetizations. We expect to do another $5 
billion to $10 billion net monetizations this year with significant efforts 
already underway. At the same time, we continue to evo
lve our capital 
structure. We added more preferred to our capital stack last year when we 
monetized more than $6 billion of our long
-
term tower purchase options. 
And we also issued $1.2 billion of traditional preferred stock.
 
The publicly traded preferred 
stock is new to us but there is a market for it 
and it provides investors another alternative to invest with AT&T. In fact, 
these shares are currently trading at a premium to par. Investors are 
looking for secured dependable returns, which is exactly what 
this offers. 
And dividend rates at less than our common stock dividend yield make it 
attractive for us.
 
The tower preferreds also allow us to use very long
-
term assets to generate 
cash in a tax
-
efficient manner. We also continue to be focused on our three
-
year debt reduction targets. Depending on the timing of share retirements 
and asset monetizations, you will see our net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratios 
fluctuate throughout the year but we expect to continue reducing debt for 
the full year and intend to tar
get leverage in the two to 2.25 range by the 
end of 2022.
 
Our share retirement has begun in earnest. We told you we wanted to buy 
shares as early in the year as possible and that is what you're seeing. 
Thanks to our $4 billion ASR, we've already bought bac
k about 85 million 
shares in January and expect to see another 20 million in the remainder of 
the first quarter.
 
You can expect us to continue to buy back shares during the remainder of 
the year and meet or exceed our 250 million share retirement target fo
r 
2020. That's on top of the 56 million shares we bought back in 2019. We 
have a lot of levers we can pull to optimize our capital structure. We're 
focused on managing debt and have a wealth of opportunities with our 
balance sheet as we showed last year. Y
ou can expect us to continue to 
manage it in a prudent way including issuing additional preferred shares.
 
Now let me revisit our 2020 guidance on Slide 17. Our guidance remains 
consistent with what we told you in October. This year more so than most, 
our r
esults will be more weighted to the second half of the year. For 
example, in the first part of the year, we expect pressure from heavy HBO 
Max investment, which you saw begin in the fourth quarter.
 
And in EG, higher content and noncash amortization costs a
s well as 
continued pressure on video subs. But in the second half of the year you will 
see our momentum build. For example, share retirements have been 
aggressive and will continue and the EPS benefits will flow increasingly 
throughout the year.
 
HBO Max w
ill have launched leading to strong subscriber growth. The run 
rate benefits of our cost reduction plans will be clearly visible. And 5G 
combined with HBO Max will drive more upgrades and stronger wireless 
revenue growth later in the year. Again, all of th
is has been factored into our 
full year guidance.
 
With that in mind, here's what we've committed to: 1% to 2% revenue 
growth; adjusted EPS of $3.60 to $3.70 a share; stable adjusted EBITDA 
margins; free cash flow in the $28 billion range, with our dividend
 
payout 
ratio in the low 50s; gross capital investment in the $20 billion range and 
this doesn't include our investments in content; continued debt reduction 
with share retirement of 250 million or more common shares in 2020; and 
our net asset monetization
s between $5 billion and $10 billion.
 
Mike, that concludes our presentation. We're now ready for Q&A.
 
Michael Viola
 
Operator, we'll take the first question.

Operator
 
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question 
comes from the line of 
John Hodulik. Please, go ahead.
 
John Hodulik
 
Great. Thank you. Maybe a couple of questions for John Stankey. Yes. 
Thanks for the commentary on the entertainment sub trends, but maybe a 
little bit more clarity. I mean, first of all, y
ou saw a slowdown in fiber adds in 
the quarter. What was driving that? And, I guess, in conjunction with the 
guidance for sort of more improvement in the back end of the year, do you 
expect that trend to reverse?
 
Or when 
--
 
how do you expect those adds to 
sort of play out over the course 
of the year? And what drives the acceleration? And then, in terms of the 
HBO Max guidance, the $500 million in incremental expense we saw in 2019, 
does that impact your guidance for the $2 billion in 2020? Thanks.

Hi, John. Happy New Year. So, first of all, fourth quarter of 2019, fourth 
quarter is seasonally a slower quarter. December is a pretty slow month in 
general for home
-
based services, given the dynamics of the holiday and the 
like, so that's part of the
 
contribution to the issue of the slowdown.
 
The second is, our gross add performance on video wasn't strong. You see 
the subscriber trends. As we've shared with you, as we move through this 
year and we start shifting to AT&T TV, our gross add performance s
tarts to 
get much stronger. And naturally, when you're able to put AT&T TV, a 
software
-
based product with fiber, it's a much more natural combination 
than a satellite dish and fiber. And so, as we start to roll out AT&T TV now in 
markets and we move in, we
're going to see much stronger performance on 
the fiber side.
 
I'll tell you, as I look at where we are right now in current customer trends, I 
feel pretty good that that's, in fact, the case and we're going to be where we 
need to be on that. Frankly, it's 
not a hard sell. It's a great product. It's a 
product that customers like. I think, we could do very well with it and I don't 
expect that we're going to see that continue through. So, that's what I 
would tell you. You're going to see recovery in 2020.
 
On t
he Max side, we gave you a range on what to expect in 2020 in terms of 
dilution, that we're not changing any of that range. The range is a range for 
a reason. There's a lot of moving parts on Max introduction. It's a 
combination of both, going to market wi
th subscribers and it's a product 
that's going to continue to grow over the coming years.
 
And we're going to be looking in the market for opportunities for other 
content acquisition and the like. And it's entirely possible, we may be 
opportunistic, or look
 
at something and we want the management team to 
have that flexibility to be able to balance those things out. We have 
subscriber growth coming and things are working well with our strategies. 
We make it a little heavier on trying to build up subscribers a
nd what we 
expected.
 
I think, that's the nature of building a new and subscription
-
oriented 
business. And so, that range is important that we have the flexibility for the 
management team to do what they want to do. We feel very strongly we're 
going to get 
back that investment as we build this new distribution platform 
over the coming years, that's why we're doing this. We like the dynamic of 
ultimately having some control of those customers and being in a position 
where we can manage that life cycle going f
orward. And we think it's a good 
smart long
-
term investment.
 
John Hodulik
 
Okay. Thanks, John.

Your next question comes from the line of Philip Cusick. Please go ahead.
 
Philip Cusick
 
Hi, guys. Thanks. John, can you update us on the WarnerMedia stra
tegy 
from here away from Max? We see video industry bundled units declining 
pretty quickly even away from you as you decelerate. How does that change 
your thoughts on Turner over time and the strategic value there?
 
And then can you also give us an update o
n the low
-
value video subs that 
are remaining in the base and how those should come out over the next few 
quarters? Thanks very much.
 
John Stankey
 
Sure. Happy to do that Phil. So, if you step back and think about the position 
we sit in the 
--
 
what I would 
call the traditional pay TV universe, I mean 
everybody knows it's in transition. And it's a mature product that's kind of 
working its way through the back end of a life cycle. But I like where we 
stand in that and that our total percentage of cost of goods
 
sold in that 
space relative to the size of the bundle that the customer buys is not huge.
 
Our network portfolio is a fairly concentrated network portfolio. If you think 
about it the bulk of our profitability comes from three primary networks, its 
TNT, TBS
, and CNN. And I think if you look at trends, we all know that 
general entertainment content and the bundle is not performing as well and 
the nice part about our two general entertainment networks TNT and TBS, 
these are really hybrids. They're a combinatio
n of general entertainment and 
sports. And so they historically perform at the upper end of desirability from 
a ratings perspective and attractiveness from an advertisers' perspective 
because of that mix of content that we have. So, one having more contain
ed 
portfolio; and two, having that mix of content I think is important to 
basically ride through this transition and have some resiliency.
 
And my view of what's been happening in most carriage agreement 
negotiations, as we go back out in the market and ren
ew things is our 
distributors see that and understand that those are important networks to 
carry forward. And we're continuing to see that people place value on those 
things even in a more skinny down or a smaller pay TV universe moving 
forward and feel pr
etty good about that.
 
Now, let's be clear, the reason we're doing Max is we also know that new 
distribution platforms need to be out there that are the growth platforms 
and that match general entertainment content how consumers want to see 
them. And that p
ivot between what we're doing with linear networks and 
what we're doing with Max is a key part of the WarnerMedia strategy. It's an 
important dance and choreography that we have to do to get that right. And 
we feel we're positioned very well and make that 
happen. We spent a lot of 
time in the Investor Day explaining why we think it's a natural place to go.
 
To keep the networks relevant what you should expect us to do, we will 
continue to invest that 
--
 
in them. We'll continue to make sure that they're 
viabl
e for our distributors, but you'll see the content shift start to occur a 
little bit. What we see with subscribers is that obviously they like news and 
sports. They also like content that's socially relevant. And so probably a mix 
of starting to see a litt
le bit more unscripted content come in, things that 
cause people go into the office and talk about it around the water cooler. 
And that will probably start to supplant hours. It might have been more 
general entertainment
-
oriented content that you are going
 
to see showing 
up on SVOD platforms like HBO Max moving forward.
 
And we think that mix in conjunction with what we're doing with Max will 
allow us to ensure that the content we're producing in our great studios 
across our different brands will have a plac
e to market that we can monetize 
with end user either through distributors in the traditional fashion or through 
direct
-
to
-
consumer constructs where maybe we have a direct relationship 
with the customer.
 
On the subscriber pay TV low
-
value construct, look w
e're mostly through 
that. I would tell you we've got a little bit more work to do on some 
promotional roll
-
offs in the first quarter that is going to continue to show up. 
And when we shared 
--
 
as I shared earlier, what's going to happen on 
subscriber trend
s that I think will be more at the rate of decline by the time 
we exit this year, you should expect you're going to see continuing 
improvement in our subscriber trends each quarter as we move through.
 
But I will tell you, you just can't flip a switch 
and get there overnight. And 
that's why I'm kind of suggesting you should think that we're on a glide path 
to get back to that ratable decline with subscriber base decline in the 
aggregate pay TV industry by the time we exit the year.
 
We're going to see pr
obably our heaviest losses in first quarter. When I look 
at what's happening from an operational performance perspective and what 
the team is doing on gross add improvements, what we're seeing in churn 
improvements, the rollout of AT&T TV that really hits 
its stride in the second 
quarter in terms of its availability across the customer base, we'll start to 
see those subscriber trends incrementally improve as those capabilities start 
to roll into the base. And we'll get to what I just indicated by the time w
e 
exit the year.

John Stankey
 
Thanks.
 
Randall Stephenson
 
Take the next question Greg.
 
Operator
 
Your next question comes from the line of Simon Flannery. Please go ahead.
 
Simon Flannery
 
Great, good morning. Thank 
you. Randall, we put out a lot of targets here 
for 2020 and beyond. Perhaps you could just share about how the executive 
incentives are being set up for the year, what the KPIs and metrics are. I 
know last year deleveraging was I think 25% of the short 
--
 
or 20% of the 
short
-
term comp. So any color you could give around what the two or three 
key focuses are for the year?
 
And then one for John Stankey, you talked about the investment in the 
network, the capacity there. I think in the past you've talked about
 
the 
opportunities in the wholesale market. Perhaps you could just give us an 
update on how things are going there and the opportunity perhaps to sign 
up some cable companies. Thanks.
 
Randall Stephenson
 
Hi, Simon this is Randall. Yeah, as you articulated a
nd for those who aren't 
familiar, coming into 2019 I told all of you that our number one priority for 
2019 was to reduce our debt and get our leverage ratios down to 2.5 times 
debt
-
to
-
EBITDA. And it was going to require strong cash flow generation, 
selling
 
some non
-
core assets. All that was instrumental in getting there. And 
to really drive at home and get the focus for the management team as you 
said, we set that debt
-
to
-
EBITDA target as a significant amount of executive 
compensation and mission accomplish
ed.
 
I think the team executed at an amazing level in terms of identifying asset 
opportunities to dispose, getting those things driven through the process, 
negotiated actually getting good prices for all of those assets and then 
driving just strong cash flo
ws and some impressive working capital 
opportunities we're taking advantage of and these working capital initiatives 
that are put in place are not one and done. What we're most excited about 
are these are working capital initiatives that are repeatable. An
d so I feel 
really good about our ability to generate in 2020 even with the HBO Max 
investments another $28 billion of free cash flow.
 
Coming into this year, the debt objective of 2.5 times isn't what we're 
working towards. What we're working towards is ma
king sure we're 
continuing to generate the cash flow to execute the broader capital 
allocation strategy, meaning more specifically retiring the shares we issued 
for Time Warner. And as both John Stephens and I articulated in our opening 
comments that is a 
focus, and our objective is to retire at least 250 million 
additional shares this year. We'll get about 100 million of those knocked out 
in the first quarter. And there's at least 150 million more to be coming in the 
back part of the year that will generat
e nice EPS accretion as we move 
throughout the course of the year.
 
And so all that said, the management team is going to be focused on hitting 
these earnings objectives that we've laid out for you and the cash flow 
targets. And that's what compensation wil
l be really focused on. And I think 
it's going to be effective in generating the cash we need to execute the 
share buyback programs and the overall capital allocation strategy.
 
John Stankey
 
Simon thanks for asking the question, because I think it highlight
s a really 
important aspect of how we're going to grow wireless revenues next year, 
because we already have that strength as you indicated the network 
performance and that perception.
 
As we do research out the market is now starting to grow amongst the 
cus
tomer base. I think we have some plans to even fine
-
tune our brand 
positioning messages as we move into this year a little bit more. And we 
know that as we move that perception, which is happening right now, we 
see momentum in subscriber growth.
 
And so we'
ve got just pure subscriber economics that are going to help us 
there, make some shifts in distribution. We've got the tailwinds of FirstNet 
behind us, which are starting to help us dramatically. And I think the 
coverage improvements that occur as we get i
nto the second phase of 
FirstNet will allow us to move through that. And then we talked about just a 
few minutes ago what we're doing on the upgrade cycles and the Max 
launch. There's a lot of good things moving our direction what I would call 
the core org
anic part of the wireless business to grow revenues.
 
And frankly over the last several years, our wholesale business had been a 
bit of a headwind in our wireless business, because we didn't have the flash 
capacity that we've now been able to turn up with t
hese key investments 
over the last 1.5 years.
 
We're now in a much different position than we've historically been and 
where we've had to be very guarded about our wholesale position largely 
because we needed capacity to support our retail base.
 
And we're n
ow, I think in a position in the industry when I look at what has 
to happen with people either in a deal or no
-
deal situation in spectrum and 
their spectrum holdings that we are probably more flashed than others in 
the industry. And we can in fact play in 
a different way in the wholesale 
space.
 
We're not just focused on cable. I think we want to do as I've indicated 
previously the right deal, a deal that's constructive for the industry in 
general. Certainly if there was an opportunity to do something in tha
t space, 
we might do it. But there's a lot of other wholesale options out there that we 
expect to lean into and I expect we can step up to in the most accretive 
fashion possible.
 
And what I would indicate to you that I think whether you believe a T
-
Mobile,
 
Sprint deal occurs or doesn't occur either way they are going to need 
to be partners in the industry that need to round out networks and do some 
things differently. And we would also try to understand whether or not we 
have other partners in the industry 
or merging partners in the industry that 
we can help with on the wholesale side.
 
So, there are plenty of options for us to go and start pulling that wholesale 
lever and driving it up. And I think that will be an incremental difference for 
us than what we'v
e seen over the last couple of years that we've been 
managing that number down.
 
John Stephens
 
Simon to add to what John said, this is the first year that we've had stable 
reseller revenues throughout the year. And in fact sequentially, we grew 
reseller revenues and in year
-
over
-
year and the fourth quarter. So what 
John is talking about, we are not only well positioned for, but it's starting in 
a small way right now but with the opportunity to make much bigger. It's 
already occurring and it's con
tributing to that service revenue growth that 
we've had both in the quarter and the year.
 
Simon Flannery
 
Thanks.
 
John Stankey
 

 
Operator
 
Your next question comes from the line of David Barden.
 
David Barden
 
Hey guys
. Thanks for taking the question. I guess two, first John Stankey 
your 
--
 
it sounds like you guys really have bought into this idea of 5G 
smartphone super cycle. And I feel like that is not a consensus view. I know 
that there's a lot of debate about it int
ernally here between our tech guys 
and our chipset guys and our phone guys.
 
And so if you could kind of give us some perspective on where that 
conviction comes from that that we're going to get enough of a boost in 
demand for products that, I don't know th
at the consumers really 
understand it's a lot different than what they're already buying that would be 
super helpful?
 
And then John Stephens, could you walk us through the science behind this 
kind of new embrace of the preferred securities? Because it seem
s a little 
odd to be buying back stock, but then at the same time issuing preferred 
stock and debt has deductible interest and preferreds don't. And so I think 
that there's some confusion as to kind of what the net benefit to the equity 
holder is of kind o
f looking at preferreds and capital stack? Thank you.
 
John Stankey
 
Dave so I don't know that I would use the term super cycle. I don't look at 
the plan and say, we're expecting a super cycle. But we are expecting an 
increase or a step
-
up in what's occurrin
g. And look I think that the 
foundation of that assumption is based on we've done a couple of different 
area interface changes. We did the UMTS air interface change. We did the 
LTE air interface change. And I think there were similar discussions going on 
a
t that point in time.
 
Well will somebody really need the increased LTE speed over UMTS? It works 
perfectly fine. And I would tell you we do see this step
-
up occur because 
naturally speaking people have a tendency to sit around and run speed test 
on their d
evices. And when somebody next to them is getting better 
performance, it raises awareness amongst the subscriber base.
 
And I expect that there's going to be a certain number of folks who look at 
that and just say because that device performs better because
 
these new 
devices have access to a much broader swath of bands it's going to perform 
better. And we are going to see a degree of uptick simply because the 
subscriber base is going to notice that there is a degree of performance 
etcetera as a result of tha
t.
 
Secondly as I said we're going to be driving some of this ourselves. We're 
going to be out there with some pretty aggressive promotion on HBO Max 
and we're going to be tying these to our better plans. And when you look at 
what we're assuming in our busi
ness plan for the year, our increases in the 
number of customers moving into unlimited aren't crazy silly step function 
changes. They're more of the trend and taking advantage of the fact that we 
are going to put more advertising dollars into the market to
 
support Max and 
support 5G.
 
And we'll get some nominal uptick in what those migrations into our higher
-
value unlimited plans are. So we want to stimulate some of that. We're 
coming off of historic lows of upgrades. And we think the market is set up to 
bas
ically go through renewal cycle given, how we're promoting. It's coming 
at the end of the year in the holiday season. There's going to be better 
networks out there. We do expect there's going to be an uptick in the 
upgrade cycle. Super cycle maybe a little
 
bit too strong a word than an 
uptick yes.
 
David Barden
 
Got it.
 
John Stephens
 
And just to add to what John said, we have had three years here of very low 
upgrade rates. Just to some extent people are going to need new phones. 
And so this is just also this 
aging of the phone base has been occurring over 
multiple years. Secondly, this is the first time we're going to have a 5G 
network up and running and available before the devices are out, the next
-
generation networks in there. And as John made very clear, t
he HBO Max 
and other products we have they would really meld well. The convergence of 
all three of those things is going to be really attractive for us.
 
With regard to the science of a preferred it's simply this. The market is open 
to it. Investors want it
. They like this certainty. At today's rates, our 
preferred that's out there is actually trading below 5% yield about a 4.7%, 
4.8%. I am seeing it today about a 4.8% yield. So that's lower cash cost 
than our common dividend, so that saves us money there. S
econdly, as you 
know they don't share in the common profits of it. Third, it's a diversification 
for us. And so it gives us an opportunity to go into a different investor base. 
So just like we had done over the last 10 years have really diversified our 
deb
t base. This gives us an opportunity to diversify our shareholder base. 
And we believe that that's good for everybody and also allows us to bring in 
the volume or the quantum of common shares that are out there.
 
Additionally, when you look at the preferred
 
partnership interest that we've 
done and the preferred interest, we've done there, that has a very efficient 

 
those dividend costs are much lower, because they're very tax efficient. So 
those costs get well below 4%. And once again, they allow us to give
 
recognition to assets that people may not have realized. For example, our 
tower receivables and over $6 billion worth of real option cash that we have 
a high likelihood of getting, I don't know that anybody was paying much 
attention to that. Now it gives 
us the opportunity to put that spotlight that 
we really already achieved that value. So 

 
but the clear science of the 
preferred is; one, the dividend costs are lower than our common; second, 
they're stable and our common is going to continue to grow; thir
d, it gets us 
to another market segment, another investor base which is helpful; and 
fourth, that allows us to reduce the reliance on the common share base 
that's out there. For that perspective, we feel very good about. I feel like it's 
a really 

 
it's a 
good move for all of our shareholders.
 
Michael Viola
 
Thanks, Dave. Greg, we will take the next question.
 
Operator
 
Your next question comes from the line of Michael Rollins. Please go ahead.
 
Michael Rollins
 
Thanks and good morning. If you fast 
forward to the end of your financial 
plan in 2022 given the CapEx that you've articulated, can you frame what 
the network capabilities are going to look like for 5G mobile, fixed wireless 
broadband coverage, and fiber
-
to
-
the
-
home coverage? And then secondl
y, 
can you just unpack a little more of what you see driving the strength in 
industry wireless postpaid phone net add? And as you look at your own 
customer trend are you seeing any meaningful differences in customers and 
markets that have 5G evolution vers
us those that haven't received it yet? 
Thanks.
 
John Stankey
 
Sure. So, Mike, let me see, if I can hit a combination of things you laid out. 
So first of all, I think one of the significant shifts you'll see in 2022 by the 
time we get to that point and a lot 
of this is being driven by work on FirstNet 
is I think we'll be in a much better position on macro coverage and not only 
from a number of square miles, but I think you're going to see the 
improvement in core interior performance given how we densify things
 
to 
support our FirstNet subscribers and the agencies we have there. And as I 
said, this is really 

 
where last year was a year of us getting coverage 

 
macro coverage in place kind of getting the umbrella, the footprint turned up 
this year is where we do 
a lot of the 

 
make the network better stuff. So 
we've been doing all the site acquisition, all the fill
-
in. And we start turning 
up sites and just going to make the network better. It's going to make the 
network better on the inside of a building that's g
oing to make the network 
better in terms of the square miles that are covered.
 
And when you add that to the great spectrum position that you're already 
seeing and the wonderful reviews of speed and performance that we're 
getting back on test today, that on
ly makes things stronger.
 
Secondly we are as you know in filling with millimeter wave and we've 
already turned up over 30 markets with millimeter wave. We're continuing to 
increase that footprint. And we're going to be very opportunistic of where we 
can do
 
that. We're in a unique position especially in the places where we 
offer wireline businesses that we can densify on a fiber infrastructure in a 
way that's really economic and is advantageous to our cost structure as we 
move forward.
 
That millimeter wave f
ill
-
in is where you're going to get unique performance 
characteristics. It will be obviously, probably more pronounced in the urban 
areas of large cities. Our plan right now is we're not as optimistic as maybe 
some are on what I would call the fixed wirele
ss replacement construct. We 
obviously believe there'll be some part of the subscriber base that might 
decide that they don't need a fixed broadband connection.
 
I think that's going to take a couple of years to start to emerge when you 
get the density a li
ttle bit more robust, I think as we see more mid
-
band 
spectrum coming in place to support the millimeter wave and make the 
performance a little bit more consistent.
 
So I wouldn't tell you any of our financial plans and our business plans. 
We're out there e
xpecting wonderful revenue increases from a push in the 
fixed wireless space. On what we do in the fixed space, you should expect 
that we're going to continue to add to the wireless 

 
excuse me, the fiber 
footprint.
 
Right now as we've shared with you our g
oal is to get a little better return 
out of what we've deployed because between consumer and business we 
have about 20 million locations, we can be aggressively working penetration 
in. And we think that we need to ensure we've got the right business 
practi
ces and marketing practices to get the return on that footprint that's 
there.
 
And as soon as I get indications that the team is actually executing on that 
well and we have the right formula on it, we'll probably release the ticket on 
some additional bill. 
You should expect just by natural growth of the 
population, you'll probably see somewhere between 350,000 to 0.5 million 
new fiber locations coming into the portfolio. Right now that is just kind of 
what I would call the natural growth rate that's going to
 
happen.
 
If we step that up a little bit, it will be because we feel good about how we're 
executing on the embedded footprint we have in place. And we know exactly 
where the next incremental place as we go and build. And I think it's entirely 
possible that
 
this operating team could build another 1 million to 2 million a 
year, if we felt like we had the operating momentum to do that.
 
On the postpaid trends, look there's 

 
the difference between prepaid and 
postpaid is changing. It's getting 

 
they're getting
 
closer together. We've 
been in a situation where we frankly as we shared with you our prepaid base 
looks a lot more like a postpaid base in what may be the broader industry 
prepaid base looks like.
 
Once we get these folks on prepaid, once we get them on s
martphones, we 
start seeing churn characteristics with multiline accounts that are very 
similar to what we have in postpaid. And so, I think as the economy has 
improved as the differences between the two products have gotten a little 
less as smartphones ha
ve worked their way into the prepaid base because of 
the cycle of maybe previous generation phones being available, we see 
customers now starting to opt into a postpaid construct.
 
Does that reverse itself, if we see some economic headwinds and maybe 
people
 
become a little bit more careful about what they do? That's possible. 
But the net of it is when you look at whether a customer goes with our 
prepaid offer or a postpaid offer, we have a lot of similar characteristics 
between the two. It's 

 
we can hit the
m in both places. But we feel very 
comfortable that we can catch the transition if there's more of a move to 
postpaid which is what I think is occurring, largely driven by economy and 
the way the networks are performing and the differences between the two 
products.
 
Michael Viola
 
Thanks Mike. Great. We'll take one more question.
 
Operator
 
Okay. That question comes from the line of Kannan Venkateshwar. Please go 
ahead.
 
Kannan Venkateshwar
 
Thank you. A couple if I could. Firstly, I mean, when you think about th
e 
decline rates of video at DIRECTV, although it will moderate over the course 
of 2020 based on your guidance. If at some point, DIRECTV becomes 
smaller than say Comcast and because of the video losses and those lines 
cross, is there any kind of an impact 
on your programming cost because of 
the most stable nation clauses and others that you get on account of your 
scale? And how does that impact margins if it does?
 
And secondly, when you think about the attach rates for broadband in video 
homes, could you gi
ve us a sense of what that is? And within the base of 
homes that you've lost as a result of the promotional loss last year, is it in 
line with the average? Or is it higher or lower? That will help us get a sense 
of where trends are. Thanks.
 
John Stankey
 
So
, the short answer to your first question Kannan is, no. We 
--
 
first of all, 
as you're aware, we went through a fairly significant renegotiation cycle over 
the last 12 months, so those are all baked in the bag through the next three 
to five years depending
 
on the nature of the particular content and I don't 
see any exposure in any of those agreements. I would suggest we're not 
going to continue to pay at the best part of the rate card given the size and 
the scale of our business as we move forward.
 
I think 
frankly, what's more likely to happen in pay TV moving forward is 
what I talked about earlier, where I think there'll be some pruning and 
trimming of offers in the market. As folks move forward to manage their cost 
of goods sold on programming costs, it wi
ll be dropping or shifting away 
from less traffic networks. I think that's going to be a bigger driver of cost 
structure than renegotiation or anything around that. But we're pretty well 
baked in that regard.
 
As you know, one of the things we're working th
rough is, we have a step
-
up 
in our content cost as a result of that significant renegotiation work we did 
last year. We're going to have to work through that in 2020. And then in the 
subsequent years '21, '22, you'll see us on what I would call more indust
ry 
traditional step
-
ups year
-
over
-
year in programming costs. But we're in the 
bag on those things and I think we're in pretty good shape.
 
On the broadband attach rates, the attach rates in footprint where we offer 
broadband are extremely high and they have
n't changed. We would expect 
to see a modest step
-
up as we move away from satellite combined with 
broadband and get into our software product distributed over broadband. 
Those sales rates, I think will help us on gross not necessarily a significant 
change 
in attach rates. When we are successful selling, we typically attach 
both.
 
The reality is, is we want more gross. We don't necessarily want to change 
the attach rate. We get more gross by the fact that for example in footprint, 
solid 10% of those subscribe
rs have line of sight related issues on satellite. 
They won't have that on the software
-
driven product. That helps us on gross 
intake and that's one of those things that help us 
--
 
helps us as we move 
through this year change those subscriber trends.

Okay. This is Randall. First of all, I just want to thank everybody for joining 
us again this morning for the call and your interest in AT&T. We're coming 
from off of 2019 where we told you exactly what we're going to do. And in 
terms of debt repayment, operational performance et cetera, capital 
allocation, we checked every box. We've now given you our playbook for 
2020 through 2022. It's a playbook that we feel very confident that we can 
achieve. We're now gaining momentum in our
 
wireless business, which we 
feel very good about that. We have a capital allocation plan that we have a 
high degree of confidence and we'll be able to execute over the next three 
years. And we have a media business that's performing at a very high level 
e
ven in an industry that's in transition.
 
And with HBO Max coming and the investment we're making there, we're 
confident that it's just another growth vehicle for this business over the next 
three years. So, bottom line, we have a plan that we think stacks 
up very 
nicely. We're confident in our ability to execute. We love the management 
team and look forward to 2020. Again, thank you for joining us this morning.

Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the AT&T 
Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in 
a listen
-
only mode. Later we will conduct a question
-
and
-
answer session and 
instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions]
 
Now at this time, I would like to turn the conference call over to your host, 
Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Mike Viola. Please go ahead.
 
Michael Viola
 
Thank you, Tony. Good
 
afternoon everybody. Welcome to our fourth quarter 
conference call. It's great to have all of you with us. Joining me on the call 
today is Randall Stephenson, AT&T's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, 
and John Stephens, AT&T's Chief Financial Officer.
 
Randall will provide some opening comments and then he'll close with 2016 
guidance. John will cover our results and we'll follow all of that up with a 
Q&A session. Let me remind you, our earnings material is available on the 
Investor Relations page of the 
AT&T Web
-
site. That's 
att.com/investor.relations.
 
Before we begin, I need to call your attention to our Safe Harbor statement. 
You've seen this before but it says that some of our comments today may be 
forward looking and as such they are subject to risks 
and uncertainties. 
Results may differ materially and additional information is available on the 
Investor Relations page of AT&T's Web
-
site.
 
So with that, I'll turn the call over to AT&T's Chief Executive Officer, Randall 
Stephenson.
 
Randall L. Stephenson
 
T
hanks, Mike, and good afternoon everybody. Before John just steps you 
through the results, I want to take just a couple of minutes to just reiterate 
the strategy we are pursuing that is to be the premier integrated 
communications company in the world, and 
obviously that's a strategy that 
we are pursuing in every single market segment, and as from our largest 
multinational customers to the most price
-
sensitive consumer.
 
And when you look at 2015, it was an eventful year where we've put 
together a lot of the 
pieces that were required to fulfil this objective. 
Primarily, we closed on the DIRECTV acquisition, and we secured a very 
deep spectrum footprint in the government auction that's giving us the 
network capacity for our TV Everywhere plans, and we acquired 
two Mexican 
wireless companies with extensive spectrum holdings and distribution, and 
this gives us access to one of the very best emerging market economies in 
the world.
 
Now, we financed the DIRECTV and spectrum purchases at very attractive 
rates and we d
id all of this putting together and exited 2015 with a very 
strong balance sheet, and our dividend coverage has returned to a level 
that's very consistent with our historic norm.
 
As you look at our strategy, the core is getting the basic connectivity 
eleme
nt right, because if you want to be an integrated solution provider, it 
requires more than anything else world
-
class, high
-
speed, secure 
connectivity, and it can't be just wireless connectivity or broadband to the 
home or business, but all connectivity, wi
reless, broadband, satellite, VPN, 
and it all has to be integrated.
 
So for example, TV Everywhere, DIRECTV is really accelerating our 
introduction of next
-
generation TV, and the DIRECTV content agreements 
combined with our networks is proving to be a very 
powerful combination. 
So we can now deliver the best entertainment packages over traditional 
linear TV or streamed over the Internet to essentially any mobile device.
 
A couple of weeks ago, we launched a nationwide solution that combines any 
of our TV ente
rtainment packages with unlimited mobile data, so our 
customers can now stream their video without incurring overage charges. 
And this is only our first move. You're going to see the offers and the 
customer experience continue to get better and better as w
e move through 
2016.
 
We also launched a number of integrated solutions for businesses, and I 
think the best example of this is our Network on Demand service which lets 
customers dial their bandwidth up or down literally on
-
demand. Internet 
phone service is
 
also having a lot of success, and I think this is a beautiful 
example of an integrated solution. It gives a company the capability to 
securely access information from a mobile device over a VPN into virtually 
any major cloud provider, and that includes Am
azon, Microsoft, IBM, or 
salesforce.com.
 
The common thread to all of this is providing our customers with a seamless 
integrated experience, and again the core to making all of this happen is the 
network, and our LTE network now covers 355 million people an
d businesses 
in North America, and we expect to hit the 385 million mark by the end of 
this year. We're continuing to build out our GigaPower footprint, and we can 
now deliver speeds up to 1 gig to over 1 million customer locations in 20 
markets, and we've
 
announced plans to enter an additional 36 markets. We 
also continue to expand our fiber network to more businesses, so we're 
really feeling good about our networks, and we believe we do have the most 
comprehensive capabilities now in the industry.
 
But to 
compete in today's market, the solutions do have to be global 
solutions because at the end of the day our customers are global, and that 
global focus is why we're the leader in serving multinational businesses. In 
fact, we connect 3.5 million businesses th
at include nearly all the Fortune 
1000, and we do it in almost 200 countries and territories. We've extended 
our wireless network into Mexico now, and as you're going to see in a few 
minutes our growth in Mexico is exceeding all of our expectations.
 
And al
so in 2015, we built on our global leadership position in the Internet of 
Things and our IoT solutions are not U.S. solutions, they are global 
solutions. We invested very early in this space and it is paying off. We now 
have over 26 million devices connect
ed to our network. We're also a leader 
in Connected Cars. We added a million of them in the fourth quarter and 
recently we completed a deal with Ford that we believe is going to connect 
at least 10 million cars over the next five years.
 
And finally, we're 
investing aggressively in the network architecture that is 
going to give us a competitive advantage in cost. We're driving the industry 
to software defined networks, and I have seen few opportunities over my 
career to drive down the cost to deliver service
 
like this. We're also on track 
to deliver at least $2.5 billion in annual DIRECTV synergies by 2018, and we 
continue to invest in spectrum. We began last year by investing $18 billion 
in the auction to significantly deepen our spectrum footprint, and as a
 
result 
we now have 40 MHz of fallow spectrum to deploy over the next few years 
to support TV Everywhere.
 
But just as important is the impact that such a deep spectrum footprint will 
have on our cost to build and operate our networks. So as we look out ove
r 
the next few years, we're convinced the software and defined networks 
combined with the DIRECTV synergies and our deep spectrum position are 
going to give us an industry
-
leading cost structure, and our objective is 
really straight
-
forward, we want to mov
e the most traffic at the lowest cost 
per bit.
 
Today, we think we're a company with no obvious peer. We have a 
nationwide TV and wireless footprint. Our IP broadband footprint reaches 
nearly 60 million customer locations. We have end to end capabilities in
 
enterprise, world
-
class distribution, and a globally respected brand, and 
while all these transformative moves were taking place, we executed pretty 
well in 2015.
 
If you look at Slide 5, as you see, adjusted EPS growth was solid, our cash 
flows were way u
p, margins continued to expand, and consolidated revenue 
growth was on track. We ended 2015 with 137 million mobility subscribers, 
45 million video subscribers, 13 million IP broadband customers, and an LTE 
network that's covering 355 million people, and w
e're seeing nice growth 
across all of our key product categories. In the fourth quarter, we had really 
solid net adds at wireless, satellite, video, and IP broadband.
 
So to wrap it up, strategy is working. We have the critical capabilities we 
need to execu
te the strategy, and I'm going to hand it over to John now, 
and then I'll come back later to give a full year outlook for what we see in 
2016. So with that, John?
 
John J. Stephens
 
Thanks, Randall, and hello everyone. It's great to have you on the call. Let
's 
start by taking a look at the quarter and our financial summary on Slide 6. 
We finished the year strong. We had double
-
digit growth in consolidated 
revenues, adjusted earnings, and free cash flow. At the same time, we 
continued to see margin expansion i
n every segment of our domestic 
business.
 
In the fourth quarter, reported EPS was $0.65 and adjusted EPS was $0.63. 
That's up more than 12% over last year's fourth quarter. This includes 
adjustments for merger and integration related costs and the annual m
ark to 
market of our benefit plans. This strong growth comes even with earnings 
pressure from our Mexico wireless operations and some deferral of 
recognition of video revenue.
 
Consolidated revenues grew to $42.1 billion. That's up more than 22% year
-
over
-
y
ear, mostly due to our acquisition of DIRECTV. That growth comes 
even with lower equipment sales as customers chose to hold on to their 
smartphones for a longer period of time.
 
During the quarter, the Company aligned DIRECTV's revenue 
recognition for 
new customer promotional offers to AT&T's practices. The Company will now 
recognize revenues from customers reflecting the amounts billed over time. 
Recognition of expenses will not change. The fourth quarter impact of this 
change resulted 
in lower booked revenues by about $300 million, and it had 
a corresponding impact on income, margin, and a $0.03 impact on EPS as 
well.
 
Cash flows continue to be a great story. Free cash flow was more than $3 
billion in the quarter and nearly $16 billion f
or the full year. That brought our 
free cash flow dividend coverage to about 64% for the year.
 
Let's take a closer look at our operational highlights, starting with Business 
Solutions on Slide 7. The biggest news here in our Business Solutions 
segment was 
our dramatic margin improvement. EBITDA margins improved 
360 basis points year
-
over
-
year as cost efficiencies far outpaced equipment 
revenue declines. Equipment sales were down year
-
over
-
year as we sold 
fewer handsets and less wireline CPE to our business 
customers, but higher
-
margin service revenues were essentially flat on a constant currency basis 
with rolling strategic services and wireless services largely offsetting legacy 
wireline declines.
 
We continue to see stabilization in our wireline data revenu
es. Total data 
revenues now comprise nearly 60% of wireline business revenues. Growth in 
our most advanced products is keeping pace with declines in legacy data 
services. Strategic services revenues grew by more than 10% year
-
over
-
year and when you adjust 
for foreign exchange pressure, growth was even 
stronger coming in at more than 12%.
 
We served the total connectivity needs of our customers and more and more 
that means mobility. Mobility and cloud solutions are changing the way 
business gets done and AT&T
 
is delivering this to customers. We're 
connecting people, cars, homes, cities, devices, machines and businesses to 
the Internet and each other. We've established ourselves as the world leader 
in IoT. We signed more than 300 new Internet of Things business
 
agreements in 2015 alone. Our recently announced new Connected Car 
agreements with Ford and BMW build on our industry leadership in that 
category and our new Smart Cities and Connected Health initiatives 
demonstrate how connected devices can help cut cost
s, grow revenues, 
boost efficiency and satisfy customers' needs.
 
Let's now move to our Entertainment Group results on Slide 8. This is our 
first full quarter reporting with DIRECTV and the results reflect the growing 
revenue and increased profitability tha
t we expected to receive from 
combining these operations. Reported revenues for the quarter more than 
doubled year
-
over
-
year, mostly due to the DTV acquisition, but our U
-
verse 
revenues also showed solid growth.
 
We also saw exceptional margin expansion whi
ch points directly to the 
benefits of the acquisition. Our EBITDA margins came in at more than 22%. 
That's up more than 800 basis points year
-
over
-
year. We shifted our 
marketing focus to driving satellite net adds and you can see that in our 
subscriber res
ults. Satellite net adds were 214,000 with our total video net 
adds for the quarter down just slightly.
 
We've been really pleased with our growing flow share with DIRECTV. Year
-
over
-
year gross adds have been up every month since the deal was closed, 
thanks
 
in large part to our wider distribution. And we are seeing an increase 
in satellite customers in our wireline footprint bundling broadband with their 
video service. Sales of satellite and IP broadband to new customers were up 
60% from the end of the third
 
quarter this year. That helped drive the 
increase of more than 190,000 total IP broadband subscribers in the fourth 
quarter.
 
It's still early but we see a lot more opportunity to use video to drive sales 
and lower churn for all of our services. Our new un
limited wireless data for 
combined wireless and TV customers has been very popular since we 
introduced it two weeks ago. We've already had more than 0.5 million 
wireless subscribers sign up for the unlimited data plan and TV net adds are 
going strong as we
ll, and we expect to launch a variety of new video 
entertainment packages this year.
 
These offers definitely add some sizzle to our bundling offers but the real 
impact is to build a strong relationship with our customer base. Our goal is 
that TV Everywhere
 
experience with broad viewer choice both inside and 
outside of home that is simple and easy for our customers to use. AT&T is 
already a leading provider of online video.
 
Our DIRECTV app already allows live video streaming of more than 100 
different networ
ks and by the end of the first quarter we expect to have 
nearly all the top 25 cable networks. We've already seen about a 50% 
increase in the number of customers using the DTV app since the second 
quarter of the year. We are driving an OTT capability with 
our video 
services, one that provides great choices at a fair price and that's 
[indiscernible] is also a win
-
win for the content providers in our integrated 
offerings.
 
Now let's move to our U.S. Mobility results on Slide 9. As a reminder, AT&T's 
domestic m
obility operations are now divided between the Business 
Solutions and Consumer Wireless segments. For comparison purposes, we're 
providing supplemental information for our total U.S. wireless operations 
here.
 
During the fourth quarter, total net adds came 
in strong with 2.2 million new 
subscribers and with gains in every customer category. That's the third 
consecutive quarter where net adds have exceeded 2 million. Almost 1 
million of those net adds were branded which includes both postpaid and 
prepaid, dri
ving positive phone additions in the quarter. We're putting a lot 
more focus on branded customers and with good reason.
 
Cricket has energized the prepaid space for us. We added more prepaid 
subscribers than any other carrier in 2015. In fact, we added more
 
subscribers than the rest of the industry combined, and Cricket churn is 
coming in at industry leading levels. This helped drive an increase of 
213,000 branded phone subscribers in the quarter. Compare that with our 
postpaid pressure of about 250,000 phon
es, the vast majority of which were 
higher churning feature phones with average ARPUs at about $35. All the 
while three quarters of our Cricket gross adds in the fourth quarter were on 
rate plans that were $50 or higher. This points the overall strength of
 
our 
business and our ability to operate an efficient smart business in the 
competitive mature market.
 
We also continued to grow our high
-
value smartphone base, adding about 1 
million branded smartphone subs during the quarter. At the same time, we 
had ano
ther strong churn quarter. Total churn was down year
-
over
-
year 
once again, thanks to our great networks, our quality offers and our top
-
notch customer service. Postpaid churn came in at 1.18% for the quarter, an 
improvement from the year ago quarter, and f
ull
-
year postpaid churn was 
1.09%, one of our best years ever. That's an impressive performance at a 
time when we focus on higher value subscribers in a heavily competitive 
market.
 
And I need to add a point about the Cricket churn. We have seen improving 
c
hurns throughout the year even as we shut down the legacy CDMA network 
and move subscribers to our 4G LTE network. Fourth quarter Cricket churn 
was the best yet, coming in at 3.8% or 170 point improvement over last 
year's fourth quarter and about half when
 
you look at the comparable weak 
fourth quarter from two years ago. Cricket has become a powerful part of 
our wireless story and we are very pleased at how it's performing and we 
expect it to do even more in 2016.
 
Wireless margins and ARPU are on Slide 10.
 
Our relentless efforts to drive 
efficiency and move our smartphone customer base to the no subsidy model 
once again drove record wireless EBITDA margins. You can see this clearly in 
our operating expenses. Equipment revenues were down more than $700 
milli
on, mostly due to lower upgrade volumes. Total cash operating costs 
were down 1.8 million, thanks to our sharp focus on cost management and 
efficiency. That helped increase EBITDA by nearly $900 million in the quarter 
and drive our best ever fourth quarter
 
EBITDA service margin of 43.2%.
 
We also had our best ever full year service EBITDA margin coming in at 
46.7%. By the way, if you exclude regulatory and insurance fees from 
service revenues, as some of our competitors do, our full
-
year number is 
about 50%.
 
Total wireless revenue was impacted by lower smartphone 
sales. Service revenues continue to stabilize. Equipment revenues also were 
impacted by increasing number of bring
-
your
-
own
-
device subscribers. We 
had about 700,000 in the quarter. That includes thos
e who purchased new 
smartphones through vendor leasing programs or vendor installment 
programs. BYOD sales are our lowest cost subscribers and we're happy to 
have them. They value our quality network coverage and reliability as well 
as our [indiscernible] 
selection of rate plans.
 
Phone
-
only plus Next ARPU continue to grow at a steady pace, up 4.6%, 
even with a growing number of BYOD subs. The number of smartphone 
customers on no device subsidy plans continues to expand. More than two 
thirds of smartphone su
bscribers or nearly 70% are on no subsidy plans with 
about 46% of that smartphone base on AT&T Next plans.
 
Now let's look at our international operations. That information is on Slide 
11. The wireless scene in Mexico is really getting [indiscernible] these
 
days. 
First, we blew through our year
-
end 4G LTE deployment target by reaching 
44 million POPs. That puts us well on our way to our next benchmark of 
reaching 75 million POPs by the end of the year and it brings our North 
American LTE coverage to 355 mill
ion people, which is more than any other 
carrier.
 
We also launched our rebranding to the AT&T name in several areas, 
beginning in markets where we've deployed LTE. That includes Guadalajara 
and Monterrey with Mexico City slated for April. And we continue t
o expand 
our distribution network. We've added 1,000 new store locations since we 
acquired these properties earlier in the year. All of this helped drive strong 
subscriber growth for the quarter with nearly 600,000 total net adds with 
gains in both prepaid
 
and postpaid.
 
Mexico financials continue to reflect our operational investment and strong 
subscriber growth. We expect comparable results for the first half of the year 
and the investment cycle to continue through 2016. In Latin America, our 
DIRECTV opera
tions continue to show solid growth on a local currency basis, 
but foreign exchange rates continue to pressure our results. Revenues, 
ARPUs and margins are all pressured by FX, are being hampered by 
challenging economies across Latin America. Subscriber pr
essures in Brazil 
impacted net adds. But even with all of this, we generated modest positive 
cash flow from these operations in the quarter.
 
All in all, we feel very confident that we will be able to create value with this 
business and with these assets. W
e're more integrated with the day
-
to
-
day 
operations and we have solid local management teams that are adding 
stability in a very challenging economic environment.
 
Now let's move to the consolidated margins on Slide 12. Consolidated 
margins reflect the over
all strength of our business. Adjusted consolidated 
income margin came in at 16.8% in the quarter. This was a 230 basis point 
improvement over the year ago fourth quarter. And adjusted EBITDA margin 
was 160 basis points higher than a year ago. Strong fourt
h quarter results 
helped drive 130 basis point improvement in the full
-
year adjusted operating 
income margin. That's a tremendous accomplishment for a company with 
$146 billion in revenue.
 
There were some reasons for this improvement. Strong margin expansi
on in 
our Entertainment Group and Business Solutions and our focused sales 
approach and efficiencies in wireless drove strong consumer mobility margin 
gains as well. We'll continue our laser focus on cost reductions. We've driven 
savings through greater ef
ficiencies, productivity gains and expense savings. 
Project Agile continues to build momentum as do our Digital First initiatives. 
We're seeing cycle time reduction and lower call volumes.
 
Software defined networking will radically reshape not only our cos
t but also 
the flexibility of our network deployment. Our margin momentum continues 
to be strong. We're confident we'll continue to expand [indiscernible] 
margins and to cut costs to offset pressure while we're in the investment 
cycle in Mexico.
 
Cash flows
 
were outstanding in 2015. Let's take a look on Slide 13. We 
improved our ability to generate cash in 2015 and our ability to have strong 
free cash flow even with strong capital investment. In the fourth quarter, 
cash from operations were more than $9 bill
ion and we've generated more 
than $35 million in operating cash flow in 2015.
 
Capital investment totaled $6.8 billion for the quarter. This includes about 
$700 million that we spent in Mexico where we received equipment and are 
putting it into service in t
he normal course, but we've got financing terms 
from our vendors that don't require us to pay for it until the end of 2016 or a 
little bit later. For the year, we made capital investments of nearly $21 
billion.
 
Free cash flow was $3.1 billion. For the 
full year, it was nearly $16 billion, 
coming in higher than our increased guidance. We also continued to tap the 
securitization market to manage working capital with Next. We received 
about 900 million in the fourth quarter. When you combine this with the 
foregone payments from prior securitizations, the net impact is about $100 
million of pressure on cash flow. So cash flow in and of itself was very strong 
from operations.
 
In terms of uses of cash, dividends totaled $2.9 billion for the quarter and 
about $
10 billion for the year, which gave us a payout ratio of 64%. Net 
debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was 2.31. We ended the year with $5.5 billion 
in cash and short
-
term investments. We're proud of our ability to generate 
cash. This gives us the financial stren
gth to invest in our business, reduce 
debt and return substantial value to our shareholders.
 
Now, I will turn it back to Randall to provide our 2016 outlook.
 
Randall L. Stephenson
 
Okay. Thank you, John. Last summer we provided a long
-
term guidance 
after we
 
closed the DIRECTV deal and it really hasn't changed. We're 
tracking almost exactly on what we told you. And so when you look at 2016, 
what you can expect is double
-
digit consolidated revenue growth, adjusted 
EPS growth in the mid
-
single digit range or be
tter, stable consolidated 
margins with a solid business plan to improve in each segment even while 
we're investing in Mexico. Capital spending will be in the $22 billion range 
with our focus on cost efficiencies and SDN creating a downward bias to that 
for
ecast, and we expect our free cash flow dividend payout ratio to be in the 
70s with a goal of growing free cash flow this year.
 
So that kind of wraps it up and with that John and Mike and I are glad to 
stay in for questions. So, Tony, we'll turn it back to
 
you.
 
Question
-
and
-
Answer Session
 
Operator
 
[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Mike McCormack 
with Jefferies. Please go ahead.
 
Michael McCormack
 
John, maybe just a comment on the service revenue in overall wireless 
should be sort of l
apping the big mobile share value push last year. Just 
trying to get a sense for the trajectory on the year
-
over
-
year decline. It 
looks like it continues to get better. I'm assuming we should expect that 
throughout the year. And then secondly on the Entert
ainment segment, I 
guess looking at sequential margins versus year
-
over
-
year, it looks flatter 
sequentially but there was the impact of the revenue recognition change. 
Just trying to get a sense for what we should be thinking about with margin 
trajectory t
here, maybe particularly as you go in there and get more wireless 
rights for content and maybe where those wireless right content costs flow 
through the model?
 
John J. Stephens
 
Let me give you a couple of insights there. First into the service revenues in 
wireless, we have to wait and see what 2016 brings, but we're expecting it 
to improve throughout the year, the year
-
over
-
year trends. We continue to 
see a little optimism in what we're seeing from the customers and demand, 
so we expect to see improvement t
hroughout the year in that service 
revenue.
 
On the Entertainment margins, the first point I'd like to make is the $300 
millionrevenue deferral did impact margins in this quarter. The margins 
would have been close to a couple of basis points higher if we wo
uld have 
had that recognition. That's the first point I want to make to you.
 
Second point, what we'll see is we will see the merger synergy savings 
starting to show up in margins in 2016, and specifically most of the $1.5 
billion worth of run rate savings 
we expect to get to by the end of the year 
we'll start seeing coming through the Entertainment Group. As we go 
through the year, we'll see what happens with other competing interests, 
but clearly those items are leaving us with the expectation that we will
 
have 
improving margins in the Entertainment Group.
 
Michael McCormack
 
John, just as you sort of progress on getting more and more mobile rights 
for content, how should we think about where those incremental costs for 
the rights should flow through, is it e
ntertainment or is it on the mobility 
side?
 
John J. Stephens
 
We expect it to flow through in the Entertainment Group.
 
Operator
 
That will come from Phil Cusick with J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead.
 
Philip Cusick
 
Two things. First to follow
-
up on Mike's questio
n, can you just remind us, 
John, what the deferral is and will that impact revenue any further or is this 
sort of the most you'll need to defer? And then second, Randall, since 2009 
you've been known as a bit of an economic savant. Can you give us an idea 
of what you're seeing from your customers in the U.S., both consumer and 
enterprise, and do you see any signs of economic weakness?
 
John J. Stephens
 
Phil, on the revenue deferral, this had to do with one of our major contracts 
and a customer signed up a tw
o
-
year contract, and so previously DTV had 
recognized equally over each month of the contract. We recognize it as we 
bill it. So we just came to a consistency, brought it to the AT&T 
methodology. So that $300 million is not in anyway, shape, or form lost 
r
evenue, it's just deferred, doesn't change our customer contracts, it won't 
change our cash collection. It's just a deferral. And additionally, we didn't 
defer any expenses. We continue to recognize any out of pocket expenses 
with regard to that in the sam
e way we have done before.
 
Philip Cusick
 
And that's mostly only going to impact 4Q, right?
 
John J. Stephens
 
There will be some further impacts throughout next year, but by the end of 
the next year, we'll get into the situation where the 
originating piece and the 
reversing piece of this will be offsetting, but that will take us through the 
next year.
 
Philip Cusick
 
Got it.
 
Randall L. Stephenson
 
Phil, this is Randall. 'You're economic savant', I've never been called that. So 
it won't surpris
e you what we are seeing. We are seeing some softness if 
you look at enterprise business on anybody that has anything that touches 
oil and gas industry. All those companies are a little bit defensive right now 
as you might guess. Also anybody, big exporter
s, people who are exporting, 
who have exposure to foreign currencies, particularly the strong dollar, we're 
seeing weakness there. But I will tell you, we are kind of netted out. Our 
revenues kind of held their own on the business side because we are takin
g 
share and NetBond and Network on Demand, we're having a lot of success in 
the marketplace, and so we're taking share and holding our own but we are 
seeing some softness in those areas.
 
The consumer continues to spend money. In fact, there's a decent holi
day 
season in light of really aggressive competition, but the consumer continued 
to spend money. I might have anticipated, in fact I do anticipate a little 
more robust Christmas season because you're seeing energy prices at lows 
we haven't seen in a long t
ime, and you didn't see the step
-
up in consumer 
spending that you might've expected in the third and fourth quarter. But the 
consumer did continue to spend.
 
As we look at 2016, we've built this plan around a 2% GDP growth rate in 
the U.S. roughly, and ther
e's a lot of science that goes into that but you can 
basically turn around and look at the last few years, you see it's been 2%, 
it's not really hard to forecast it these days. We've been fairly tight in terms 
of hitting our estimates for the last few year
s.
 
What I am concerned about, I'll be honest with you, is as you look at 2015, 
there are a lot of things that went the consumers' way and that went the 
economy's way, not the least of which are energy prices. But even over the 
last few years, there's been 
some benefit from 2 million people being put 
back to work. And so as we get to end of 2015, those benefits that we've 
seen over the last couple of quarters, if you look forward, are you going to 
see those in the future, probably not. And so I made a commen
t last week 
that got picked up that we're assuming 2%, if you ask me to kind of 
handicap is there more downside or upside to that, probably downside, but 
it's probably within a tight range of 2% is what our estimate is right now.
 
Operator
 
Our next question
 
in queue will come from Amir Rozwadowski with Barclays. 
Please go ahead.
 
Amir Rozwadowski
 
The first question I wanted to ask was around your strategy in the mobile 
area. As you mentioned, Randall, during the prepared remarks, you have 
unveiled what I assu
me is the first of many plans integrating your mobile 
and video anywhere solutions. How should we think about your approach 
towards the competitive landscape going forward in terms of your go to 
market strategy? I mean it does seems though on a relative ba
sis you 
probably weren't as promotional as some of your competitors, and would 
love to hear your thoughts as we progress through 2016.
 
Randall L. Stephenson
 
So we closed DIRECTV on July 24 and immediately put in place some plans 
that will be kind of for th
e first phase of integration. We brought the TV 
capability into our retail stores and have had nice lifts, as you heard John 
talk about going through his remarks, and then January we did the unlimited 
data plan for our TV subscribers.
 
What you should expec
t is you're just going to continue to see as we roll 
through 2016 capabilities and offers that take advantage of putting the two 
together, and the customer experience is going to continue to get better and 
you're going to see offers that we think are uniqu
e in the marketplace. I'm 
not going to get very detailed with you right now, Amir, because we are still 
in the process of getting some of the really critical content deals secured, 
but things are coming together very nicely and you're going to see this kin
d 
of a phased rollout over the next few days and in fact over the next 45 days 
you will get your first look what one of these will look like, and so stay 
tuned.
 
But I think it will be an eventful year for the industry as we rollout new and 
different kind o
f capabilities, new and different type of programming options 
for the mobile device and even new ways to think about how you price in a 
mobile
-
centric environment. So actually I'm very energized and the further 
we get into it and work with our partners on 
the content side, the more 
energized I get about it.
 
Amir Rozwadowski
 
Thank you very much. And then maybe if I can switch gears to the video 
side, as you mentioned it seems though you continue to benefit from 
[indiscernible] integration has progressed, are
 
you on the verge of rolling 
out more converged offerings with broadband and video and how should we 
think about that opportunity set for yourselves?
 
Randall L. Stephenson
 
So, Amir, I'll tell you right now we are early in the process. The sales 
channel is 
just really starting to get their legs underneath them on how to 
attach satellite and mobility together. This is a new category and so we're 
very, very new in this and the performance continues to get better and 
better in the sales channel.
 
Also keep in mi
nd that we don't even have the installation workforce up to 
speed on provisioning this. So we're just getting the installation and 
workforce up. We just had the latest union contract gave us the rights we 
needed to push this out across our entire footprint
. And so you're going to 
see us continue to get better and better there as well.
 
As you pointed out, the satellite adds were strong in the fourth quarter but 
U
-
verse churn offset that, so we were slightly negative in total. You'll see 
that relationship get
 
better and we are doing some things to shore up the U
-
verse base because we are focused on the satellite product and so as a 
result you're seeing U
-
verse churn up. We're doing some things to shore 
that up. It will improve. Not the least of which, we did s
ome things on 
pricing to ensure that we can help begin to mitigate the U
-
verse churn.
 
The other thing we did, and it's early but I think we are going to see some 
not inconsequential impacts from this, is the unlimited offer for all of our TV 
customers. U
-
v
erse customers can now step into an unlimited data offer and 
this is we think a hugely retentive offer. It's a great value for our customers 
to have this type of offer put in front of them.
 
So we think you'll see the U
-
verse churn get better, you'll see th
e subscriber 
numbers continue to improve as we move through 2016 and the sales 
channel improves, the provisioning channel improves. And then some of 
these offers I talked about, some unique offers that will be mobile centric 
offers and some unique content 
available, we think those are going to 
continue to add momentum to this as well. So bottom line, we think the 
subscription numbers get better as we go through the course of the year.
 
Operator
 
The next question in queue will come from Brett Feldman with Gol
dman 
Sachs. Please go ahead.
 
Brett Feldman
 
John, just a question on the cash flow outlook that you provided for this 
year, you obviously gave us some help thinking about the revenue, the 
EBITDA and the CapEx piece parts in that calculation. I think you men
tioned 
some deferred CapEx related to Mexico. I'm curious if that's factored into the 
guidance. If you can give us any help on how to think about cash taxes with 
deferred bonus depreciation or extended bonus depreciation and anything 
else that we need to t
hink about, like pension, that would be very value 
added. Thanks so much.
 
John J. Stephens
 
Couple of things. One, with regard to the deferred payments in Mexico, 
those have been our plans all along. We continue to work on the cash flow 
opportunities and we're doing for a number of years. So those are all in 
already. There's nothing new here.
 
Secondly, with regards to bonus depreciation, as we told the community 
when we first gave our guidance that we were taking that into consideration 
a
ssuming that we'll get passed but we would meet that 

 
we would meet 
this guidance even if it didn't get passed. It has gotten passed.
 
The one point I would make to everyone is that it's now 15 years our bonus 
depreciation has been in place, and so getting
 
the bonus depreciation 
extended for five years and [indiscernible] is really important, but the 
creation of benefits from bonus depreciation is now being largely offset by 
the reversal of prior year's benefits that have been taken by taxpayers. So 
it's mu
ch more of a balancing item there.
 
With regard to that pressure on cash flow, it did not come from our pension. 
We have a pension contribution we'll make this year and about $200 million 
but that's already been in the plans. That's the only thing that's re
quired. 
Our pension plan is very well funded.
 
And then we do expect total tax payments to be up this year on a year
-
over
-
year basis, but as you know from our prior year filings, our tax payments 
were really modest last year, and so we would expect those to
 
go out. But 
all in, we feel pretty comfortable hitting our guidance and we are certainly 
working very, very hard to do better on that guidance.
 
Brett Feldman
 
And just to make sure I heard it correctly, and maybe I didn't, but I think 
you said that this ye
ar's CapEx did include some of the deferred payments in 
Mexico, meaning that you will hit your free cash flow next year even though 
you have already recognized the CapEx early on your [indiscernible]?
 
John J. Stephens
 
So [indiscernible] talk about CapEx is
 
like it was this year that it was 20.7 
and we'll have about that 15% of service revenues which is about, so it gets 
to be about $22 billion for this year. That will be our CapEx. The working 
capital impact of paying for some of last year's purchases this 
year is in our 
working capital calculations. I think of it separately from my CapEx numbers, 
but yes, it's already in that guidance, so we will be adjusting the guidance 
for that.
 
Operator
 
The next question will come from David Barden with Bank of America 
Merrill 
Lynch. Please go ahead.
 
David Barden
 
Maybe this one is for John or Randall, for the first time in a while we're 
looking at some reasonably comfortable headroom on the balance sheet, 
2.3x leverage versus I think your kind of historical comfort level
 
limit of 2.5 
turns, and for a company of AT&T size that's a real money. Obviously we 
have the 600 MHz auction coming up. New York Post tells us you are buying 
Time Warner. It is obviously a lot of things that could be on the agenda here 
including just sti
cking to your deleveraging agenda. Could you kind of rank 
order some of the ways you want to use what headroom appears to be there 
relative to the deleveraging priorities?
 
John J. Stephens
 
With our strong cash flows, we're going to continue invest in netwo
rks as 
we've said, keep this quality up and keep these product offerings moving out 
and we feel comfortable about doing that within that $22 billion range, but 
we do believe that positions us well. We do think that includes all our merger 
and integration a
ctivities. We've got a lot of fallow spectrum out there that 
we bought over the last few years. So we're in a very good position to be 
able to operate within those kinds of parameters and still provide the highest 
quality service.
 
With regard to the cash a
fter we've done that investment [indiscernible] and 
we're going to continue to be [indiscernible] loyal and respectful of our 
shareholders in accordance with our Board's direction. Third, we're going to 
focus on reducing debt levels. But with that, as you 
do that, you keep your 
balance, be strong and keep opportunities available, but that's where we'll 
be focusing.
 
Randall L. Stephenson
 
It's right now I think we've been pretty clear that the next couple of years 
we want to get our debt levels back down to k
ind of more normal levels for 
us. We spiked them a little bit to get the spectrum bought last year and then 
also to do that DIRECTV deal. So we'll spend the next couple of years 
working the debt back down before we start talking about different capital 
all
ocations in terms of share buyback or anything of any magnitude.
 
David Barden
 
And could we interpret that as being kind of relative to historical comments 
of being willing to bid for instance $9 billion in the 600 MHz auction, would 
those comments, Randall
, suggest that maybe you're going to take a much 
more conservative attack as that comes up?
 
Randall L. Stephenson
 
We'll see what the auction brings and then how everybody participates, but I 
haven't been bashful in saying if there's an opportunity to get a
nother 2x10 
at that spectrum, we would pursue it. And so we think we can do that within 
the guidance John has given here and execute on that, but we'll have to see, 
David. It's not yet to us really clear what the spectrum footprints are going 
to look like 
and whether you can piece together truly a ubiquitous 2x10 type 
footprint which is really important to us to be bringing another band of 
spectrum into our operation, it's going to be really important to have a 
ubiquitous broad footprint. And so we'll have 
to look at that and obviously 
we're going to have to look at the person, that bid that the government has 
just issued the RFP on. So there are a lot of ways we'll evaluate the 
spectrum scenario, but it's reasonable to assume that we'll be active one 
place 
or the other.
 
Operator
 
Our next question in queue will come from James Ratcliffe with Buckingham 
Research Group. Please go ahead.
 
James Ratcliffe
 
Two if I could. First of all, just to dive in a little more into the DTV 
integration, any incremental thoughts
 
on sizing what the revenue upside 
there is? I know it's early but now that you have for example some track 
record regarding unlimited data and you'd be able to share data across the 
two operations. And secondly, any incremental thoughts and the status of 
sponsored data and how you expect to see that roll out over the course of 
the year?
 
John J. Stephens
 
On the DTV integration and the revenue upside, let me frame it this way. We 
are pleased with what we have seen so far, specifically the unlimited data 
and the wireless I mentioned here. We had 500,000 wireless customers 
signed up for it already. So we're overall pleased with it. We think there's 
[great opportunity] [ph] there. The timing of those could give us a reason 
for some carefulness there for this
 
reason.
 
For example, Randall mentioned the training of our technicians who do the 
installs. We're just going through the completion of that now, and that's 
really going to be more off a second half of the year where we'll see how 
really effective that is.
 
We have seen a lot more bundling of the satellite with 
broadband but we need some more time to make sure that we understand 
the momentum of that and the progress of that.
 
Additionally, we are still going through the sales process of training our reps 
who 
never sold broadband when they sold satellite before or who sold 
broadband but never sold satellite before, and as Randall pointed out, 
because we sell wireless we have to increase all their sales activities, 
whether in the stores or in the call centers.
 
S
o all of this is going to take some time for us to really track [indiscernible]. 
I will tell you, we are optimistic and pleased with the initial results but giving 
any guidance on the revenue synergy sort of perspective is a little 
premature.
 
Randall L. St
ephenson
 
On your question on sponsored data, James, I think it's important to think 
about what we have assembled here. And so between DIRECTV and our 
Otter Media relationship, we think we have the best premium set of content 
available to anybody anywhere a
nd we're getting the rights secured to allow 
us to begin delivering this over whatever platform the customer wishes. If 
the customer wants it on a tablet or a smartphone or on a TV and we're 
getting to the place where we can do that.
 
Now if you think about
 
the most premium set of content, whether it would 
be sports programming, whether it would be binged type programming that 
has stacking rights and [look
-
back] [ph] capabilities, whether it would be 
movie libraries or whatnot, it's just a very, very robust 
set of content that 
we're piecing together here to be delivered. I think one would just have to 
assume that sponsored data would be a critical element on how the 
customer would take advantage of this.
 
And so we haven't developed or announced I should say, 
we are doing a lot 
of work right now on how we come to market. We have not announced any 
plans but I think it would be reasonable to assume sponsored data would be 
a part of how our customers would take advantage of this kind of content 
library.
 
Operator
 
Our next question in queue will come from Simon Flannery with Morgan 
Stanley. Please go ahead.
 
Simon Flannery
 
Perhaps you could give us some sense of what you are including in 2016 
guidance for realized synergies and any kind of expectation around what 
int
egration cost might be this year? And then Randall, following up on that 
content theme, maybe you can update us on the Otter Media and the joint 
venture with Chernin and any perspective on whether you want to get 
deeper into ownership of content more broad
ly?
 
Randall L. Stephenson
 
Simon, let's say it this way, by the end of the year we expect to be on a run 
rate of $1.5 billion, which is going to be about $125 million a month. That's 
how we think about it. That's how we're doing our plans. I certainly don't
 
mean to imply we're at that level in January, don't want to convey that, 
we're not, I don't expect that, but we expect it to grow throughout the year. 
We did have a very good first five months of getting costs aligned and 
addressing a lot of the administr
ative or headquarter some of the easier 
costs to start getting out.
 
So we did well with that and we're making good progress on the content, 
and quite frankly are shifting to a satellite based customer base is helping. 
But from your question perspective, I 
would think of it in that way that we 
are going to hit and hopefully exceed the $1.5 billion run rate which will be 
$125 million a month by the kind of December timeframe, fourth quarter 
timeframe.
 
With regard to any capital required for those integration 
costs, that's already 
included in the $22 billion of capital guidance. And from the expectation of 
integration costs, while we have some, without giving guidance, I would 
suggest to you this way, if you think about what makes up our integration 
savings or 
merger savings, content negotiation, staffing, supply chain, the 
cost to do that are not necessarily significant. It's just a matter of getting it 
done and doing the business. So I wouldn't expect those types of merger 
integration costs to be significant.
 
I will tell you we're still going to have customer facing amortization, 
trademark, trade names amortization, those kinds of normal merger 
integration. We're pretty explicit with those in the details we provide in our 
filings.
 
On the content side, and speci
fically you asked about [RV] [ph], that's going 
well. We're still early, but as everybody knows, we're partnered with Peter 
Chernin who I think probably is the best content talent on the planet, and 
early leveraging the Fullscreen acquisition that we did o
ut of Otter Media, 
Fullscreen is obviously moving into a subscription model. We're really early 
to see how that progresses. But we're using that platform to do a lot of work 
for developing what I will call mobile centric content designed for the mobile 
dev
ice, and very optimistic about what the opportunities are there.
 
In terms of other or broader content ownership, there are a number of areas 
where we have what I'll call proprietary content. We own a number of 
regional sports networks. Some of those we acq
uired through the DIRECTV 
acquisition. Others we have acquired over the course of the last year. We 
also have a lot of what I will call exclusive content that is produced by us, 
everything from the Dan Patrick Show to a particular network we have on 
DIRECT
V and some series like Kingdom and so forth.
 
And Simon, you should expect us to continue to engage at that level and as 
we have success, you'll see us invest more in the areas where we have 
success, but right now I think our plate is full doing full
-
scale 
integration of 
DIRECTV and bringing it into the mobility channel.

The next question in queue will come from Frank Louthan with Raymond 
James. Please go ahead.
 
Frank Louthan
 
Can you talk a little bit more on the mobility side about deals with Ford 
and 
so forth? Does that include getting just maybe beyond new cars but also 
getting into the used dealership networks? And then on the Mexico side, can 
you comment on your aspirations for video with those customers there?
 
Randall L. Stephenson
 
So the Ford 
deal is exclusively the cars coming off the manufacturing floor, 
and so those are new cars coming out over now in 2020. Like we said, we 
are expecting 10 million automobiles to roll off the floor between now and 
2020 with our connectivity and just from For
d.
 
You bring up an interesting point and that is there is a massive used car 
fleet out there that is not connected and there is actually technologies that 
are now available. I have a sports car, old sports car that I now have 
connected to the Internet and 
it's actually a fairly elegant solution.
 
And so there are some capabilities that we are putting into the market, in 
fact we are selling into the market today, to connect the used car fleet that 
is out on the U.S. roads and we think that's important because
 
the average 
age of a car on the road today is 11 years. And so if you really want to grow 
this business, you need to tap into the used car fleet. So that's a priority for 
us and you'll see us pursue that.
 
On Mexico, and as it relates to the video 
opportunity, we are fairly convicted 
that mobile and video are going to be a category that's very, very relevant 
in the U.S. and we're early on here in the U.S. but based on early success 
we continue to get more and more convicted, it is going to be an imp
ortant 
category, bringing the two together is going to be important. And if it's going 
to be important in the U.S., we think it will be important in other markets 
and Mexico will be no different.
 
As you know, we have a minority share position in a satellit
e company in 
Mexico and hopefully we'll be able to do some partnering there but we do 
think the video combination with mobile is going to be important in all 
geographies in all markets.
 
Frank Louthan
 
At some point, does it make sense to take a larger posit
ion in that 
ownership?
 
Randall L. Stephenson
 
I don't know if our partner has any interest in selling that position. So time 
will tell. We'll just have to see.
 
Operator
 
Our next question will come from Michael Rollins with Citi. Please go ahead.
 
Michael Rol
lins
 
Just two if I could. First, the management in the past has discussed the 
investments in broadband within the wireline footprint over the last few 
years. Is there a way you can size the footprint where you've made the 
upgrades but you are underpenetrat
ed for broadband share and help us 
think about the gap you hope to close given the speeds that you are now 
offering? And then if I could just throw in a second question, I was 
wondering if you could share some of the segmentation of how you spent 
capital i
n 2015 capital expenditures specifically and how those allocations 
might change as you look at the 2016 budget?
 
John J. Stephens
 
Let me take a shot at this. With regard to our wireline footprint, we have 
about 60 million IP broadband enabled customer locat
ions [indiscernible] 
from our consumer side and we've got about 15 million IP broadband 
customers today. So these are round numbers. The stat profile will give you 
the details. But with that, you can see that [indiscernible] penetration right 
now is about 
25%. The key change here is the fact that we now have a 
national video product in DIRECTV and a satellite product, and such that we 
didn't have that before.
 
So many of our, if you will, broadband capable locations didn't have a video 
offering, now they do.
 
And so as we improve this single [indiscernible] 
capability, this sales channel capability, all of that, we expect to grow that 
share and we would expect that it would be a significant improvement over 
where we're at today.
 
With regard to the expansion th
at we are doing now with regard to fiber, we 
are seeing very good results and the ability to always have video available 
with the satellite product is going to prove I think to be very beneficial for 
us. So we will expand on that 60 million footprint over 
the next four years 
when we will also get to 

 
some of it will overlap but we will get to 14 million 
fiber
-
enabled and quite frankly there is a likelihood that we may get to more 
than that when we are finished. So that's the way to think about that 
footpri
nt issue.
 
With regard to the capital spend, you are right, we don't go into great detail 
on the capital spend because in our wireline and wireless footprint and we 
are an integrated carrier, the spends become overlapping, whether you're 
taking high
-
speed b
ackhaul to a sell
-
side or whether you are stripping 
wireless traffic or wireline traffic or an IP backbone.
 
But from a general perspective, in 2015 we spent probably about half of our 
capital in the wireless area, the other half in the wireline area, and i
f you will 
the [indiscernible] the shared services area. I will tell you that pickup in the 
fourth quarter in part was due to Mexico and in part was due to the set
-
top 
box and the sales opportunities in DIRECTV. So, I'll give you that way to 
think about it
 
and I think that will be kind of a consistent story as we go 
through in the coming years. We are investing at a rapid rate in all of our 
businesses.
 
The one thing about our wireless business is when you've got the tower 
network that we have today, the inf
rastructure that's been there and you 
have the spectrum holdings that we have today, you can do great things 
with quality service, at least our networking can do great service and 
continue to meet all the needs and you can be pretty effective with your 
cap
ital spend.
 
It's not a situation where there isn't investment, it's that much of this 
investment has been made over the last three years for the spectrum 
purchases through the VIP project putting extensive fiber into the ground 
and backhaul capabilities an
d we are going to continue that quite frankly 
with GigaPower as we put more fiber near other cell sites that we can then 
give even better high
-
quality backhaul. So it's a really integrated process but 
needless to say we continue to be very proud of the per
formance and 
continue to invest there.
 
Randall L. Stephenson
 
Don't forget software defined networking continues to push capital 
requirements down over the next three or four years. We think it's going to 
be significant.
 
John J. Stephens
 
Tony, we'll take on
e more question.
 
Operator
 
And that will come from Timothy Horan with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.
 
Timothy Horan
 
Just a couple of follow
-
ups. John, so maybe just on the cash tax rate, can 
you give us maybe a little bit more color? I think Verizon said in t
he high 
20% range. I know you've reported taxes of 35% over the next few years. 
There's a lot of moving parts. But is kind of mid 20% range look pretty 
good? And then a quick follow up for Randall.
 
John J. Stephens
 
Tim, [we don't like to give that guidance
] [ph] but let me say it this way. I 
can completely understand how Verizon or [indiscernible] a similarly situated 
company can get to that level.
 
Timothy Horan
 
Got you. Randall, clearly there's unprecedented technological change of 
cloud and 
artificial intelligence and everything else going on and you've had 
a lot of your peers slash CapEx and OpEx spending and Sprint seems like 
they are really on the road to doing that right now, but we've had a lot of 
European carriers do the same thing. I g
uess the question I get a lot is, how 
much of a focus is that at AT&T and do you have confidence that you can 
kind of see some of these benefits? And I guess maybe in that regard, I 
know you have Project Agile out there, any kind of update on where you are
 
in that process and ability to cut expenses, that would be great?
 
Randall L. Stephenson
 
When you think about software defined networking, as you think about the 
merger synergies for DIRECTV, $2.5 billion run rate synergies, you think 
about all this going 
on and just the core business, you've got Project Agile 
John does where we are really just streamlining a lot of various operations, 
moving a lot of the customer interaction at their request to digital, the 
opportunity is really impressive to continue taki
ng expense out of the 
business.
 
I would tell you, if you look at just this quarter's results, it ought to give you 
some degree of comfort in terms of what's possible, even at a company of 
our size and our scale. Whether it's Business Solutions segment, our
 
Mobility 
segment, our Entertainment Group segment, consolidated 

 
I mean it was a 
clean sweep in terms of taking margins up and we weren't taking them up 5 
or 10 basis points, the margins really moved up considerably. And so we feel 
really good about the 
path we are on and the momentum we have on the 
cost side of taking cost out of the business.
 
On the capital spending side, this is a unique opportunity. We're at a place 
where a lot of things are converging in terms of maturity that's going to 
create some 
incredible opportunities as we go forward. These ubiquitous 
high
-
speed mobile networks, I mean they are here and they are ubiquitous, 
they are low latency, combine that with cloud, combine that with data 
analytics capabilities that are available to the mas
ses, I mean the world of 
big data is here and it's available to everybody, and then sensors.
 
The sensor technology, the ability to actually put in sensors at virtually no 

 
I mean the cost is nominal to put these sensors in place. Millions upon 
millions of
 
these sensors, all of these, these four elements coming together 
at one time is a massive opportunity and people are not thinking about how 
to take advantage of ubiquitous mobility, high
-
speed, low latency networks 
with cloud, with data analytics, with th
is sensor technology are going to miss 
it and we think we're at a place right now where we have a unique position 
on bringing all of this together and creating growth. We're going to invest 
through this cycle. We're going to invest in video and making sure
 
we can 
deliver video to our customers, we think that's going to be a huge 
opportunity, and expanding our footprint into Mexico.
 
I mean all of these are converging we think to give us a growth platform for 
the next four or five years that is unique. So we'
re trying to be prudent, our 
downward bias on an incremental basis of capital. As we continue to 
emphasize that, we are being more and more efficient with our capital 
spend. John pointed out the implications of spectrum. Don't miss this. As 
you deploy thes
e 2x10 MHz blocks of spectrum, the efficiencies it brings to 
building and operating mobile networks is significant and we think we're in a 
very unique position in that regard too.
 
So I said in my opening comments and I'll say it again, our intention is to 
deliver over these networks the most traffic at the lowest cost per bit to 
deliver. That's our objective and that's the path we're headed down. So we 
feel good about being able to achieve that.
 
So thanks for the question and I also thank everybody for your
 
participation 
on the call. We are off and running with the DIRECTV acquisition in Mexico, 
those are going well, and we feel good about where we are as a business 
and looking forward to 2016. So thank you for your interest.

Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the AT&T First 
Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a 
listen
-
only mode. Later, we will conduct a question
-
and
-
answer session. 

remind you that this conference is being recorded.
 
I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Michael Viola, 
Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Please
 
go ahead, sir.
 
Michael Viola
 
Okay. Thanks, Greg. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the first 

Relations here at AT&T. Joining me on the call today is Rand Stephenson, 
AT&T's C
hairman and CEO; and John Stephens, AT&T's Chief Financial 
Officer. Rand is going to provide an update of the key 2019 initiatives, then 
John is going to cover our operating results. Then, of course, we will follow 
that with a Q&A.
 
Before we begin, I need 
to call your attention to our Safe Harbor statement. 
It says that some of our comments today may be forward
-
looking. As such, 

additional information is available on the Investor 
Relations website.
 
I also need to remind you that we're in a quiet period for the FCC spectrum 
auctions, spectrum auctions 101 and 102, so we can't address any questions 
about that today. And as always, our earnings materials are available on the 
IR page o
f the AT&T website, and that includes the news release, investor 
briefing, 8
-
K, associated schedules, etcetera.
 
And so now, I'd like to now turn the call over to Randall Stephenson.
 
Randall Stephenson
 
Okay. Thanks, Mike. And we do appreciate you joining us
 
this morning. I 
came to you back in January and I outlined six priorities for 2019, and we 
have those again listed on the third slide. But if I could quickly summarize, 
what I would tell you is in all six of these areas we're either on track or well 
ahead
 
of schedule.
 
And the first one, as you remember, I told you that paying down the $40 
billion in debt that we took on to acquire Time Warner that that would be our 
top priority, and we are on target to retire 75% of that by year
-
end. This 
quarter, we gener
ated free cash flow of $5.9 billion and brought our net debt 
down by $2.3 billion. And that puts us well on track for generating at least 
$26 billion of free cash flow for the full
-
year.
 

 
Hulu 
and Hudson Yards. That generated an additional $3.6 billion of cash. And 

down working capital and restructuring some collateral arrangements, and 
this is also adding significa

sight to reaching our target of $6 billion to $8 billion from asset 
monetizations, so bottom line, we committed to driving our net debt to 
EBITDA ratio to around 2.5x by year
-
end, and we are right on track
 
for 
achieving that.
 
Second priority was mobility, and we had another really strong quarter, and 
it continues to grow and build momentum with customers. Our wireless 

some significant acco
unting pressures. Our postpaid and prepaid phones 
grew very nicely and churn remains low across both products. So, all in all, 

 
And then stabilizing profitability of our entertainment gro
up, this was a must 
do for us this year. And John Donovan and his team are exceeding 

it by nearly 7%. There was a small one
-
time item in there from a carriage 
dispute settlement, b
ut even removing that, growth was very healthy, I 
think around 5% excluding that. And so, that was led by 8% growth in 
broadband revenues. I got to tell you our fiber product, the AT&T fiber 
product is doing very well in the marketplace.
 
On the cost side, 
the team is doing terrific work on controlling content costs, 
promotion costs, and all the other operating costs. And then, finally, some 
aggressive customer segmentation and targeting are driving some higher 
video ARPUs. And so, I think what you should ex
pect is as we work through 
the year, we will continue to see declines in traditional TV subs, particularly 
those areas where we can't bundle with broadband, but as we get into the 
second half of the year, we roll out our thin client video product. There wi
ll 
be a much lower price product in the marketplace. What I think you'll see is 
subscriber losses should lessen as we get into 2020.
 

over the top product. That should be pretty stable for
 
the rest of the year. 
We might see some slight customer losses in the second quarter as the price 
increases continue to flow through. The second half of the year should be 
decent. Bottom line, I remain comfortable that we are either going to meet 
or excee
d our entertainment group EBITDA target for the full
-

going to lay the groundwork for continued stability as we move beyond 
2019.
 
At WarnerMedia, it's been a really strong start to the year. Revenue growth 
was solid. Operating income grew by
 
double digits. Our merger
-
related 
synergies are on track and we expect to hit $700 million in run rate by the 
end of this year. Stankey and his team have reorganized the business to 
compete in a world of streaming and streaming content. We brought in some
 
great new talent, like Bob Greenblatt. He is a known commodity. He is 
running WarnerMedia Entertainment, and is also leading the SVOD 
development project for us. And I got to tell you, I think he is one of the 
best around and I couldn't be more excited to
 
have him on board.
 
Bob and his team's top priority is to develop our new SVOD service. And as 

significantly enhanced by the Warner Bros. library, which is a very, very 
deep and prolific l
ibrary. The closer we get to launching this service, the 
more excited I get. We are planning a WarnerMedia Day for everybody in the 

across from WarnerMedia and we're going to give yo
u a detailed look at the 
product, and that includes the breadth of new and existing content. So just 
stay tuned for that and we're making significant investments here and we 
think our customers are going to love this product.
 
Now every facet of our strateg
y is built on a foundation of world
-
class 
connectivity. And a few years ago, we set out to build the best video delivery 
platform in the world, and we invested billions of dollars securing spectrum 
licenses, and we made it among our highest priorities to g
o after and to win 

FirstNet build has now passed the halfway mark and it is running well ahead 
of schedule. We now have more than 7,000 agencies signed up across the 
country with mo
re than 570,000 subscribers, and those numbers are 
growing.
 
This initiative along with our vast portfolio of spectrum has catapulted AT&T 
into the leadership position in network quality. Over the last few months, 
AT&T has been recognized as both the best a
s well as the fastest wireless 
network, and FirstNet has enabled us to accelerate our 5G and fiber build 
out. Our 5G service is now in parts of 19 cities and we will have 5G coverage 
nationwide next year. We are the only carrier to offer 5G service to 
busi
nesses and consumers, and we're well ahead of our competition here. 
And our AT&T fiber network now surpasses 20 million locations, that's both 
consumers and businesses. And in short, our network investments are 
paying off and we're not done yet.
 
Finally, B
rian Lesser and his team continue to grow Xandr, that's our 
advertising business. Revenues were up 26% including the AppNexus 
acquisition. They had strong EBITDA margins and we're continuing to invest 
in new product development capabilities as we integrate
 
more of Turner's ad 
inventory. So, we're very pleased with the progress we're making. Our 
strategy is working. Our key initiatives are on track and you can expect 
strong execution on these priorities as we continue in the quarters ahead.
 
And so, with that

and he'll take you through the results.
 
John Stephens
 
Thanks, Randall, good morning, everyone. Again, thanks for being on the 
call today. Let me begin with our financial summary on Slide 5. Adjuste
d EPS 
was $0.86 in the quarter. WarnerMedia continues to be accretive. Mobility is 
adding customers and we saw EBITDA growth in our Entertainment group. 
Offsetting these positive signs was about $400 million non
-
cash impact from 
the reversal of rev rec and
 
fulfillment deferrals. We expect those headwinds 

guidance.
 
Adjusted earnings included a higher interest expense from the Time Warner 
acquisition and the non
-
cash impact of lower capitaliz
ed interest as we 
continue to put additional spectrum into service in our mobility business. 
During the quarter, we also had a mark
-
to
-
market adjustment to our 
pension plan based on our expected distributions for the coming year. The 
$0.05 impact reflects 
lower interest rate even though we significantly 
exceeded our returns on plant asset assumptions.
 
Consolidated revenues came in at $44.8 billion, up 18%. Thanks mostly to 
the acquisition of Time Warner. The gains in mobility service revenues, 
WarnerMedia a
nd broadband were offset by a foreign exchange impact of 
approximately $550 million and lower U.S wireless equipment sales of about 
$175 million as well as a little bit of ongoing legacy product pressure.
 
When you look at our pro forma basis, revenues were
 
down slightly due 
entirely to the impact of foreign exchange and lighter equipment revenues. 
Without those impacts, revenues were up. Operating income showed solid 
growth and adjusted consolidated operating margins were 21.4% or up a 
170 basis points with
 
strong growth in the WarnerMedia and mobility and 
significant improvement in our Entertainment group. EG's first quarter 
EBITDA puts us in solid shape to meet or be our full
-
year EBITDA target for 
EG.
 
Our cash flows also continued to be impressive. Let's 
look at those in Slide 
6. Both our cash from operations and free cash flow saw strong growth. 
Cash from operations was up 24%, mostly reflecting WarnerMedia. Free 
cash flow was $5.9 billion. The addition of WarnerMedia operations obviously 
made an impact. 
For example, our securitization efforts got a lift to more 
than $1 billion from adding WarnerMedia to our program. This helped to 
overcome $700 million in pressure from income taxes, where in the first 
quarter of last year we received a significant refund 
from the December 
2017 passage of tax reform.
 
When you look at our free cash flow for the past 12 months, we are well 
over $25 billion. And with a full
-
year of Time Warner, we have confidence in 
meeting or exceeding our $26 billion range cash flow 
guidance. Our dividend 
payout of free cash flow was about 63% in the first quarter, another healthy 
amount. We also continue to invest at high levels. Our reporting CapEx was 
$5.2 billion and total capital investment was right at $6 billion when you 
includ
e $800 million of payments from vendor financing arrangements.
 
We have been receiving favorable payment terms from several suppliers, 
which allow us to be more efficient with our spending. And you see that at 
our capital investment in the quarter. We had $
700 million of equipment 
assets put in the service during the first quarter that we won't have to pay 
for and aren't included in our CapEx number because of these new vendor 
financing activity. As a reminder, payments made under our vendor 
financing obliga
tions are classified in the cash flow statement as financing 
activities, not investing activities.
 
I will get into more detail about our leverage little later, but our net debt 
declined a solid $2.3 billion in the quarter. In addition to strong free cash 
f
low in the quarter, we amended many of our collateral support agreements 
with our lenders, which allows us to reclaim most of the collateral posted for 
our foreign currency hedges. The net result was more than $1 billion in cash 
return to us, fully offsett
ing our vendor financing payments. And we don't 
expect to post much additional collateral during the five years of these 
arrangements. In fact, we expect to get another $300 million or more in 
collateral return to us in the second quarter.
 
Let's now look a
t our segment operating results, starting with 
communications on Slide 7. Mobility turned in another solid quarter with 
service revenue growth, solid margins and postpaid and prepaid phone 
growth. Our Entertainment Group got off to a good start and stabili
zing 
EBITDA for the year. In fact, we grew at nearly 7% in the quarter, thanks to 
broadband revenues growing more than 8% and tight cost controls. In fact, 
our broadband growth exceeded our legacy revenue change in the quarter.
 
Communication revenues were 
up slightly when you exclude lower 
equipment revenues from the fewer smartphone upgrades. And margins 
were up 20 basis points even with the accounting headwinds and lower 
business wireline EBITDA. Business continues to be impacted by legacy 
declines and th
en transition to a low margin services. The first quarter had a 
tough year
-
over
-
year compare and this year we had higher deferral 
amortization and a wholesale business customer default, but we still posted 
$2.5 billion of EBITDA for the quarter.
 
Now let's 
take a deeper look at our mobility results on Slide 8. Solid service 
revenue growth drove wireless revenue gain even as equipment revenues 
get to lowest upgrade rate in our history. Service revenues grew by nearly 
$400 million or 2.9% in the quarter and EB
ITDA grew by about 2% even 
with non
-
cash accounting headwinds of $200 million and subscriber gains in 
postpaid and prepaid phones. We grew postpaid phone net adds by 80,000 
in the quarter, a significant improvement compared to a year
-
ago and 
FirstNet conti
nued to be a tailwind to customer growth.
 
In prepaid, we had 85,000 phone net adds, our 17th consecutive quarter of 
growth. We continue to be strategic here as well, focusing on the high
-
value 
prepaid market. Cricket is our flagship brand in prepaid. It ge
nerated strong 
subscriber growth and had its lowest ever quarterly churn rate of less than 
3%, down more than 60 basis points year
-
over
-
year. Prepaid revenue 
growth was solid, up more than 6%. We now have more than 10 million 
Cricket subscribers, double wh
at we had when we acquired the company in 
2014 with more than 17 million total prepaid customers under the umbrella 
of AT&T.
 
Randall already mentioned our many network achievements, but I will also 
point out that the percentage of new FirstNet customers is
 
shifting to more 
customers new to AT&T and fewer migrations.
 
Let's now look at our Entertainment Group results on Slide 9. The headline in 
Entertainment Group is growing EBITDA and operating contribution. And 

rget of stabilizing EG EBITDA 
for the full
-
year. EBITDA grew by more than $180 million and margins 
expanded by 180 basis points to 24.7%, reversing a trend that we saw last 
year as the chart shows. A few things drove that improvement. First was 
good expens
e control both on content cost moderation from some recent 
renewals and operational cost such as lower advertising expense and 
promotional spending.
 
Also we had a one
-
time settlement of a prior year carriage dispute that help 
the first quarter by about $40
 
million. So even without that one
-
time event, 
we had growth of over 5%. Third, our video ARPU increased as we focused 
on higher value customers, reduce promotions and move our pricing to 
market for both premium at over the top service offerings.
 
Advertisi
ng revenues also continue to grow. Our premium ARPU grew for the 
first time in five quarters, up more than 2% and DIRECTV NOW ARPU was 
up more than $10 year
-
over
-
year. The number of premium TV customers on 
a 2
-
year price lock promotion declined by about 70
0,000 in the quarter. We 
still have about 1.6 million customers left on that pricing and we work 
through those for the rest of the year.
 
Our focus on 
--
 
is on the long
-
term value customers. Secular declines and 
pricing moves we've made, did results in fewe
r gross adds and 544,000 
fewer video subscribers. Changes to packaging and pricing in DIRECTV NOW 
impacted over the top net adds as well, but was significantly less than the 
fourth quarter.
 
Broadband revenues grew by more than 8% and contributed to EBITDA 

and broadband for the past year, helping us stabilize and grow EBITDA. We 
expect IP broadband ARPU growth to continue, but somewhat more 
moderate rates as we lap the step up that we 
saw in the second quarter of 
last year. We gained nearly 300,000 AT&T fiber customers in the quarter, 
bringing the total in service to more than 3 million and we now passed more 
than 12 million customer locations with fiber. For the quarter, we added 
45,00
0 broadband customers.
 
During the quarter, we updated our billing process for the premium video 
and broadband customers. Customers are now billed and receive service for 
the full month when they stay 
--
 
when they are in the last month of service, 
which is 
consistent with our content cost and mobility customer policies as 
well as the rest of the industry. This generated additional revenues for us 
and gave us additional time to win back customers. Customers in service at 
the end of the period were higher beca
use of this change, about a 117,000 
subscribers in premium TV and 38,000 in broadband.
 
We expect the video net add challenges we saw in the first quarter will 
continue. Achieving EBITDA growth in the first quarter was a tremendous 
accomplishment for our En
tertainment Group team. We continue to have 
confidence that we will meet or exceed our EBITDA target for the full
-
year.
 
Let's move to WarnerMedia's first quarter results, which are on Slide 10. 
WarnerMedia continues to exceed our expectations and had a str
ong start to 
the year. Revenue growth was up more than 3% and operating income once 
again showed double
-
digit growth and nearly 12% with gains in all three 
units, and WarnerMedia continues to be accretive to both earnings and free 
cash flow.
 
Warner Bros re
venue grew by nearly 9%. Theatrical revenues increased 
primarily due to carry over revenue from Aquaman. Television revenues 
increased primarily due to higher initial telecast revenues. HBO revenues 
declined mainly related to a carriage dispute with one ou
r distributors, but 
still realized operating income growth for the quarter. HBO's operating 
income was up due to lower programming costs. We continue to increase 
investment in high quality content. However, programming costs declined 
primarily due to the t
iming of content releases and some lower amortization 
expense.
 
Turner revenues were down slightly, subscription revenues continue to grow. 
Thanks to higher domestic affiliate rate. But this revenue growth was offset 
by ad revenue declines, primarily from t
he every other year shift of the 
NCAA Final Four games. We are the Final Four games in the first quarter last 
year and reported all that ad revenue. This year CBS reported that. in years 
which CBS broadcast the Final Four games, we reported our share as 
pa
rticipation interest not as ad revenue. That explains the difference, 
virtually all the difference in our ad revenues. With that, Turner's operating 
income was up 7%.
 
WarnerMedia set for a solid year with final season of Game of Thrones is 
underway and vie
wership is breaking records. More than 17 million people 
turned in for the season premiere and to date more than 27 million people 
have watched the episode. In fact, we added more HBO Now subscribers in 
the week leading up to the Season 8 premiere of Game 
of Thrones than in 
any other week in the services history. Those numbers will show up in the 
second quarter customer accounts.
 
We also had another successful airing of the March Madness, the NBA 
playoffs are going full steam on TNT. Warner Bros. Shazam! op
en earlier this 
month and is doing well at both the domestic and international box office. 
And later this year, we have our next Godzilla movie. It, Chapter 2 and the 
Joker, to name just a few of the great movies slated to be released.
 
Now let's look at Xa
ndr and Latin America results on Slide 11. Still very 
much in the early days for Xandr, but it continues to execute and expand. 
Revenues were up more than 26%, including AppNexus, our strongest first 
quarter growth in the last three years. Growth rate in t
his business tend to 
be seasonal and event driven such as election days with growing growth 
ramping throughout the year. EBITDA margins continued be strong and we 
continue to invest in developing our advertising platforms.
 
We are making progress, integrati
ng the Xandr marketplace across all of 
AT&T. Xandr is now helping optimize Turner inventory. Xandr will also be 


benefits 
of blending premium content with our data and distribution to take 
advantage of targeted and relevant advertising opportunities. These 
agreements can help distributors, content providers and most importantly, 
help our customers.
 
Turning to Latin A
merica, we continue to deal with foreign exchange and 
local economy challenges. Total Latin America revenues and EBITDA were 
down year
-
over
-
year, primarily due to those pressures. But on a constant 
currency basis and excluding Venezuela, revenues would hav
e grown .3% on 
a comparable basis.
 
In Mexico, we saw solid service revenue growth, which was offset by lower 
handset sales in the quarter. We are making good progress on our goal to 
achieve profitability in Mexico. We still have plans for more improvement,
 
EBITDA improved by $58 million year
-
over
-
year. We are improving 
operating income and maintain line of sight for EBITDA to breakeven in the 
second half of the year.
 
Coming into 2019, we adjusted our subscriber base in Mexico to reflect the 
impact of a doub
le count from certain third
-
party distributors and the sunset 
of 2G services. We continue to take operational steps to improve the quality 
of our sales and profitability. This includes focusing on higher value 
customers, adjustments to dealer commission st
ructures, reduction in the 
subsidies and targeted price increases. Each of these changes improves the 
long
-
term value of our business, but puts pressure on volume comparisons.
 
Even with our focus on higher value customers, we continue to grow our 
subscribe
r base of nearly 18 million subscribers. Given our focus on quality, 
we expect to see continued net add growth as churn improves. Foreign 
exchange significantly Vrio [ph], but revenues were flat sequentially. If you 
look at the results in constant currency
, revenues were up year
-
over
-
year 
and the business continues to be profitable and generate positive cash flow. 
The beginning of the year, customer base was adjusted for the prior year 
after we identified and shut off a group of nonpaying customers. Vrio ne
t 
adds were down, but our total subscriber base remain stable from a year
-
ago.
 
Now before we get to your questions, let me give you an update on 
deleveraging, that's on Slide 12. As you know, our goal is to get to the 2.5x 
net debt to EBITDA range by the e
nd of this year through free cash flow, 
asset sales and overall cash management and we are off to a really good 
start. First, our free cash flow, working capital and collateral agreement 
initiatives help us reduce net debt by $2.3 billion in the first quar
ter. 
Remember, the first quarter is usually our toughest quarter for free cash 
flow.
 
We still expect our free cash flow after dividends to generate about $12 

significant asset sales
 
that put us well on our way to our asset monetization 
target. And it includes the sale of our interest in Hulu for $1.4 billion, which 
closed on April 15 and the pending $2.2 billion sale of our interest in Hudson 
Yards, which was just announced. This put
s us in solid position to meet our 
leverage target of the 2.5x range by the end of the year. We are sharply 
focused on this. The teams have done a superb job so far and we expect 
that to continue through the rest of this year.
 
Mike, with that, we're 
ready to take some questions.
 
Michael Viola
 
Okay. Thanks, John. Greg, we will start with the Q&A and we will take our 
first question please.
 
Question
-
and
-
Answer Session
 
Operator
 
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of 
John Hodulik from UBS. Please go ahead.
 
John Hodulik
 
Okay, great. Thanks, guys. Maybe a couple of questions on EG. First, maybe 
for John, the 5% growth, the adjusted growth on EBITDA was quite a bit 
better than we thought, and we were led to believe given 
the price changes 
that you would actually see improving trends later as the year progressed 

change guidance, you said there could be some upside, but how should we 
think of the cadenc
e of that as some of these price increases work through 
the system there. And then, maybe drilling down on the traditional sub 
losses. I guess, we get some 
--
 
we understand how NOW is going to 

 
in HBO. 

$117,000 sub adjustment. First of all, is that the way to look at that? And 
then Randall, in your remarks, you said things would improve in the second 
half. And John, 
during your remarks you said that you'd still expect to see 
challenges. What is the cadence of that? Should we be using the 661 this 
quarter as the base of losses going forward? And the 1.6 million still on 

f and adding to churn? 
Just how should we think of that line going forward? Thanks.
 
John Stephens
 
Yes. So, John, let me try this. Let Randall kind of clear up what maybe I 

-
-
 
as we
 
mentioned, one
-
time adjustment was about $40 million, but the 
EBITDA growth was close to $200 million. So, it was only a small part of it. 
So it was really good. What 
--
 
that growth, and we're pleased and have 

of stability. We are not raising 
our guidance, but as Randall said and I repeated, it's clear that we're on line 
of sight to not only meet but exceed that target, so we are just being careful 
with our representations going out.
 
John Hodulik
 
Got it.
 
John St
ephens
 
We will continue to balance things and continue to measure costs, and go 
after high value customers, so we are leaving ourselves that flexibility, but 
we are clearly on track. I wouldn't suggest to you that you can draw a 
straight line out, but I fe


about it. We continue to expect to meet our guidance. At this stage, I 
understand why you would think we're going to exceed it, we'll l
et that 
happen. We are going to stick with our guidance as it is today with the 
understanding that we're outperforming on many respects.
 
With regard to the sub losses, I think of it as a 
--
 
the 544 is the right 
number. I understand we pointed out the chang
e in the billing [ph], but 

out there. So it's not a loss each quarter or an adjustment each quarter. In 
the second quarter, it just refreshes itself. So, it's kind of just the tim
ing 
item on a one
-
time basis. Secondly, we did price increases on an annual 
basis in January. So that affected. All the customers got some price 
increase, that affected the linear. And we had about 700,000 customers 
impacted by the 2
-
year price lock. As we
 
go through the year, we won't 
have another annual price increase per se. So that will have a 
--
 
that impact 
on customer accounts won't necessarily be there in that light. And then, 
secondly, as we get through now down to about 1.6 million at the beginning
 
of the year 2.4 million on the price locks, as we get through the rest of 
those, we'll see less and less impact from those just because we get through 
the process. We expect that process to continue through November, which is 
the 2
-
year anniversary the la
st time we had an offer on this, but we'll see a 
lot of that activity going through in the second quarter. That's the difference 
between the first quarter and the rest of the year in the sense of the annual 
price increase as well as the largest group of th
e 700,000 customers hitting 
by the 2
-
year price lock. Randall, what would you want to add?
 
Randall Stephenson
 


 
effect of that in the fourth quarter and the first quarter. Second quarter, 
you'll see that moderate, and I actually believe second half of the year based 
on what we're seeing in terms of uptake in the market on the new platform 
and the new product, and w
e should have a decent second half of the year 
on DIRECTV NOW. On the traditional premium product DIRECTV, I said you 
should expect continue to see losses as we move through this year, but we 
will be launching second half of the year the thin client, which
 
think of that is 
our satellite replacement product. And why this is so important? It allows us 
to get into the market at a lower price point. When you look at the DIRECTV 
churn, it's interesting. What you see is not people at the high end in terms of 
ARPU
s that are churning. It's disproportionally at the low end and where we 
don't have broadband. And so this thin client gives us an opportunity to 
meet that low end with a better price point and this should start to moderate 
the subscriber losses. And partic
ularly as we get into 2020, we think this 
product is going to have a really good appeal for people down market in 
terms of their expectations of video pricing.
 
John Hodulik
 
Okay. Thanks, guys.
 
Michael Viola
 
Greg, we will take the next question please.
 
Oper
ator
 
Your next question comes from the line of David Barden from Bank of 
America. Please go ahead.
 
David Barden
 
Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. I guess, first kind of a bigger 
picture question with respect to the DTC strategy, Randall, or John 
Stankey, 
if he's on. A couple of weeks ago we saw Disney launch a DTC product or 
announce a launch with lower
-
than
-
expected pricing, bigger than expected 
losses. Numbers came down and the stock jumped 10% because people 
were looking at this as kind of a st
andalone Netflix being incubated inside 
Disney. And I was wondering if you guys could kind of address how you guys 
think about how the market would react to a similar announcement at AT&T? 
And if you could at this stage kind of dissect a little bit about w
hat you think 
is good and strong about the Disney platform announcement and what 
maybe vulnerable about their approach and opportunities you see for 
yourself to come into that market. I guess, kind of on a related topic, could 
you talk a little bit about w
hat if anything the Hulu sale might mean to the 
financials of the business. My guess is that you'll kind of see less losses from 
that flowing through to the earnings statement? And if you could kind of size 
that, that will be helpful for us. Thanks so much
.
 
Randall Stephenson
 
David, this is Randall. On Hulu, fewer losses and less capital requirements. 
So 
--
 
but we received $1.4 billion in cash and we're no longer in it, and so 
the capital goals go away, obviously. So on the Disney launch, yes I was 
impresse
d by what Disney did. I was 
--
 
also I thought the market reaction 
was an indication that people look at what Disney would be able to bring to 
market in terms of original content, library of content, deep strong brand 
content and new and original content an
d talking about the licensing that 
they would be pulling back in and I think what it did is gave the market an 
appreciation that this is a viable direct
-
to
-
consumer product, that will have 
good appeal for a broad number of customers, not just in the U.S., 
but 
around the world. And so I thought it was very instructive from that 
standpoint. From our standpoint, you'd be able to formulate your own 
opinion in September, October about what will be bringing to bear. But in 
terms of premium content, think about th
e HBO brand. In terms of breadth 
of content, consider the Warner Bros. library and the depth of that library, 
the new original content creation machine at Warner Bros., which is really an 
impressive scale machine in terms of producing theatrical as well as
 
TV 
productions. And we're actually quite optimistic that we have something 
from both a magnitude of content, breadth of content, depth of content, new 
and original generation creation capabilities that we believe we can bring to 
market and will have signi
ficant customer uptake. And we will lay out for you 
those details in terms of what we think that looks like, what our expectations 
are for this product, including pricing and so forth. We are not ready to fully 
disclose all that yet. There's a lot of work 
being done. Bob Greenblatt is just 
getting his hands into this and working at aggressively. But I will tell you 
we're very, very optimistic and the Disney announcement gave us nothing, 
but more optimism in terms of what we think we will be able to bring to
 
market.
 
David Barden
 
Thanks, Randall.
 
Randall Stephenson
 
Thank you, David.
 
Michael Viola
 
Okay. Greg, we will take the next question. Thanks.
 
Operator
 
Your next question comes from the line of Simon Flannery from Morgan 
Stanley. Please go ahead.
 
Simon 
Flannery
 
Great. Thank you very much. I wonder if you could turn to wireless. Perhaps 
you could just update us on the outlook on the wireless service revenues for 
the rest of the year, another good performance and the ads turning around 
despite churn contin
uing to be a little bit higher year
-
over
-
year. So talk us 

advantage of that, and how that should shape during the year
-
end? Any 
updated color on the 5G rollout? We haven't really seen a lo
t on the 
commercial site. So when do we see more kind of opportunities in terms of 
pricing plans and so forth? Is that when the sub 6 gigahertz chipsets come 
out? Thanks.
 
John Stephens
 
Sure, Simon. Let me take a run at it and ask Randall back me up. But fi
rst 
on the wireless revenue outlook continued to be positive. I stand by our 
guidance, and expect new service revenues. We had a great growth almost 
3%, 2.9% in the first quarter. I will point out that last 
--
 
second quarter is 
when we saw some service rev
enue growth. So our compares get a little 
tougher in the second quarter and then a little bit more tough in the third 

will still expect to grow it. It just has little tough compares,
 
that's one. Two, 
why do we expect to grow? Because we do expect customer net adds. This 
first quarter was the first time in, I think, five years we had positive postpaid 
phone growth and solid prepaid phone growth. I think probably close to 
170,000 or so 
voice that adds in the first quarter. In total, it's really great 

marketplace. So we feel good about the momentum coming out of that and 
that opportunity going forward. I will give you a
 
sidebar. Our reseller losses 

--
 
in quarters, I should say, excuse 

--
 
that service 
revenue item. From a network improvements perspective, Randall 
mentioned the mul
tiple awards that we're getting. Anybody's heard Mike and 
I do presentations know that we test the speeds walking down the hallways 
before our presentations and it's working. We get emails from investors and 
so forth. So it's having a real impact that we b
elieve is impacting our ability 
to gain and retain customers. It's going to take a while to make sure we get 
that story fully understood. It's 
--
 
I mean, it takes a while to convince 
people, so we're optimistic that we will see the benefits that later in t
he 
year. We are at 53% of our network build out for FirstNet as of the end of 
the first quarter. We expect to get to 60% clearly by the end of the third 

with FirstNet authority. And as
 

--
 
first reimburse going to get that done. Now we expect to do that. We are 
well ahead of schedule. Team is doing a great job in that. Putting all that 
spectrum into use at once maybe caused some interest expense pre
ssure, 
but it's working and it's working in the quality of the network. 5G were at 19 
markets today operational using that 39 gigahertz millimeter wave. I will tell 
you, we still have plans to get a couple hundred. We have, if you will, a 
couple hundred mi
llion on our 5G evolution network coverage by the end of 
this year, but end of next year we will have over 200 million of our POPS 
covered on a 5G network. So our plans for 5G are going quite well. We 
--
 
as 

e to come until next year 
and the year after, but we are working on a number of things. Whether it's 
in the hospital, in core netting medical centers, or it's in the factories, 
whether it's doing a whole host of automated, if you will, campuses for our 
big
 
customers, we are seeing lots of really good progress with that. But it 
--
 
from a revenue perspective for a company of our size, we're still 
--
 
we're 
very optimistic, we're leading in 5G, but we'll see those revenue impacts 
growing over next year into the
 
2020 one timeframe.
 
Randall Stephenson
 
I would 
--
 
Simon, I would add that this is the wireless piece. The network 
quality piece is probably the area within our business where I take more 
satisfaction than just about anywhere else. And this has been a long
 
time 

billions of dollars in building the spectrum portfolio, and so bringing on 
FirstNet and having the opportunity to begin turning up all that spectrum is 
we're going across the 
country and turning up FirstNet is having exactly the 
impact that we hoped it would have and it is changing the value proposition 
for our customers. The value proposition is now one of quality and speed 
and delivery of video and we're not going out doing a
 
lot of aggressive 
promotions and we're not doing pricing to try to get customers to stay and 
come on to the network. It is happening just organically and by virtue of the 
strategy that we implemented. The 5G evolution of product that we have out 
there as 
we turn all this spectrum up and put the new technology on MIMO 
and so forth, our competitors hate it, but it is having exactly the effect that 
you wanted to have. Our customers see this tag and they go do a speed 

meg speeds depending on where 
they are. It is truly a step change difference in product capability. And that 
its having exactly the effect that we had hoped. And so all the areas that I 
look at right now and say I am pleased with this is the number one are
a that 


feeling really good about that as well. But this is really, really an important 
accomplishment for us.
 
Simon Flannery
 
Great. Thank you.
 
Michael Viola
 
Thanks, Simon. Greg, ready for the next question.
 
Operator
 
Your next question comes from the line of Philip Cusick from JPMorgan. 
Please go ahead.
 
Philip Cusick
 
Hey, guys. Thanks.
 
Randall Stephenson
 
Hi, Phil.
 
Philip Cusick
 
C
an you 
--
 
two follow
-
ups. Can you dig first into the wireless growth and 
help us quantify what FirstNet is doing for the subline? And then, second, a 
follow
-
up on the video side. Can you expand on your relationship with the 
NFL, and particular on the exclu
sivity of Sunday ticket? Thank you.
 
Randall Stephenson
 
Sure. Wireless growth, we 
--
 
we're having a lot of success with FirstNet even 
with only 50% of the nation now completed in terms of the network build. 
And you heard 570,000 subscribers and John articul

threshold where more and more those are coming new on to the network, 

FirstNet community. We put some very attractive offers out there for their 
families. A
nd so every FirstNet subscriber that comes on to the network, I 

 
John Stephens
 
Yes.
 
Randall Stephenson
 

impact on subscriber 
gains. The network quality being the best and FirstNet 
being a main driver of it. So FirstNet is going to be a very important 
strategic element for us for a number of years to come and we are 
--
 
we 
continue to be more enthused about it than when we want to
 
bid and won 
the deal. In terms of the NFL, I think we're not allowed to discuss much, but 
the exclusivity should remain as we go forward on DIRECTV. You probably 
saw news that the NFL network was taken down on our U
-
verse network. 
And look, we're heavily 
invested in the NFL on DIRECTV, but we're limited to 
carrying the Sunday ticket just on DIRECTV. And so our customers that have 
a high affinity to the NFL, we tend to have them overall on DIRECTV. When 
you look at the NFL network, there's some costs attach
ed to that. And when 
you consider the games on the NFL network or the NFL Draft, our customers 
can watch the NFL Draft on ABC, they can watch the Thursday night games 
on Fox, and so it's all stuff we carry and so the NFL network was for a 
product U
-
verse t
hat was not allowed to carry the Sunday ticket. It just 

some content cost and we will give our customers access to the NFL through 
other mediums. If they really are a NFL centric 
customer, we will move them 
to DIRECTV.
 
Philip Cusick
 
Got it. Thank you. And at one point you had talked about bending the 
content cost curve on DIRECTV. You re
-
signed Viacom. Is there something 
coming that you think might bend that curve, or we should be 
looking at it 
sort of linear from here?
 
Randall Stephenson
 


last few months have all been curve benders.
 
And we are 
--
 
we feel good 
about where we are coming in and I think the margins on Entertainment 
Group are reflecting that. So bottom line, I am satisfied with the progress 
that John Donovan and his team are making on the content deals are 
coming up and g
etting them re
-
crafted to make sure we can distribute them 
to all of our various platforms and controlling the cost curve.
 
John Stephens
 
Remember Phil, the ability to work with them on 
--
 

content distributors have more advertising mi
nutes than we as the 
distributor do. So if we can use our advertising resources to increase our 

then we can offer that to the content guys. There is a different 
--
 
there is a 
solu
tion to the situation where they can gain advertising revenues and not 
have that the content cost, but still the revenues for them, and both of us 
benefit as do the customers. And quite frankly, we are really excited about 
Viacom. As we said we're working 
at Xandr with Viacom on things just like 
that. So those solutions here that are to be mutually beneficial, all three of 
the parties, the distributors, the content providers and the advertisers. So, 

at job, but we 
believe that there are solutions here that makes sense for everybody.
 
Michael Viola
 
Thanks, Phil. Greg, we will take the next question, please.
 
Operator
 
Your next question comes from the line of Brett Feldman from Goldman 
Sachs. Please go ah
ead.
 
Brett Feldman
 
Thanks for taking the question. On the slide where you show your fiber 
broadband net adds, what we can see is that there's been gradual 

building out the fiber 
network. I was hoping you could give us just a little bit 

mix of that then shifting from upgrades to maybe winning new customers. 
How do you see that trending as you complete the fi
ber build out? And if you 
can give us any insight into the success you've had at bundling that fiber 
with some of your other products, that will be really helpful. Thank you.
 
John Stephens
 
Yes. So, Brett, let me take a shot at it. And I appreciate you brin
ging this 
up, because I should dovetail this in 
--
 
for our prior question. When you look 
at the Entertainment Group margins in total, broadband is really a driver. 
Broadband is really a grower. If you remember my comments, broadband 
growth this year
-
over
-
y
ear quarter exceeded the challenges, the headwinds 
we faced from the local voice of the other equipment revenue. So that's 
actually 
--
 
when you put broadband there, broadband's growth exceeded 
that. So broadband, specifically fiber derivative is doing well
. And it is 
--
 
and 
it itself is helping drive EBITDA margin improvement at Entertainment 
Group. That's one. Two, we will continue to see some revenue growth on 
broadband throughout the year, just like wireless compares get a little bit 
more challenging in 
the second and third quarters, but we still 
--
 
we still 
expect to see ARPU growth and revenue growth. So feel really good about 


ow much more we put 
out a 1 million or 1.5 million a quarter, we continue to immediately utilize 
25% of that, because we've continue to add capacity and we will finish off 
adding that capacity at least from the FCC requirements we have in July. We 
will the
n start to further penetrate that market. So we feel like we will be 
able to grow it. If you think about the timeframe, keeping up at a 25% is a 
pretty good penetration rate when you continue to add as much fiber as 

ave the video, the wireless, the 
fiber together bundling is going well. It continues to give us an opportunity 
to participate and take market share in the broadband space. You are right, 
we continue to see on the early stages migrations of existing custome
rs. But 
once again, as we get passed that that initial stage, we get in to be able to 

continue to see going forward. So with that being said, I expect we will get 
to around 14 million or
 
maybe just under that range by the end of June and 
to July kind of the timeframe to fulfill our FCC requirement. That will give us 
22 million customer locations in total. But that 14 million we'd expect to 
continue to see that 25% penetration very quickly
 
and move up from there 
and get into a on par market share with our competitors as we take share or 
convert more customers. Let me stop at that and see Randall, if there's 
anything you want to add or anything I forgot?
 
Randall Stephenson
 
No, I think you co
vered it well. This is probably one of the more exciting 
areas of the business in terms of where we have invested heavily and now 
we are seeing the fruits of the investment and getting to 25% penetration, 
that's almost mechanical. To be candid with you, wh
enever we go into a 
neighborhood and turn up fiber, 25% comes fast and 50% is eminently 
achievable. And we actually think we can hopefully get beyond 50% as we 

fiber, a video produ
ct and a mobile product, churn rates just drop. And the 
value effect of that is really, really powerful. Customers will love it and the 
services were all premium services and so this is going to be a really 
important element of us as we go through the rest
 
of this year in 2020 in 
terms of keeping the Entertainment Group EBITDA stable.
 
Brett Feldman
 
Thank you.
 
Randall Stephenson
 
Thanks, Brett.
 
Operator
 
Your next question comes from the line of Mike McCormick from 
Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead.
 
Michael
 
McCormick
 
Hi, guys. Thanks. Maybe just a quick comment on the wireless business. It 
sounds like you guys grew 
--
 
you are fairly aggressive in 1Q on the buy one 
get one offers. Clearly FirstNet is having a positive impact, but how should 
we think about on 
a going forward basis through 2019 the appetite for that 
trade
-
off between promotional activity margin and phone net adds? And 
then, secondly on the broadband side, the active broadband side, could you 
give us a sense 
--
 

that allocation 
--
 
the 
revenue allocation change, how should we think about the spot pricing in 
broadband sort of today versus, say a year
-
ago.? Thanks.
 
John Stephens
 
Let me take the first one. On the mobility margins and the perception of 
BOGOs and so forth, remember our equipment revenues are really down. So 
in 
--
 
so that may have an effect depending upon on how any of our 
promotions are done on the BOGO stuff, but le
t me say it this way. If you 
look at our results and you say service revenues were up about $375 million, 
$400 million, and our 
--
 
about $375 million and our EBITDA was about $130 
million, $350 million. And then you say I had noncash accounting rev rec 
com
mission and amortization in the rev rec and so forth of about $200 
million. Effectively, of that $375 million service revenue, $350 million 
--
 
or 
almost $350 million of it fell to the bottom line from making that accounting 
adjustments. So from that perspe
ctive, it won't be really effective at 
controlling cost, controlling promos, being prudent with advertising and 
promotional expense. So we feel good about the quality of our customer 
count net adds and the ability to do that. I mean, I understand your 
ques
tion, but I don't want to leave you with the impression that somehow 
--
 
this was a very thoughtful process and focused on value of customers. And 
we 
--
 
I believe we are really successful. So I would tell you that the value of 
FirstNet, the quality experien
ce of the market and the opportunity it 

more distribution points out there with opening new stores. But that's part of 
our investment that we're making that sometimes shows up in the
 
expense 
line as opposed in the CapEx line. But we're expanding our stores in places 
where we have stores before. So all of that based on FirstNet, based on the 
solid very, very solid first quarter results, based on this expanded, if you 
will, geographic f
ootprint and distribution footprint, we feel really good about 
wireless going forward.
 
Randall Stephenson
 

communities, as we deploy, we're turning up new distribution in these rural
 
communities and these tend to be communities that have had one option for 
the last number of years. And we're having a lot of success as we move into 
the smaller communities, set up new distribution and taking market share. 

efit of the FirstNet build.
 
John Stephens
 
With regard to the IP broadband side, I just refer you to the kind of the 
ARPUs, I think that we got published out there with regard to this quarter 
being at about 50 
--
 
little over 50 bucks on the broadband ARPU, 
it's about 
8% growth. But if you compare it to next quarter you will see next quarter 
year
-
over
-
year 
--
 
we jump from first quarter to second quarter last year. 

about the succes
s of the project. We feel really good about it and we do feel 
like as we get more of the fiber put in service. We have the opportunity to 
--
 
our customers will want higher
-
speed, and they will be willing to pay a fair 
price for those higher
-
speeds. So we a
re optimistic about it. We are just 
being careful from a numerical comparison perspective. If you look at the 
first quarter last year, both on wireless and on broadband to second quarter 
you saw a step up in those ARPU numbers, and we just want to make sur
e 
the compare is right.
 
Michael McCormick
 

price increases across the board and over the top streaming video products. 
How does DIRECTV now sort of set up against that and in this lan
dscape how 
do you view price elasticity for your customer?
 
Randall Stephenson
 
Yes, Mike, we made our move on OTT pricing and rationalizing the whole 
content lineup for our OTT product in the fourth quarter. And you've now 
seen most of the other players tha
t have a streaming product out there 
follow. And I think we're getting to a place where the product, we all look at. 
So, okay, this is a sustainable place if you can get the advertising revenues 
to where we think we can get them. This was probably a sustai
nable level. It 
is as you're seeing highly price
-
sensitive. This is a segment of the market 
that had by and large left the linear product market, because of pricing. And 
so as we came in with a $40 product, you saw a significant uptake and it 
was largely p
eople who had left the market. And as you begin to move the 
pricing and try to get the profit equation right, you saw some fallout, but 

of getting the new platform out there. It ca
me out I think very end of March, 
but we're seeing good uptake on the new platform, the new pricing. As I said 
during the second quarter, you may still see the OTT product to be negative 
in terms of subscribers, as we continue to experience price increases
 
on the 
base. But what we're seeing on the uptake of the new product with a new 
price point is giving us confidence. So we get to the second half of the year, 
this thing ought to do decent growth. And so we're actually optimistic, but it 
is a very price
-
se
nsitive product, Mike. Make no mistake about it.
 
Michael Viola
 
Thanks, Mike. Greg, we will take one last question.
 
Operator
 
Okay. That question comes from the line of Michael Rollins from Citi. Please 
go ahead.
 
Michael Rollins
 
Hi. Thanks and good morning. 
Two, if I could. First, as you look at the 
performance of full fiber subscribers when you made the upgrade relative to 
the implied decline of customers with DSL and fiber
-
to
-
the
-
node, how are 
you thinking about what portion of your homes ultimately need to
 
get the 
full fiber capability and how quickly you want to get there. And then, 
secondly, you described the growth in fixed broadband ARPU as customers 
are buying up the higher
-
speed packages. Do you see a multiyear 
opportunity in the wireless segment to c
hange the pricing model and charge 
higher prices for higher bit 
--
 
higher bit rate, especially as you introduce 5GE 
and then eventually full 5G?
 
Randall Stephenson
 
Yes. On the 5G piece, Mike, I will be very surprised. If as we move into 
wireless, the prici

pricing regime you see in fixed line. If you can offer a gig speed, there are 
some customers that are willing to pay a premium for 500 meg to a gig 
speed and so forth. So I expect that to be the case. 
We are two or three 
years away from seeing that play out. Right now from a 5G standpoint, what 
we're seeing in terms of adoption tends to be business. In fact it's 
exclusively business for us right now. Its serving as a land replacement 
product and we're h
aving really impressive demand where we turn up the 
5G service from businesses basically saying, we want to put a router in, and 
it becomes their LAN replacement. And so now as you begin to think about 
equipment, whether it be handsets or tablets or laptop
s that have 5G 
modems within them, which that will happen starting this year and it really 
pick up over the next year, then that truly does become a LAN replacement. 
You don't even need the router at that stage. And so, the idea that just like 
business cus
tomers pay more for more speed in a fixed line environment, we 
expect that there is going to be demand and that there will be price 
differentiation for speed as you move into a 5G environment. In terms of 
fiber upgrades, we have as you know, over the last 
3, plus 4 years have the 
most aggressive fiber deployment program probably in the United States. 
And so we've been going at a really hot rate in putting fiber out. As I 
mentioned earlier, I think it was to Mike McCormick's question, the adoption 
on fiber d
eployment in terms of taking market share and customer upgrades 
is fairly mechanical. It doesn't take a rocket science to figure out what this 
looks like as you deploy fiber. And so while we're going to kind of finish off 
this first phase of our fiber depl
oyment between 5G and FirstNet and just 

fiber continue to be pushed into this network. And as business locations 

oyment 
continue over the next 4 or 5 years. And it's not going to go at the same 

see that stopping. So I see our fiber opportunity just continuing to grow as 
we move 2020 throug
h 2025. Thanks for the questions, Mike.
 
Michael Rollins
 
Thank you.
 
Michael Viola
 
Okay. Well, listen, I appreciate everybody joining us. And once again, 
punchline to this quarter is we have basically done exactly what we told you 
we would do at the Analyst 
Day and then again our January guidance. Debt 
reduction is right on track. Asset sales and asset monetizations are right on 
track. Our free cash flow forecast is actually ahead of schedule and 
Entertainment Group is on track and actually ahead of schedule 
as well. So 
stay tuned. We will be getting more details to you in terms of our 
WarnerMedia Day to come in September, October timeframe. And I 
appreciate your time and look forward to talking to you again. Thank you.

Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Fourth 
Quarter 2017 Earnings Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen
-
only 
mode. Later, we will conduct a question
-
and
-
answer session. Instructions 
will be given at 
that time. [Operator Instructions] Also as a reminder, 
today's teleconference is being recorded.
 
I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Michael Viola, 
Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
 
Michael Viola
 
Thank you, T
ony. Good afternoon everyone and welcome to our fourth 
quarter conference call. As Tony said, I'm Mike Viola, Head of Investor 
Relations for AT&T. Joining me on the call today is Randall Stephenson, 
AT&T's Chairman and CEO; and John Stephens, AT&T's Chief 
Financial 
Officer.
 
Randall is going to provide an overall business update and cover our 2018 
business initiatives and John is going to cover results along with the 2018 
outlook, and then will follow with our normal Q&A.
 
As always, our earnings materials ar
e available on the Investor Relations 
page of the AT&T website. It includes our news release, our 8
-
K, investor 
briefing, and a variety of associated schedules.
 
Before I begin, I need to call your attention to our Safe Harbor statement. It 
says that some o
f our comments today may be forward
-
looking. As such, 
they're going to be subject to risks, uncertainties, and results may differ 
materially. And additional information is available on the Investor Relations 
website.
 
And so now, I'd like to turn the call o
ver to AT&T's Chairman and CEO, 
Randall Stephenson.
 
Randall Stephenson
 
Okay, thanks, Mike. What we'll do is start on page four of the deck. And I 
just want to take a moment and reflect on 2017 because by any measure, 
2017 was a remarkable year. It's remark
able for our country, for our 
industry where we operate, and for AT&T. And it's been a long time since 
we've seen so many, what I would call, major public policy achievements 
compressed into a single year like we saw last year. And we're calling these 
achi
evements because the combined impact from these is going to be 
growth. It's going to be growth in U. S. investment and jobs and in wages. 
And all of this began early in 2017, as regulations across all industries were 
being rationalized.
 
In our industry spe
cifically, the FCC returned us to a light touch regulation of 
the Internet. And this was the purchase that up until 2015, it allowed in the 
Internet to flourish in the U.S. tech sector to leave the world innovation. So, 
we obviously believe this is a step 
in the right direction, but this regulatory 
pendulum is going to keep swinging back
-
and
-
forth unless Congress steps 
forward and writes new laws to govern all Internet companies and to protect 
the consumer.
 
We believe that we need clarity. We need a long
-
te
rm predictability on the 
rules of the Internet and on customer privacy. So, we're calling for an 
Internet Bill of Rights and you can expect us to take a leadership role on this 
as the discussion progresses.
 
Unquestionably, the biggest development that came
 
out of Washington last 
year was around tax reform. Our public policymakers pulled the greatest 
lever they had available to them to stimulate capital investment, job 
creation, and wage growth. That lever was given U.S. companies a 
competitive tax system, o
ne that levels playing field with the rest of the 
world.
 
We're in very early in the process, but you've seen it. Company after 
company is already announcing increased investment, hiring, wage 
increases, and employee bonuses, and we were first out of the ga
te. We 
announced bonuses for more than 200,000 front
-
line employees and a 
voluntary medical plan contribution for a total of $1 billion. And we also 
increased our 2018 capital expenditures by another $1 billion.
 
So, while public policy stole a lot of the s
potlight, we did make a lot of 
progress on several strategic initiatives last year. The most important is 
FirstNet, winning that FirstNet bid. And this was going to prove to be the 
foundation for taking wireless network performance to a completely new 
leve
l.
 
What we're doing is building a nationwide network with the latest 
technology. It's designed and it's hardened for America's first responders 
and then that will be our foundation for broad 5G deployment.
 
We're well underway with the build, including new 
sites in unserved or 
underserved rural parts of the country. We plan to deploy 40 megahertz of 
fallow spectrum that we've accumulated over the last for years along with 
the spectrum from FirstNet. And we'll also be deploying the millimeter wave 
spectrum fr
om our FiberTower purchase and this is going to give us a 
quantum leap in both capacity and performance.
 
We move to Mexico, I'm really pleased with how the team is executing. 
They're doing so well. We added 3 million customers in 2017. We also made 
great p
rogress leading the industry in terms of software
-
defined networking, 
55% of our network is now virtualized. And as a result, you're seeing our 
networking and our IT cost structure falling significantly.
 
We also made progress moving our base of our high va
lue customers into 
multiproduct bundles, saving them money; driving down churn, and earning 
more of their overall spend. And you can see the fruits of the strategy in our 
strong wireless performance this quarter in DIRECTV NOW's terrific first year 
in the 
market. Our fiber build continue to go strong. We know reach more 
than 7 million customer locations and expect to double that in the next 18 
months. So, that's a look at 2017.
 
And what I want to do now is move forward to 2018 and talk about our 
priorities 
this year and that's on slide five. It's no surprise our top priority for 
2018 is closing our deal to acquire Time Warner. We were obviously 
surprised when the government decided to try and block the merger because 
it is a classic vertical merger between t
wo companies that don't even 
compete with one another.
 
With 50 years of legal precedent, it's the type of business combination that 
the government has consistently approved with appropriate conditions. Now, 
while we remain open to finding some reasonable s
olutions to address the 
government's concern, we do expect this case will ultimately be litigated in 
court. The trial date is set to begin March 19 and we remain very confident 
that we'll complete this merger.
 
We're also going to be laser
-
focused in 2018 o
n building the world's premier 
gigabit network. And again, FirstNet, combined with our fiber and our 5G 
deployment, is giving us a powerful platform to accelerate our move into a 
gigabit world. And I got to tell you, I love our position here. We expect to 
be 
the first U.S. company to launch mobile 5G service by the end of this year 
and our fixed 5G trials were also going very well.
 
We're learning a lot. We're gaining great insights into making this product a 
very strong commercial offering. And then, last w
eek, the FCC issued an 
order that cleared the way for us to move forward with our acquisition of 
FiberTower and the vast majority of its millimeter wave spectrum licenses. 
It's what required for 5G. So, we get from FiberTower an average of nearly 
360 megah
ertz of nationwide spectrum. And again, millimeter wave is 
critical for our 5G strategy and we'll be putting this spectrum to work later 
this year.
 
In video, we're going to launch our next
-
generation platform this spring. 
This platform will add cloud DVR c
apabilities, it will give us a third stream to 
DIRECTV NOW, and it will have a lot of further enhancements to the user 
interface. Now, I've been using this thing recently and I got to tell you, I 
think our customers are really going to like this. The exper
ience is very 
good.
 
And so then before year end, we plan to launch in the next
-
gen product in a 
home centric configuration with a very thin hardware client. And just think 
about it this way, it's a very small, inexpensive streaming device plugged 
into your
 
TV and then you connect it to any broadband service. There will be 
a voice controlled user interface with an integrated search feature and will 
allow you to search across any streaming video service that you subscribe 
to. So, it can be DIRECTV NOW, Netfli
x, Amazon, Hulu, or even YouTube. It 
also gives you a premium live video experience in your home with the 
flexibility and ease
-
of
-
use what you would expect out of an OTT service.
 
We're also ramping up our advertising and analytics business. This was 
being 
led by Brian Lesser, who joined us last quarter. I think he's one of the 
best minds in ad tech. We're really excited about this opportunity because 
advertisers have made it really clear to us that they're looking for a trusted 
option in premium video adver
tising, looking for an alternative to the current 
digital ad duopoly that can bring advertisers scale and deliver results that 
are transparent and brand safe.
 
Once Time Warner closes, we'll be well
-
positioned to be that alternative. We 
think the entire ind
ustry, advertisers, publishers, and consumers, are more 
than ready for this alternative. And with Time Warner, we believe we'll have 
the right data, the right content and the right talent to build an automated 
advertising platform that can transform premiu
m video and TV advertising.
 
2018, we're also going to be focused further on Mexico. Our business there 
is going to continue to scale. We continue to move towards profitability. We 
have great momentum in the market; nearly doubling our subscriber base in 
the last two plus years and our LTE build in Mexico is almost complete.
 
And then, finally, our industry
-
leading cost structure is proving to be a 
significant competitive advantage. We obsess over delivering the lowest cost 
per megabyte in the world and we 
still have a lot of room to grow. So, that's 
kind of a synopsis of what we'll be focused on in 2018.
 
What I'm going to do now is hand it off to John to give you a report on the 
fourth quarter and our outlook for 2018. So, John?
 
John Stephens
 
Thanks Randall
 
and thanks for joining us on the call. Let me begin with our 
financial summary, which is on slide seven. The positive impact of tax 
reform led to some significant changes in both our reported fourth quarter 
and annual results. This impacted our balance sh
eet and fourth quarter 
earnings. It also led to us making some important decisions that impacted 
our fourth quarter cash flows. We'll walk through these impacts as we 
discuss the results.
 
Revenues were essentially flat year
-
over
-
year as a strong quarter in
 
wireless 
equipment and in our international operations mostly offset declines in 
legacy, wireless and video services.
 
Adjusted consolidated operating margins in the quarter were down year
-
over
-
year due to healthy increases in wireless sales and expenses f
rom our 
Entertainment group, offsetting those solid growth in our international 
operations. And for the full year, operating margins were up 40 basis points.
 
In the fourth quarter, our adjusted EPS was $0.78, including a $0.13 
positive impact from tax refo
rm. Essentially, our ability to fully expense 
capital spending in the fourth quarter generated most of this benefit.
 
Remember, tax reform expensing provisions were effective retroactively to 
September 27th, 2017. We also made a number of other decisions wi
th 
regard to with tax reform in mind including the $200 million in bonus 
payments to our frontline employees, an $800 million funding of our 
employee and retiree medical trust, nearly $100 million funding of our AT&T 
charitable foundation, and a number of 
other steps.
 
Adjustments for the fourth quarter include these special items; a $20 billion 
gain from our preliminary estimate of net deferred tax liability reductions 
generated by the new tax law, asset write
-
offs in our [Indiscernible] plant as 
our consum
er fiber footprint continues to expand and we continue to serve 
new customers with those fiber capabilities, and additional storm and natural 
disaster impacts. And in the fourth quarter, those are primarily from Puerto 
Rico. Other adjustments include our a
nnual mark
-
to
-
market pension plan re
-
measurement and merger and integration costs amortizations and some 
other adjustments.
 
Free cash flow was up for the quarter and was $17.6 billion for the year, 
even with the $1 billion of benefit payments made in conne
ction with tax 
reform. CapEx for the full year also came in on target at just under $22 
billion.
 
Let's now take a look at our operations starting with mobility, where the 
team turned in outstanding customer growth. Those details are on slide 
eight. AT&T's 
domestic mobility operations, as you know, are divided 
between the Business Solutions and Customer Wireless segments. For 
comparison purposes, the company's providing supplemental information for 
its total U.S. Wireless operations and that's what I'll disc
uss today.
 
First off, we added 329,000 postpaid phone customers in the quarter, a 
significant increase on both the year
-
over
-
year and sequential basis. 
Postpaid smartphone net additions were even more at 400,000.
 
Altogether, we had more than 2.7 million ne
w subscribers with gains in 
postpaid, prepaid, and connected devices. And looking at the full year, we 
added more than 2 million of our most valuable branded smarts phone 
subscribers to our base. One big reason for the success is reduced churn. 
Postpaid ph
one churn continues to run at record levels, dropping to 0.89% 
in the quarter.
 
Revenues were up in the quarter, thanks to strong smartphone sales. These 
sales also had an impact on margins. We had a year
-
over
-
year increase of 
700,000 smartphone gross adds 
and upgrades in the quarter as our 
customers kept coming back and getting new phones. Our BOGO offer was 
also successful and helped drive this volume increase.
 
This growth impacted margins. But with record low postpaid phone churn, 
these customers will pro
vide financial benefits years into the future. With 
these and many other efforts, we expect service revenues to improve 
throughout the coming year and turn positive for the year.
 
We take a disciplined approach in building our customer base. We'll continue 
to be keenly focused on cost management, but also look for efficient 
opportunities to reinvest in our customers and continue growing.
 
Now, let's take a look at our Entertainment Group results. Total video 
customers, IP broadband connections, and bundles al
l grew. DIRECTV NOW 
had a tremendous customer growth in its first year of operation. The 
368,000 net adds in the fourth quarter gives us nearly 1.2 million customers 
in service, and we believe the best is yet to come.
 
As Randall mentioned, we're close to l
aunching our second
-
generation 
platform. We're excited about the improved customer experience the 
platform will bring and the newer opportunities that will come along with it. 
This will include the cloud
-
based DVR, an additional video stream to the two 
we 
offer today, and a more robust video
-
on
-
demand experience.
 
You're also seeing us turn the corner with our Broadband business. IP 
broadband gains continue to be robust even as the conversion of DSL 
customers to IP slows the consumer DSL customer base droppe
d below 1 
million.
 
We added nearly 600, 000 IP broadband customers during 2017. Broadband 
penetration rate in our fiber footprint, where we have marketed our fiber 
service more than 24 months, are nearing 50%. Last year alone, we doubled 
the number of IP b
roadband subscribers in our fiber footprint.
 
A big part of our subscriber success can be attributed to the integrated 
offers that we have. We continue to increase the number of bundled 
customers. The number of households, who take both video and wireless, 
increased by 160,000 in the quarter or about 700,000 more wireless 
customers who bundle with the video. That's significant because the churn 
rate of our DIRECTV customers who have our wireless service is nearly half 
that of standalone satellite subscribers
.
 
At the same time, we continue to work through the ongoing transition of the 
pay
-
TV industry. This transition pressures revenues and margins. We will 
manage this transition as we have managed other transitions over the year, 
but expect the pressure to con
tinue throughout 2018.
 
Now, let's look at Business Solutions results on slide nine. Wireless drove 
growth in our Business Solutions segment, but we also saw sequential 
improvement in our Wireline revenue trends. Wireless revenues were up 6% 
on the strength
 
of smartphone sales, while service revenues were essentially 
flat. Wireline revenues were down 3.5% year
-
over
-
year, an improvement 
over previous quarters and up nearly 1% sequentially.
 
We now have 1.8 million business customer locations connected with fib
er. 
That means more sales opportunities for the team. We also expect increased 
business activity following the passage of tax reform.
 
Margins felt the impact of increased smartphone sales, but Wireline margins 
were up significantly to 37. 8%, something lik
e 270 basis point increase, as 
we continue to drive hard on cost
-
management initiatives.
 
A big part of these cost savings come from our move to a virtualized 
network. More than 55% of our network functions were virtualized by the 
end of 2017 and there's st
ill more opportunity as we drive towards our goal 
of 75% of these functions virtualized by 2020.
 
Our International business also turned in another strong quarter. Those 
results are on the bottom of slide nine. We had growth across our 
operations. Revenues 
were up 16% as both DIRECTV, Latin America, and 
Mexico showed strong revenue and subscriber gains. EBITDA also was up 
significantly, thanks to strength in Latin America and improvement in 
Mexico.
 
Subscriber growth continues to be strong in Mexico. The 
1.3 million net adds 
in the quarter pushed our full year growth to more than 3 million and our 
total subscriber base to more than 15 million.
 
And our Latin American satellite operations added 139,000 customers, 
thanks to the strength in their prepaid produ
cts. The business continues to 
be profitable and generate positive free cash flow.
 
Our business units turned in a great fourth quarter, but we also have done 
an excellent job managing our balance sheet during the quarter. Those 
highlights are on slide 10. 
We take pride in the disciplined management of 
our balance sheet. We see it as a competitive advantage and value 
generator for our shareholders. It's the foundation our company is built on 
and gives us the strength and flexibility we need to invest and to 
grow. That 
foundation became even stronger in 2017, thanks to tax reforms and 
thoughtful measures we undertook.
 
First, we de
-
risked the existing debt portfolio by extending maturities, 
primarily beyond 10 years as we prepare to close the Time Warner deal. 
And 
we did it cost effectively without significantly increasing our interest rates. 
Our weighted average maturity is now 14.5 years at a weighted average 
interest rate of 4.4%. And we diversified our portfolio with about a quarter 
of the debt denominated i
n foreign currency. This gives us ample near
-
term 
liquidity to meet the demands on the business and provide solid, long
-
term 
returns to our shareholders.
 
Second, our terrific cash flow generation enabled us to invest in growth, 
improve leverage ratios, and
 
improve dividend coverage with a payout ratio 
of 68% in 2017. And with the passage of tax reform, we see a significant 
boost to our balance sheet, reducing $20 billion of liabilities and increasing 
shareholder equity by a like amount. This reform signific
antly improves our 
net debt to equity ratios as well as free cash flow and dividend coverage in 
future years.
 
We also are in excellent shape with our pension plan. Our pension plan 
assets returned over 14% for the year, and we are nearly fully funded with 
no significant cash contributions required for at least five years. This is the 
case even with a historically low discount rate.
 
If you apply the average five
-
year discount rate to our plan, it is essentially 
fully funded and at the average 10
-
year rate, i
t's actually overfunded. 
Coming from a strong position, we plan to increase our investment allocation 
to fixed income assets and lower our expected return on pension assets 
down to 7% from the current 7.75 assumption.
 
All these measures have a profound imp
act on our financial position and I 
would expect the rating agencies will take notice and begin updating their 
models. It certainly has changed our outlook on capital budgeting, improving 
the returns of a whole range of products.
 
As promised, we'll increas
e 2018 capital investments by $1 billion with tax 
reform. Even with that, we expect significant free cash flow growth in 2018 
and going forward with our dividend payout ratio improving into the high 
50% range this year. And we're committed to deleveraging 
after Time 
Warner closes with plans to return to historic levels by the end of 2020, if 
not before.
 
Our management team has worked hard to build and maintain a strong 
balance sheet. We also know the job is never done. But 2018 brings tax 
reform, FirstNet a
nd a new accounting standard that will affect our financial 
results.
 
Let's talk about 2018 on slide 11. First, let's look at immediate impacts of 
changes in the tax law. Tax reform provides immediate benefits and its 
allowing the additional $1 billion in i
ncremental investment in 2018, much of 
that targeted for fiber deployment.
 
The lower tax rate is also expected to increase operating cash flow by about 
$3 billion this year compared to pretax reform expectations. We're also 
confident that as other business
es increase investments, there will be a 
potential uplift in demand for our services. We can't predict exactly when, so 
we didn't assume a significant increase in GDP trends in our guidance, but 
we are optimistic that it'll come and we'll be watching this 
closely. We expect 
our 2018 effective tax rate will be in a 23% range. The full year's impact of 
tax reform is expected to be about $0.45 of EPS health.
 
FirstNet will have an impact on our 2018 financials. We plan to move quickly 
with the build
-
out and the
 
timing of FirstNet reimbursements could impact 
our 2018 free cash flow.
 
For example, we may have FirstNet
-
related expenditures this year that 
aren't reimbursed until 2019. We planned in net FirstNet reimbursements 
against the capital and operating expendi
tures to which they relate, so 
there'll be no revenue impact.
 
We estimate that 80% of the reimbursements will offset capital expenditures 
with 20% offsetting operating expenses. We expect to expense sustainability 
payments as paid, net of any recoveries fo
r FirstNet approved projects. We 
will see a $0.05 per share expense impacts from our sustainability payments 
and other operating expenses from our build
-
out in FirstNet operations.
 
Additionally, we will see a $0.05 a share expense impact from increased 
int
erest expense in 2018. This comes from placing our AWS and WCS 
spectrum in service and no longer capitalizing the carrying cost related to 
owning in that spectrum. And we'll see a $0.04 a share expense increased 
from the lower expected return on pension as
sets that we previously 
discussed. In 2018, we will see a $0.06 a share benefit from reduced 
depreciation expense that we generated by the copper abandonment that we 
recorded in the fourth quarter 2017.
 
And finally, the new revenue recognition accounting s
tandard will have a 
positive impact on our near
-
term financials. Several items will be impacted, 
but the biggest of these are deferral pearl of commission expenses, which 
will increase profits in 2018; re
-
characterization of some service to 
equipment reven
ues for equipment that was provided with multiyear service 
contracts. This was expected to have an impact on Service revenues, but not 
a material impact on total revenues or on profitability; and a netting of 
universal service and other regulatory fees aga
inst the related expense. This 
is expected to significantly reduce both revenues and expense, but have 
little impact on profits.
 
We still have work to do on revenue recognition, but our initial estimate is 
$0.10 to $0.15 per share of positive EPS impact in
 
2018. Our results will 
differ from others because of our extensive Next program as well as our 
adoption of deferred installment accounting contemporaneous with our 2015 
acquisition of DTV. Look for more detail disclosures in the near future.
 
The impacts o
f tax reform, FirstNet, copper plan abandonment, and rev rack 
are reflected in our 2018 outlook, and the details on our outlook are on slide 
12. On a standalone basis, excluding Time Warner, we expect adjusted EPS 
in the $3.50 range as I said, inclusive of
 
the items previously discussed.
 
We also expect organic growth in the low single
-
digits, driven by continued 
profitability improvement in Mexico, Wireless service revenues growing in 
the second half of the year, cost structure benefits from virtualization 
and 
automation, and those offset by continued transformation of our video, 
business, and legacy services.
 
Free cash flow growth will be strong. We're expecting about $21 billion of 
free cash flow for the full year, which approximates our expected adjusted 
net income. And we expect capital spending to approach $25 billion or about 
$23 billion net of expected FirstNet reimbursements. That includes the $1 
billion of incremental tax reform investment. That's it in a nutshell. We 
ended the year with an exclamati
on point, thanks to customer growth, tax 
reform and FirstNet. And we're very excited about the year ahead.
 
With that, Mike, I will turn it back to you for Q&A.
 
Michael Viola
 
Thanks, John. Tony, we are ready for the questions.
 
Question
-
and
-
Answer Session
 
Op
erator
 
Thank you. [Operator Instructions]
 
We'll take our first question from Phil Cusick with JPMorgan. Please go 
ahead.
 
Philip Cusick
 
John that was a big nutshell.
 
John Stephens
 
Thank you.
 
Philip Cusick
 
So, if I can one for John and one for 
Randall. First, John, have you talked to 
the rating agencies about what the appropriate long
-
term leverage target 
looks like given the lower tax rate?
 
And then, Randall, sort of following up on things that John said, and I know 
it's early, but what have yo
u seen from customers in terms of investing in 
their telecom services post tax reform, probably more conversation so far 
than orders. But how can that impact AT&T trends going forward? Thanks.
 
Randall Stephenson
 
So, Phil thanks for that. And one clarificat
ion, Mike is here with me, I want 
to make sure I said this right. We expect to get to more traditional historic 
levels by 2022 or earlier. And I apologize if I said 2020. The correct number 
is 2022, which is consistent with the advice we've been giving eve
ry time we 
talk about the deal.
 
Philip Cusick
 
Makes a little more sense.
 
Randall Stephenson
 
Phil, we have been in discussions with the rating agencies, but we don't 
--
 
we haven't come to any conclusions. We are still in a give and take in that 
process and 
we'll continue that. I will 
--
 
so, I expect that this will impact 
their models. I also understand that they are also waiting for us to close the 
Time Warner deal and to update their models with the new Time Warner 
information. So, no answer yet, working on
 
it, and we look forward to kind 
of continue those conversations with the rating agencies.
 
Philip Cusick
 
Thanks.
 
John Stephens
 
Yes, Phil, on the capital spending and investment that you said specifically in 
telecom. We track with this gross fixed investmen
t. If you look at business, 
gross fixed investment anywhere in the world, our services tend to track 
with that.
 
Fourth quarter was like a number we hadn't seen in quite some time, gross 
fixed investment; I think it was over 6%. It was a very, very strong n
umber. 
Around here, how do high
-
fives when we see those kind of numbers, 
because that's usually an indication of general spending, because when 
businesses spend more capital, they generally hire more people. When they 
hire more people, they spend more capi
tal. And so, specifically, you'll see 
businesses adding people, and those people have to have computers, they 
have to have machinery, they have to have broadband connections, they 
have to have mobile services, they have to have data connectivity. And so 
th
at is a metric we watch closely.
 
The anecdotal evidence, and it's purely anecdotal other than the gross fixed 
investment, is strong. People are talking about investing more. You've seen 
announcement after announcement, company saying they're intending to 
i
nvest more capital as a result of tax reform and so that is our expectation. I 
think history is a very good indicator of this and when you talk about when 
you see Apple talking about investing in more facilities and manufacturing in 
the United States, for 
a company like AT&T and anybody in our sector, that's 
a good thing.
 
So, we have pretty good expectations at the B2B side of our house, our 
enterprise business side could catch some tailwinds. We don't have that 
build in the guidance we've given you because
 
it's just too early right now. 
But I'm very optimistic that we're going to overachieve most economic 
assessments of 2018. You're finally starting to some economists get out 
there and very bravely just talk about 2.7% growth; I think that is very low. 
And 
if we don't have a three hand on economic growth this year, I'll be 
sorely disappointed and surprised.
 
Philip Cusick
 
Correct. Thanks Randall.
 
Randall Stephenson
 
Thank you.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question will come from Amir Rozwadowski with 
Barclays.
 
Please go ahead.
 
Amir Rozwadowski
 
Thank you very much and good afternoon Randall, John, and Mike.
 
Randall Stephenson
 
Hi Amir.
 
John Stephens
 
Hey Amir.
 
Michael Viola
 
Hey Amir.
 
Amir Rozwadowski
 
I wanted to touch base a bit on the video industry at this 
point. How do you 
think about the status of the linear video market? It does seem as though 
one of your competitors seems to be taking a more selective or focused 
approach in terms of their subscribers. How should we think about your go
-
to
-
market strategy 
for that business going forward?
 
And then, John, you had mentioned there are some ongoing pressures 
through this transition. How do you think about the margin profile of that 
business going forward? Clearly, you folks are investing in some of these 
next ge
neration products. Given that those are still subscale, but growing 
but in investment mode for now, how should we think about the progression 
of returns of that business going forward?
 
Randall Stephenson
 
Okay, Amir, I'll go first. I'll talk a bit about the
 
video industry and how we 
think about it. But since the day we bought DIRECTV, we assume that 
traditional linear video would be in a declining mode since kind of the nature 
of it, OTT and the ability to consume video on mobile devices, we believe 
would be
 
the trend and the way where things went, we wanted to be in the 
leadership position and facilitating that kind of consumption of premium 
video on mobile devices. And we have been in the leadership position in 
that.
 
We have made an objective to ensure that
 
we can transition. We run these 
transitions all the time, right? When you have technology transitions or 
business model transitions whether it's fixed phone service to mobile, 
whether it's a private line kind of service for business to VPN, whether it's 
-
-
 
you can kind of go down the list of whether it's feature phones to 
smartphones, we run these transitions and we think we're pretty good at it.
 
As it relates to video, we are standing up a video product that we are 
convinced will give us growth in the vid
eo platform for the next few years, 
and that's our DIRECTV NOW. So, as traditional linear declines, DIRECTV 
NOW, we think can offset that and not only that, but our traditional linear 
video will be repurposed.
 
You heard me talk about our next
-
gen platform 
that is home centric, a very 
thin client into the home. That will actually drive cost structure of the 
traditional video product down so that you could preserve margins in the 
traditional linear video as you grow in the over
-
the
-
top applications and 
video 
services. So, we're very bullish on video.
 
As we look at the numbers, our consumers are consuming more value than 
they used to, not less. They're consuming it on different devices. They're not 
just consuming it in their home. They're consuming it on tablet
s and 
smartphones, and that's where we want to be. And so we're rather bullish on 
that, Amir.
 
John Stephens
 
Amir, with regard to legacy or the linear TV product, think about it this way. 
First of all, key strategy is the bundle. When we are bundling with w
ireless 
or when we're bundling with broadband, we're seeing significant 
improvement. We mentioned that we've got another 170,000 homes this 
quarter that we've got bundled with wireless and 700,000 wireless 
customers that were bundled with our satellite TV 
product. That bundling 
allows us to have profitability from that combined account. It also creates 
higher value, lifetime value for each of those customers.
 
When you see us bundling with fiber, what we are seeing is a churn ratio 
rate that's about half the
 
standalone satellite or video product churn. So, as 
we expand the fiber to 14 million over the next two years, you'll see us have 
tremendous opportunities to bundle with video. So, that is great.
 
In addition, we expect to pick up whatever video losses we 
have and more 
than that with DIRECTV NOW, and Randall spoke 
--
 
just spoke about the 
aspects of that, that opportunities to improve the revenues profitabilities and 
the reach to that.
 
And the last thing I'll tell you is with where to our satellite product. 
We're 
going to continue to serve what you might consider non
-
urban or non
-
suburban America, rural America. We're always going to have an ability to 
do that on a combined basis with our great wireless service and with our 
satellite TV process 
--
 
products su
ch that we can continue to provide those 
who lives outside the city limits, so to speak, great quality, great choice. 
That's how we're thinking about the business. But as we've shown over the 
last two and a half years, that's all based on a relentless obse
ssion with cost 
management and continuing to improve the cost structure.
 
And while the advertising opportunities are there for DTV NOW, there clearly 
also there for our traditional linear TV product. So, those are all the things 
we're working on. Is it goi
ng to be easy? It'll be challenging. But as Randall 
said, we've been through this time the transition many times before, and we 
feel up to the task of working through it.
 
Amir Rozwadowski
 
Excellent. Thank you very much for the incremental color.
 
John Steph
ens
 
Sure.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question in queue will come from John Hodulik with 
UBS. Please go ahead.
 
BatyaLevi
 
Hi, this is Batya Levi for John. Two questions. One, just following up on the 
bundling strategy, can you talk about how 
bundling has started to improve 
sub
-
trends both on the video and voice phone side? And if we can expect 
that to continue into 2018?
 
And how will you balance that sub
-
growth with profitability? Do you expect 
wireless margins, which were kind of flattish thi
s year, can they start to 
improve? And the entertainment profitability has been coming down. Can we 
see a stop at that? Thanks.
 
Randall Stephenson
 
Yes, so Batya, it's good to hear from you. With regard to bundling on 
wireless churn, I can't give you a numb
er of basis points, a precision amount 
of basis points in there. What I can point to is if you look at specifically 
postpaid phone, which is where the majority are really value
-
focused 
bundling is done, we're getting record levels of the low churn. And we 
attribute at least part of that to the bundling aspect. So, what we're seeing 
is working. That's the first thing.
 
Secondly, we're also seeing what was a very high level, 700,000 increase 
year
-
over
-
year in smartphone gross adds and upgrades. It continue to 
significant level of BYOD devices. So, what we're seeing is with this bundling 
opportunity, customers are continuing to come back to us that have been 
with us for a while and your customers are coming to us. That's what 
resulted, not only the great subscri
ber gains for the quarter, but in some of 
that, if you will, impact on cost and margins.
 
But when you look at the total profitability, we're very pleased with that and 
when you look at the churn impacts of that for years to come, you can 
understand why we 
make that lifetime value investment. So, that's how 
we're seeing that.
 
With regard to the video products, we're seeing a similar 
--
 
once again I 
can't point directly as a measurement for basis points. But as I mentioned 
specifically with fiber, it's cut in
 
half on the bundling. But on Wireless, we're 
also seeing lowered churn. So, that's been, if you will, very helpful to the 
overall business.
 
But then when you put those multiple products together and it's not only the 
reduction service cost with the right 
to building and administration and so on 
and so forth, but it's also with that total customers and the ability to track all 
their services, we do see a long
-
term past
-
due greater value creation. That's 
how we're thinking about that bundling strategy, not o
n a day
-
to
-
day basis, 
but when you look at these, for example, going to turn on that longer term 
basis. Churn at these levels is implying 100
-
month and more lives for these 
smartphones, tremendous, tremendous opportunities. So, that's what we're 
looking to
wards.
 
Lastly, we're going to be able to continue to cut cost. And as we continue to 
cut cost through virtualization and automization [ph], we're going to be able 
to continue to maintain.
 
We have been on our path for the last four quarters of setting recor
ds in 
Wireless service margins and we chose this quarter to reinvest in our 
customer base. When you got churn at those sub
-
90 basis point levels, it 
seems like the right thing to do. And with tax reform and the other things 
that are going on in our busines
s, we feel very comfortable that it is the 
right thing to do.
 
John Stephens
 
So, what I'd add to that, Batya, that there's probably no more powerful 
driver of margins in our industry than low churn. So, you think about what 
drives low churn. There are two b
ig drivers. Customer SAT is the number 
one driver of lower churn. But the second is multiproduct bundles with our 
customers, the more relationships they have with this on different products, 
the more powerful the driver of churn is. And so that's why we re
lentless 
focus on both of these. But the multiproduct services are the second biggest 
driver of churn improvement that we have.
 
BatyaLevi
 
Okay. Thank you.
 
Randall Stephenson
 
Thank you, Batya. We look forward to you being on future calls also.
 
John Stephens
 
Did you fire John?
 
Operator
 
Thank you. And our next question will come from David Barden with Bank of 
America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.
 
David Barden
 
Hey guys. Thanks for taking the questions.
 
Randall Stephenson
 
Hi David.
 
David Barden
 
Appreciate it. 
I guess I'm that guy this quarter again. So, John, just doing 
the math on kind of that long series of EPS adjustments kind of taking out 
the hurts and putting back the helps, it kind of gets to kind of low single
-
digit EPS growth $2.98 to $3.03 from the $2
.92 of this year. And we're 
looking at
--
 
John Stephens
 
Let me answer to this. Low single
-
digits, if you want to pick 1%, 2% or 3%, 
I'll let you do that and $0.08 of those items that I talked about. When you 
add them altogether, those items are total 
about $0.08 of net pressure. 
That's depreciation, the other three were $0.14 a pressure, net $0.08 of 
pressure that we're observing. So, just to be straightforward with that.
 
David Barden
 
Okay, good. Thanks. But on a net basis, still seems to 
suggest like 
something is still moderating from 2017. I think we saw about $1 billion of 
EBITDA pressure in 2017. And I was wondering if you can kind of talk about 
into 2018 kind of how that EBITDA versus non
-
EBITDA below the line stuff is 
getting you to t
hat EPS number.
 
And then the second piece of it is just I mean last quarter, I asked us about 
the enterprise flattening out. You said that there was some green shoots 
emerging in the pricing environment. You've actually had a pretty stable 
enterprise Wirel
ine business for the whole year now. And with the essentially 
level three merger kind of consolidating the space, is stable the new outlook 
or are we kind of turning a corner here? Thanks.
 
John Stephens
 
Yes, let me with the enterprise business. We did not,
 
as I mentioned in our 
guidance that our basis for our guidance. We did assume a dramatic shift in 
the GDP. We certainly expect continued investment, as Randall mentioned. 
We expect that to turn into orders, we just didn't know when and so we 
haven't model
ed that in.
 
With regard to the most recent activity, we did there were some 
management actions, the team took we saw some improvement in our 
trends on our legacy revenues and some continued positive growth on our 
strategic services. If that continues and w
e can continue to pressure that 
through the year along with some tax reform initiated demand, there's an 
opportunity for us to do better than what we've modeled, better than what 
we've given in the guidance. So, we are hopeful and we're watching and 
we're 
going to be careful with that.
 
With regard to the items, David, with regard to 2018 and the operational 
side, improvements in Mexico, continued strong performance in Latin 
America, we'll continue to see some pressure from legacy revenues like 
wireline voic
e and then some early challenges with wireless service as we lap 
the first year of unlimited and then a movement towards voice service 
revenue improvement in growth. Those are the things that are going on in 
the business.
 
One thing I will point out. Rememb
er, about $0.05 of the pressure for next 
year is going to be an interest expense. That's a below the line item. That's 
from 
--
 
no longer capitalizing the interest expense regarding the spectrum 
we're going to put to service with the FirstNet. That was part
 
of that $0.08 
that I was talking about.
 
So, while we're not giving specific guidance on margins, or on EBITDA levels, 
I want to make sure I give you is much color as I should to your question.
 
David Barden
 
Thanks John. And just the kind of takeaway, is th
e EBITDA, kind of, 
trajectory still pretty much in the same ZIP Code or are we seeing that 
improve, and that's kind of helping that EPS story?
 
John Stephens
 
Yes, I'll just say it this way, you have to have good solid performance in the 
business to overcome
 
those pressures and to still come in that mid
-
single
-
digits 
--
 
or excuse me, come into low single
-
digits EPS growth. You have to 
have strong performance in the business. And the biggest item that is on 
that EBITDA 
--
 
two big items that we talked about. On
e, depreciation, which 
we've laid out and then two is the interest expense. Those go in large 
margin to offset each other.
 
David Barden
 
Great. All right. Thanks John.
 
Randall Stephenson
 
David, I'm probably on the optimistic side of business spending, as yo
u 
heard my answer to Phil's question. But as you just kind of look at fourth 
quarter up and down the business segment, it just 
--
 
wasn't just 
concentrated in one area, it was multinationals all the way down to small 
business. We're just showing signs of im
provement. And so I find myself 
getting somewhat optimistic. The business spending is really going to 
accelerate as we work through 2018.
 
David Barden
 
From your mouth, Randall. Thanks.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question will come from Simon Flannery wit
h Morgan 
Stanley. Please go ahead.
 
Simon Flannery
 
Great. Thanks. Good evening. Randall, you touched a little bit on 5G and you 
put out a couple of press releases this year. It was obviously in the news the 
last couple of days. Can you just talk about where
 
you are, what you've 
learned from the trial so far, and what should we be looking to you and 
AT&T for 2018 in 5G? What are the used cases that will get you most 
excited?
 
And then, John, just coming back to the ASC 606, the $0.10 to $0.15, I 
think Verizon 
had said that by 2020, that would sort of wind down to kind of 
a neutral impact. Is that the same math for you? Thanks.
 
John Stephens
 
Randall let me think the ASC 606 first. Yes, over a period of years, it will 
balance out as the contracts lap each other. 
So, yes, that's the kind of 
thought. And as I mentioned, the other item is with us and compares us to 
others, we didn't adopt deferred installment accounting that coming lease in 
the cable industry, we adopted and that with the DIRECTV merger. So, a lot 
of
 
the items along with our next accounting that we've already been using 
will, to some people, give an impression that our numbers are not as much 
as they otherwise might have expected. Randall?
 
Randall Stephenson
 
On 5G, Simon, the used case I get most exci
ted about is the opportunity to 
have nearly, a nationwide broadband footprint and it could be a fixed line 
replacement. The capacity is there, the performance is there, there's going 
to be full gigabit throughput. And so I get very energized on the opportu
nity 
over the next few years to actually build out a nationwide capability for 
broadband for both business as well as consumer.
 
And so those are the ones, by the way, that from the technology is probably 
the easiest to scale and so forth. But as you begin to think about mobile 
solutions, we will be deploying mobile solutions in 2018 and it's going to be 
in 12 markets, that's what w
e've been doing. Think of this as a puck. 
Because, really, the thing is going to cause 5G to go slow more than 
anything else, it's just availability of handsets.
 
We're getting the equipment manufacturing moving, we're getting the 
supply chains moving, we'r
e doing the sell
-
side acquisition, we're doing all 
the build type work, but getting the handsets at scale penetrated into the 
market will slow things down. So, that's why we're going to be pucks in the 
first part of our deployment in these 12 market, so it
 
is a mobile solution. 
But it's not going to be a handset. There's not going to be that many 
handsets available. We'll be pushing the vendors to make that happen 
faster. But we know how long these things take and how long it takes them 
to penetrate the mar
ket.
 
As you think about other applications, the easy ones of that we all talk about 
is autonomous cars. And in fact, I just don't think those used cases work 
without 5G technology. It's all about low latency. People say 5G and you're 
thinking about speed. 
And speed and throughput is important. But the most 
important element is latency and having low latency 5G is the first 
technological innovation that truly gets us to low latency.
 
And as we think about a distributing cloud environment, we think we're in a 
unique place to begin distributing the cloud capability into our infrastructure. 
Think of all the nodes, all the access points that we have in our network 
distributing cloud at that level, we can take latency to a lower level than we 
think, virtually anybo
dy else, but it will be a competition, it will be a race 
and we'll see who gets there first.
 
But the latency is exciting. The latency is also critical for as you think about 
super IoT, connected devices, and connecting everything. It's going to be 
importan
t for virtual reality and augmented reality applications. So, we're 
taking this, to your point, used case
-
by
-
used case and that is what's 
determining our deployment and our build plans, our used cases and it's 
centered around predominantly these areas that
 
I just articulated to you.
 
Simon Flannery
 
Great. Thanks a lot.
 
Randall Stephenson
 
Thank you, Simon.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question will come from Amy Yong with Macquarie. 
Please go ahead.
 
Amy Yong
 
Thanks. And following up on the Entertainment Group
, you exited 4Q with 
really solid video trends. Do you still think you can grow a video pie and 
maybe perhaps, outpace the traditional pay
-
TV environment?
 
And I think, previously you've updated us on the mix of DIRECTV NOW 
subscribers, can you give us the 
mix of cord cutters and where they are 
coming from, that will be helpful? Thank you.
 
Randall Stephenson
 
So, a couple of things. We would expect to continue grow video customers 
with our DIRECTV NOW outpacing our linear customer counts in the sense of 
net a
dditions. So, we do expect that.
 
Secondly, I would suggest to you that the mix hasn't changed much. We're 
still getting around 50% of them from cord nevers and around 50% of cord 
cutters or cord shavers.
 
Secondly, we are getting a disproportionate amount o
f those customers 
being multiple dwelling units, millennials, and others 
--
 
specifically those two 
groups and we're excited about that. So, as we move through the process 
we'll continue.
 
We still haven't seen a dramatic uptick in customers that are shiftin
g from 
our full value product to the DTV NOW, but we continue to watch that 
carefully and continue to come up with different ways to make sure we can 
prove that and track that. But in kind of total video customer base, we do 
believe we have the opportunity
 
to continue to grow just like we did in the 
fourth quarter.
 
John Stephens
 
Exactly our plan, Amy. We'll grow our TV customer base is the expectation. 
And as we continue to mature the DIRECTV NOW platform, we think we can 
actually do better. The new DIRECTV
 
NOW platform has a lot more 
functionality. So, once you get cloud
-
based DVRs and you can put a third 
stream, now all of a sudden, you're entering a new marketplace with those 
as well and getting new functionality, we think we get higher penetration. 
So, w
e're actually very bullish on DIRECTV NOW. We think convinced 
economics will continue to improve as we move over the next couple of 
years.
 
Amy Yong
 
Great. Thank you.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question that will come from Matthew Niknam with 
Deutsche Ban
k. Please go ahead.
 
Matthew Niknam
 
Hey guys thank you for taking the question. One on capital allocation, I just 
--
 
with the significant cash savings you're laying off from tax reform, are 
there any areas of the business you're looking to potentially accel
erate 
investment in beyond fiber? And on the fiber topic, does this change at all 
how you think about that 14 million fiber homes past target beyond mid
-
2019? Thanks.
 
Randall Stephenson
 
Yes, I get it. Look tax reform changes everything as it relates to 
capital 
allocation, Matthew and if I understand that as well as anybody. But when 
you're suddenly looking at your after
-
tax returns improving by 20% roughly, 
it just changes how you think about your investment thesis. It changes the 
profitability equation 
on fiber as well as 5G and how you think about rural 
and how you think about FirstNet. And so it gives us the ability to consider 
starting to push our fiber deployments faster and further.
 
And it's early. It's hard to say what it will mean as you own a med
ia and 
entertainment company. But how does it affect the decision
-
making as it 
relates to investment in premium content, as it relates to direct
-
to
-
consumer 
distribution and how fast you go in those regards.
 
So it's 
--
 
we've been planning for this for quit
e some time. But now that it's 
here and it's real, we're going through, we're digging in, and ask what are 
these projects that we want to be investing in and these initiatives we want 
to be investing in that could continue to drive growth over the next fiv
e or 
six years and let's take advantage of it.
 
John Stephens
 
Now, we are expecting more money on fiber to accelerate the process and 
achieve our goals and then we'll have the opportunity to look to expand.
 
Secondly, we are, if you will, excited about and I
 
think the team is working 
very, very hard to achieve the FirstNet goals and even exceeding the goals 
set out by the FirstNet authority. That's a really positive thing for us. And 
while we were interested in doing that for some time, tax reform and the 
cas
h generate, the cash savings aspect that provide us that opportunity 
--
 
flexibility to go after that even more. So, those are two areas where I think 
you'll really see us utilize the benefits of the new tax laws.
 
Matthew Niknam
 
Thanks Randall, thanks John.
 
Randall Stephenson
 
You bet.
 
Michael Viola
 
Hey Tony, this is Michael; we'll take one more question.
 
Operator
 
Thank you, sir. That will come from Scott Goldman with Jefferies. Please go 
ahead.
 
Scott Goldman
 
Hey guys, good afternoon. And thanks for fitting m
e in. Maybe Randall, if 
you can just talk a little bit about the wireless competitive environment. 
Obviously, still very competitive, but it seems like we've been operating in a 
pretty 
--
 
in a more rational environment of late, and that's driven some 
bette
r results in fourth quarter. Just wondering how you think about, overall, 
what you're embedding in your outlook in terms of the competition in 2018?
 
And maybe just a quick one follow
-
up with John on that same question. How 
do you think about the puts and t
akes on ARPU based on the expectations 
for competition in 2018? Thanks.
 
Randall Stephenson
 
My outlook for wireless competition is that it will continue to be intensely 
competitive and we don't see that changing. How people are competing has 
changed somewha
t and how we're competing is changing quite a bit. I'm not 
going to go into a lot of details because we made some moves in the fourth 
quarter and you're going to see those continue into the first, second, and 
third quarter. We think are going to be very ef
fective and has been very 
effective in the marketplace. But I'll call it smarter competitions, smarter 
way in approaching our customer base and in accessing new customers. We 
believe very strongly that combining video with our mobile product is a 
really im
portant element.
 
And you will see us continue to do that. But actually, probably take it to new 
and different levels because it's proving so powerful on churn. We're also 
getting to place we've learned enough that is becoming very powerful as it 
relates to
 
customer acquisition.
 
And so combining video with wireless is a really important driver and you've 
seen some of the industry begin to make moves to mimic that, which is 
usually an indication that you're having success and so you'll see more and 
more of th
at. But it'll remain competitive, but we feel really good about how 
we're set up, what we're doing in the marketplace and that we'll continue to 
even take that a step further as we move through 2018.
 
John Stephens
 
Scott, on the ARPU side, let me first make
 
sure we're clear with regard to 
rev rack and the adoption of it and it's an unusual accounting change and 
then it's a flash cut. So, couple of the changes include regulatory fees, USF 
[ph] which we can't a service revenue today. And then also, in the expe
nse 
line, they'll be netted. So, ARPU will come because we're pulling back out.
 
Secondly, there will be some of the service revenue that's called service 
revenue today we'll get allocated to equipment revenues in the future for 
that small number of situati
ons where we still subsidize equipment.
 
Once you take that into account, you will have comparable ARPU and I just 
want to make sure everybody knows that. With regard to the opportunities 
for ARPU, I think about it in a total profitability situation, not ju
st in an ARPU 
situation. So, we certainly are looking to do as strong as we can on ARPU 
and as many services.
 
But as Randall said at the beginning, we're relentless on this lowest cost per 
megabit provider. And as we get to that, we can be very successful 
with 
things like prepaid or other alternative levels of ARPU.
 
My only point is that though we bundle with regard to video and broadband 
wireless together and we get great ARPUs from those, there will be 
situations where we will look to accept lower ARPUs l
ike in prepaid.
 
And because of the very low cost structure, because of the billing, or general 
administrative cost, because of opportunities to maybe get that analytics 
value out of it, we'll be able to still be profitable, or we'll be able to expand 
the b
ase of customers and be able to make more total profit that way.
 
So, that's one of the reasons why we're not giving EBITDA margin guidance, 
is because we want to focus on this total cash, total profitability position. So, 
our ARPUs will continue to be measured relentlessly and we'll continue to 
analyze of them in the sa
me way. I want you to understand that we're really 
focused of that total service revenue growth, total revenue growth, total 
profitability as opposed to just any one aspect.
 
Scott Goldman
 
Understood. Thanks.
 
Randall Stephenson
 
Very good. Thank you, Scott. 
And listen, I want to thank everybody for 
joining us today. 2017 was a truly unique year for American business, U.S. 
business. And I think 2018 is going to prove to be a really good year for the 
realization of the implications of what was done in 2017. And
 
I think the 
consumer is going to be better off, I think wages are going to be higher as 
businesses invest more. And as a result, AT&T being a very U.S. centric 
company, we think we're going to have a good year ahead of us as well. So, 
again, thank you for
 
joining us and look forward to talking to you next time.

Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP
 
Thanks, Mike, and hello, everyone. Thank you for joining us today 
and thank 
you for your interest in AT&T.
 
We are very excited about the progress we've seen in our business the last 
three years. We set some ambitious goals to transform our business, every 
part of our business, to lay a new foundation for the future and f
or growth. 
The first quarter was another significant step in that transformation. To put 
it simply, we are executing very well. We have completed or are near 
completion with all of our Project VIP network initiatives. We are also ahead 
of plans with many o
f the transformational customer and operational 
initiatives that we now have underway.
 
The results are impressive. You know the story. Our 4G LTE network now 
covers 308 million people with ultrafast speeds. We also deployed new 
spectrum, densified the netw
ork, and added DAS [Distributed Antenna 
Systems] and Wi
-
Fi capabilities to improve the quality and reach of our best
-
in
-
class network.
 
Our expanded wireline IP broadband footprint reaches 57 million customer 
locations, and we now are offering 75
-
megabit sp
eeds in 90 cities. We've 
also deployed fiber to nearly 800,000 additional business locations, with our 
1 million goal in sight, enabling strategic services growth and network
-
on
-
demand possibilities.
 
While transforming these networks, we've also invested h
eavily to transition 
our customer base. Many of those transitions are nearing completion as well. 
Several years ago, we started to move our postpaid base to smartphones 
and usage
-
based pricing. Today, 84% of our postpaid phone base use 
smartphones, and alm
ost 90% are on usage
-
based plans. And just one year 
ago, we accelerated the shift to the no
-
device subsidy model for 
smartphones when we launched Mobile Share value plans.
 
Customer response to these plans has been tremendous. About 60% of our 
postpaid smar
tphone subscribers already are on no
-
device subsidy plans. 
The surge of customers coming to value plans provides for some expected 
tough comparisons when looking at year
-
over
-
year financial results, but our 
record
-
breaking churn demonstrates that we made t
he right move in 
introducing these plans.
 
We also moved to strengthen our position in new growth areas. In prepaid, 
we acquired Cricket and paired it with our LTE network to provide a premium 
prepaid experience. We also saw the future of the Internet of Th
ings and 
developed platforms such as the connected car and home automation. We 
now have more than 20 million connected devices on our network, and the 
future is very bright for additional growth.
 
In wireline, the transformation to IP broadband is nearing c
ompletion. That 
means most of the costs associated with this transformation are also behind 
us. Today, nearly 80% of our broadband base is on IP, and about 90% of 
the customers with access to IP broadband already have it. And more than 
30% of our business 
wireline revenues come from our strategic IP services.
 
And finally, we have been laser focused on improving our operations, driving 
efficiencies across the board. We're seeing good traction with several Project 
Agile cost savings initiatives, including Dig
ital First, which is our company
-
wide effort to make it easy for customers to do business online. The number 
of digital transactions with our customers has increased by the tens of 
millions the last two years, and we expect to see that increase by millions
 
more in this coming year.
 
We also have been reducing cycle times in provisioning new services. This 
improves our competitiveness, our revenue opportunities, and the customer 
experience, while reducing expenses as well. And we took a giant step with 
our le
ading software
-
defined network initiative when we launched Network 
on Demand capabilities for business customers in 100 cities.
 
We continue to take steps to make our capital structure more efficient, 
including monetization of assets, reducing borrowing cos
ts, and 
implementing working capital improvements. This has contributed to our 
strong balance sheet and gives us the financial strength we need to continue 
to invest and diversify our business.
 
The moves to diversify our business also continue on track in 
the first 
quarter. Those details are on slide four. We've executed Project VIP in our 
transformation well, doing the hard work necessary to enable the company 
to move forward. This puts us in a great position to achieve the vision we 
laid out for you last 
quarter, vision of a new AT&T, a diversified, integrated 
wireless and wireline company for both business and consumers, uniquely 
positioned in a world of high
-
speed mobile connectivity and video.
 
We expect the DIRECTV transaction will close this quarter. W
e have done a 
lot of work identifying opportunities for additional cost synergies between 
these two great companies. This includes savings from supply chain, 
installation, customer care, and even sending just one bill. This has 
increased our confidence tha
t we can significantly exceed the original $1.6 
billion expected in cost synergies. In fact, we now believe cost synergies 
alone will exceed a $2.5 billion run rate by year three.
 
In wireless, we closed on Iusacell, the first of our Mexico wireless 
acquisi
tions, and we expect to close the Nextel Mexico deal shortly. 
Together, these properties will give us a leading spectrum position in a 
dynamic wireless market that is just beginning its transformation to the 
mobile Internet. We plan to deploy a near
-
nation
wide 4G LTE network, 
something we know how to do very well. It will be covering about 100 
million people in a country that borders the United States. The cross
-
border 
opportunities that this opens up are exciting from both a consumer and a 
business standpo
int.
 
We have also significantly improved our spectrum position here in the United 
States. Our Leap acquisition brought with it an average of 10 MHz of 
spectrum in the top 100 markets, covering 137 million people. Some of it 
was unused spectrum. We've alrea
dy put much of that unused spectrum to 
work in more than 200 markets, and we've begun shutting down the legacy 
CDMA networks. We expect that process to be complete by the end of the 
year, and we will quickly redeploy that spectrum as well.
 
We also made a m
ajor investment earlier this year when we acquired 
licenses for near
-
nationwide contiguous 10x10 MHz block of high
-
quality 
AWS
-
3 spectrum. Needless to say, we feel good about our spectrum 
position. This takes a lot of uncertainty out of the process with ou
r ability to 
add capacity and maintain quality in a cost efficient manner. We know what 
we have and we know what we need to do, and we have a clear path to 
delivering a network that customers want, that customers expect, and that 
customers will use.
 
With t
hat as background, let's take a look at our consolidated financial 
summary on slide five. Adjusted consolidated revenues grew to more than 
$32.6 billion. That's up about $375 million when you adjust for the sale of 
our Connecticut wireline properties. This
 
growth was driven by continued 
success in wireless as we reposition our business model, strong demand for 
strategic business services, and adjusted wireline consumer revenue growth. 
Adjusted wireline revenues were down about 1%, but revenues were 
essentia
lly flat year over year if you adjust for the impact of foreign 
exchange and discontinued businesses.
 
Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.63. That includes adjustments for Leap 
integration expenses as well as costs associated with the voluntary 
employee re
tirement plan. It also excludes a one
-
time $0.05 benefit from a 
tax planning related matter. And while we don't show this on an adjusted 
basis, first quarter 2014 earnings also include the income we received from 
our previous equity ownership of América Mó
vil as well as net income from 
our domestic Connecticut wireline operations. Those two provided about 
$0.03 of EPS in the first quarter of last year that we don't have this year.
 
Our business also continues to generate solid cash flows, with free cash flow
 
of $2.8 billion. Cash from operations totaled $6.7 billion, and that includes 
an additional $500 million investment in our Next customer base. And capital 
expenditures were $4 billion. At the end of the quarter, our cash balance 
was $4.4 billion. And in t
erms of uses of cash, dividend payouts totaled $2.4 
billion.
 
At the same time, we maintained a solid balance sheet while continuing to 
invest in the business. During the quarter, we funded investments in AWS 
spectrum and Iusacell. And we are also well 
positioned for our planned 
investments in DIRECTV and Nextel Mexico.
 
Net debt to adjusted EBITDA at the end of the quarter was 2.19 times. And 
as we've said before, with our transformational investments in DIRECTV, 
Mexico, and spectrum, we will go above ou
r normal net debt to EBITDA 
target. But after we close the DIRECTV transaction, our focus with free cash 
flow after dividends will be on paying down debt and getting back to our 
target range.
 
Now let's turn to our operational highlights, starting with wire
less on slide 
six. Our wireless results this quarter only include our domestic operations. 
Information on our Iusacell operations is included under the international 
segment in our financial statements and is separately broken out.
 
The repositioning of our
 
smartphone base by giving customers the choice of 
lower
-
priced service with no device subsidy plans continues to show positive 
results. Postpaid churn was 1.02%, the best first quarter that we have ever 
had and the best in the industry this quarter. This 
continues the positive 
trend we saw last year and comes in a very noisy and competitive 
marketplace. And prepaid churn also showed strong continued signs of 
improvement thanks to the strength of our Cricket operations.
 
Total net adds came in strong at 1.2 
million. That was led by gains in 
postpaid and connected devices. We added more than 440,000 postpaid 
subscribers in what is traditionally a slow net add quarter, thanks to strength 
in tablets. These tablet gains more than offset a decline of feature phone
 
subscribers. We also grew our high
-
quality postpaid smartphone base by 
another 500,000 in the quarter. This includes postpaid upgrades and 
migrations, which we don't include in our net add number. And when you 
look at total branded smartphones, which incl
udes both postpaid and 
prepaid, we added about 1.2 million smartphones to our base during the 
quarter.
 
We also added about 1 million connected devices, thanks to a continued 
strong showing by connected cars. Connected device net adds were 
impacted by a cha
nge in how we report our session
-
based tablets. 
Previously, we included them as part of our prepaid base. Now they're 
reported as connected devices subscribers. This gives us and you a better 
view of phone growth in prepaid, which now essentially includes 
only phone 
activity. You see that this quarter.
 
Thanks to strong results from our Cricket offering, we had positive growth in 
prepaid. Cricket is just the latest example of our ability to integrate new 
businesses. The team has done a very good job of trans
forming this 
business. Retention is ahead of schedule. Churn is less than expected and 
certainly much less than historical levels prior to our ownership. And we're 
doing a great job of moving customers off the legacy CDMA network. More 
than 90% of Cricket 
customers already are on the GSM platform. However, 
we do expect to see some pressure over the next quarters as we complete 
the transition to GSM and shut down the legacy CDMA networks.
 
Overall, postpaid gross adds and upgrades continue at a solid pace. We
 
had 
about 6.2 million smartphone sales in the quarter, slightly higher than last 
year's total. Our postpaid upgrade rate was 6.6%. Smartphones were 94% 
of all phone sales, and now make up about 84% of our postpaid phone base. 
We still have about 16% of ou
r phone base to transition to smartphones, but 
the bulk of the smartphone transformation has been completed. 
Transforming our phone base to LTE smartphones and moving those 
customers to no
-
subsidy and usage
-
based pricing has been a big investment 
for us. B
ut once again, we made these investments, executed our plan, and 
are now in a strong position to move forward.
 
Now let's look at the progress we're making with shifting our customers to 
AT&T Next and Mobile Share. That information and revenue are on slide 
seven. AT&T Next sales reached record levels, nearly two
-
thirds of 
smartphone sales. Another 5% brought their own devices to our network. 
That means 70% of phone sales in the quarter didn't carry a subsidy. Total 
wireless revenue was up about 2%, driven by
 
36% growth in equipment 
revenue. The customers who choose to bring their own devices don't 
increase equipment expense for us, so the no
-
device subsidy model works 
for our customers and us, whether it's with Next or with bring your own 
device.
 
As expected,
 
service revenues this quarter were impacted by Mobile Share 
value plans. But because we have now passed the anniversary of the 
introduction of these plans, we expect the year
-
over
-
year comparisons will 
improve in the coming quarters. At the end of the fir
st quarter, more than 
70% of our postpaid base is on Mobile Share plans, with more than 60% of 
the postpaid smartphone base on no
-
device subsidy pricing. This means our 
first quarter Next flow share percentage has exceeded the percentage of 
smartphone subs
 
on no
-
device subsidy pricing. Mobile Share customers 
continue to buy up to larger buckets of data. About half of all accounts are 
on plans 10
-
gigabytes or larger and about 20% are on plans of 15
-
gigs or 
more. That's more than twice as many as a year ago. 
This helped drive a 
14% increase in data billings.
 
As expected, the strong Next take rate helped drive the third consecutive 
quarter of sequential phone ARPU growth when you factor in Next billings. 
The metric gives you a more accurate idea of what an aver
age customer 
pays us each month. Phone
-
only ARPU with Next was more than $66 in the 
quarter, with the average monthly Next billings about $6 and growing. That 
strong sequential increase comes even when you factor in the impact of our 
new Data Rollover plan
, which generated about $0.25 of ARPU pressure in 
the quarter. As the Next base grows, so does the impact on billings. More 
than 30% of our smartphone base is now on AT&T Next, but 65% of our 
sales are on Next, so our ARPU with Next is expected to continue
 
to grow.
 
Now let's move to our wireline operations on slide eight. Our focus on 
profitability and transforming to IP technologies can be seen in our wireline 
results. On the business side, Strategic Business Services are now close to a 
third of the busine
ss wireline revenues, and we continue to see strong 
demand for those services. Adjusted Strategic Business Services revenues 
grew by more than 15% in the quarter. And when you adjust for FX, growth 
was more than 17%. Adjusted wireline business revenues wer
e down 3.3%. 
However, about half of that decline comes from the impact of FX and our 
discontinued low
-
margin businesses, such as Global Hubbing. If you consider 
those items, the decline would have been 1.7%.
 
And if you look at our combined business wirelin
e and wireless operations, 
revenue actually increased year over year. While overall wireline business 
operations saw pressure, it was most pronounced in wholesale, in part due 
to our focus on profitable sales and the continued impacts of network 
grooming. 
Enterprise revenue was down less than 1% when you adjust for 
Connecticut and FX. Small business revenues were also down. However, 
there are some positive signs with new business starts and growing sales 
from our fiber build.
 
We also took a significant step
 
recently in our transition to software
-
defined 
networks. We introduced Network on Demand for business customers in 
more than 100 cities. This allows businesses to easily order, add, or change 
network services on their own in real time.
 
In consumer, U
-
vers
e services now make up about 70% of consumer 
revenues and helped drive adjusted consumer revenue growth of more than 
2%. U
-
verse started the year with solid subscriber gains, increasing 
penetration, and strong revenue growth, including adding more than 
400
,000 IP broadband subscribers. That helped drive a net gain of almost 
70,000 new subscribers to our overall broadband base.
 
We are nearing the completion of our broadband conversion to IP. About 
80% of our broadband base is now on IP. That's 90% of our IP
-
eligible 
customers. So we expect the number of migrations to ease throughout the 
year as well as the costs associated with those conversions.
 
At the same time, we continue to increase broadband speeds. We expanded 
our 75
-
megabit services to nearly 90 citie
s, and we offer GigaPower in 10 
markets, including a just announced deployment in Chicago. We also hit a 
milestone with our Voice
-
over
-
IP services in the quarter. We now have more 
than 5 million VoIP subscribers. All this helped drive an increase in adjust
ed 
U
-
verse consumer revenues of almost 20%.
 
Now let's move to margins, starting with wireless margins on slide nine. 
Wireless service margins were essentially stable year over year. There was 
pressure from customers on no
-
device subsidy pricing in advance 
of 
upgrades and from the full quarter of inclusion of Cricket operations. And our 
new Data Rollover plan also had about a 20 basis point impact on margins. 
This was offset by the impact of AT&T Next and cost saving initiatives in the 
quarter.
 
Wireline marg
ins continue to stabilize, and operating margins were flat year 
over year. There was pressure from non
-
cash benefit expenses and TV 
content costs, but this was offset by growth in consumer and Strategic 
Business Service revenues and solid execution on our 
cost initiatives.
 
For the quarter, our adjusted consolidated operating margin was 18.5% 
compared to 19.6% in the year
-
ago quarter and 18.9% two years ago, but 
most of the year
-
over
-
year difference is due to our strategic investments in 
Mexico and Cricket.
 
Cost efficiencies continue to be a priority with us. We discussed the success 
of our Digital First initiative earlier. We also have made headway in cutting 
cycle times to provision new business services. We're seeing up to a 40% 
reduction in cycle times on
 
some IP products, with more than a 50% 
reduction in the fiber
-
ready buildings. Our software
-
defined network 
initiatives will help even more.
 
Before we open up the call for your questions, let me do a quick recap of the 
quarter on slide 10. The first quart
er was another big step in the 
transformation and diversification of our company. Customers are moving to 
Mobile Share value plans and AT&T Next in increasing numbers. This helped 
drive industry
-
leading postpaid churn and more than 1.2 million wireless net
 
adds.
 
The success of the migration to IP technologies can clearly be seen in our 
wireline revenue numbers. IP services now make up 70% of our consumer 
revenues, and our migration to IP broadband is near complete. In business, 
Strategic Business Services, 
which include our IP services, is close to a third 
of the wireline business revenues. Strong demand has revenue growing at 
more than 15%.
 
At the same time, the moves we are making to diversify our business 
through video and international operations are on 
track. We are confident 
the DIRECTV and Nextel Mexico deals will close this quarter, and we are 
taking steps to get all plans in place to close these transactions quickly.
 
Our solid balance sheet and cash flows provide the financial strength to 
invest and 
to make these transformative moves. We feel very confident with 
our standalone guidance for the year. We're on track and on plan. In fact, 
we're actually ahead of plan in many of the areas, including free cash flow. 
That gives us even greater confidence th
at we can hit our growth targets for 
the year while also being prepared for the DIRECTV and Nextel Mexico 
acquisitions.
 
We are on the starting blocks for a very exciting year for AT&T. We have 
made the investments and done the hard work necessary to positi
on us to 
be a very different company, and we are ready for the opportunity ahead of 
us.
 
With that, Tony, let's go ahead and take some questions.
 
Question

and

Answer Session
 
Operator
 
Thank you very much. Our first question will come from Simon 
Flannery with 
Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
 
Simon Flannery

Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
 
Okay, thanks very much. John, thanks for the update on DIRECTV. Can you 
just go into the merger synergy guidance a little bit more? Just what are the 
main buckets ther
e? And help us think about how it phases year one, year 
two, year three. And then you sound confident on the closing this quarter. 
Given all of the headlines we have out there, just can you just give us some 
more sense of what makes you so confident? Thank
s.
 
John J. Stephens 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP
 
Thank you, Simon. Real quickly, Simon, the base of most of our savings that 
we previously announced was going to content contracts as we understood 
them to be standard in the industry. And
 
that was the basis for a large part 
of our $1.6 billion original target; that along with some of the normal 
synergies associated with bringing two public companies together.
 
The additional ones are the opportunities we now see in going to, for 
example, on
e single truck roll to install products, so combining the 
installation of both our broadband capabilities and our video capabilities into 
one truck roll; or getting the customers on one single bill, one single 
customer care operation; the ability to go to 
our supply chain to get better 
pricing with regard to our equipment because specifically one of us was 
buying set
-
top boxes and other equipment at lower numbers than the other 
one was. And so when you combine those, we're confident we can get some 
more sup
ply chain savings.
 
There's also the standard cost of things like combined advertising, combined 
customer care, combined activities. But that's what we built up to this $2.5 
billion. They are cost savings. But we believe that they are very much real, 
very a
chievable, and we believe that they'll grow. Certainly in that third year 
is when they get to that $2.5 billion level, but they are significant during the 
2017 third
-
year timeframe. They will build starting in 2015 but build really in 
2016 and really move 
toward significant amounts in 2017.
 
With regard to our confidence in the transaction closing, it really comes 
down to what the transaction is about, and that is bringing customers 
greater choice, bringing more competition to the marketplace, bringing 
expan
ded opportunities for customers to get bundled services, services that 
they want, and really to improve the broadband capacity that's out there for 
customers through our additional investments of some of these savings. So 
as we continue to go through the p
rocess, we continue to feel good about 
where we're at, and we are optimistic and continue to believe we'll close it 
this quarter.

Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
 
Great, thank you.
 
John J. Stephens

Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP
 
T
hank you.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. The next question in queue will come from Phil Cusick with 
JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
 
Philip A. Cusick

JPMorgan Securities LLC
 
Hi, John. Thanks. A quick follow up on Simon's question. Have you had any 
indication from the DOJ
 
or FCC either way in terms of approval?
 
And then second, if you can talk about the Mexican business, the same 
thing. What barriers remain to closing Nextel? And how do you think about 
integrating those businesses from here and the need to ramp up CapEx to
 
do that? Thanks.
 
John J. Stephens 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP
 
Yeah. So as would be normal in a transaction like the merger of DTV and 
AT&T, our legal representatives are having the normal process and contacts 
with parties within the ru
les in the normal course. I won't go into those 
details. But I will tell you, Phil, if you look at what's on the record out there 
and the benefits this brings, I think there's an easy path to see why this deal 
would get approved and the benefits it will br
ing to consumers. So I'll leave 
it at that. We continue to feel good about it.
 
With regard to Mexico, the process for Nextel first had to go through the 
U.S. bankruptcy process and the opportunity for other bidders to come in. 
That process has all been com
pleted. The U.S. bankruptcy court has 
approved the sale. So we're now just left with getting the regulatory 
authorities in Mexico, IFETEL, to approve it. We're in, as you might expect, 
normal contact, and that would be normal in a deal, respectful contact 
and 
working through issues with them. Our experience with them on Iusacell, 
our experience with them on the regulatory framework that they've set up, 
and the economic environment they set up gives us confidence that that 
deal could close shortly.
 
Philip A.
 
Cusick

JPMorgan Securities LLC
 
And in terms of integrating those two mobile businesses once you have 
them?
 
John J. Stephens 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP
 
Yeah. So we will operate as one business. We will get significant benefits 
from t
he two networks. And so we will be able to utilize the infrastructure of 
both companies to really help us manage and really prioritize capital 
investments, so it really will allow us on a combined basis to ramp up the 
networks much more quickly. As we ment
ioned in my prepared remarks, 
when you combine the two companies, they clearly have a leading spectrum 
position in Mexico, which also gives us an opportunity to very efficiently 
ramp up.
 
Your comment or question, Phil, with regard to will we need to spend 
capital 
on that asset, absolutely. We intend to get the network quality up to our 
standards. And as quickly as prudently possible, we're working through 
those plans. And once we get the Nextel Mexico merger completed, we'll 
have all the information at our 
disposal to finalize those plans, and then we'll 
come back to the Street at the same time we do with the DIRECTV merger 
and update you on those plans. But it will take some additional capital. But 
quite frankly, in the company the size that we will become 
once the 
DIRECTV and Nextel Mexico deal are closed, it will be a very manageable 
level of additional capital.

Hey, Mik
e.
 
Michael L. McCormack

Just a couple things. I guess first on the wireless side, I think your comment 
the way we would read it is that phone
-
only ARPU and service revenue from 
a year
-
over
-
year growth perspective, have we bottomed out and h
it the 
tipping point there? And then secondly on wireless, what's the experience 
that you're having with customers that are on the Mobile Share value when 
they go to upgrade? Are you seeing any unusual churn activities around 
those guys?
 
John J. Stephens 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP
 
Mike, quite frankly, we're not seeing any unusual churn activities, really. I 
don't mean to be inappropriate, but the 1.02% postpaid churn is the best 
we've ever had. And if you go beyond, if you subdivide our
 
postpaid base 
into postpaid smartphones, as you can imagine, the trend is even lower. So 
we feel very good about that.
 
With your comments with regard to service revenues, when you look at our 
service revenues this quarter, clearly it was impacted by, so t
o speak, a full 
year of opportunity for customers to transition to Mobile Share, and really 
not only about a month, no time prior to the first quarter of 2014 and only 
about a month of 2014 first quarter for customers to transition. So this is 
going to be 
the starkest comparison or the most significant comparison time. 
We expect those comparisons to get easier or to be less challenging as we 
go through the year because we've established much more of a stable Mobile 
Share value base as of the end of the firs
t quarter compared to where we 
were at the end of the first quarter last year.

John, if I can just sneak one in, just thinking about cash flow, any thoughts 
on plans for factoring in 2015, a magnitude question? And CapE
x run rate a 
little lower than we anticipated, is that just ahead of the deals closing?
 
John J. Stephens 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP
 
CapEx is just what we needed. It is lower than the run rate. We're not 
changing any guidance on CapEx. 
It's just more of a philosophy to spend it 
as you need it, don't spend it early.
 
With regard to factoring, you can expect us to factor every quarter this year. 
Part of that process is to get an established track record on that. We did do 
it in the quarter.
 
Even with the factoring we did in the first quarter, we 
added to 

 
as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we added to our total 
investment in our Next customer base by about $500 million. But I think we 
expect to continue to use that securitization proce
ss in an effort to 
eventually get to a point where we'll have another option for financing our 
business, whether we choose to use it or not.

John C. Hodulik

UBS Securities LLC
 
Okay, thanks. Hey, John, just a couple questions. First actually, can you give 
us a number of how 
much factoring was done in the quarter? And then a 
couple follow
-
ups to previous questions, the 70% of adds coming on no 
subsidized plans is a big number. Is that the top that we can expect, or can 
you push that still higher?
 
And then lastly, switching gea
rs over to wireline, margins were off, EBITDA 
margins were off a little bit on a year
-
over
-
year basis. Can you give us a 
sense for maybe what's driving that and how that should trend on a year
-
over
-
year basis? Should we continue to see declines, or with so
me of the 
costs coming out of the Connecticut properties, do you expect that to be 
bottoming around here? Thanks.
 
John J. Stephens

Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP
 
So, John, let me try to make sure I hit all these, and challenge me. If I 
skip 
one, let me know.
 
John C. Hodulik

UBS Securities LLC
 
Sure.
 
John J. Stephens

Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP
 
First, I think we mentioned that we had about 65% take rate on Next on 
about 6.2 million net adds and upgrade sales, so aroun
d 4 million Next 
sales. You guys can do the math on an average price of a phone to get the 
gross receivable. We mentioned that we increased our receivables, net 
increase in our investment in our customers by about $500 million. The 
offset to the rest of th
e purchase price was about $1.5 billion of factoring, 
and then some collections from customers from previously sold Next phones 
in early 2014 or even a few that we sold and 2013 that are now paying us 
monthly fees that we are collecting and keeping at the 
company. So we're 
not subject to prior monetizations or securitizations.
 
On the net adds, at 70%, I think the key assumption there is we've seen this 
60% 

 
65% Next take rate before and we've seen it again this quarter. The 
one thing I will tell you is tha
t to get it to 70%, we had about 5% or about 
300,000, a little over 300,000 BYOD devices. Those are great net adds for 
us. While they don't bring any equipment revenue, they don't bring any 
equipment expense. And so that's a good deal for us. They often jo
in Mobile 
Share value plans, so they are sticky customers.
 
That is the unknown, if you will. That 300,000 is a little bit below what it was 
running on a quarterly basis the last three quarters of last year. But this is 
typically a slower 

 
first quarter is
 
typically a slower quarter. We're still 
encouraged by the level that 

 
that will be the determinant of where we 
come out, whether we come out in that 60% to 65% range or if we get 
higher than that. We'll just have to wait and see. But I do feel very good 
about the fact that in total that no
-
device subsidy is at 70%. And quite 
frankly, the overall base on Mobile Share value for smartphones is at 62%, 
so we're running hotter than that.
 
And then third, the amount of those customers that are actually paying us
 
monthly for Next today is down in the 32% range. So I'm very optimistic 
that the monthly Next ARPU piece, the monthly billings piece, is going to 
pick up from that $6 level.
 
John C. Hodulik 
-
 
UBS Securities LLC
 
Right.
 
John J. Stephens 
-
 
Chief Financial Of
ficer & Senior Executive VP
 
EBITDA margins, we're going to continue to focus, particularly in wireline, on 
cost savings. I think you're aware that we did an early 

 
voluntary early 
retirement program. I think our take rates on that were in the 3,300 range,
 
so we'll see some savings from that going forward.
 
Additionally, we did see some pressure in the first quarter as we converted 
some of our former backhaul or interconnection in Connecticut from 
company
-
owned to leased arrangements. So they moved out of de
preciation 
in some of those characteristics into COE. And we'll manage through that 
and manage the efficiencies of our operations. We'll overcome that during 
the year. So those are the things we're working on to improve those 
margins. And as I said, we're 
still confident with our guidance, and that 
guidance included improving margins in wireline, wireless, and overall.

Thank you. Our next question in queue will come from Brett Feldman 
with 
Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
 
Brett J. Feldman

Goldman Sachs & Co.
 
Thanks. Just to follow up a bit on churn, if I listen to some of things you 
were saying, you've got a growing share of your base on Mobile Share value 
plans. And there's obviously 
a lot more value in those plans, so they're more 
attractive. You have a growing percentage of your base on smartphones, 
which you said have a lower churn profile. And you keep selling tablets, 
meaning your average customer probably has multiple devices, an
d usually 
that means lower churn. So is it reasonable to think you could actually 
continue to improve churn from here? I know the second quarter of last year 
is a tough comp, so putting that aside. Or are there mitigating factors, 
including the competitive
 
environment, that might just create a little bit of a 
floor on where you can go right now?
 
John J. Stephens 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP
 
I'll say this. We're very pleased with where we came in on churn in the first 
quarter, particularly
 
with the noisy and competitive environment that we 
operate in. But we are not getting into the fact that we can't do better from 
here on out. We're not predicting that. We're not guiding to that, but we're 
certainly striving to do that. You are right, Bre
tt, that the second quarter of 
last year is going to be really tough comparison. But with that being said, we 
still are striving to do better each and every quarter than we did the last 
quarter, and we'll keep that effort up.
 
When you think about Mobile Sh
are value accounts, there are just under 
about 20 million of those accounts, and they average just under three 
devices per account. I think we can get you the detailed numbers, but it's 
probably about 19.5 million accounts, and there are about 2.9 devices 
per 
account. And yes, that really does help with churn.
 
Additionally, our smartphone churn is lower than our total postpaid. 
Effectively, our feature phone churn is higher. And as we've reduced that 
base down to 16% now of our postpaid base and we're seein
g flow share of 
only about 6%, we're optimistic that we can increase the smartphone base. 
And that will give us another lever to really make an attempt to manage 
churn to a lower level. With all that being said, it is a competitive 
environment, and we have
 
to be ready to handle whatever situation issues, 
offers come out from other parties in this environment, regardless of the 
logic that may or may not be behind them.
 
Brett J. Feldman 
-
 
Goldman Sachs & Co.
 
Great, and just as a quick follow
-
up, since you men
tioned the feature phone 
base, as you come towards the tail end of migrating them to smartphones, 
how do you think about that residual base? Is there a proactive effort to get 
all of them into smartphones, or is there just an acknowledgment that some 
of th
ose customers will probably eventually just come to end
-
of
-
life and 
you're going to let them go?
 
John J. Stephens 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP
 
We don't want to necessarily lose any customers, Brett, we want to keep, 
and we've got a lot o
f really good ones that are still on feature phones. But 
the issue is the functionality of our networks is so dramatically different 
when you're using a smartphone, and the value our customers can get out 
of our networks is so significant, is so much great
er with a smartphone. So 
we're certainly encouraging that.
 
What I will tell you that's encouraging to us, though, is that we're finding 
that we're having real success in the prepaid space, in the traditional no
-
subsidy or low
-
subsidy model prepaid space an
d still getting really good 
ARPUs and still using a lot of maybe lower cost but a lot of smartphones 
there. We had a significant number of smartphones added to our prepaid 
base. So I would tell you that a feature phone that may not want to go to 
the full p
ostpaid smartphone relationship might stay with us in a prepaid 
relationship and still get the benefits of some very good network and quality 
and phones, and yet do it in a different pricing in different subsidy 
mechanism.

Thank you. Our next question will come from Frank Louthan with Raymond 
James. Please go ahead.
 
Frank G. Louthan 
-
 
Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
 
Great, thank you. Can you give us a little more color on what you said about 
seeing some increased signs of some improvement in SMB and passed 
homes with fiber, some additional businesses with the fiber build? How many 
addi
tional businesses have you built? And what are some of the signs that 
you're seeing a little bit of a turn in that part of the business?
 
John J. Stephens 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP
 
So, Frank, we've built 

 
800,000 customer locations ha
ve been passed with 
fiber. What we did is we built a significant amount of those to customer 
order, where customers, existing customers, new customers order that and 
want us to build. But we also built a measurable amount to, if you will, into 
areas where 
we were confident we could sell and be effective. In those areas 
that we've built and spread the copper before we had a contract in place, we 
are now aggressively selling into those areas, and we have been pleased 
about the ability to penetrate those build
ings and to sell into those. So that's 
the encouragement.
 
In many of those buildings, you've seen how it works. You can go into a 
building. It might have 20 potential customers in there, and you have to sell 
to the first one. And once you get the first one
 
sold, you can come back and 
then have some credibility with selling to the second, the third one. So we 
are making some significant progress in getting those first sales inside the 
building. And the team is working hard under Ralph de la Vega's leadership
 
to then go back and really maximize all the opportunities in those buildings. 
People love the fiber and the high
-
speed that it provides, the quality of that 
service. So this investment ahead of an order is starting to show signs of 
paying off. That's what
's encouraging.
 
Additionally, we're continuing to see interest from our normal business, 
small business customers, and some of our packaged deals with regard to a 
combination of our bundled mobility and wired IP services. I don't want to 
suggest that we ar
e seeing the small business market take off, but we are, 
and our numbers will explain the reason for me saying that. But we are 
seeing continued strong demand for IP and strategic based services, those 
Ethernet
-
based services, those IP
-
based services.
 
Fran
k G. Louthan

Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
 
And what should we expect going forward on a quarterly or annual basis for 
these types of businesses that pass? How many more do you have?
 
John J. Stephens 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP
 
We'r
e going to get to 1 million business customer locations passed. If you 
think about the run rate we've been on, it's pretty easy to think that we can 
get to that 1 million by the end of the year. That would be a very reasonable 
process. We've publicly state
d that we can get there by the end of the year 
or shortly thereafter. So that is what I think you can expect.
 
With regard to predicting growth rates or trends in the small business area, 
we haven't done that. But I will tell you on the overall Strategic Bu
siness 
Services, I am encouraged that we're at the 32% level of revenues. I'm very 
encouraged that it's reached $2.6 billion. I'm very encouraged that even in 
this tough environment it grew 15% on an adjusted basis. And when you 
take into account FX pressu
res, it would have grown 17%. I think the team 
is doing very well, and the network we built is attracting customers for its 
quality, its security, and its speed.

Hi, Amir.
 
Amir Rozwadowski 
-
 
Barclays Capital, Inc.
 
I just wanted to follow up on the questions around the competitive 
landscape. How do you think about the level of promotional 
activity for the 
course of this year versus last year? And specifically, how should we think 
about your strategy going forward? Last year, obviously, you made a 
concerted effort to adjust pricing in order to migrate more of your 
subscribers onto Next. Do y
ou foresee needing to have to do that again? It 
doesn't seem like, based on the comments that you made on ARPU 
trajectory, but I just wanted to confirm.
 
And then I'd also be interested to hear your thoughts on the Google 
announcement today and whether you 
view it as a possible new competitor 
over the mid to longer term, even though it seems fairly limited in scope 
based on what they announced today.
 
John J. Stephens 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP
 
Okay. I think with your first question, Amir
, I think you'll continue to see us 
taking actions on the strategy that we have laid out already; that we are 
going to continue to focus on profitable customers and providing smartphone 
growth, Mobile Share value, getting customers on Next or BYOD, and 
con
tinuing to migrate. Now we've got 90% migrated to usage
-
based plans, 
and use the LTE deployment of phones and the, so to speak, year
-
over
-
year 
growth, data growth we've seen of those phones of about 50% to then drive 
data growth and then drive higher bucke
ts. So that's the strategy there.
 
Sure, I'm certain we will have some promotional activity, as we always do, 
but I wouldn't suggest to you that it would be out of the ordinary, out of the 
normal process. I will also suggest here that we are just in the beg
inning 
phases of the connected car, of the Internet of Things, and of the 
opportunities that that's going to provide us. This really deep, high
-
quality, 
308 million people that are covered with LTE or have LTE available to them 
is really a great thing for 
all the Internet of Things product and services, 
whether they be the connected cars or the other platforms we have out 
there. And we believe that over terms, we'll see really great growth there. I 
think we added close to 700,000 connected cars in the quart
er. So it still has 
a long way to go, but it's growing very quickly. And remember, what we're 
seeing today is really just mostly the wholesale arrangement, and here as 
we mature through this process, we'll get that opportunity to get the retail 
arrangement
.
 
With regard to Google, I would suggest to you I'm not an expert on the 
matter, so I don't mean to be, but I understand your commentary about it's 
very limited. So I understand it's limited. It's got a very limited number of 
devices. That's not generally 
the way we like to present options to 
customers. We like to provide a lot. My understanding it's limited in this 
case. My understanding also is that there's going to be very limited 
distribution and customer care. And those things are items that we found 
o
ur customers value. So we'll just have to wait and see, but it's just another 
one of the plays in the environment that's out there.

Bank of America Merrill Lynch
 
Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the questions, may
be two if I could. Just the 
first one, Verizon is getting a lot of attention on the OTT strategy, both 
skinny bundles and the wireless side. But depending on how things shake 
out, AT&T could be the nation's largest video player. Could you give us a 
sense a
s to the timing and what we should be expecting coming from AT&T 
on this front? Are you working on this pro forma knowing that DTV deal is 
behind you, or do you have to wait for the DTV deal? I think people would 
love to know where you guys stand on that.
 
And then just second, I think, John, you've thrown out a deleveraging target 
at some of the conferences of about 1.8 times within a three
-
year timeframe 
post the deal. Could you divide 

 
waterfall how you get there from a 
combination of operations and asse
t sales? And then rumor has it you're 
running the real estate group at AT&T now. Could you map out where the 
buckets for asset sales inside of AT&T are and scope it for us? It would be 
helpful. Thanks.
 
John J. Stephens 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Ex
ecutive VP
 
So let me get to a couple things. One, I won't give any detailed plans about 
post
-
DTV AT&T. I don't think it would be prudent at this time. But what I will 
tell you is that over
-
the
-
top distribution of video on wireless, on broadband 
connections
 
with or without linear subscription is something that I'm sure 
we'll see and something that we will see be a part of packages in the future. 
My own experience is that I see it as an add
-
on to a subscription package. 
And I think we believe that that will b
e the way a lot of the opportunities will 
go, but we're certainly open to it, and we're going to certainly be in a 
position to help and develop that part of the process. I won't go into the 
Verizon situation or any specific offers on our part.
 
With regard 
to deleveraging, I will go this way. We're expecting free cash 
flow to exceed dividends and provide cash not only this year but into the 
future to pay down debt. That's one. Two, we're expecting EBITDA to 
expand, not only just from the acquisition of DTV b
ut from the content 
savings 

 
excuse me, from the cost savings that we've talked about even 
today. And that will expand EBITDA even more, which will by simple math 
help the metrics of net debt to EBITDA. Third, we'll continue to look at all 
aspects of our 
asset portfolio. As I've mentioned before, we have a about a 
$300 billion total asset portfolio today that will only get larger with DTV and 
Nextel Mexico. And so we will continue to look for opportunities.
 
I would suggest to you that if you look at our re
cord over the last three 
years, we have a pretty reliable record of generating over $15 billion worth 
of cash from asset monetizations, and we've done it very tax efficiently, so 
we've netted a significant amount of that cash to be able to use. And we'll 
j
ust continue to do the same process that we've done. I wouldn't expect 
anyone to think that we are complete in that process, but I'm not going to 
get into listing any specific items.

Please go ahead.
 
Michael I. Rollins

Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)
 
Hi, good a
fternoon. Thanks for taking my questions, two if I could. Just one, 
could you disclose what the postpaid revenues were in the quarter? I think 
it's something that you've given out in the past. I didn't see it in this 
quarter's release.
 
And then secondly, i
f we just take a step back on the wireline business, you 
talked about the investment you made, a lot of broadband for homes with 
the VIP project. How should we be thinking about the impact that should 
have on broadband units over time, being able to grow t
hat residential 
broadband business? Does it take a certain amount of time before you get 
some benefit from the sales, or is there something else that we should be 
looking out for in terms of impact there? Thanks.
 
John J. Stephens 
-
 
Chief Financial 
Officer & Senior Executive VP
 
Mike, I'll let Mike and the team follow up with you on the details of the 
postpaid revenue details, and refer to what we put on the website. Whatever 
we give you, we'll make sure it's out there on the AT&T website. I don't hav
e 
those numbers right in front of me.
 
With regard to the wireline business, the VIP project, and specifically I think, 
Mike, you're probably referring to the 57 million IP broadband locations, I'd 
suggest to you this. What we really need to see is the DIRE
CTV deal to close 
because the transaction, the key to being successful in that area is that 
customers want a bundle. And so with the closing of that transaction, we'll 
be able to have a bundle not only of the video services that DTV provides, 
but of the br
oadband services that we can provide.
 
As I mentioned before, about 30 million of those 57 million broadband 
locations, a little bit under that number, don't currently have a video 
product. Once we can do a real bundle with owner's economics and provide 
the
 
efficiencies of one truck roll, the efficiencies of one service call, the 
efficiency of one troubleshooting call for the customers, one offer, one 
pricing structure, we believe that that will not only be good for our company, 
but it will be very good for 
customers that they'll have a new competitive 
offer out in the marketplace.
 
And so we think that the completion of our DIRECTV
-
AT&T merger is a key 
factor in that process and a key factor in bringing great quality services to 
customers. And from our survey
s and from the information I've seen, it's 
what customers want. So that will be the focus point. I would suggest to you 
that we'll probably have more to say on that and give some insights to that 
when we have our Investor Day, which will likely be within a
bout a month 
after the closing of DTV.

Great, I have two, if I may. The first one, I was wonderi
ng if you can give us 
an update on your fixed wireless strategy. I know that was part of VIP a 
while ago, but I was wondering if it's changed at all with what you received 
in the AWS
-
3 auction.
 
And then the second question is, it's my understanding that fo
r the AWS
-
3 
debt that you raised to pay for those proceeds that you're capitalizing that 
interest. I was wondering if you could just talk about how much debt is 
actually being associated with the AWS
-
3 auction. Thanks.
 
John J. Stephens 
-
 
Chief Financial Of
ficer & Senior Executive VP
 
So first of all, your second question on AWS, yes, we are capitalizing that, 
and the amount of the debt that is being associated with that is a ratable 
share of our overall debt portfolio. The overall interest cost has come down
 
significantly over the last three years as we've refinanced debt. But it is an 
allocated share based on the $18 billion, approximately $18 billion purchase 
price. So that is what is getting capitalized.
 
With regard to the fixed wireless local loop, Colby,
 
I wouldn't suggest to you 
that anything's changed at this time. We still have the commitments out 
there in the DTV transaction, and we still stand ready to live up to those and 
to satisfy those in full. We think that's a clear benefit for the consumer and
 
the marketplace as a part of that transaction. But we're still confident that 
we can satisfy that, and we'll see how that comes out. That's probably 

 
the 
finalization of the DTV deal is probably going to have to come before we're 
going to go through and 
I'd be ready to discuss any modifications, if any, to 
the fixed wireless local loop plans.

u for being on the call today. 
Our work the last few years sets us up for a transformative 2015. We are 
ready to move quickly once the DIRECTV and Nextel Mexico deals close. Our 
networks are in place, our customer transformation is on track, and we are

ing tangible results in our Digital First and software
-
defined network 
initiatives. Our performance in the first quarter adds to that confidence.
 
Wireless turned in another solid performance in a competitive environment. 
Wireline's focus on profitability a
nd strong demand for IP services brought 
margin stability and growing IP revenues. We are ready for our Next 
transformative steps and we are excited about the opportunity we have 
before us.
 
One last thing before we go, as a good friend of ours, Kathy, woul

Randall Stephenson
 
Thanks, Mike. Good morning. The headline of the second quarter and the 
first half of the ye


plans, which are right on track. Since we close the merger last June, net 
debt is down $18 billion. We expect to further redu
ce net debt about another 
$12 billion in the second half of the year, and that should get us to a 2.5 
times net debt to adjusted EBITDA range by year
-
end. And to the extent 

look at
 
allocating capital to share buybacks in the back half of the year.
 
Wireless is about half of our overall EBITDA and it continues to fire on all 
cylinders. Last quarter, we grew revenues, EBITDA, and phone subscribers 
both postpaid and prepaid. Wireless se
rvice revenues were up 2.4% in the 

with a world
-
class network.
 
Our wireless network has been named fastest, the best and the most reliable 
by independent testing services. FirstNet co
ntinues to be the driver of our 
network performance as well as our 5G leadership. And at the end of the 
quarter, we were about 60% complete with our FirstNet coverage, ahead of 
plan. And we are now targeting 70% completion by year
-
end.
 
And our FirstNet bui
ld is accelerating our 5G deployment, as we deployed 


the first half of 2020.
 
Turning to WarnerMedia, th
ere was another strong quarter, merger 
synergies remain on track and we had solid operating income growth across 
all three business units. This was a record year, 191 Primetime Emmy 
nominations for WarnerMedia and HBO alone scored 137 nominations. That 
was
 
the most in its history. So, what was the result of all of this?
 


up investment in content is working. 
And this will be critical as we launched 
HBO Max next spring. And as Mike mentioned, we look forward to share a 
more about HBO Max in October.
 

stabilize EBITDA, we actually grew it by
 
1.1% in the quarter. Later this 

service over broadband. We have some really high expectations for this 

more c
ities as we go to the year.
 
IP broadband revenue growth remain strong, we continue to see a solid 
growth in our AT&T Fiber product. That product now reaches about 14 
million customer locations or 22 million when you include businesses. So, all 
in all solid
, steady progress against the commitments we made coming into 

exceed each of those commitments for the full year. In fact, this morning, 

19 to the $28 billion range, 

year.
 


 
John Stephens
 
Thank
 
you, Randall, and good morning, everyone. Let me begin with our 


was $0.89 in the quarter, including $0.
02 impact from a higher effective tax 
rate. We continue to expect low
-
single
-
digit growth for the full year, as we 
are set up for a solid second half of the year performance.
 
We grew revenue both on a reported and pro forma basis in the quarter. In 
fact, a
ll segments are growing on a constant currency basis. Adjusted 
operating margin was up 90 basis points with the addition of WarnerMedia, 
strong growth in Mobility, and continued improvement in our Entertainment 
Group.
 
Our cash flows were very strong on the
 


cash flow was a record $8.8 billion. The addition of WarnerMedia operations 
made and impact, as did adding their receivables to our securi
tization 
efforts. The securitization lifted free cash flow by $2.6 billion. Our ability to 
generate cash continues to be impressive.
 

about $4 a share. With the benefit of our securit
ization efforts, we have 
confidence to raise our free cash flow guidance for the full year to the $28 
billion range. Our strong cash position also allows us to continue to invest at 
industry leading levels. CapEx was $5.5 billion and total capital investme
nt 
was $6.5 billion, when you include the $1 billion of payments for prior 
vendor financing activity. And we reduced net debt by $6.8 billion in the 
quarter.
 
Let me speak more to deleveraging on Slide 7. We paid
-
off $18 billion in 
debt since we closed the 
merger, and we ended the quarter with our 
adjusted net debt to EBITDA ratio at just under 2.7 times. This is down from 

to hit our year
-
end target of being in the 2.5 times range.
 
Y
ear
-
to
-

about $7 billion from free cash flow and nearly $4 billion in asset 
monetizations, offset by about $2 billion of vendor payments and other 
purchases of assets. And these sales have com
e from assets that contribute 
no EBITDA.
 

-
end leverage target. To the extent, we can overachieve with that target you 
can expect will take a hard look at allocating capital to sha
re buybacks in the 
back half of the year.
 

Communications segment on Slide 8. The story of our Communications 
segments this quarter is stable revenue [Technical Difficulty] EBITDA and 
margin 
growth, while adding phone subscribers.
 
Our Entertainment Group is delivering EBITDA growth. And Business 
Wireline revenue trends improved in the quarter, thanks to strength in 
strategic and managed services and about $125 million from IP licensing. 
But ev
en without those licensing proceeds, Business Wireline revenue trends 

Business Wireless performance, our Business Solutions revenue grew 2.3%.
 
On the cost side between, the team is 
doing great work in controlling 
content, promotions and other operating costs. Solid cost management was 
evident throughout the business, especially in our Entertainment and 
Business Wireline units.
 
Let me give you some more details starting with Mobility 
on Slide 9. Our 
Mobility business continues to perform very well. Service revenues grew by 
2.4%, EBITDA growth was even higher at 3.1% and EBITDA margins 
expanded by 80 basis points with service margins of 56.1%.
 
We had a strong quarter with 355,000 phone 
net adds, including 72,000 
postpaid and 283,000 prepaid. And we added 388,000 smartphones in the 
quarter further strengthening our customer base. Postpaid phone trend was 
up slightly to 0.86%, but was down sequentially.
 
And at the same time, our prepaid bu
siness, especially Cricket continues to 
perform at strong consistent levels. Prepaid revenues were up nearly 10%, 
we had our 18th consecutive quarter of phone growth, and churn hit an all
-
time low at both cricket and AT&T prepaid. With the network leadersh
ip and 

wireless business will get even stronger as we evolve to 5G. In short, our 
network investments particularly our spectrum deployment are paying off, 

.
 

long

term customer value continues to impact our Entertainment Group. 
EBITDA grew both year
-
over
-
year and sequentially. This was the second 
straight quarter of EBITDA growth. Ye
ar
-
to
-
date EBITDA was up about 4%.
 
Expense reduction outpaced revenue declines, setting the stage for EBITDA 
growth. Broadband revenue growth helped us as well as continued growth in 
video ARPUs. The number of premium TV customers on the two
-
year price 
loc
k declined by more than 600,000 in the quarter.
 
Video subscriber numbers were in line with what we said to expect for the 
quarter. Premium declined 778,000 and DIRECTV NOW declined 168,000. 

loting 
AT&T TV, our thin client broadband TV product, the best important milestone 
with our fiber deployment reaching $14 million customer locations, and 
satisfying our fiber build commitments. This will be an important driver of 
growth going forward. In f
act, we had more than 300,000 AT&T fiber net 
adds in the quarter, and IP broadband revenue grew by 6.5%.
 
We expect AT&T fiber penetration to grow as the service matures. Bottom

continued stability beyond 2019.
 

continues to be free cash flow accretive. Our expense management with 
merger

related sy
nergies are on track. We expect to hit a $700 million run 
rate by the end of this year. And HBO Max is slated to launch next spring. 
Overall, WarnerMedia had another strong quarter with 5.5% revenue growth 
and solid operating income growth. HBO revenues gr
ew, thanks to strong 
content sales, driven by home entertainment and international licensing.
 
Turner revenues were up about 2% on subscription revenue growth, and this 

championship thi
s year. It will be back on Turner next year. And at Warner 
Bros., theatrical revenues increased due to home entertainment games and 
a highly successful release of Mortal Kombat 11, which drove game 
revenues.

Question

and

Answer Session
 
Operator
 
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And looks like first, we have the line of 
John Hodulik of UBS. Your line is open.
 
John Hodulik
 
Great. Thank you. Maybe
 
some questions on the Entertainment segment. 

1 million subs left on the promotions. When did those promotions expire? 
And maybe if you could comment a little bit on the programmi
ng disputes 


 
is expectations for 
resolution there driving some of the belief and continued growth in EBITDA 
in that segment? And then, how do you expect that to impact the sub trends 
as we look into the sec
ond half of the year? Thanks.
 
Randall Stephenson
 


the subscriber numbers for you. As everybody pro
bably knows, CBS has 
pulled their signal off DIRECTV as has Nexstar. And there are two very 
different situations.
 


sent 

 
that 



here dark and not
 


 

product is broadcast, the four big broadcast stations
 
free
-
over
-
the
-
air 
content, I might point out, and their opening bid in the negotiations like a 
100% increase. And not only was it a 100% increase, but the assets that 

rather sig


 

that again are free over the air. And so that one may t


kind of price increases on our customers. And interestingly enough, unlike 
other times we have gone through these type of blackouts where companies 
have pull
ed their signal.
 
Our customers and world of streaming are finding other ways to access this 

flow right into the programming guide in our DIRECTV lineup and some 
customers are at a pre
tty significant rate finding other ways of getting to 


 
John Stephens
 

illion customers left, as I 
mentioned on these price locks, and those price locks expire in the fourth 

But in November, as they closed out, and we expect to have through the 
proce

the impacts of getting to this value based long
-
term customer value 


 
Additionally, we 
have 

 

performance of the business being really solid, certainly stable, but solid in 
my mind. You can see that; we believe that this value of customer long
-
term 
value customer approach is working. So, on the intake s

continue to file that, and that will also continue to lead us to some working 
through the rest of this year.
 


 
the beta, learn from it, 


adding a long
-
term value based customer and we have the potential to use 
AT&T T
V.
 
We have more optimistic expectations for 2020 that gives us the basis to 
believe that our margins will continue to be stable next year.
 
Randall Stephenson
 
And just most importantly, what John just went through is, as we come out 
of back end of 2019 
and the customer base is cleaned up. We will have a 
customer base that is going to be perfectly suited for HBO Max. And we 
really had a really strong second quarter with HBO. And I got to tell you 
what we saw on HBO in the second quarter, particularly on t
he digital 

this DIRECTV base, as we come out of 2019 is going to be ideally suited for 
driving HBO, HBO Max penetration as we launch that next year.
 
John Hodulik
 
Thanks a lot, gentl
emen.
 
Randall Stephenson
 

 
Operator
 

line is open.
 
Philip Cusick
 

 
given through the second 
quarter some thoughts about typical seasonality in video losses in 2Q versus 
1Q, and it came through around that 100,000. How do you think about 
typical video losses in 3Q versus 2Q? And should we expect a continued sort 
of subdue
d level of promotion in video until you get to the wider AT&T TV 
launch?
 
John Stephens
 
Yeah, Phil. I think, you should expect 

 
as you call it subdued or what we 
call at the long
-

You should expec
t that. We have some normal summer activity with video, I 

balancing of that with the same number of customers, the amount of 
customers getting off these two
-
year price locks.
 
Putting that 

losses to continue and are predicting what they are, but we need to get 
through this 1 million customers base and some of the other, if you will, less 
the value

conscious
-
focused promotions tha

need to get through those that will take us through the end of the year to do 
that.

term value of the customer.
 
Operator
 
And next up in queue, we have the line of Simon Flannery of Morgan 
Stanle
y. Your line is open.
 
Simon Flannery
 
Great. Thank you very much. Turning to the balance sheet on the buybacks, 

continued deleveraging once you get to the 2.5, where do you 

 
where 
wou
ld you like to end up on the balance sheet and how are you going to 
divide your free cash flow between the two?
 
And then if you could update us on the $6 billion to $8 billion of net asset 

o you see 
that trending at this point? Thanks.
 
John Stephens
 
So, Simon, I want to take the asset sales first. Feel really good about where 


 
and I bucket them 

 
I put them in two buckets. One is a 
straight asset sales, Hulu and Hudson Yards, 
and that was the $4 billion. But 

the WarnerMedia securitizations, a whole collection of that kind of activity. 

 
With regard to the asset sa


 


still have, we still own. We have a whole collection over a 1,000 cell towers 
in Mexico. We probably have 250 parcels of real es
tate with a couple of $100 
million in the contract. We have an equity investment in the company called 
CME and their independent board is reviewing their strategic alternatives.
 

g
ot a whole collection of things that gives us confidence in meeting that $6 
billion to $8 billion range, and hopefully doing very well with regard to that 
$6 billion to $8 billion target.
 

ing to 
cover the investment we made in millimeter wave this year in the 24 
auctions. So, the $6 billion to $8 billion target is going to include being to 
pay for that with the proceeds. We just got a lot of opportunities, we feel 

ave that with that.
 
With regard to the balance sheet, I think, if you can think about as we talked 
about after 

 
the fourth year after the close of the deal. We look to be 

 


great fl
exibility to pay down debt and take advantage of what now is a 
higher cash cost of equity capital than the cash cost of our debt capital. So, 
when you look at out of very methodical basis, right now, the cash flows of 
the overall operation on an after divi
dend basis can be enhanced by shifting 
some of your focus from debt repayment to buyback.
 


our focus 

 
prima

well on track, we feel good. I think you can tell that just by the fact that we 

So, these are historically low interest r
ate environment, and operating at 
these levels has been something we can very reasonably do, periodically we 
do and feel very comfortable about.
 
Randall Stephenson
 
Thanks. Simon.
 
Operator
 
And next up in queue, we have the line of David Barden with Bank 
of 
America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.
 
David Barden
 
Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. I guess, the first one would be 

and I think that you guys have been trying to 
kind of just maintain it, but is 
there something structural or competitively that has evolved it, might be 

 
this might be the first data point in the trend? Or is it more of an anomaly?
 
And then the second question, John Stephens, would be on the cash flo
w 
guide. Could you kind of parse down the increase in the free cash flow 
guidance? Is it related to lower CapEx, as you shift CapEx to vendor 
financing? Or is it related to the working capital benefits from the 
WarnerMedia asset sale or other things kind o
f that are going to come 

 
John Stephens
 
So, they could 

 
let me take that free cash flow one first. And quite frankly, 

. We did $2.6 billion 
securitization that we told you about. And quite frankly some would suggest 
that raising the guidance to $28 billion could have been raised even higher 

to i
nvest in the network, our FirstNet team, our network team is [putting for 

But if they need more capital, I want to have the flexibility to do that and 


 
what
 
our guidance is.
 
If we can get software releases out quicker with regard to 5G, and put those 
in place, I want to retain the flexibility to do that. So quite frankly, the raise 

abou
t it. And yet retains flexibility for us. So, I understand the reason for 
your question, but we have retained some flexibility in this to make sure 
that if we can continue to build at this 

 
the 60% achievement level that 

chedule. If we can keep doing this and the 
impacts of that overall wireless business are really showing up at lower 


s doing. So, I 

it.
 
Randall Stephenson
 
On the B2B front, Dave. This is Randall. Look, U.S. business is pretty 

to since 
tax reform, I think, like our six quarter of really healthy fixed investment for 

a little soft in the last quarter or two with the China trade discussions. The 
administ


 
for us to talk about that, but look business has 
pulled in and best with the last quarter or so as a result of the trade 
uncertainty.
 

business fixed investm
ent and that tracks very well with us. Second is 

worked off a lot of those whole legacy products, we had this incredible 

e the new IP 
type services. And the pricing there in the marketplace has been pretty 
reasonable and stable, and the new products sets are doing well. You saw 
special service as we call them, but I think those were up 6% plus for the 
quarter, which is a rea
lly nice healthy growth rate for those.
 
And then we had some IP sales in the quarter, and that profit up a little bit. 
So 

 
but even without that, the trends are really, really strong here. We feel 
good 

 
we feel about as positive on this segment as we hav
e in quite some 

this segment. And the IP sales by the way, I mean, I know those are come 

couple in thi


 

were announced just recently. And those are not inconsequential de
als. 
Those have multifaceted implications. And predominantly, those deals 


And as you have seen ove
r the last few years, we have very consistently 
with all the activity in the network going on, we have very consistently 
driven those cost levels down on an absolute basis, 8%, 9%, 10% year
-
over
-
year very consistently.
 




taking over a lot of applications for AT&T, moving those to th
e cloud. And 
what is going to do is allow us to continue at this type of cost reduction 
curve on the network and IT side of the house, and continue that 
momentum there. In addition, we are securing revenue opportunities with 
each of those companies, and ac
tually have go
-
to
-
market strategies. That 

wireline revenue side.
 

house, and hopeful that we continue to ha
ve economic growth, the trade 

and improve on this.
 
John Stephens
 
Thanks, Dave.
 
Randall Stephenson
 
Take the next question.
 
Operator
 
Next up, we have the line of Brett Feldman of Gold
man Sachs. Your line is 
open.
 
Brett Feldman
 


fully deployed on FirstNet without really having had a chance to do
 
a lot yet 
with 5G. But over the next year, both of those initiatives are going to be 
much more significantly deployed. Can you talk a little bit about how you 
think about your go
-
to
-
market in Mobility and whether you think over the 
next few quarters, ther

more? Thanks.
 
Randall Stephenson
 
Yeah. Thanks, Brett. This is Randall, again. Yeah, look the wireless side of 
the house, we are feeling more and more confident every day as we execute 
through the network st
rategy in the FirstNet strategy. And as you think 
about growth in the future, you hit on the key elements. FirstNet is just in its 
infancy, and we have a few hundred subscribers that have moved to 
FirstNet. The first responder community is a rather large m

market where we come into it with very small share.
 
And so, our opportunity to grow share as we build out this First Responder 

But that just as importantly is 

moving into markets where we have had a pretty thin presence in the past. 
These are rural communities. And as we move into these communities, we 
are standing up brand new distribution in many communities. And eve
rybody 

penetration numbers look like when a new entrant comes into a community.
 

see that as we stand up distri



here.
 

inconsequential, in fact is probably the most 
important of all of this, is that AT&T now has claimed the network quality 
mantle. Network quality is ours, and we feel very strongly about this. And as 
I told you, we have been rated the best, the fastest and 
the high most 
reliable network by people who do this for a living on an independent basis. 

 


ms of gross add capability. And just 
having a strong network quality brand and message in the marketplace by 

about the wireless business right now. John, would you add anything?
 
John Stephens
 
Brett, we think of the first responder community, has 3 million potential, to 

secondary first responders, the guys who going in and restore power and 
restore hospi


almost 

 
that adds about 11 million to it. So that brings that community 

 

 

 
And then you think about them having multiple devices whether it be a 
tablet or a phone, and then you think about them having family members. 
So, it really is a very large scale. We are making great progress in getting 
au
thorized with agencies and adding customers. And adding customers, that 



ve us this opportunity quite frankly to 
lower churn to get better quality service to this existing 80 million customers 

 

difficult time putting a price tag on or giving predictions for. Bu

real benefit for us and for the shareholders, for the customers. So, we feel 
really good about that.
 
And that leaves us just in a very smooth transition into 5G. This 5G 
Evolution is going on now to 5G Plus with our millimeter wave and our 
20 


year. So, we really are leading in 5G. We really are 

 
and FirstNet is 

 
a lot of benefits to it. So, you can 
understand why we do feel good. We do feel good about what the team is 

going forward.
 

 
of this complete 
by the end of this year. And our network guys have surprised me on the 

build side. And the remaining piece would be software upgrades, so we feel 
really good ab
out the financial aspects of this process also.

open.
 
Michael McCormack
 
Hey, guys, thanks. Randall, obviously a lo
t of news out there and it seems 
like the last game was about to change, I guess, fairly dramatically in the 
wireless business. Just sort of thinking, what are your thoughts over the 
next three to four years as you see potentially new entrants coming in? H
ow 
does that change the AT&T strategy going forward? And I guess, secondly on 
the Business Wireline side, just to circle back on that, it feels like 

 
it sounds 
like you guys are going to much more on retention efforts around that. Is 
there something there
 

having a positive impact? Thanks.
 
Randall Stephenson
 


 
Michael McCormack
 

 
been hearing that you guys 
been doing a much better job in retaining customers and probably shared to 

 
Randall Stephenson
 


 
and it happens to be accurate. We have done a very good jo
b as 

been fairly rational in the marketplace. And so, yeah, we really have had not 
only on a retention basis, but also on an acquisition basis, picking up new 

p a number of new logos in the last year or so. And so 


but all of that was just good economic hea
lth. And American business is 
quite healthy right now.
 

industry structure. And the news this morning that maybe T
-
Mobile is close 
to having a deal with the DOJ. I just 

 

a 

 
there are so many ifs 


if Charlie Ergen has wireless assets and distribution or Sprint T
-
Mobile 
happ

to do for the next three years.
 
Our strategy is pretty well baked, and I think the strategy is resilient as it 

 
standpoint that is, first and foremost, centered around FirstNet, getting the 
FirstNet capability deployed, built, standing up new distribution, tapping that 
new market and just continuing to drive network quality.
 
And then, obviously, the 5G deployment i
s high, high priority. Also, then 

HBO Max will be a key part of this wireless strategy as we get into next year 
and pairing a very unique premium video content with our wireless and
 
our 
TV and broadband business. So, whether anything happens with that or not, 

 

closely, but there are so many ifs around, does the industry structure
 


happen in M&A before, where the state AGs have positioned themselves, 
where they will be the last say on any
 


through this.
 
And so, thinking about state AGs and then the rumors and so forth in the 

 
antitrust concerns 



but at

Next up, we have the line of Michael Rollins of Citi.
 
Michael Rollins
 
As you consider balancing revenue performance and profitability, can you 
discuss the role that content exclusivities 
will play in the future for AT&T in 2 
respects? First, on the content in sports rights, like NFL SUNDAY TICKET that 
you distribute through DIRECTV, and then second, separately, how you think 
about monetizing the content library in WarnerMedia on an exclusi
ve basis, 

 
Randall Stephenson
 
Sure. Hi, Mike. Yes. So, start with the NFL SUNDAY TICKET exclusivity. 

unfortunately, right now, that content is tied to our satellite product. And so, 
it serves a good value as we come int

retention tool. But in terms of an opportunity to grow our business with that, 

hopefully, over time, we can address that and move it on to our 
other 
platforms. And I think it can be a really important piece of growing our other 
platforms.
 
As you think about NBA, Major League Baseball, a lot of the content that 

 
is 

 
content rights that are held by the Turner companies, whether it be TNT or 
TBS a
nd the NBA Final 4, and then playoffs fit that as well, those are 

in making Turner very unique content as we market it to other distributors, 
but also as we begin to put that conte
nt on our HBO Max platform. This will 
be at the early stages of HBO Max, but you should assume that ultimately, 
HBO Max will have live elements.
 
And those live elements, both unique live sports, premium sports, the ones 
we just went through, NBA, Major Lea
gue Baseball, NCAA basketball, those 
are going to be really, really important elements for HBO Max. The same 
with news, and you can go through the areas of news that we think are very, 
very important, and will do quite well as an element of HBO Max.
 
So exc
lusive content has been important for as long as the TV business has 


Bleacher Report. We have some great exclus
ive live content in Bleacher 
Report, from NBA to soccer, European soccer and so forth. So, a lot of 
opportunities to take advantage of the unique content deals that we have 
within WarnerMedia.
 
Operator
 
Next up, we have the line of Kannan Venkateshwar of Ba
rclays.
 
Kannan Venkateshwar
 
If I may on the Entertainment Business, if you just look at the performance 
this particular quarter, despite losing subs, you, of course, did well on 

to
 
a point where the yield is better than the sub
-
losses overall. And 
therefore, when you look at some of these new product launches, the central 
line device going forward and even DIRECTV NOW, how are you thinking 
about 

 

? Is it more to manage that? Or is 
it more for growth? And is video growth from a subscriber perspective really 
important going forward? Or should we just assume that because the focus 
is margins and growth, margins and top line stability, the focus will m
ore be 
on price and costs?
 
Randall Stephenson
 



 
one has to ask, how is it that 
subscribers can decline like this and margins expand? And i
t says a lot about 
the customers that are staying on the network, that they tend to be very 
high
-
value customers, tend to be very valuable customers as you think 
about where we are going as a company. And that is distributing unique 
content through as many
 
distribution points as possible.
 
And so, as you think about the product portfolio going forward, which is 


a 

thin client product that were bringing to market, it literally takes the 
customer acquisition costs and cuts it in half. And the beauty of that is that 
you can begin to address a
 
fundamental problem with the current linear TV 
business, and that is the price point, but the content costs just continuing to 
grow. You heard me talk about Nexstar wanting 100% increase on their 
broadcast rights and so forth.
 

et the cost curve down on this product, so we 
can keep people into the product for a longer
-
term basis. So, as you drive 

bringing to market, then you can bring the price points down and h
old 
margins and still have the same value equation from a customer standpoint. 
So, DIRECTV, good product, will be there for a long time.
 
AT&T TV, you should assume, this will be the workhorse over the next 
couple of years. And we will put our shoulder and 
our muscle behind AT&T 
TV, get a lower price point, shore up this customer base over the next 

given any subscriber numbers on HBO digital because we just had Game of 
Thrones, and w
e added a lot of digital subscribers. And we will, as we get to 


going to be a little guarded about
 
giving subscribers.
 


 
DISH stopped carrying HBO. 
And year
-
over
-

strong the digital subscriber performance of this thing was. And churn is 
hanging in the
re pretty strong in the third quarter because as Game of 
Thrones went off, the HBO folks, we gave them more capital to invest in 

well. Chernobyl was a blowout success. After Big L
ittle Lies ended last 
Sunday. Now we have Succession coming online.
 
The new season of Barry is coming into play, and this thing is just feeling 
pretty good. And so, as you think about a video portfolio, DIRECTV, AT&T 

ore conviction that HBO Max is 

going to put our shoulder and our muscle as we move forward. And the 
implications of that to profitability, we think, are pretty important.
 

 
give more visibility on the WarnerMedia Day in October. But 
bottom line, we like how the video portfolio is shaping up here, and you can 
listen to that discussion and begin to appreciate where you would expect our 
marketing and customer acquisition muscle
 
to go.
 
John Stephens
 
Randall, if I could, one thing to add. All that investment that Randall was 

seen the 3% revenue increase at HBO ties exactly to what Randall said. How 
are y


continue to invest in content just like CapEx throughout the year. And that is 
in 

 
that is already included i

shown up through this year and included in our guidance.
 


toda

of free cash flow, not only for the trailing 12 months, but for this year. So, 

around I made on WarnerM
edia and HBO and those types, but also across 

generating just tremendous cash flows, not only in total, but on a per
-
share 
basis.
 
Operator
 
Our last question will come from the line
 
of Tim Horan of Oppenheimer.
 
Timothy Horan
 
Randall, can you dive into the 5G strategy a little bit more? It does feel like 
now you could be a few years ahead of your peers, and it seems like a great 
opportunity to gain share, maybe grow ARPUs here, but ar
e you going to be 
able to deploy the 5G software as soon as the FirstNet build has gone by the 
end of next year? And can you talk about maybe what the go
-
to
-
market 
strategy will look like? Will you look to gain share more so or will it be to 
grow ARPUs? An
d just practically speaking, from a customer perspective, 
how much more speed or network capacity or latency will they really see off 
the bat and starting in 2021?
 
Randall Stephenson
 
Yes. Hi, Tim. You bet. We are pretty consistent in talking about the 
adva




urning up all this other latent data 
spectrum that we own as we climb the tower and putting the 5G hardware in 

 

e 
exactly what we told the market that it would be. You turn up all the 
spectrum, you put the new technology in place and there is a speed 
enhancement. And we are unquestionably the fastest network in the market 
just because of that capacity served. And we
 
are literarily in the process of, 

had a slide on this, by 50%. There are just inherent performance 

experienc
ing, and our churn is reflecting this.
 
Now 5G, to your question, will a software be ready? By mid
-
year next year, 


 
put all this hardware in place, we will have a 
nationwide footprint of 5G. So yes, the software will be turned up. And b
y 
mid
-

of market
-
by
-
market turning up our millimeter wave spectrum 5G into that 
spectrum band. And as you know, when you put 5G into that millimeter 


you start to get the gig
-
type speeds. And we have it up in areas here in 
Dallas, for example. And I have a Samsung phone that I carry around. And I 
routinely, when I do speed tests here in Dallas, get over 1 gig spee
ds, get 2 
gig on some occasions.
 

-
up in speed performance as 
we deploy this in the millimeter wave on top of our lower
-
ban spectrum 
where we turn it up over the course of next year.
 
The really high
-
performance millimeter wave spectrum is going to come 
market
-
by
-
market, and it will take a while to deploy the really high
-
speed 
spectrum. As we turn it up, Tim, you should expect our focus will be a little 
different to some of our competit
ors. It is a business
-
driven focus at the go
-

technology. If somebody needs a connected factory or connected plant, 

s a 
Wi
-
Fi replacement for their business operations, we can deploy and we can 
replace that. If somebody has IoT applications, we can begin to deploy this 
and roll these services out kind of commensurate with the network 
deployment.
 
And so, it will be busin
ess
-
driven at first. As we get broad coverage of the 
millimeter wave, and this is really important, as our customers begin to get 
handsets into their hands that can use this technology, which right now, is 
pretty limited number of handsets, but as we exit 

significant 

 



where there
 

coverage. That will happen as we go through the course of next year.
 
And we do agree with you that we have an advantage here. We have a 

, this broad 5G 
deployment mid

John Stephens
 
And let me wrap up, and then hand it over for Randall for some closing 
comments. But specifically, on the quarter, we had solid revenue growth. 
And we me
t our service revenue growth in mobility. Quality EBITDA growth, 
solid EPS, strong free cash flows and continued investment in both content 
and network that are showing up in our results. So, we feel like it was a very 
good quarter, and we are very 

 
and w
e remain optimistic going forward. 
Our ability to generate cash and manage our balance sheet is without 
question, and we feel very good about it. Randall, let me turn it over to you.
 
Randall Stephenson
 

f the commitments we 
gave to you last year, at the end of the year, we are hitting every one of 


this year.
 



 

through this year and the cash flows continue to produce.
 

ght this asset 
was so important for us to own. This is a great business, great talent, great 
people running it. HBO is firing on all cylinders. Warner Bros. is doing 
terrific. And all this is coming together to give us great confidence that HBO 
Max is goin

to that, more of that to you in October. We look forward to seeing everybody 
there. Thank you for joining the call, and look forward to seeing you.

Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the AT&T 
Second Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants 
are in a listen
-
only mode and later we will conduct a question
-
and
-
answer 
session. 

our host, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations for AT&T, Mr. Mike Viola. 
Please go ahead, sir.
 
Mike Viola
 
Okay. Thank you, Lori and good afternoon everybody. Welcome to our 
second qua
rter conference call. Thank you for joining us today. As Lori said, 
I am Mike Viola, Head of Investor Relations for AT&T. Joining me on the call 

update with perspective on the qua
rter and then we will follow that with a 
Q&A session. Let me remind you that our earnings material is available on 

att.com/investor.relations.
 
I need to call your attention on Page 2 to our Safe Ha
rbor statement. Before 
we begin, the Safe Harbor statement says that some of our comments today 
maybe forward
-
looking. And as such, they are subject to risks and 
uncertainties. Results may differ materially and additional information is 
available on the In

 
Before I turn it over to John, let me cover Slide 3, cover our consolidated 


ts for a 
non
-

merger
-
related costs, which include DIRECTV and Mexico. This strong year
-
over
-
year growth comes even with earnings pressure from our Mexican 
wireless operations as well as the imp
act from our divested Connecticut 
wireline business and our equity investment in América Móvil.
 

adjust for the sale of our Connecticut wireline property. This growth was 
driven by con
tinued solid performance in wireless as we repositioned our 
smartphone base. We had impressive gains in strategic business services 
and strong wireline consumer revenue growth. Cash flows also grew 
significantly in the quarter. Cash from ops for the quarte
r totaled more than 

flow was $4.5 billion and more than $7 billion on a year
-
to
-
date basis and 
that brought our free cash flow dividend payout to 67% on a year
-
to
-
date 
basis.
 
And s

Financial Officer, John Stephens and he will discuss our operational 
highlights. John?
 
John Stephens
 
Thank you, Mike and hello everyone. Thanks for joining us today and as 
always thanks fo
r your interest in AT&T. As you can see in our second 
quarter results, our moves to transform the company are working and 
working well. We grew revenues, expand the margins and achieved double
-
digit adjusted EPS growth. Cash flows were strong allowing us t
o invest in 
our business, return substantial value to shareholders and strengthen our 
cash position. Our moves to reposition our smartphone customer base are 
working achieving the expected results. Almost 80% of the smartphone base 
is already on Mobile Sha
re Value plans and 68% of our smartphone sales 
and upgrades were on AT&T Next. When you are adding the customers who 
brought their own device, nearly three quarters of smartphone sales were 
without subsidies. This helped drive strong postpaid phone
-
only wi
th Next 
ARPU growth and best ever service margins.
 
In wireline, our transition to IT services continues at a strong cliff. U
-
verse 
services are more than 70% of consumer revenues and helped drive near 
4% adjusted revenue growth. Strategic services are now 
a third of our 
wireline business revenues and continue to grow at a very strong pace. So, 
all in all, a very strong quarter as we begin the diversification of our 
company. Our growth in cost initiatives, such as Project VIP and Project 
Agile, are working. 
We are executing at a high level and we have a solid 
foundation for growth as we move forward.
 

wireless on Slide 5. Our wireless strategy is working. Our efforts to 
reposition the sm
artphone base to the no subsidy model have taken hold. 
We continue to see solid evidence that our efforts are paying off. First, the 
most significant shift of our smartphone customers to Mobile Share Value 
plans is behind us. This has helped stabilize serv
ice revenues, which were 
essentially flat for the quarter. There was heavy promotional activity on last 

sales approach this year helped in our year
-
over
-
year comparison.
 
Second, a
s service revenues stabilized and the number of customers using 
AT&T Next increases, we have seen our postpaid phone ARPU with Next 
increase steadily. It was up more than 6% year
-
over
-
year. And our postpaid 
phone
-
only revenues increased sequentially reachi
ng its highest level in 
three quarters. We are about halfway through the expected Next sales cycle 
as customers upgrade their smartphones. As they do, we expect continued 
ARPU with Next growth as more customers upgrade. Our focus on costs, 

ional efficiencies and other cost savings programs, such as 
Project Agile, help drive strong margin expansion in the quarter. Our 
adjusted wireless EBITDA service margin was 48.5%, our best performance 
ever and an almost 600 basis point improvement over la

quarter. The story of the last six quarters has been repositioning our 
smartphone base. This has moved subscribers away from the heavy handset 
subsidies in exchange for lower monthly pricing. For the last several 
quarters, customers on pre
-
Next pricing have been ahead of us, but we are 
starting to see the benefits of the strategy.
 

transitioning our customers to Mobile Share Value plans. In a little more 
than a year, 
nearly two
-
thirds of our smartphone base has moved to the no 
subsidy discount pricing of Mobile Share Value. While customers continue to 
choose these plans, the growth rate is slowing as the penetration has been 
achieved. On the other hand, the revenue gro
wth opportunity with AT&T 
Next has much farther to go. About 68% of our smartphone sales in the 
quarter were on AT&T Next, but our Next customer base is only about 37%. 
That gives us substantial opportunity to grow revenues as these customers 
upgrade their
 
smartphones.
 
We expect penetration rates for both Mobile Share Value and AT&T Next to 
continue to grow. AT&T Next and Bring Your Own Device are about 90% of 
postpaid smartphone sales are company
-
owned stores and have programs 

 
and we have programs in pla
ce to generate similar or better rates in our 
other channels. And the Mobile Share Value plans, continues to draw new 
customers. Only about 12% of our smartphone base is still on unlimited data 
plans and that has been steadily dropping as customers choose 
to move to 
our new Mobile Share Value plans.
 
We also continue to see growth in the percentage of our postpaid base on 
Mobile Share Value family plans or business plans. That total has reached 
96% in this past quarter. These plans tend to be more sticky wit
h lower 
churn. We also turned in another strong net add quarter as postpaid, 
prepaid and connected devices drove our highest net adds in more than 3 
years. Those details are on Slide 7.
 
Total net adds came in at 2.1 million subscribers, including 410,000 p
ostpaid 
subscribers and 1.4 million connected devices. Cricket is really kicking in the 
gear. Prepaid voice had a strong turnaround year from a year ago. We 
gained more than 330,000 prepaid voice customers after losing about that 
many in the year ago quart
er.
 
Our process has been benefited by our ability to transition the Cricket 
customers to our new high
-
quality 4G LTE network. Our strong sales efforts 
and the near completion of the Cricket integration helped drive that 
turnaround. 97% of Cricket customers
 
are now on our GSM platform as we 
continue the integration and as we shutdown the CDMA networks. These are 
premium prepaid customers, almost all are choosing smartphones when they 
go onto our GSM platform and about two thirds of the gross adds are 
choosin
g our highest value plans. Those are plans that have higher ARPU. In 

postpaid ARPU. And we are doing this integration faster and with less churn 
than we originally anticipated ev
en with our network conversion. We had our 
lowest ever prepaid churn, thanks to continued progress with Cricket even 
as we decommission the networks.
 
We also had our second largest connected device net add quarter ever. Our 
leadership in connected cars dro
ve that growth. Our relationship with eight 
car manufacturers producing more than half of the new connected cars in 
the United States is driving this as more and more manufacturers make 
connectivity a key part of their new car strategies. The company had 7
.2 
million branded smartphone gross adds and upgrades in the second quarter. 
We increased our high quality branded smartphone base by about 1.2 million 
in the quarter. This includes branded upgrades and migrations, which we 
don't include in our net add num
ber. The smartphone momentum, plus 
strength in prepaid, led to a positive branded voice net adds in the quarter. 
Churn continues to be solid. Postpaid churn was down slightly from the first 
quarter of this year. And for the year, we are still running below
 

best ever annual postpaid churn record of 1.04%. Total churn was also 
impressive. It dropped 16 basis points to 1.31% from 1.47% in the year ago 
quarter, driven in large part by the significant improvements in prepaid. And 
branded churn was al
so down year
-
over
-
year as we added more than 
740,000 branded devices.
 

repositioning of our wireline base also is working. The challenge here is to 
maintain margins while transiti
oning customers to IP services from higher 

extraordinary efforts to control costs and focus on profitability has helped 
stabilize or we can expand margins as we made this transition. That was
 
true this quarter even with about $40 million or 30 basis points of additional 
pressure from spring storms that hit our network and our footprint. We have 
taken several measures to make this possible. You know of our efforts to 
exit low margin wholesale b
usinesses causes revenue pressure, but it does 
improve the future of our business. Our customer service focus has helped 
to reduce cycle times in provisioning services for customers and added 
network on demand capabilities with our next generation network 
investments. These efforts were recently recognized by IDC, which named 
AT&T a leader in seeking new innovations to improve customer service.
 
Our Project Agile is more of a mindset than just a cost efficiency program. 
We are not only finding ways to take c
osts out of our business, but also 
working to make things simpler to start with for both our customers and us. 
Our transformation IP technologies continue to drive strong performance in 
both strategic business services and wireline consumer in the quarter.
 
Adjusted strategic service revenues grew by nearly 14%. And when you 
adjust for the foreign exchange pressure, growth was even stronger, coming 
in at more than 16%. At the same time, we see the impact of IP with our 
data revenues. Total data revenues are 
nearly 60% of wireline business 
revenues and more than half of those revenues are from strategic services 
as we transition customers from legacy data services. This has helped drive 
total data year
-
over
-
year revenue growth for the third consecutive quarter
.
 
Adjusted wireline business revenues were down 3.9%. However, if you 
adjust for the impact of our discontinued wholesale businesses and FX, the 
decline would have been 1.7%. There was revenue pressure across our 
wireline business operation, but was most p
ronounced in wholesale, where 
we have been focusing on profitable sales even if it meant a reduction in 
revenue. Small business revenue was down slightly over the first quarter of 
the year, but we continue to see fiber sales accelerate and we are very 
exci
ted to hear that AT&T has been named the highest ranked brand in 
overall business wireline customer satisfaction performance in the J.D. Power 
small
-
to
-


 
O
n the consumer side, U
-
verse services are more than 70% of consumer 
revenues and adjusted revenues grew about 19% year
-
over
-
year. That 
helped drive our strongest consumer revenue growth in 5 quarters, growing 
by 3.7% when adjusting for the sale of Connecti
cut operations. You also see 
our focus on profitability and repositioning our customer base with U
-
verse. 
Video net adds dropped with fewer promotions and are targeting of high 
value subscribers. We did add about 240,000 IP broadband customers in the 
quart
er as we continue to reposition our DSL base to IP. That work is 
nearing completion with less than 1 million eligible DSL subscribers left to 
transition.
 

in wireless and stable wir
eline margins had a positive impact on consolidated 
margins. In the second quarter, our adjusted EBITDA grew to $11.1 billion 
and the adjusted consolidated margin was 33.6% compared to 31.5% last 

 
operating 
income also is showing continued improvement. It was $6.5 billion, up 
12.4% year
-
over
-
year. And adjusted operating income margin grew to 
19.6%, up more than 190 basis points from the year earlier second quarter. 
This was largely due to cost focu
s initiatives, which included Project Agile, 
our strength in wireless, growth in consumer revenues and gains in strategic 
business services. The company also benefited from lower trailing expenses 
from capital spending as Project VIP was completed. And our
 
move to next 
generation networks is starting to make a real difference as well.
 

summary is on Slide 10. Our ability to generate cash continues to be strong. 
Cash from operations totale

dividend commitment and our best cash generation in seven quarters. And 
we generated $15.9 billion in cash year
-
to
-
date. Capital expenditures totaled 
$4.7 billion and $8.7 billion year
-
to
-
date. We still expect s
tandalone capital 
spending in the $18 billion range this year, but we are now including our 
expansion efforts in Mexico in that amount. Free cash flow was $4.5 billion 
and $7.2 billion year
-
to
-
date. We are well on our way to hitting our 
standalone free cas
h flow guidance we gave you earlier this year. We now 
expect standalone free cash flow, excluding any impact from DIRECTV in the 
$12 billion range or better and this includes the operational and capital 
impacts from our Mexican acquisitions.
 
In terms of us
es of cash, dividends totaled $2.4 billion, which gives us a free 
cash flow to dividend payout ratio of 55% for the quarter and about 67% 
year
-
to
-
date. Our net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was 2.15, similar to the 
first quarter. We did issue debt in the s
econd quarter to help finance our 
acquisition activities. Our long
-
range goal is to get these levels back to the 
1.8 range and expect our cash focus to be on paying down debt in the near
-
term. The strong financial performance in the first half of the year 
sets us up 
well for the transformation and diversification of our business.
 
Now, let me close with a quick summary of the quarter on Slide 11 before 
we get to your questions. Our transformation plan is working. When you 
build the great network, develop nex
t generation products and focus on the 
customer, good things happen. This focus drove strong results in the quarter 

-
digit adjusted 
EPS growth, but just as important was our ability to generate cash 
from our 
business, which we did. All this is in line or better than guidance that we 
gave you earlier this year. These results add to our confidence that we are 
on track to hit our standalone guidance metrics.
 
Wireless financials were solid as we near comp
letion of our shift to Mobile 
Share Value plans. Next take rates continue to increase helping drive 
increasing postpaid phone with Next ARPU. Our prepaid brands are doing 
great and our expense management helped drive our best ever service 
margins. Our move
 
into Mexico positions us as the only company who owns 
and operates a North American mobile service area that will serve more than 
400 million people with 4G LTE service. And we expect to reach 350 million 
people by year end. Owning these network assets no
t only provides a high 

economics advantages.
 
We are also very pleased that in order to approve our DIRECTV transaction 

expect final approval 

deal today during this call, but I can tell you this. First, as far as any 
conditions that Chairman Wheeler alluded to earlier this week, we feel very 
confident t
hat we can make an adequate return on any investment we make 

for our shareholders has not changed. Second, we still fully expect to 
achieve $2.5 billion worth of cost synergies f
rom this transaction. That also 
has not changed.
 
We plan to webcast an Analyst Day from Dallas very soon after the deal 
closes to discuss our strategy in much more detail. We are more confident 
than ever about the opportunity this transaction brings. We ar
e building a 
unique communications and entertainment company, that we believe will not 
only transform us, but transform our industry as well. And we are very 
anxious to talk with you about it.

John Hodulik
 
Okay, thanks. Good afternoon, guys.
 
John Stephens
 
Good afternoon, John.
 
John Hodulik
 
Hey, the two things I think that stood up the most 
in the report were the 
service revenue trends and the wireless margins. So, first, on the service 
revenue, given the trends you are seeing and the slowing shift to the Mobile 
Share Value, do you feel confident that we can get to growth in that line 
item in
 
the second half of the year given the competitive environment? And 
then on the margins, big improvement there, 600 basis points in the year
-
over
-
year basis. I mean, there were some add
-
backs, but is this 

 
is that the 
kind of improvement we should see thr
oughout the rest of the year? Thanks.
 
John Stephens
 
Yes, John, good question. Thanks. First, let me say this, we are pleased with 

margins up. They did a great job and they continue wi
th that focus. On the 
service revenues, we did get a little bit of benefit this year or this quarter 
from the promotional activity that took place last year. So, the disciplined 
sales approach that the team took was really important to driving that good 
pe
rformance in the service revenues. While we are not giving specific 
guidance on either on service margins or on the specific amount of wireless 
margins, we are going to stay with our guidance that we did have out there 
that we continue to expect to grow ov
erall revenues in our business and that 
we are going to continue to expect to grow margins both on the wireless and 
on the consolidated side. So, I will stick with that, but yes, we are very 
encouraged by it. The discipline that the team has shown is impre
ssive and 
we see every reason to continue that focus and discipline.
 
John Hodulik
 
Alright, thanks, John.

Thank you.

Phil Cusick
 
Hi, guys. Thanks. I guess if you could talk about Mexico, can yo

expected over about a 4

will include updating 100 million POPs to LTE. But as I have said before that 


associated with it, because we will focus our efforts on those in best position 

will get the 40 million we are targeting by 
the end of this year. So the, if you 
will, capital will not be spread evenly or ratably over the cycle time. With 
that being said, I think you can view us as getting to that 40 million next 

will get to 

billion is capital dollars.
 
With regard to this year, what we really want to make sure is clear is as we 
spelled out in the separate international segment, the internat
ional business 
right now is requiring some investment. We are aware of that. We expected 
it. And we are going to make those investments. And with that investment 
and the investment in capital this year, we still believe two things will 
happen. We will be a
ble to come through in the CapEx in the $18 billion 
range for the total company, including the Mexico CapEx and we will 
generate free cash flow in the $12 billion range or better, including both the 
capital and operational expense requirements of the Mexic
o business.
 
Phil Cusick
 
If I can just follow
-
up, the $18 billion in CapEx this year implies a nice 


 
Jo
hn Stephens
 
Well, I think a couple of things. And the simplest thing is to say network 

million POPs with LTE right now. And we are putting on a spectrum to use as 
opposed to building towers. A
nd so that aspect of it is just a utilization of 

CapEx. Secondly, the 57 million IP broadband and what is now 
approximately 900,000 business customer locations passed with fiber. Once 
agai
n, the network guys have done a great job in getting the Project VIP 
initiatives completed. And when they are done, there is the additional spend 



focus on working capital and construction work in progress and driving down 
cycle times and a whole host of other efforts, the team is doing really good 

ings that are 
driving this capability. We are going to continue invest in capacity. We are 
going to continue to invest in successful sales. We feel very good about our 
ability to continue to respond to customers in a positive way.
 
Phil Cusick
 
Thanks, John.
 
John Stephens
 
Thank you.
 
Operator
 
And we go to Mike McCormack with Jefferies. Please go ahead.
 
Mike McCormack
 
Hey, guys. Thanks. I had just a quick comment on competitive positioning, 

 
a little 
bit of share here at the benefit of probably margins and probably some of 
the ARPU trends, but just maybe a comment on those sub
-
losses you are 
seeing in the handset side, the quality of those subs. And then, secondly 
John, your thoughts on cash 
taxes as we look into 2016?
 
John Stephens
 
Couple of things. Mike thanks for the question. First only, let me say it this 
way, on a branded net add basis we were negative, on voice we were 
positive. We added voice customers. Now on the postpaid category, we
 
did 
lose some feature phones, which have our lowest ARPUs. But on the prepaid 
side with both our Cricket and GoPhone brands, we added some premium 
customers. I think I mentioned that two
-
thirds of our Cricket customers are 
buying out of the higher plans. 
Those are $50, $60 month plans. Two thirds 
or more of our customers are buying those plans. And those ARPUs are 
higher than the feature phone ARPUs we are losing and quite frankly, higher 
than a lot of 

 
some people in the markets postpaid ARPU. So we are 
getting 
great tradeoff. The beauty of that, though and the thing is helping margins. 
So, there is very low acquisition subsidy costs with regard to those 
customers. We did sell over 7 million smartphones through the 

 
in the 
quarter. A lot of those were in
 
our prepaid space, but we did sell that. 
Beauty of it is that the customers are satisfying the financial requirements of 

 
Mike McCormack
 
And John, we are seeing a meaningful amount of those so
rt of postpaid 
feature phones moving over to the Cricket brand or prepaid brands?
 
John Stephens
 
No, those will be migrations. So we would account for those as migrations, 

adds in prep
aid were all customers we acquired that had not had service 
with anybody before or we took from other providers. So we feel really good 
about our competitive position and we are really excited about our prepaid 

g with Cricket and quality of 
the customers we are getting. And quite frankly, the great job the teams 
done in the accelerating the integration, getting us over on the 

 
on our 
GSM or LTE networks, getting smartphones to these customers hands and 
really pr
oviding quality service. Churn is 

 
the reduction in churn is really 
impressive. And you can see from our slides, overall churn 

 
total churn was 

prepaid.
 
Mike McCormack
 
Okay. And the ca

 
John Stephens
 

go up because of the tax rules and currently in place right now. No 
legislation for bonus depreciation. With that being said, the
re has been a bill 
that came out of the Senate finance committee I think just last week. There 
has been a lot of activity in the house to extend the various tax extenders, 
research bill and credit and other things and include bonus depreciation. 
Some say f
or a 2 years cycle, others say 3 years to 5 years cycle depending 
upon which piece of legislation we are talking about. If those happen, we 
would see a significant benefit from a company who invest in the United 
States and invest in jobs through CapEx in t

to be seen as what will happen.
 
Mike McCormack
 
Okay, great John. Thanks.
 
John Stephens
 
Thank you, Mike.
 
Operator
 
We will go to David Barden, Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.
 
David Barden
 
Hey guys. Thanks for t
aking the questions. I guess, first John if I could ask 
the wireless margin question another way, which is looking at the sequential 
change in the cost, there is about almost $750 million of sequential costs 
went away after you subtracted out the merger an
d integration expenses. So 
could you kind of parse down what happened quarter
-
over
-
quarter in the 
wireless business and can we expect this starting point to be where we 

I guess,
 

the implications of the potential conditions here. But I think as the level is 
set in that conversation, could you kind of go through what you are able to 
talk about in terms of the scop
e of the current GigaPower initiative, the 
economics around that initiative, cost of home passed and so we can kind of 
all be on the same page in that conversation? Thanks.
 
John Stephens
 
So let me start with the wireless, right. There are a couple of 
things we need 
to be focused on. One is we made significant progress with regard to Cricket 
and the integration of it. So we have been able to free up a lot of spectrum 
over the year to take in capacity in a very efficient and low
-
cost way. So be 
able to s
erve customers more effectively get more LTE. Secondly, we have 

 
the Cricket as you know the company we bought was operating at a 

 
and it 
will say that challenge environment will challenge results from a margin and 
operating income perspective. The team 
has put in place integration plans 
and activated those and effectuated those. They are now improving and 
growing EBITDA and operating contribution in that piece of it. So if you go 
back if you look at the prior public company we bought the lead company 
and
 
you can get a sense if you can turn those numbers positive, you can 

 
Two, we have seen efforts in our customer tier and specifically in our 
mobility customer care centers, where we have done a whole vari
ety of 

there, with the 

 


getting it right the fir

extensive investments over the last few years in Digital First and allowing 
customers to, for example order, upgrade, buy different packages, pay their 
bills, those types of things on their smartpho
nes. All that has driven, call 
volumes down significantly into our care centers to the tune of, we will 
probably have a drop for this year of about 10 million phone calls out of our 

 
Our 
LTE network is a lower cost network and we are continuing to see 

Additionally, we are seeing our customers seem to want to hold their phones 
longer under the next plan, at least longer t
han we had initially expected. 
And with that, we are seeing cost savings there. So those are all part of 
what we saw in the second quarter. And we are optimistic that we will be 
able to continue much of that momentum maybe at different levels, but we 
are g
oing to be able to continue that momentum going forward. So we are 
very optimistic about that.
 

GigaPower, we have announced an effort to go into 25 major markets to 
place fiber to th
e prem in those. We have done it and started in some initial 
markets in Dallas and Austin, some others. Our initial results have been very 
encouraging. Our sales have exceeded our expectations. We are seeing 
great, if you will net promoter scores from our 
customers who take those 
services. And we are encouraged by that. And I think based on prudence 
how these 

 
the comments with regard to it is that, but we are encouraged 
by what we have seen out of GigaPower and the capabilities it brings, not 
only to our 
customers, but to us as a service provider.
 
David Barden
 
Great. Thanks, John.
 
John Stephens
 
Thanks.
 
Operator
 
And we will go to Amir Rozwadowski with Barclays Capital. Please go ahead.
 
Amir Rozwadowski
 
Thank you very much. John, I was wondering if you could
 
switch gears back 
to start assessing the competitive environment, particularly in the wireless 
arena, there has been a lot of discussions around levels of promotional 
activity in sort of the first part of the year, whether or not we are at elevated 
levels
 
or sort of depressed levels versus last year. As you look out towards 
the remainder of the year, you had mentioned that you are taking a 
disciplined approach, I was wondering if you can give us a bit more color in 
terms of your strategy going forward here
 
in terms of either from a 
promotional standpoint or if there is some new products coming on the line 
with this merger, the type of strategies that you are taking for customer 
acquisition?
 
John Stephens
 
Yes. So let me just say it this way. We are certainly
 
evaluating and watching 

are not responding to each and everyone from a discounting program. We 
have shown that kind of discipline. We have responded with 

 
with an effort 
to make 
customer care easier, customer service easier, customer data 

pain points and satisfy them. And we have done a great job in providing 
value customer solution with our prepaid brand. Th
ose are the kinds of 
things we are going to do and continue to do. I think you have seen it in our 
numbers that this disciplined approach has paid off. And as I mentioned, we 
did have positive voice net adds. So we feel good about what is done to 
positioni
ng. Quite frankly, the biggest strategy play that we have had in that 
wireless base was probably acquisition of Cricket and giving us that 
capability that platform and the distribution to really serve those value 
customers in a different way. But if you wi



ability to compete with the tools that we have that are different than ou
r 
competitors. Having that premium prepaid, having Mobile Share value, 
having Next, having connected cars and connected devices, having all those 
tools in this great network, I believe we are in the best position to compete 
going forward and are looking fo
rward to that opportunity.
 
Amir Rozwadowski
 
Thank you. And then if I may one brief follow
-
up in thinking about sort of 
churn levels and then we have seen sort of a tick down from the prior 
quarter and in thinking about the scope of the competitive landscap
e, how 
do you think that sort of churn should progress through the course of the 
year?
 
John Stephens
 

focused on churn as a way of giving good service, lowers churn, lowers 
churn, give
s good profitability. So, we certainly value it. And we will continue 
to focus on it. I will just leave it to say that through 6 months, our churn on 

was our best year ever. An
d then secondly, as I mentioned, if you peel 
through our numbers, you can see our total churn dropped 16 basis points, 
which means our prepaid churn, which I did mention had its best quarter 
ever for us. And our prepaid churns are improving. So, we are rea
lly focused 
on it. And we believe that gives us that opportunity to really generate value, 
still being very competitive in the marketplace.
 
Amir Rozwadowski
 
Thank you very much for the additional color.
 
John Stephens
 
Thanks, Amir.
 
Operator
 
We have 
Brett Feldman with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
 
Brett Feldman
 
Thanks for taking the question. John, during your statements, you 
mentioned that you are increasingly focused on driving profitability in the 
wireline side and you know that there was a small
 
loss of video customers 
against that strategy. It implies you saw something in the market that you 


focus
ed strategically? That will be helpful. And just along those lines since 
the broadband numbers, we are just a little under run
-
rate on U
-
verse I 
think you talked about where you were from a penetration standpoint in an 
upgrade cycle, if you could revisit t
hat? That would be helpful.
 
John Stephens
 
So, a couple of things. One with regard to we do have a tremendous focus 
on driving cost out of our wireline business. And as all of you know, when 
legacy services drop off, they usually have very high margins to g
o with 
them. So, as we are growing our strategic services, U
-
verse services, we are 
really focused on controlling costs, so we can replace 

 
to maintain our 
profitability. With that being said, on the U
-
verse video side, the first point 
to make is second q
uarter is always seasonally a challenge. You got a lot of 
relocations. You got a lot of students returning from college. And with our 

challenge for us. The issue then is do you go
 
out and do a lot of promotional 
activities to stimulate growth? We chose to be very disciplined and very 
limited in those promotional activities. As you can see, it really had a unique 
impact in the sense that our revenues grew 3.7% or almost 4%. So, it w
as 
from this disciplined approach of not getting out of hand with regard to 

bundling all our services together, we are very optimistic about our ability to 
compete.
 
With regard to 
our IP broadband, it really has more to do it this time, not 
only with the seasonality, but also with the fact that we were converting our 
DSL at a very high rate to our IP broadband or a high
-
speed broadband. 
That process has left 

 
has achieved 13 millio
n of these high
-
speed 
broadband. And we are only about 1 million left. So, coming from a number 
of years ago, where we had 14 million to convert, we are down to 1. And so 
you will see 

 

a some
what challenged video footprint at the current time, the opportunities 
before us are clear with that high
-
quality broadband service that we have. 
So, I will leave it at that.

Alright, thank you.
 
John Stephens
 
Thank you.
 
Operator
 
We go to Simo
n Flannery with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
 
Simon Flannery
 
Thank you very much. John, it sounds like the FCC is getting ready to put 
out the final rules for the broadcast incentive option. You have put out a 
commitment around $9 billion under certain 
conditions. Can you just review 
your perspective on the 600 auction? And then any color you can give us on 
securitization during the quarter? Thanks.
 
John Stephens
 
Yes. So, with regard to securitization, Simon, we did do some this quarter. 
They were about 
$1 billion this quarter and we did about $800 million in the 
year ago quarter, so a slight increase in the securitizations, I am assuming 
you are talking about the net securitizations, continue to see strong demand, 
continue to see a real interest in that 
investment by a number of banks at 
very attractive rates. And we are getting to the point now that we have 
lapped the full year and are building a history with regard to this program, 
which is very good for the company. This has to give us flexibility goin
g 
forward. So, very pleased with it, expect we will continue to do it, but the 
differential year
-
over
-
year was not dramatic as it may have been in some 

always interested in looking at 
spectrum and the opportunities to improve 
our spectrum position and we planned for that on a regular basis. With 
regard to participation in the broadcast auction, we did offer to participate 
when we first announced our intention to acquire DTV. We will wai
t and see 
what the final terms and conditions with regard to any approval of that 
merger are, but in any event, I would suggest you that will be interested 

participate in an appropriate 
way as we move forward.
 
Simon Flannery
 
Great, thank you.
 
John Stephens
 
Thanks, Simon.

Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. John, so you are on track to br
ing 
the CapEx down to the $18 billion range, but this does follow some heavy 
investment the past few years. As you look out over the technology 
roadmap, like 5G coming down the pipeline, do you anticipate that we will 
see another period of elevated investm
ent?
 
John Stephens
 

What we are seeing is our move to get this fiber deep into the network and 
getting LTE out deep into the wireless network and the solutions that we are 
findin
g in a software
-
defined network opportunity, we see a real opportunity 
to actually strive to bring investments, if you will, lower or more efficient 

going to be in that $18 b
illion range, which is about 15%. We are certainly 

 
we are not going to give any guidance with regard to next year or the year 

analyst conference if we get that opportunity. Wit
h that being said, I think 
there is a real opportunity with some of the activities are going on in 
software
-
defined networks on a longer term basis to actually bring that in 
capital intensity to a more modest level.
 
Joe Mastrogiovanni
 
Got it. Thanks.
 
Opera
tor
 
Thank you. We go next to Frank Louthan, Raymond James. Please go ahead.
 
Frank Louthan
 

passed with GigaPower and sort of what the cost is running on that right 
now? And then secondly, 
on the wholesale business, what exactly is the 
trend there? Are you losing share or is it just lower pricing or is lower 
volumes or where is that actually going?
 
John Stephens
 
So, on the wholesale business, first thing is we exited our mobile 
housing 

having a significant impact on the global 

 

the first point. The second point we are saying is the continued 

 
not only 
pressure on the leg
acy analog services, but a movement towards more 
efficient IP strategic services. So, when the customers move up, sometimes 
they have both services in place, but even after they shut off the legacy 
services, the strategic services oftentimes have more effi
ciency. And so until 
the volumes grow to absorb that, there is a disconnect between those 
revenue sources. But with that being said, we still feel very good about the 

 
our win percentages and our ability to hold on to that business and our 
ability to grow
 
going forward. The biggest first issue with regard to 
wholesale though is the fact that we have decided to get out of some 
business and on the second piece is some of this growing as they have 
transitioned to strategic services to Ethernet and other thing
s. But we will 
continue to be positive. We will continue to be able to compete well in that 
wholesale space.
 

this time. And let me give you some insights into why that would be
 
challenging at this point. There is a difference between whether you do it to 
multi dwelling units or whether you do it to a single home and a single 
residence. So, all of those factors at this stage could mislead folks with 
regard to any kind of factual 
numbers. So we have chosen not to do that. 
But we are just getting started with the fiber to the prem activity. We are 
pleased with it. I can suggest you that we are probably still in the early 
stages of it. But the take rates, the satisfaction rates conti
nue to outperform 
our expectations with our customers.
 
Frank Louthan
 
Okay, great. Thank you.
 
John Stephens
 
And Lori we will take one more question.
 
Operator
 
Very good, that is from James Ratcliffe with Buckingham Research. Please 
go ahead.
 
James Ratcliffe
 
Hi. Thanks for taking the question. I have two on the wireless side, if I 

improvement you are seeing in prepaid churn, just improving credit quality 
or better retention, something el
se going on there. And second, given the 
continued growth in Connected Cars, any insight you can provide around the 
economics around those what ARPUs running and if there are any subsidies 
or revenue shares involved? Thanks.
 
John Stephens
 
So on the prepaid
 
business, there is a couple of things. One, great plan, 
great attention to our customers, but quite frankly, they are right now a 
great network. So they are getting great service with cost efficient plans. 
And we are able to do it because they are paying 
for their own phones. So 

customers converted from the network that they were on the CDMA network 
they are on onto our LTE networks. So they are having a great experience, 

 
Two, we are giving a good pricing. We can do that because they 
are paying for their own phones essentially. So and then our sales team and 
our operations team is working very hard to integrate the quality of our 
networks, our backbone and our cost structu
re.
 

lot to do with these great networks that they are writing on. So I would 
suggest to that. On the Connected Car, there is kind of three relationships I 
think of when I think
 
of that connected car and our revenue side. There is 
one of the wholesale relationship with the auto manufacturer/dealers and 

-
time information, real
-
time information to the 
cars or take it from the cars for whether it woul
d be design, marketing 

wholesale relationship we have with the auto manufacturers. And as we 
continue to develop applications and they continue to develop applications 
and informati
on needs out of that process, we will continue 

 
we are hopeful 
to continue to grow that revenue.
 
The key to that is much of that activity can be done off
-
peak hours. And so 
the auto manufacturers can gather that time and gather that data at times 

s very cost efficient for us to do it. So we can utilize our networks 
when they are somewhat under utilized and they can still a really good 

plan and part of our Mobile Share Va
lue plans has had add
-
on service. We 
are just getting started with that. We are very optimistic about the 
opportunities there. But quite frankly, the cars first are just rolling off. And 
secondly, there are some promotional time and promotional activities 
where 
that capability is available before we sign them up to a retail package. So 
that process is just getting started. We feel very good about it. And I think it 
fits within the overall connected life strategy that our mobility team is 
running.
 
And then l

own the car, but yet wants to utilize that connectivity in their car. And we 
are seeing some utilization of that today and we will continue to see that 
develop. We are optimistic and very jazze
d up, so to speak about the 



going forward in revenue generation and margin generation improvement. 
Lori, I think we have time for one more question.
 
Operator
 
That will be from Tim Horan with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.
 
Tim Horan
 
Thanks a lot. So John, a great job on the financial d
iscipline, so you think 
the wireless expenses is a good run rate here. I know there is a lot of 
moving parts, do you think maybe you would a little light on the marketing 
this quarter or that was an impact then? Can you also just lastly give us 
some data u
sage statistics? Thanks.
 
John Stephens
 
Yes, I am sure, Tim. Well, let me say this, on the margins, there is always 
going to be seasonality and we are always going to have the challenges 
there in our business. We are going to have a much smoother seasonalit
y. 
We may have because of the way we have shifted the business, flip some of 
the pressure quarters and the hiring quarters around. We will have more 
smoother. But we will have additional activities as we get into the holiday 
season with more units and more
 
activities with regards to that. Secondly, 
while we are going to continue to be disciplined with all costs including 
marketing, I would suggest we will continue to market and believe we have 
been effective with our marketing, but have not shut it down. Wi
th regards 
to 

 
Tim what was your last question?
 
Tim Horan
 
Yes, wireless daily usage and where maybe customers are in terms of 
utilization of their existing capacity of?
 
John Stephens
 
Yes, we continue to see data growth per handset to be significant. And i

been running at kind of the 50% year
-
over
-
year increase for a while. With 
regard to the data plans, we are seeing customers a couple of things. We 
continue to see customers go to bigger data plan, some of the 20 gig and 

s helped our service revenues this quarter 
was we continue to see people do some overages even though we gave 

 
we 
gave roll over to our customers to help them manage their plans. They took 
advantage of it. We continued to see some over usage. So we view t
hat 
opportunity to get customers to buy some bigger buckets and move 
themselves out of that stress opportunity. But usage continues to be a 
positive for our revenue opportunities and continues to be something and 
our guys watch very closely. So we keep thi
s high quality service.
 
Tim Horan
 
Thank you.
 
John Stephens
 
Thank you. Thanks Lori. For everyone on the call, I want to thank you for 
being with us today. In closing, let me say this. For the last 3 years, we 
have laid a plan that deployed next 
generation networks, that develops 
some innovative products and services and that has been focused on 
repositioning our customer base. And at the same time, we have been 
focused on cost management. Second quarter results show that this strategy 
is working.
 
We now stand ready to continue this process with our strategic 
investments, in spectrum, in Leap, in Mexico, as well as our pending 
transaction with DIRECTV. We are ready to take advantage of our new 
opportunities as we transform our business and our indu
stry. Thanks again 
for being on the call. And as always, thank you for your interest in AT&T. 
Have a good evening. Thank you very much.

Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the AT&T 
third quarter 2015 earnings call. At this time, all lines are in a listen
-
only 
mode. Later there will be an opportunity for your questions, and instructions 
will be 
begin at that time.
 
I'll now turn the conference over to Senior Vice President, Investor 
Relations, Mike Viola. Please go ahead, sir.

Inc.
 
Okay, thank you, Cathy. Good afternoon, everyone, 
and welcome to our 
third quarter conference call. Thank you for joining us today. With me on the 
call is John Stevens, AT&T's Chief Financial Officer. John is going to provide 
an update with perspective on the quarter, and then we'll follow that with a 
Q&A
 
session. Let me remind you that our earnings material is available on 
the Investor Relations page of AT&T's website, and that's 
ATT.com/investor.relations.
 
But first, I need to call your attention to the Safe Harbor statement before 
we begin. As you guys 
know, it says that there could be some comments 
today that might be forward
-
looking, and as such they're subject to risks 
and uncertainties. Results may differ materially. And additional information 
is available on the Investor Relations page of AT&T's web
site.
 
With that, I'll turn the call over to AT&T's Chief Financial Officer, John 
Stephens, to discuss our financial and operational highlights.
 
John J. Stephens

Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice 
President
 
Thanks, Mike, and hello, everyone. 
Thank you for joining us today and for 
your interest in AT&T. Before we discuss the quarter, I'd like to take a 
moment and do a quick reset of what we have put in place at AT&T. With the 
close of our DTV acquisition, we became a unique U.S. competitor. We 
are 
the first scaled communications and video provider to offer customers fully 
integrated nationwide products. Our focus is on profitable growth, and we 
believe that we have in place the products and the platforms that will enable 
our success.
 
First, you'
re probably familiar with our new operating segments, Business 
Solutions, Entertainment & Internet Services, Consumer Mobility, and 
International. These segments are built on a series of investments that have 
set the stage for a new kind of company. Our ne
twork investments over the 
last three years is unprecedented. At a time when customers value and need 
connectivity more than ever, our integrated high
-
speed wireless and wireline 
IP networks are in place, ready to meet the growing data demand.
 
We invested 
in a deep spectrum position. When you combine the spectrum 
we bought in the AWS auction along with the WCS spectrum we already 
own, we have 40 MHz of spectrum in the pipeline that we can use to meet 
growing customer demand, plus we've added our spectrum fr
om Leap. This 
provides an efficient way to meet the increasing demand for mobile data.
 
We're also investing in next
-
generation software
-
defined networks. We plan 
to virtualize and control more than 75% of our network by 2020 using cloud 
infrastructure and 
SDN.
 
Behind all this is our focus on profitability. Our improving margins are due in 
large part to our ability to reduce costs and manage our customer base, 
including letting our customers manage the smartphone handset cycle. 
Project Agile savings are comi
ng through. Automation and Digital First have 
reduced customer call volumes by an average of 2 million calls a month. 
Simplified offers help as well. So do the simple blocking and tackling efforts 
of expense controls, getting it right the first time, and w
orking capital 
efficiencies.
 
We also are being smarter and growing revenues. We've exited some low
-
margin businesses, such as Global Hubbing. We have seen increasing capital 
efficiencies not just with lower trailing operating expense, but also driving 
lowe
r unit costs as we continue to invest in our world
-
class networks. In 
effect, we are doing more for less. And our expected cost synergies from 
DIRECTV give us even more runway to reduce costs.
 
We are uniquely positioned as a company. No other company has t
he assets 
and capabilities in place that we do. We are confident that our investments 
have positioned us with a sustainable and efficient long
-
term leadership 
position.
 
With that as background, let me cover our consolidated financial summary, 
which is on s
lide four. I'll begin by reminding you that third quarter results 
include DIRECTV operations since our acquisition as of July 25. These results 
exclude the first 24 days of DIRECTV operations in July.
 
Our financial results this quarter provide further supp
ort that our strategy is 
on target. Consolidated revenues, margins, and adjusted earnings all 
delivered solid growth in the quarter, and our cash flows were exceptionally 
strong. In the third quarter, our adjusted EPS was $0.74. That's up nearly 
14% over l
ast year's third quarter. This includes adjustments for mostly 
non
-
cash Cricket network decommissioning and DIRECTV merger
-
related 
costs.
 
The strong growth comes even with earnings pressure from our Mexico 
wireless operations. Consolidated revenues grew to
 
$39.1 billion. That's up 
nearly 19% year over year, mostly due to our acquisition of DIRECTV. But 
we grew revenues even if you exclude DIRECTV. And again, this number 
does not include the first 24 days of DIRECTV revenue, as we are reporting 
under GAAP ac
counting. If you add those revenues to our GAAP number, 
consolidated revenues for the quarter would have been more than $41.2 
billion.
 
Besides DIRECTV, we also had growth from solid gains in our Business 
Solutions segment, including Strategic Business Serv
ices and data and 
strong IP data revenue growth in our Entertainment & Internet Services 
segment.
 
We also had another strong quarter generating cash. Cash from operating 
activities for the quarter totaled almost $11 billion, up more than 20% over 
last year
's third quarter. And free cash flow was $5.5 billion. That brought 
our free cash flow dividend payout ratio to 57% for the year. And when you 
take a look at the last two quarters, you can see that we're delivering the 
financial results that we expected wh
en we started to transform our 
business. Combine the second and third quarters, and you'll see adjusted 
EPS up more than 12%, $20 billion of cash from operations and $10 billion 
of free cash flow, and record Mobility EBITDA service margins in each 
quarter.
 
Those are the kind of financial metrics we are shooting for, and we 
firmly believe we are positioned to keep that rolling.
 
Now let's take a look at our operational highlights, starting with Business 
Solutions on slide five. Our Business Solutions segment 
includes both 
wireless and wireline results from our business customers. Mobility is the 
way business gets done these days, and going to market with a total 
connectivity solution plays to the strengths of our company. We can see the 
benefits of this approa
ch in this quarter. Business wireless and Strategic 
Services revenue growth more than offset declines in legacy wireline 
products. Wireless revenue growth was driven by gains in both wireless 
service and equipment revenue. Margins were an even better story
. Our 
focus on profitable revenue growth and cutting costs from the business 
drove a nearly 300 basis point year
-
over
-
year improvement in EBITDA 
margin.
 
Breaking the segment down further, we saw revenue growth in three of our 
four customer categories, ente
rprise, small business, and the public sector. 
Our business wireline revenues were down due to pressure from legacy 
services, but we continued to see growth stabilization in our wireline data 
revenues. Total data revenues grew for the fourth consecutive qu
arter and 
now comprise nearly 60% of wireline business revenues.
 
Growth in our most advanced data products is outpacing declines in legacy 
data services. Strategic Business Services revenue grew by more than 12% 
year over year. And when you adjust for fore
ign exchange, growth was even 
stronger, coming in at more than 15%.
 
We also have improving year
-
over
-
year wireline small business trends the 
last few quarters, and that continued in the third quarter. Plus, when you 
include Mobility Solutions, we actually 
grew small business revenues. This 
gives you a better idea of how our Business Solutions team is competing and 
winning.
 
Mobility is just one advantage we bring to the business market. We continue 
to drive fiber deeper into our wireline network. We've deplo
yed fiber to 
950,000 new business customer locations. As you can see in our business 
results, we're just beginning to tap this growth opportunity. Our move to 
software
-
defined network architecture is not only allowing us to add 
compelling new services such
 
as NetBond and Network on Demand, but it's 
also helping us reduce cycle times and move to a lower
-
cost capital and 
operation structure.
 
Network on Demand has been met with strong customer response. The 
product allows customers to adjust network bandwidth 
as needed in real
-
time. Today it's available in more than 170 cities, driving improvement in 
cycle times. And we've already signed more than 275 customer deals. 
Business Solutions focus is making the network on demand, the office 
mobile, and the cloud high
ly secure. That's how we're running our business, 
and we are excited by the results.
 
Now let me talk about our Entertainment & Internet Solutions (sic) 
[Services] (11:01) results on slide six. This is basically our former Consumer 
Wireline business and the
 
DIRECTV U.S. operations. Even though we had 
DIRECTV only for part of the quarter, the results reflect the growing revenue 
and increased profitability that we expect to receive. Reported revenue 
almost doubled year over year.
 
But even more dramatic was the
 
improvement in margins. Our EBITDA 
margins came in at more than 22%. That's up more than 800 basis points 
year over year. Essentially, we've converted a quality video business with 
limited scale into an industry leader earning solid margins through our 
DI
RECTV acquisition. And we think there's plenty of room to improve even 
more with the expected cost synergies from the DTV deal.
 
During the past few weeks, we have reached a multiyear agreement with 
Viacom for U
-
verse and DIRECTV subscribers, and we 
believe we are on a 
path for the best content pricing going forward. Our approach is to develop a 
win
-
win situation for both us and the content providers, and I encourage 
them to look at our wireless and broadband assets to widen their 
distributions. Early
 
results have been promising.
 
We are also seeing some early success on the revenue synergies. For 
example, we are selling DIRECTV in virtually all our 2,200 company
-
owned 
stores. The next step is launching certified dealers and online as well as 
ramping up
 
sales in our call centers. It's starting to make an impact. 
DIRECTV net adds picked up shortly after the deal closed and were solid 
throughout the rest of the quarter. That drove 26,000 satellite net adds post 
deal close. We now have more than 25 million 
video subscribers in the U.S. 
It's important that we do this right coming out of the gate. We've been 
holding back much of our cross
-
selling promotions as we train service reps 
and technicians for a premium single
-
service experience, so we will see the 
ben
efit of those strategies impact future quarters.
 
As expected, U
-
verse video subscribers declined in the quarter. Net adds 
dropped with fewer promotions and shifting our focus to the lower content 
cost DIRECTV platform. We added 192,000 IP broadband custome
rs in the 
quarter, as migrations from our DSL base continued to slow. U
-
verse video 
losses also put some pressure on broadband numbers due to our high 
attachment rates. But we are confident we can work through this as our 
single
-
service experience for broa
dband and satellite is rolled out.
 
As we said, it's early in our integration of DIRECTV. We don't even have a 
full quarter of results, yet our integration efforts are on or ahead of target, 
and early results indicate this deal will prove to be everything w
e thought it 
would be and more.
 
Now let's move to our Mobility results on slide seven. AT&T's Mobility 
operations are now divided between the Business Solutions and the 
Customer Wireless segment. That information is in the investor briefing and 
stat profil
e. For comparison purposes, the company is also providing 
supplemental information for its total domestic wireless operations.
 
Let's start first with the total domestic wireless operations financials. We 
have a compelling value proposition, great network, 
superior customer 
service, and fair pricing. All this sometimes gets lost in the competitive 
noise. Our focus is to provide the best customer experience while increasing 
profitability and not just chase customer counts. Our third quarter results 
drive that
 
point home. We had our highest ever wireless service EBITDA 
margins at 49.4%. Our Consumer Mobility business helped drive that with 
service margins of more than 50%. AT&T Next sales are a big part of that 
success, but we also have been very aggressive in 
taking costs out of the 
business and increasing efficiencies in our Cricket operations.
 
Total wireless revenues were flat year over year. Lower year
-
over
-
year 
smartphone upgrade volumes impacted equipment revenues, and Mobile 
Share Value plans did the same
 
to service revenues. As expected, with most 
of the conversion to Mobile Share Value plans behind us, we saw increasing 
stability with our service revenues, which were essentially flat with second 
quarter levels.
 
We also continued to see steady growth of A
T&T Next and Mobile Share 
Value plans. About two
-
thirds of our postpaid smartphone base is on no
-
subsidy pricing, with more than 40% on Next. That gives us substantial 
opportunity to continue to grow equipment revenue as these customers 
upgrade their smart
phones. For the quarter, nearly 80% of the smartphone 
sales were on Next or BYOD. We also continue to see growing phone
-
only 
ARPU plus Next, which increased by nearly 5% year over year. We also 
turned in another strong net add quarter as postpaid tablets, 
Cricket, and 
the connected car drove our highest net adds in nearly five years. Those 
details are on slide eight.
 
Total net adds came in at 2.5 million, as we continue to see the impact of 
our Cricket acquisition and connected car strategy. The company add
ed 
289,000 postpaid subscribers with about 620,000 tablets and computing 
devices. We also had a record 1.6 million connected device net adds. Most of 
these were connected cars, where we added about 1 million.
 
But perhaps the biggest story in the quarter ha
d to be our continued 
strength in premium prepaid. This has been a remarkable turnaround story 
for us. We added 466,000 prepaid voice subscribers in the quarter after 
losing subscribers in the year
-
ago third quarter. These subscriber gains 
came from both C
ricket and our GoPhone products.
 
We also completed our Cricket network conversion in the quarter. We are 
seeing Cricket deliver great ARPUs. In fact, the ARPU from Cricket 
smartphones net adds is nearly $10 more than our postpaid feature phone 
ARPU losses.
 
We continue to grow our branded smartphone base. We added 
1 million in the quarter. Our added voice subscribers were also positive in 
the quarter.
 
Total churn was down year over year thanks to lower prepaid churn, even 
with shutting down the Cricket netwo
rk. Postpaid churn for the quarter was 
up year over year, as we focus on higher
-
value subscribers. However, year
-
to
-
date postpaid churn is running at 1.06%, just slightly higher than last 
year's best ever full
-
year churn of 1.04%.
 
Here's another way to loo
k at churn. We are adding premium prepaid 
subscribers whose ARPU is higher and subsidy costs are lower than postpaid 
feature phone subscribers who have the highest postpaid churn. And our 
success in the prepaid market is resulting in improvement in total c
hurn. 
Cricket gives us a quality prepaid offering for the more value
-
conscious 
customer, same great network, quality customer service, and the flexibility 
prepaid delivers with subscriber acquisition costs that are much lower than 
our postpaid voice.
 
Now l
et's look at our international operations. That information is on slide 
nine. Our international segment provides wireless services in Mexico and 
satellite entertainment services in Latin America. Let's start with Mexico. We 
are taking the first steps in ou
r investment cycle in Mexico and pushing hard 
to replicate the same great 4G LTE network experience there that we have in 
the United States. So far we're making great progress. By the end of the 
third quarter, we've already covered about 29 million people 
with our 4G LTE 
network. And as of today, we now cover more than 30 million. This puts us 
on plan to reach 40 million by the end of the year and provide a high
-
quality 
platform to sell on.
 
Mexico's financials reflect our network investment and the work bei
ng done 
to bring IUSACELL and Nextel's operations together. This is the heavy lifting 
of the wireless business, but we have done it before, and we are confident 
we can do it again successfully.
 
We're also confident that we will grow market share. We have a
 
great 
leadership team in place and a solid plan not only to deploy the highest 
quality network but deliver a superb customer experience as well. It's a 
great opportunity, and the potential synergies of a 400 million POP North 
American calling area make it
 
even better than we first imagined.
 
Our Latin American DIRECTV operations are showing solid growth on a local 
currency basis. But foreign exchange rates, including our decision to adopt 
the SIMADI rate in Venezuela, are pressuring our results. Revenues, A
RPUs, 
and margins are all pressured by FX, and subscriber results are being 
hampered by challenging economies in the region. But importantly, our Latin 
American businesses have cash flows that allow us the opportunity to better 
position our operations. We'
ll continue to work through these headwinds and 
work on operational efficiencies in Latin America.
 
Now let's move to consolidated margins on slide 10. Our focus on profitable 
growth is clearly seen in our consolidated margins. Adjusted consolidated 
operati
ng margins came in at 20.3% in the quarter. This was a dramatic 
improvement over the year
-
ago third quarter, and adjusted EBITDA margin 
was nearly 200 basis points higher than a year ago.
 
There were several reasons for this improvement. First, the DIRECTV 
acquisition increased the profitability of our pay
-
TV business, but just as 
important was our focused sales approach in wireless and U
-
verse video. 
Project Agile savings also are coming in ahead of plan. Our simplified offers 
and increased efforts to take 
care of customers on the first call has produced 
results. Call volumes in our Mobility centers continue to drop, down an 
average of 2 million calls a month when compared to the year
-
ago third 
quarter.
 
We also have been highly effective with our cost optimi
zation efforts. That 
has helped drive down costs for access and in our supply chain. We're also 
keeping an eye on the force by minimizing outsourcing expenses. Overall 
force has been managed through voluntary retirement programs, normal 
attrition, and norm
al reductions in operations.
 
Trailing operating expenses from capital investments also were down year 
over year. We also have been highly efficient with our capital spending and 
unit costs are decreasing, essentially doing more for less. All this adds up, 
and DIRECTV gives us an opportunity to expand margins. We have our 
target to get to $2.5 billion or more in savings. We already are realizing 
some of that in our content and supplier relationships. We really like our 
momentum here, and we are confident we 
can continue to expand margins 
and cut costs, even with pressure from our international operations.
 
We also believe healthy cash flows are fundamental to our success. Let's 
look at slide 11 for those details. We continue to execute and deliver strong 
cash 
flows. In fact, we are increasing our free cash flow guidance for the 
year. In the third quarter, cash from operations totaled $10.8 billion. That's 
our best cash generation in 12 quarters. And we generated $26.7 billion in 
cash year to date. Capital expen
ditures totaled $5.3 billion, about the same 
as last year's third quarter. Free cash flow was $5.5 billion and $12.8 billion 
year to date.
 
In terms of the uses of cash, dividends totaled $2.4 billion, which gives us a 
dividend payout ratio of 44% for the q
uarter and 57% for the full year.
 
Our net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was 2.28 times, which was better 
than our original expectations. Our focus is on maintaining a strong balance 
sheet. We paid down more than $5 billion in debt early, and we still have 
more than $6 billion of cash on hand. These strong cash flows are a 
fundamental part of our business. This gives us the financial strength to 
invest in our business, reduce debt, and return substantial value to our 
shareholders.
 
Now let me close with a qui
ck summary and updated guidance on slide 12 
before we get to your questions. First, let's address guidance. We are 
increasing our full
-
year EPS outlook to the $2.68 to $2.74 range. We also 
now expect free cash flow to be in the $15 billion range or better 
this year. 
All other full
-
year guidance is reaffirmed. Our focus on profitability is a big 
reason we're able to do this. In the quarter, we saw growing revenues, 
expanding margins, and double
-
digit adjusted EPS growth, but just as 
important was our ability
 
to generate cash from our business. Cash from 
operations was strong and free cash flow gave us excellent dividend 
coverage.
 
We are seeing positive signs in our largest segment, Business Solutions. 
Customers appreciate our integrated solutions approach and
 
are migrating 
to our newest software
-
defined network services. We also saw our highest 
ever wireless service EBITDA margins, with an incredible turnaround story in 
prepaid unfolding. And we closed the DTV acquisition in the third quarter, 
and the integrat
ion process is on target and positioned to exceed 
expectations.
 
This is an exciting time for us. We believe we have the pieces in place to 
redefine our business and our industry.
 
With that, I will turn it back to Mike so we can get to your questions.

Certainly, that will come from Amir Rozwad

please.
 
Amir Rozwadowski

Barclays Capital, Inc.
 
Thank you very much. I wanted to touch upon the commentary around cash 
flow, John, if I may. If we take a look at your raised outlook for the year, it 
does seem as though ther
e's a little bit of a tempering in the cash 
generation in the fourth quarter. I would love to hear about what you're 
spending priorities are, and more specifically how to think about the longer
-
term cash generation capabilities of the joint entity.
 
John J.
 
Stephens 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice 
President
 
Great, Amir, a couple things. One is there's always some seasonality in the 
fourth quarter with the holiday sales in our wireless business with the 
purchase of handsets and so forth. So 
there's always some seasonality, as 
you would find also with our wireline, particularly our large business 
segment. Also, we generally have larger tax payments at the end of the year 
than we do earlier on, so those are the things that are impacting us. But
 
I 
would tell you if you do a year
-
over
-
year comparison to where we're at and 
what we're projecting with regard to the $15 billion range or better, I think 
you'll see that we're continuing to have really good cash flows throughout 
the rest of this year.
 
Se
condly, with regard to future years, we would stand by what we've said 
earlier. That is that we expect free cash flow to provide us with a dividend 
payout ratio that's in the 70%. We're not moving away from that. We're not 
shying away from that at all, and
 
expect that to continue to be the case. 
We're certainly proud of these results and glad that we exceeded what we 
had promised, but we're going to be careful and prudent in predicting our 
results as we go forward. But we're real excited about where we stan
d and 
the future cash generation of this business.
 
Amir Rozwadowski

Barclays Capital, Inc.
 
Thank you very much. And then if I may, a follow
-
up here in thinking object 
the joint entity moving forward, particularly when it comes to the potential 
opportunit
ies with positioning the company and targeting your end markets. 
At your analyst update, you had highlighted that there are areas for 
potential cross
-
synergies, revenue synergies and opportunities. Specifically, 
I'm thinking about the 15 million DIRECTV ho
useholds that don't have 
access to AT&T Wireless services. I was wondering if you can give us some 
color in terms of how you plan on going after that opportunity and how we 
should think about leveraging the breadth of the full portfolio to target areas 
whe
re you may have one subscriber on one service and not on the other.
 
John J. Stephens 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice 
President
 
Right, let me take that quickly. First of all, the first revenue synergy that 
we've really gone after and we've
 
seen good success and, quite frankly, 
we're very excited about the results is in the cross
-
selling of DIRECTV as a 
satellite product in our company
-
owned stores. We have about 2,300 
company
-
owned stores, and virtually all of them are actively selling 
DIRE
CTV now. And some of them never sold a video product before, so we 
had to do some training and some learning. But what we found as we came 
through the quarter, we were able to sell more and more out of those 
stores. And we got very optimistic about it, and
 
it gives us optimism for the 
fourth quarter. So that sales effort and that first line of synergy, if you will, 
from revenue opportunities from the retail distribution chain is working, and 
we're real optimistic about it.
 
The second one with regard to cros
s
-
selling DIRECTV and the wireless 
customers, we needed to go through a process of making sure our privacy 
policies and a bunch of other administrative policies were lined up 
consistently, so customers had a seamless experience and an easy 
experience. We'v
e done all that, and I think we've now got in place one of 
our call centers to service those customers on an integrated basis, and we're 
moving forward with starting to sell that.
 
Based on the really great news we saw from the retail chain, we're really 
op
timistic about seeing those sales results unfold in the fourth quarter and 
next year.
 
The last thing is our service technicians have been installing broadband for 
us or U
-
verse for us, but they haven't been installing DIRECTV. So we've 
been putting them th
rough a training program, and we're expecting that to 
roll out, the first set of technicians to roll out after fully trained on installing 
satellite in the home, in probably November or so, the early part of 
November, such that we will then be able to sell
 
a single truck roll 
installation for broadband and video. We're very excited about that. It will be 
a measured approach. We're going to have to 

 
we don't have everybody 
trained on the first day. But we're excited about what that will bring and 
think that
 
will bring some not only good performance in the fourth quarter, 
but quite frankly, really look forward to that kind of performance, positive 
performance and impact next year. So that's the way we're thinking about 
some of those things, Amir.

Okay, great. If we could focus a little bit on the guidance, first of all, John, is 
it possible for you to give us where we are on a year
-
to
-
date basis in terms 
of the $2.68 to $2.74? And then maybe what's driving the chang
e in terms 
of is it just wireless margins that they were definitely ahead of where we 
were, or are you realizing synergies faster or if there are any other moving 
parts would be great? Thanks.
 
John J. Stephens 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive V
ice 
President
 
Yeah. So we're at the $2.09 mark today, and that was ahead of our prior 
plans. As you know, the $0.74 was ahead 

 
I'll say it was ahead of our most 
recent plans. That has really been driven by cost efficiency. And it's driven 
by savings acros
s the board, whether it's a lower number of calls into the 
call centers, whether it's the really top
-
notch performance of our Digital First 
initiatives, whether it's the streamlining of our installation process through 
our, what we call Project Halo or Hig
h Automation Low Overhead process, 
whether it's the software
-
defined networks. All of those things, whether it's 
just blocking and tackling, taking calls into the call center and getting 
answers right the first time, all of those things, all of those thing
s are driving 
cost savings.
 
And we have seen some better performance, as I mentioned, in our Business 
Solutions. Our Business Solutions team is really doing well in a tough 
economy, particularly in the enterprise and the public sector space, but 
really, re
ally well in the small business space. And that gives us optimism. 
As we mentioned with wireless, we're seeing growth in that area. But we are 
seeing the acceptance of our Network on Demand, our NetBond, our 
software
-
defined networks all moving customers i
n a positive direction. So 
it's all of those things giving us optimism for the fourth quarter. With that 
being said, certainly wireless and its performance goes without question that 
it is helping drive earnings performance.

Jefferies

Hey, guys. Thanks. John, maybe just to dig a little bit into the churn 
commentary, your thoughts on whether or not we're seeing a spike up in 
involuntary. And then how does that pace out if we look at the feature phone 
subs? Are those the ones that I'
m assuming most at risk there?
 
And then secondly, just on the ARPU side, I know last quarter you benefited 
from year
-
over
-
year easy comps. I'm assuming that as we get into the 
fourth quarter, we should restart that trajectory and year
-
over
-
year declines 
ge
tting better?
 
John J. Stephens 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice 
President
 
Let me take them separately, Mike. On the churn, first and foremost, yes, 
the feature phone churn is hitting us and having an impact on us, and those 
are decisions w
e made not to chase those customers. Can't make the math 
work on not only the pricing for those customers but the impact throughout 
our base. But secondly, we believe that we're picking that up and showing 
tremendous improvement in the prepaid space with C
ricket. So we are 
seeing total churn come down, which I think is really important.
 
With regard to ARPUs, we did have an easier comparison in second quarter 
of 2015 to second quarter of 2014 because of some promotional activities 
that took place in second q
uarter of 2014. But we've seen stabilization in our 
ARPUs and in our total service revenues, so we feel optimistic about the 
business going forward. But once again, we're going to be focused on 
profitable growth, not just chasing customer counts or specifi
c targets. We're 
going to really be focused on just getting the most profits out of the 
business.

Hi, guys. Thanks. So first on EPS, should we be thinking for 2016 of the mid

single digit or better off of the $2.71 midpoint, or shoul
d we be thinking 
about it a different way given the DTV deal? Thanks.
 
John J. Stephens 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice

Phil, let's look at it this way. We're not changing our guidance for 2016 going 
forward, so the mid
-
single
-
di
git growth rate is still good.
 
Philip A. Cusick

JPMorgan Securities LLC
 
The $2.71 is the...
 
John J. Stephens

Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice

I'm not going to refer to 

 
it's still good even with this adjusted 
guidance.
 
Philip A. Cusick 
-
 
JPMorgan Securities LLC
 
Okay, so $2.71 is the right starting point. Thanks. And then on Project Agile, 
can you give us an update on what the overall cost
-
cutting level is here and 
how we should think about that pacing in the ne
xt few years?
 
John J. Stephens 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice 
President
 
I'd say this. We're going to expect it to continue growing over the next few 
years. What we had said originally was that we were shooting for $3 billion 
of cost savi
ngs. I would suggest to you that we're probably somewhere 
between a third and a half of the way there, and that we plan to at least get 
there, get to that total target or exceed it. And then I'd point to the $2.5 
billion of targeted DTV merger synergies. A
nd certainly based on what we 
know now, we expect to see us get there or exceed those. So those would 
be the two points.
 
I would hope that we could exceed the Project Agile targets based on the 
progress we've made so far. These efforts do take time and inv
estment, and 
we've been spending that time and investment over the last couple years to 
get here. We're seeing the results pay off. We're going to keep our focus in 
this direction, but we would hope to be able to exceed it.

Simon Flannery

Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
 
Okay, thank you very much. Good evening. John, can you talk a little bit 
about the video momentum? And you went through some of the channel 
changes here. On a net basis you did have subscriber losses, but I think you 
said before that you're hoping to grow 
your video subscribers over time. So 
perhaps you can just take us through the quarter and you showed some 
good gross adds on the DTV side. What's going on there with churn, and 
when do you expect to return to positive video adds? Thanks.
 
John J. Stephens 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice 
President
 
Simon, good question. I think we had a slide on this with a chart that can 
tell you what was going on. Prior to the deal, there was some real pressure 
in the satellite video area. Performance was l
ess than it had been last year. 
And then as you see it coming out after the merger and after we started 
rolling out sales in the stores, you could see that we really picked up the 
trend, and we expect that to continue. Secondly, with the rollout this quart
er 
of the, if you will, one
-
truck roll or single
-
service experience where we can 
install TV and broadband at the same time, we not only expect the satellite 
TV to pick up, but we also expect the broadband, IP broadband, to pick up 
because people buy those 
things together.
 
And so we're hopeful that we're going to see 

 
we'll be able to show you 
some improvements and trend improvements continuing off of the third 
quarter in the fourth quarter. I won't make any predictions about specific 
levels, but we are opt
imistic with what we've seen so far. We think the 
trends are headed in the right direction. And we think the slide that we put 
together that shows that differentiation between 2014 and 2015 will give 
you good insight into that.
 
Simon Flannery

Morgan Stan

And the U
-
verse decline, is that run rate or is that all the gross adds shifting 
to DIRECTV, or is that a churn issue as well?
 
John J. Stephens 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice 
President
 
U
-
verse is a couple things. One, certa
inly the lower
-
cost platform has been 
our first choice for net adds. Two, because of our focus on profitability, we 
really got away from promotional pricing, and those customers who were 
cost
-
sensitive just had a propensity to churn. When you first put tho
se steps 
in place, we saw a little bit of higher churn in the second quarter. We're 
seeing a little bit higher in the third quarter because of that disciplined 
approach. But I would tell you that I think we still have a solid, very good, 
very high
-
quality 
customer base in U
-
verse, and we're certainly looking to 
continue to serve those customers with the best products and services. I 
think we're focused on lowering churn and keeping those customers quite 
satisfied.

Thank you, and our next question is from Brett Feldman with Goldman 
Sachs. Please go ahead.
 
Brett Joseph Feldman 
-
 
Goldman Sachs & Co.
 
Just a 
quick point of clarification and then a question. You talk about the 
fulfillment accounting methodology change in the slide. Is that your previous 
methodology change from August, or was there something new?
 
John J. Stephens 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer & Seni
or Executive Vice 
President
 
Brett, that's the same change. And if I could, before you ask your question, 
let me give you guys some insights on it. On a year
-
over
-
year basis in this 
quarter, the fulfillment accounting had about a $0.02 impact. That is the 
d
ifferential between applying it to DIRECTV and U
-
verse this quarter as 
opposed to just applying it to the U
-
verse product last third quarter of 2014, 
and so that did give us some help.
 
Additionally in this quarter, I want to point out. We had about $0.01 o
f help 
from the CAF [Connect America Fund] funding activity that went on and 
what we applied for. By the same token, we had about $0.01 of hurt or 
pressure from the Mexico operations that we didn't have last year. And if 
you look at our income tax expense,
 
except for setting aside anything that 
we treated otherwise, there's about $0.02 of income tax pressure, EPS 
pressure from income taxes. So when you look at the fulfillment accounting 
and the other unique items that occurred, they balance off with the CAF
 
funding and fulfillment accounting generating about $0.03 of benefits, and 
Mexico and the income tax was generating about $0.03 of pressure. So we 
treated those all as going 

 
because they're going to be going forward, 
because they're going to be continui
ng, I want to make sure I pointed that 
out.
 
With that being said, Brett, I interrupted you before you got to ask your 
question. I apologize.
 
Brett Joseph Feldman 
-
 
Goldman Sachs & Co.
 
No, that was helpful. The question is we have a lot of new data points a
nd 
disclosures that we had fun modeling tonight. But one of the things that we 
see here is we have video ARPU and we have IP broadband ARPU trends in 
your new Entertainment segment. And I guess as you think about your 
strategy going forward, your bundling 
strategy, do you have any guidance 
you can offer us to think about the right way to think of the trajectory of 
those two key items because they're so critical to the revenue outlook for 
that segment?
 
John J. Stephens 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Exec
utive Vice 
President
 
I think we're going to be looking to continuing to protect and improve on the 
trends that we've seen from growing those ARPUs. But likewise, with these 
assets that we have in place, I would suggest to you that our ability to 
capture th
e market, we're in a very good position to capture the market now 
that we have video where we had broadband before without any video, and 
now that we have broadband where DIRECTV had video but didn't have 
broadband before. So I want to suggest to you that 
we are going to look for 
profitable growth and focus on that, but we are excited. We are positive 
about the fact that in some of those cases, we have some growing ARPUs.
 
Brett Joseph Feldman 
-
 
Goldman Sachs & Co.
 
So just to be clear, it sounds like you're 
really excited about the opportunity 
to add more customer or more revenue generating units. That's going to be 
a big piece of how we think about shaping revenue growth through that 
segment.
 
John J. Stephens 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice
 
President
 
We are very much 

 
we're very excited about the ability to add customers, 
absolutely. I don't want to suggest that we're not going to focus on 
profitable customers; certainly we are. But we're very excited about the 
opportunities. I'll go back t
o the cross
-
selling opportunities. I go back to 

 
we've got high
-
quality video products, and we've got a high
-
quality wireless 
network and high
-
quality broadband capabilities, and they have capacity in 
all of them. And so that's a great way to expand your 
profits, by expanding 
the customers on those investments that you've already completed.

Thank you. Our next question is from David Barden with Bank of America. 
Go ahead, please.
 
David William Barden 
-
 
Bank of America Merrill Lynch
 
Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. I guess two if I could. Just first, 
John, a little bit following up o
n that question, just in terms of looking at the 
new way that AT&T is presenting itself to the marketplace, should we be 
looking at modeling the wireless business separately and the consumer 
business as giving us two very unique pictures of two very unique
 
businesses, or is this really just AT&T Wireless the way it's always been run 
and we really should just be thinking about dividing it between the two 
pieces? That would be the first one.
 
And the second one is on CapEx. There are so many now new parts of t
he 
business. Could you give us how CapEx is now being allocated between the 
Latin America, Mexico, and the domestic business units, and how we should 
think about all those different pieces trending? Thanks.
 
John J. Stephens 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer & Seni
or Executive Vice 
President
 
So a couple things. One, David, for investor and analyst ease, we've 
provided total wireless and then provided the consumer wireless, the ability 
to get to the business wireless, and we've tried to be very upfront with 
regard to
 
our financial presentation. So hopefully we've been successful with 
that. But we tried to do that to make sure you had that information. Two, I 
would suggest to you that as you look at it, the margins and the EBITDAs 
and profitabilities are 

 
they are cer
tainly different but they're not materially 
different. They don't significantly skew one way or the other. So I'd just 
make that observation for you.
 
With regard to how you model, I'll leave that to you guys' modeling. I can 
tell you the way we focused on 
it is what the business relationships we're 
selling and what our consumer relationships we're selling, and that's how we 
focused on it. But I think the information is there to do it either way. And I 
think it's going to be a matter of what you're most comf
ortable with. As we 
go forward and we see the platform we built with connected devices start 
showing more growth even than it already has, it will be beneficial for 
everyone to have this split.
 
With regard to CapEx, I won't get into specific dollars on a q
uarterly basis, 
but I'll give you these insights. On DTV Latin America, our Latin America 
properties, I would expect that they will be generally self
-
sufficient; that the 
cash flows that they generate will be self
-
sufficient to cover their CapEx 
needs. I w
ould suggest to you if we have customer growth opportunities, 
we'll be prudent about that and make sure that we don't miss out on a good 
customer. But generally speaking, it's going to be self
-
sufficient from a cash 
perspective.
 
On Mexico, I would suggest 
to you that the $3 billion we announced some 
months ago with regard to the build
-
out is still a good number. We've 
started on that process. I won't tell you that every POP, every 4G LTE POP 
costs the same amount to create. Some of the networks were more 
ad
vanced, and so some of the earlier achievement may be at a more 
efficient cost, unit cost. But I would suggest to you that $3 billion is still a 
good number.
 
And then we'll continue to invest, albeit at a slower rate, because we've built 
the 
platforms out. We'll continue to invest in fiber, in wireless capacity, and 
in success
-
based capital for DIRECTV 

 
for our satellite video product, much 
in the same way you would have seen us in the past taking into account the 
fact that the ramp
-
up in Cap
Ex for VIP is now behind us. We've gotten to 

 
we're 950,000 business customer locations passed with fiber. We committed 
to 1 million. We'll get to the 1 million, but that's the only piece that isn't 
done.

Thank you. Our next question will come from Jeff Kvaal with Nomura. Go 
ahead, please.
 
Jeffrey Kvaal 
-
 
Nomura Securities Internatio
nal, Inc.
 
Yes, thank you all very much. I was hoping that we could spend a bit more 
time talking about churn. It seems as though there are some natural feature 
phone issues that are on the postpaid side anyway. Prepaid is faring quite 
well. Could you help 
us understand if we should be expecting more of that 
across the industry? Is this an AT&T
-
specific item that will stick us with for a 
few quarters, or how we should see that?
 
And then secondly, I'm wondering on the DIRECTV synergies. What might be 
the firs
t opportunity that you would have to update us on whether you are 
on or ahead of plan for that $2.5 billion? Thank you.
 
John J. Stephens 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice 
President
 
Sure. On the feature phone phenomenon, I would tell you tha
t yes, our base 
of feature phones continues to get smaller. So over time, we'll lessen the 
impact this has on our churn.
 
Secondly, Jeff, I would leave it to you guys to talk about it or to decide 
whether others in the industry are taking this approach. It 
appears to us 
from where we see customers moving around that some of the other carriers 
are not taking the same approach, and they're focused more on customer 
counts than they are necessarily on the profitability of the customers. But I 
think you would be 
the better judge of figuring that out. And I say that 
based on the offers I see that we are dealing with and the noise in the 
market.
 
On the $2.5 billion, I think first and foremost, you'll see it in our results. But 
with regard to updating you, I think we
'll continue to update you on the 
process like we've done today where we talked about how the retail stores 
are generating sales exceeding our expectations, how the single
-
truck roll is 
going to start rolling out November, those kinds of things. And I thin
k you'll 
see us also update you like we did with the Viacom announcement where we 
basically said that we're going to get best
-
in
-
industry pricing for our 
platform. And so that would imply that we are getting to or meeting or 
exceeding our synergy targets.
 
With regard to specifically reporting on the $2.5 billion number, I don't 
expect to be doing that the rest of this year or early next year because we 
are still in the midst of really getting it done, and we're more focused on 
getting it done than we are on
 
reporting out on what it is.

Hi, thanks for taking the 
questions, two if I could. First, going back to the 
2016 guidance where you described improving free cash flow, I was curious 
if that relates back to the free cash flow guidance in August. Or does that 
now refer to the updated free cash flow guidance for 2
015?
 
John J. Stephens

That applied to the free cash flow guidance of $13 billion or better.
 
Michael I. Rollins 
-
 
Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)
 
Okay. And then secondly, can you just talk 
about in wireless how you're 
thinking about device installments versus the possibility of using leases as 
an alternative financing mechanism for customers, and how you see the 
environment evolving competitively for your mobile smartphone customers? 
Thanks.
 
John J. Stephens 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice 
President
 
Mike, good question. First and foremost, with regard to installment plan 
versus a lease, we certainly have the financial capability and wherewithal to 
manage either one, to do ei
ther one, and we're open to it. But quite frankly, 
right now our customers seem quite pleased with the installment program. 
And simply put, they seem to like it because at the end of their term, they 
own the phone. And the phones have continued use and fun
ctionality for 
them, and they continue to use that. And to some extent, we're seeing a 
side of that from this continued use of bring your own device activities in our 
company where people are bringing in devices that they already own and 
hooking them up to
 
our network.
 
But from a company perspective, it's more of a decision, and Ralph de la 
Vega and Glenn Lurie and the team follow it really closely. It's more about 
what the customers want. And if we see that the customers are going to 
want that program, we'
ll certainly consider 

 
we certainly have the capability 
to do it. But right now we believe that the customers' satisfaction comes 
from that ability to own the phone at the end of that agreed
-
to term, and 
they feel real comfortable about that. And quite fr
ankly, the difference in 
price I don't think is measurable from a lease to the 

 
depending upon what 
situation you have. But when you get down to the real costs of it, it seems 
like it's worked out well for us by doing the installment plan.

James M. Ratcliffe

The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.
 
Great, thanks for taking the question, two if I could. First on wireless and 
just following up, broa
dly do you see value in actually selling the phone to 
the customer? In other words, does it matter whether somebody gets their 
new iPhone from you or orders it from Apple and it sits on their books?
 
And secondly on broadband, a couple quarters now where yo
u're overall 
losing customers. Can you just give us a little insight on what the trends are 
in DSL and particularly where those losses are coming? Are those people in 
areas where you don't offer U
-
verse, or is it additional migration over to U
-
verse in are
as where you do offer it? Thanks.
 
John J. Stephens 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice 
President
 
Sure. On the value side of customers, it's more about being able to provide 
in the stores a full scope customer experience and take care of all t
heir 
needs. That's what we're concerned about. From a perspective of 

 
if they 
buy the phones somewhere else and bring it to us, we're thrilled with 
serving them in that way. We don't have the cost of handling the phone or 
we don't quite frankly have the c
ost of financing the phone either on an 
installment plan or through a subsidized program. So we're open to it. Right 
now on the equipment installment program that Apple has, they sent us a 
high number of phones through that program, and that's fine. We lov
e to 
serve our customers that way. And if that's how they choose to buy the 
phones through Apple and Apple finances them, that's something we can 
definitely work with. So it's really more about what does the customer want, 
and how we make sure that we prov
ide choices and services to make it easy 
for our customers.
 
With regard to our broadband trends and specifically in DSL, the first 
comment I'd make to you is over the last few years, the real trend has been 
a migration from DSL to IP broadband. And that's 
been something that 
we've encouraged ourselves, and we're beginning to complete that process 
or near completion where the DSL customers we have left is a much lower 
percentage that have IP broadband capabilities from us. So we are through 
that migration pr
ocess.
 
And then secondly, they don't have television in these areas, or I should say 
we didn't have a video offering. These were generally out of the U
-
verse 
footprint, but now we do. And now we'll be able to provide them with a video 
offering through DIRE
CTV, and we're very pleased with that. So we are 
hopeful that now this nationwide video service will help us in improving our 
overall broadband positioning. But particularly our U
-
verse broadband 
footprint where we have the higher speeds and where customer
s generally 
buy video and broadband together, we now can sell that together. So that's 
how we're thinking about it. That's how we look to it.
 
I'm going to tell you. I think on the consumer side we're down into the 2 
million range on total DSL customers. Th
at's not I think the exact number. It 
will be on the stat profile. But I would suggest to you it has changed 
dramatically over the course of four or five years, where it used to be 90%
-
plus of our broadband base and now it's a much lower percentage. So we'
ve 
gone through that migration not completely, but almost completely.

With that, I want to thank all of you for being on the call today, and I'll just 
give you a few closing comments before we go. The third quarter clearly 
delivered on our transformation st
rategy. We saw double
-
digit growth in our 
key financial metrics, including another outstanding free cash flow quarter.
 
The integration of DIRECTV is also on track. We expect to meet or beat our 
$2.5 billion cost synergy target, and we're just beginning to 
unleash 
potential promotional activities to drive bundled sales. You can see our 
increased confidence in the guidance update, where we raised our adjusted 
EPS and free cash flow expectations for the year. We believe this is just the 
beginning. We are posit
ioned as a unique competitor and the first scaled 
communications and video provider to offer fully
-
integrated nationwide 
products, and we fully expect to increase our momentum as we go forward.
 
Thanks again for being on the call. On your way home tonight, 
please don't 
text and drive. Remember, it can wait. And as always, thank you for your 
interest in AT&T and have a good evening.

Welcome to the AT&T Third Quarter 2019 Earnings conference call. At this 
time, all participant phone lines are in a listen
-
only mode. Later, there will 
be an opportunity for your questions. [Operator Instructions] As I reminder, 
this 
conference is being recorded.
 
I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Michael Viola, 
Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
 
Michael Viola
 
Thank you, and good morning, everyone, and welcome to our third quarter 
confer
ence call. I'm Mike Viola, Head of Investor Relations for AT&T. And 
joining me on the call today is Randall Stephenson, AT&T's Chairman and 
CEO; and John Stephens, AT&T's Chief Financial Officer. We'll begin with our 
2019 progress and our third quarter res
ults, but we want to spend most of 
our time today on the 3 year guidance and capital allocation plans that we 
announced this morning, then we'll take your questions.
 
Before we begin, I want to call your attention to our safe harbor statement. 
It says that 
some of the comments today may be forward
-
looking. As such, 
they're subject to risks and uncertainties, results may differ materially and 
additional information is available on the Investor Relations website. I also 
want to remind you that we're in the qui
et period for the FCC's Spectrum 
Auction 103, so we can't answer any questions about that today. And as 
always, our earnings materials are available on the Investor Relations page 
of the AT&T website. That includes the news release, investor briefing, 8
-
K,
 
et cetera.
 
And so with that, I'll turn the call over to Randall Stephenson.
 
Randall Stephenson
 
Okay. Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. On 
Slide 3, you'll see some of this listed. Last November, we laid out our 2019 
commitmen
ts and we challenged the team to deliver, and they have.
 
The punchline for the quarter is that we remain on target to meet every 
single objective for the year. We said leverage would be around 2.5 times by 
year
-
end, and we're on track to hit that target. W
e told you that full year 
EPS would grow in the low single digits, and we're checking that box.
 
We said we'd generate $26 billion of free cash flow, and now we're tracking 
to $28 billion. We said we would remain very active on the portfolio front, 
evaluati
ng and executing opportunities to monetize $6 billion to $8 billion in 
non
-
core assets, and we have. Our current forecast is to realize $14 billion 
by year
-
end.
 
 
We said that our wireless business would return to top line growth, and it 
has. Year
-
to
-
date, 
wireless service revenues are up nearly 2%. We 
committed to stabilizing Entertainment Group EBITDA despite the DIRECTV 
top line pressures, and through 3 quarters, Entertainment Group EBITDA is 
growing. And we needed to do all of this while integrating Warn
erMedia, 
hitting our synergy targets and introducing several new services.
 
So across the board, we're positioned to meet or exceed every commitment 
for the year. In a few minutes, I'll cover our 3 year plan, and you'll begin to 
understand why I feel good a
bout meeting those commitments as well. But 
before we get into that, let me turn it over to John, and he'll go deeper into 
the quarter. So John?
 
John Stephens
 
Thanks, Randall. When looking at our third quarter, adjusted EPS was $0.94, 
up more than 4% and u
p slightly for the year. As Randall mentioned, we're 
on track to reach our expected low single
-
digit growth for the full year.
 
Revenues were down in the quarter due in part to tough year
-
over
-
year 
comparables at Warner Bros., along with video and FX impact
s. However, 
adjusted operating margin was up 30 basis points with gains in Mobility, 
entertainment and WarnerMedia.
 
Our cash flows are on a record pace for the year. Cash from operations came 
in at $11.4 billion, and free cash flow was $6.2 billion in the 
quarter and 
nearly $21 billion year
-
to
-
date.
 
This puts us firmly on track to reach our full year target of free cash flow in 
the $28 billion range, both from an ongoing operations and including about 
$2 billion from a full year of applying our working capi
tal approach to 
WarnerMedia's assets.
 
This solid free cash flow comes even with strong capital investment. CapEx 
was $5.2 billion, and total capital investment was $6 billion when you 
include the $800 million of payments for prior vendor financing activity
.
 
As Randall said, with asset sales as well as expected free cash flow in the 
fourth quarter, we expect to hit our 2.5 times range net debt
-
to
-
adjusted 
EBITDA target by the end of the year.
 
Let's now look at our segment operating results, starting with our
 
Communications segment on Slide 6. Starting with Mobility. We're growing 
service revenues and adding phone subscribers while increasing EBITDA.
 
Wireless service revenues grew by about 1% in the quarter and 
approximately 2% year
-
to
-
date, and we expect that
 
trend to continue into 
the fourth quarter. EBITDA grew by 1.6% to $7.8 billion, and EBITDA 
margins expanded by 80 basis points with service margins of 55.7%. During 
the quarter, we had 255,000 phone net adds, including more than 100,000 
postpaid and 154,0
00 prepaid voice.
 
We also continue to stack up industry awards, including being named the 
nation's best wireless network for the second year in a row and fastest for 
the third consecutive quarter. These awards say it best: Our network 
investment and spectr
um deployment are paying off.
 
Let's now look at our Entertainment Group. One of our key priorities for 
2019 was to stabilize Entertainment Group's EBITDA. Year
-
to
-
date, we're up 
2.3% with expense reductions outpacing video and legacy revenue losses. 
premiu
m video and IP broadband ARPUs continue to grow. Our 300,000
-
plus 
AT&T Fiber net adds helped drive broadband revenue growth.
 
We also expect that our premium video losses have peaked. We had about 
225,000 net losses due to programming blackouts. Our gross a
dds were 
down about 400,000 due to new, higher intro pricing and credit thresholds, 
as well as more targeted promotions, and we continue to work through 
customers rolling off 2 year price locks. Those video losses also impacted our 
broadband numbers, espec
ially our bundled customers, but we did have 
more than 300,000 AT&T Fiber net adds in the quarter.
 
And Business Wireline revenue trends improved year
-
over
-
year, thanks to 
strength in strategic and managed services. That performance came even 
with about $80
 
million less of intellectual property revenue when compared 
to the year ago quarter. With our strong business wireless performance, our 
Business Solutions revenues grew by about 1%.
 
Let's move to WarnerMedia and Latin America results which are on Slide 7.
 
WarnerMedia revenues largely reflect a comparison to a very strong revenue 
third quarter last year, which includes strong television licensing revenue 
growth and a box office slate that includes several hits. But WarnerMedia 
operating margins expanded in 
the quarter. Even with lower revenues, 
Warners Bros. operating income was up 2% due to lower film and TV 
production costs.
 
We also will have challenging comparisons to the fourth quarter. We're off to 
a strong start with the box office success of Joker. Bu
t remember, the fourth 
quarter of last year included blockbuster movies such as Aquaman, Fantastic 
Beasts 2 and A Star is Born.
 
Turner revenues were up on subscription revenue growth, partly offset by 
lower advertising and content licensing and other 
revenues, but operating 
income was up almost 3%. HBO revenues and operating income saw double
-
digit growth, thanks to strong content sales driven by international licensing. 
HBO's third quarter is even more impressive when you consider the DISH 
carriage di
spute and Game of Thrones finale both occurred in the second 
quarter.
 
WarnerMedia also delivered another incredible performance at this year's 
Emmy Awards, leading the industry with 39 primetime Emmys and 15 news 
and documentary Emmys.
 
Our Latin America te
am continues to do an excellent job of reducing costs in 
a challenging foreign exchange environment that helped drive an EBITDA 
increase of more than 20%.
 
A large part of the increase was due to an $81 million improvement in 
Mexico EBITDA. We expect this t
rend to continue and Mexico EBITDA to be 
positive in the fourth quarter, and we also added nearly 600,000 wireless 
subscribers in the quarter.
 
Those are our third quarter highlights. I'll now hand it back to Randall to talk 
about our 3 year financial outlo
ok and capital allocation plan that we 
announced this morning. Randall?
 
Randall Stephenson
 
Okay. Thanks, John. So what I want to do is talk to you about what you 
should expect over the next 3 years.
 
Before we get into the numbers, I want to begin with a br
oader discussion 
on our strategy. If you go to Slide 9, we'll outline this for you. Since 2012, 
we've made a series of strategic investments, and those investments have 
been aligned around 2 overarching trends.
 
First, consumers will continue to spend more 
time viewing premium content; 
and second, businesses and consumers will continue to demand more 
connectivity, more bandwidth and more mobility.
 
When we began pursuing this strategy, we saw an emerging world in which 
consumption of video and other premium c
ontent was no longer bound to 
your living room. And everything we expected has arrived, and it has arrived 
sooner than we or anyone else anticipated. And now the foundational 
elements of our investment thesis are clearer than ever.
 
It all starts with advan
ced high
-
capacity networks. From our iPhone 
experience, we knew the mobile Internet revolution in a world of streaming 
video would require much more capacity than people were anticipating, so 
we began investing for future demand.
 
First, we spent $20 billio
n on premium spectrum licenses. Next, we acquired 
Leap Wireless, which gave us additional spectrum; and Cricket's prepaid 
business. We've doubled the size of that business and transformed it from 
losing money to healthy margins.
 
And finally, we were select
ed to build and manage the First Responder 
Network for the United States government, and this brought with it another 
layer of premium spectrum capacity.
 
Over the last 18 months, we've been putting all this capacity into service, 
and the performance result
s have been dramatic. AT&T now has the fastest 
and most reliable wireless network in the U.S. We've invested to extend 
these same capabilities south into Mexico.
 
In 4 years, we built a high
-
speed nationwide network and have doubled the 
customer base. We've
 
also been undertaking the most aggressive fiber 
deployment program in the U.S. since 2015 with over 20 million locations 
passed. Over the next 3 years, our strong spectrum position will allow for 
lower capital intensity, and that bodes well for growing op
erating margins.
 
The second essential element is direct customer relationships, and we have 
about 170 million of them across mobile, pay TV and broadband. And that 
number reaches 370 million when you include our digital properties such as 
cnn.com, Bleacher
 
Report and Otter Media. As we prepare to launch HBO 
Max, our direct customer relationships are an asset that any streaming 
company would love to have.
 
Gaining scale in linear pay TV was the core rationale behind our DIRECTV 
acquisition. We realized the sa
tellite business was mature and we anticipated 
subscriber losses.
 
However, the content savings quickly turned our U
-
verse pay TV business 
from loss to a profit. And since we bought DIRECTV, it has generated 
healthy cash flows of over $4 billion per year or
 
a total of $22 billion in cash 
by the end of this year.
 
Third, we were convinced that the value of premium content would increase 
significantly over time as consumer demand continued to grow and new 
forms of distribution emerged.
 
And I think you've alread
y seen that with some of the multiples paid for 
media companies after we did our deal. Vertically integrating content and 
distribution is the future, and we're seeing it across the board.
 
And last, the vast distribution network and subscriber base brings u
nique 
viewer and customer insights. Pairing these with our large advertising 
inventories at DIRECTV and Turner and creating an ad tech platform is a 
unique opportunity, and every work 
--
 
every move we've made has been 
focused on building these four critica
l capabilities.
 
So now as we conclude 2019, we are the clear leader in network 
performance and capacity. We have one of the premier entertainment 
companies in the world with a broad
-
based presence in premium content 
and direct customer relationships, and I
 
wouldn't trade places with anyone.
 
So if you turn to Slide 10, I want to take a look at our 3 year outlook. 
Looking ahead, let me take you through the keys to our financial outlook, to 
our capital allocation plan. And all this will drive compelling return
s for our 
shareholders.
 
I'm going to start with the top line. We expect total company revenues over 
the 3
-
year period to grow by 1% to 2% per year. This will be driven by 
strength in Mobility, increased fiber penetration and WarnerMedia.
 
As mentioned earli
er, our wireless business is now enjoying operating 
leverage from investments made over the last 5 years. Our WarnerMedia 
cost synergies are on target and EBITDA at AT&T Mexico is ramping, and 
we're identifying significant opportunities for margin improvem
ent through 
ongoing cost evaluation and operational review.
 
Given our incremental investments in HBO Max in 2020 and our expectations 
for strong growth in equipment revenue driven by the 5G upgrade cycle, we 
expect our adjusted EBITDA margin to be stable i
n 2020. From there, we will 
drive 200 basis points of EBITDA margin expansion by 2022, above the 2019 
levels.
 
Improving margins 200 basis points will give us an EBITDA margin of 35% in 
2022. And applying a 35% margin to a revenue base that's growing 1% to 
2% per year produces an EBITDA lift in the neighborhood of $6 billion in 
2022, and that includes our investment in HBO Max.
 
The drivers for this EBITDA margin expansion are: WarnerMedia cost 
synergies, continued improvements in our wireless business, conti
nued 
EBITDA growth at AT&T Mexico and our plan to take out costs across the 
entire company.
 
In fact, we've hired Bill Morrow. He's a Special Adviser and Managing 
Director of Process Service and Cost Optimization, and he's leading our 
enterprise
-
wide cost
-
reduction initiative.
 
Bill has been CEO of large communication companies in the U.S., Europe and 
Australia, and he has a proven track record of creating best
-
in
-
class cost 
structures. He'll have full authority to examine and change our
 
cost structure 
across the entire company to ensure that we achieve the targets that we're 
outlining today.
 
Bill's work will be overseen by the Board's Corporate Development and 
Finance Committee and myself. And it will be above and beyond what we're 
alrea
dy doing with network virtualization, real estate consolidation and our 
other ongoing cost
-
reduction initiatives.
 
Our free cash flow has grown significantly over the past few years, and 
that's thanks in part to our DIRECTV and Time Warner deals being cash 
flow
-
accretive on day 1. We expect free cash flow to be at $28 billion in 
2020.
 
And as the HBO Max investment declines and we execute against our cost 
take
-
out initiatives, free cash flow will grow by more than $1 billion in 2021 
and another $1 billion in 
2022, reaching $30 billion to $32 billion in 2022.
 
Now let me talk about our 3 year capital allocation framework. We'll continue 
to grow the dividend as we have since I joined the company. Expect modest 
annual increases and a dividend payout ratio going be
low 50% in 2022. 
After paying the dividend, we expect to use 50% to 70% of our free cash 
flow to retire about 70% of the shares we issued for the Time Warner deal.
 
And we will continue to reduce debt going forward. Our target is that by 
2022, our net debt
-
to
-
adjusted EBITDA ratio will be between 2 and 2.25 
quarter times, and we'll have retired 100% of the debt we took on for Time 
Warner.
 
This is a very comfortable leverage ratio for us. We have routinely pruned 
the portfolio of assets that don't contribute 
to our core strategy. In fact, 
when you conclude what we've done in 2019, we've monetized more than 
$30 billion in non
-
strategic assets over the last few years. You should expect 
continued evaluation of our businesses and more progress on divesting 
assets 
that are no longer core to our fundamental mission.
 
As I mentioned earlier, we expect to realize about $14 billion in non
-
core 
asset monetizations this year, and we're targeting $5 billion to $10 billion 
next year. This is a continuous process for us. It i
s one of the areas in which 
our Corporate Development and Finance Committee dedicates a tremendous 
amount of time and attention.
 
With the support of our Board generally and the Corporate Development and 
Finance Committee in particular, I've instructed our 
executive team to begin 
the next review of our portfolio. So we're going to give you regular updates 
on our progress as we've done over the last year.
 
We're committed to an objective, diligent and disciplined process. We'll 
analyze the merits of each of ou
r businesses individually and as a part of the 
whole. But let me be clear, we have no sacred cows. We're always open to 
making portfolio moves, and DIRECTV has been the source of a lot of public 
speculation in that regard. As we've said, it will be an impo
rtant piece of our 
strategy over the next 3 years.
 
But no portion of our business is ever exempt from a continuous assessment 
for fit and performance. We'll approach it with a fresh set of eyes and clarity 
around the rapidly evolving consumer environment, 
and we'll evaluate 
multiple options. That includes partnerships and other structures.
 
Likewise, given the quality of our assets, there will be no major acquisitions 
during the next several years. With our financial outlook and the benefits of 
our capital a
llocation policy, we expect EPS growth in 2020 will be up low 
single digits. But by 2022, we expect EPS to be between $4.50 and $4.80.
 
That includes our investment in HBO Max of between $0.15 and $0.20 per 
share in 2020 and then $0.10 per share in 2021 and
 
2022. And as you can 
see, over the next 3 years, revenue, EBITDA and EPS all grow every single 
year.
 
Free cash flow is stable in 2020 and then grows in 2021 and 2022. This plan 
will deliver both substantial and consistent financial improvements for the 
ne
xt 3 years.
 
And before I hand it to John for his perspective on the 3
-
year plan, I want to 
say a few words about what you'll see tomorrow at Warner Bros. Studios 
and our investment in the HBO Max platform. This is a terrific product, and I 
honestly can't w
ait for you to see it.
 
John Stankey and his WarnerMedia team will take you through all aspects of 
the strategy, the product and the rollout, including our revenue and 
subscriber expectations for the next 5 years. We'll be investing to maximize 
the value of
 
the service, which will drive growth and value to WarnerMedia 
and to AT&T as a whole.
 
HBO Max is a terrific platform, and we're aligned in making it great while 
also being responsible with our capital and value. We'll make the significant 
investments requ
ired to win in the marketplace, but we'll also hit our 
numbers and ensure that we deliver on the promises that we're outlining for 
you here today.
 
I feel really good about this plan, and I'm highly confident in hitting each of 
our 3
-
year objectives. So now
 
I'll ask John to provide his perspective on our 
3
-
year plan. So John?
 
John Stephens
 
Thanks, Randall. Let's turn to Slide 12 and dive a little deeper on some of 
the details of the 3
-
year plan. We're expecting 1% to 2% revenue CAGR for 
the next 3 years. On 
the operational side, we expect wireless service 
revenues to grow by more than 2% per year.
 
FirstNet, our network quality improvement and reseller initiatives, all offer 
growth opportunities for us. We also expect 5G device adoption to boost 
equipment sale
s as we launch our nationwide 5G network in 2020. We also 
expect to continue our broadband revenue growth to help offset legacy and 
video pressures. And we expect to see significant incremental growth during 
the planning period from HBO Max and targeted ad
vertising from Xandr.
 
Randall did a good job of laying out our EBITDA and EBITDA margin growth 
plans. Our incremental cost plan will contribute to the 200 basis points of 
EBITDA margin improvement. One way we plan to do that is through 
product simplificati
on. Our future video product set will focus on 2 platforms: 
HBO Max, our subscription video on
-
demand service, which you'll hear more 
about tomorrow; and AT&T TV, our live TV offering.
 
Turning to capital allocation plans. We expect to return about $75 bill
ion in 
value to shareholders over the next 3 years through $30 billion of share 
retirements and $45 billion in dividends. Our share retirement will be 
aggressive. We expect to retire about 70% of the shares issued for the Time 
Warner deal. That's more than
 
10% of the company.
 
You heard our debt reduction target earlier, but let me repeat it here: We 
intend to target leverage between 2.0 times and 2.25 times. As CFO, I'm 
very comfortable operating the business in that range. Randall also 
mentioned that we ov
erachieved on asset monetizations this year, and we'll 
monetize more non
-
core assets next year as we continue to analyze the 
merits of all of our businesses.
 
That's our 3
-
year outlook, but let's look at our 2020 guidance on Slide 13. 
Let me start by laying
 
out that all these financial projections take into 
consideration the impact of our investment in HBO Max. We expect revenue 
to be up low single digits driven by growth from wireless service revenues 
and strong equipment revenues from the launch of 5G smar
tphones. This 
revenue growth represents our best top line performance in several years 
and highlights the strong performance across our businesses. We expect the 
base business will generate EPS of $3.75 to $3.90 per share. When you 
subtract the $0.15 to $0
.20 per share of HBO Max investment, we expect 
adjusted EPS growth in the $3.60 to $3.70 per share range. Our share 
retirement program will be a big part of this growth.
 
We also expect consolidated EBITDA margin to be stable with 2019 levels, 
even with the
 
impact from our HBO Max investment and 5G smartphones 
being available next year. Helping us keep EBITDA margins stable will be 
wireless service revenue growth, WarnerMedia synergies and our cost 
initiatives. Free cash flow is expected to be in the $28 bil
lion range. It's 
about the same as this year even with the HBO Max investment. And our 
dividend payout ratio will be in the 50% range. We'll continue to invest at 
leadership levels in 2020 with an expected gross capital investment in the 
$20 billion range.
 
And we'll continue to monetize our asset portfolio. We 
expect $5 billion to $10 billion of asset monetizations in 2020.
 
Let's next walk through the components of our 3
-
year EPS growth plan on 
Slide 14. As you can see from the chart, our path to $4.50 to $
4.80 a share 
is clear and achievable. A large part of that expected growth is a result of 
share retirements. That alone should get us about $0.40 a share.
 
Our enterprise
-
wide cost
-
reduction plans and Mexico profitability growth 
should net us another 
$0.25. Our remaining WarnerMedia synergies adds 
another $0.20. We also include about $0.10 of HBO Max investment in 2022. 
That business should turn profitable after that.
 
The growth plans that we've just outlined for you provide real earnings 
opportunities
. When you combine our dividend yield along with share 
retirements of more than 3% a year for the next 3 years, that provides a 
yield of about 8.5% per year. And when you factor in EPS growth, you get a 
solid double
-
digit return.
 
I want to reiterate what R
andall said earlier. We have a high degree of 
confidence in delivering on these commitments. We're hitting our marks in 
2019 and feel very strongly that we will do it again with this 3
-
year plan. 
Randall?
 
Randall Stephenson
 
Okay. Thanks, John. And before w
e get to Q&A, I want to speak to just a 
couple of additional issues. And if you go to Slide 15, we've listed these.
 
Over the last few years, we have continuously refreshed our Board of 
Directors. It's been done under the leadership of Matt Rose. He's our 
I
ndependent Lead Director, Chair of our Nominating Committee. Today, the 
average tenure of our independent directors is 8 years. And of our 12 
independent directors, 10 have joined the Board since 2012.
 
This is the Board that has directed our transformation
 
into a modern media 
company. And along the way, we've added new directors with the skills and 
experience to inform and guide our business strategies. That includes 3 
directors since 2015 with particularly strong backgrounds in large
-
scale 
video distributi
on, media and entertainment and digital media.
 
Looking ahead, we have 2 directors retiring in the next 18 months. As a 
result, we have a natural opportunity to continue our Board refreshment and 
add additional skill sets that align tightly with the objecti
ves I outlined this 
morning. In fact, we've been in discussion with some exciting candidates for 
some time.
 
And in the coming days, following our next regularly scheduled Board 
meeting, we anticipate adding a new Board member with deep expertise in 
technol
ogy and executing strategic cost initiatives. This new director will be 
added to the Corporate Development and Finance Committee, which has 
responsibility for overseeing our cost program and the evaluation of our 
portfolio. And we'll then add another direc
tor in 2020.
 
And finally, there's been a lot of speculation recently concerning my 
retirement. The Board and I have not yet set any formal plans for my 
retirement as CEO, but having been in the role for over 11 years, you can 
rest assured the Board and I h
ave begun detailed planning for when that 
date arrives.
 
We've spent many years guiding the business to the strong position we have 
today, and for all the reasons I've described, I believe we're on the threshold 
of something really remarkable in terms of th
e next chapter of AT&T's 
storied history. I have every intention of being here, and I will be here 
through 2020 to ensure that we hit the objectives we've laid out today: to 
drive significant growth in EBITDA margins and EPS and to invest in growth 
areas a
nd to retire all the debt and most of the shares issued in the Time 
Warner merger. My goal and my strong belief is that this is going to drive 
significant long
-
term value for our shareholders.
 
And helping me do this will be my talented colleague, John Stan
key, who 
was recently appointed COO. He has a big job, and his teams are working 
together to develop their joint plans, and John is continuing to build his 
leadership teams across all 3 businesses. The Board and I have very high 
expectations for John. I'm 
excited for him, and I look forward to seeing him 
tackle his new responsibilities.
 
Together, we're all about execution and delivering on our 3
-
year plan. You 
should also understand that the Board views leadership and CEO succession 
as one of its most impor
tant responsibilities to shareholders. The Board's HR 
Committee, which is led by Chair, Beth Mooney, oversees our talent 
management program and our succession planning process.
 
Under the HR Committee's leadership, the Board's evaluation of all potential 
ca
ndidates for the CEO position has been underway for some time, and it 
continues today. Further, whenever my transition as CEO does occur, the 
Board has already determined that it will separate the Chairman and the 
CEO positions.
 
This is an exciting time at
 
AT&T for all of our shareholders, our customers, 
our partners, employees and investors. The Board and our entire 
management team and I place the highest priority on generating value for 
our shareholders. Following 5
-
plus years of heavy investment, it's no
w time 
to reap the rewards of these investments to deliver some strong returns.
 
We believe that the plan we've taken you through today is going to deliver 
strong performance across all measures and that it should generate 
significant value creation in the 
near and the long term. The strategic 
transformation we've been working on for several years has enabled this 
new plan, and we've assembled the best set of capabilities to excel as a 
modern media company.
 
The objectives we have outlined today had been cent
ral to our plans for 
many months, even before we closed our acquisition of Time Warner. But as 
you would expect, our thinking has also benefited from robust engagement 
with our owners, and that includes Elliott Management. And given the 
shareholder interes
t in our engagement with the team at Elliott, I'm happy 
to address that subject very directly here.
 
Over the past several weeks, Matt Rose and I have found our engagement 
with Elliott to be both constructive as well as helpful. Among other things, 
Elliott 
has met with the prospective new director that I mentioned earlier 
and is enthusiastic about that addition to our Board following our next 
meeting.
 
These are smart people, and they very much understand the tremendous 
opportunity we have to create substanti
al shareholder value. As we move 
forward in the coming months, the Board and I look forward to continuing 
our close collaboration with Elliott on strategy, operational initiatives in our 
portfolio and to see through the value
-
enhancing steps that I've laid
 
out 
today.
 
I'm excited about our strategy, and I'm very excited about this plan. And I 
want you to know that I'm all in on running this play and seeing us execute 
it.
 
So I know you have a lot of questions, and so we're going to open it up to 
Q&A. So Mike,
 
I'll turn it back to you.
 
Michael Viola
 
Okay. Greg, we are ready to take questions. And can you please give us 
those Q&A instructions? Thanks.
 
Question
-
and

Answer Session
 
Operator
 
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line 
of 
David Barden from Bank of America. Please go ahead.
 
David Barden
 
Congrats on the new plan. So I guess, Randall or John, as we kind of think 
about this more prescriptive capital allocation plan that you've kind of 
outlined with respect to dividends and s
tock buybacks, could you kind of talk 
about how that wraps around the potential for spectrum acquisition or kind 
of other opportunities?
 
And especially that dovetails with the kind of commitment to the no
-
acquisition posture. In the media world in 
particular, it seems like this is 
very much becoming a scale game. It would seem that more scale would be 
better if this is the right strategy.
 
Could you kind of wrap all this together for us in terms of how we kind of get 
the business developed in the rig
ht way while at the same time following 
through on these commitments for capital allocation? Thanks.
 
Randall Stephenson
 
Yes, Dave. This is Randall. I'm going to start, and I'll let John supplement 
what I say here if there's anything else he wants to add. B
ut what we have 
given you today is a cash flow forecast and plan, built around operational 
aspects that would allow us to do the shareholder returns that you heard us 
talk to today, particularly around EPS accretion and such.
 
To the extent that we need to 
engage in spectrum acquisitions of some type, 
and I have to be cautious because we're in a quiet period here. But what I 
can give you confidence in, and what I'd tell you we now have confidence in, 
we developed a lot of muscle over the last couple of years
, on cleaning up 
the portfolio.
 
And I am very confident that portfolio cleanup and asset dispositions will 
more than offset anything we need to do in terms of spectrum acquisition. 
So what we're committed to is this capital allocation, this capital return 
plan, 
because we've been investing very aggressively over the last 5, 6 years to 
get us to this point.
 
And I just think we're in a very seminal point, Dave, point where now it's 
time to reap the rewards of what we've been doing. And so drive margin 
expansi
on, get the 1% to 2% revenue growth, it's going to generate 
incredible cash flow.
 
CapEx comes in, in 2020 as you saw in John's numbers and so begin to 
reward to shareholders these investments that we've been making over the 
last few years.
 
So bottom line, 
we're committed to what we've laid out here in terms of 
capital returns. When we talk about M&A, we've said no major M&A. We like 
the assets we have. I mean this is really, across the board, a quality, 
premium set of assets. If we have to do tuck
-
in acquis
itions here and there 
to supplement capabilities, like you saw the HBO LAG deal that we did 
Friday, the LA 
-
 
or pardon me, the Latin American HBO property. That's a 
small acquisition that's immediately accretive, and it just supplements what 
we're trying t
o do in Latin America with our HBO Max product. And so you'll 
see those kind of things. But in terms of big M&A, we have no needs given 
the assets that we have right now.
 
John Stephens
 
Yes. Dave, just to put a kind of a numerical perspective. $500 billion 
balance 
sheet, finding 1% to 2% a year on a recurring basis is certainly a reasonable 
goal and something we have high expectations to be able to achieve. From a 
practical standpoint, we've announced two deals, Puerto Rico and the CME 
transaction was announ
ced yesterday.
 
They're going to provide about $3 billion in capital just next year, so we 
have a great head start to the deals that will close next year that will give us 
more cash, things that we've already gotten done. And you can rest assured 
we got mor
e of that in process.
 
And then with regard to spectrum, as Randall said, can't comment on the 39 
that's underway. With regard to the C
-
band and the other future auctions, 
certainly we'll be interested. As always, we're interested in fair auctions that 
prov
ide as much spectrum available to the marketplace and allows all 
bidders to bid.
 
We think that's going to take some time, particularly with the C
-
band and 
the FCC. But certainly, we'd be interested. By the same token, there's a 
clear expectation we'll pay 
for it with asset monetizations on this balance 
sheet, that we have that opportunity to do that.
 
David Barden
 
Thanks for the color guys. Thanks.
 
Randall Stephenson
 
Thanks, David.
 
Operator
 
Your next question comes from the line of Philip Cusick from JPMorga
n. 
Please go ahead.
 
Philip Cusick
 
So around video, have we hit the peak of losses in terms of near
-
term video 
trends? And how do you think about the impact of AT&T TV launching versus 
the price increase of AT&T TV Now recently?
 
And it looks like you plan t
o invest about $1.5 billion to $2 billion in HBO 
Max in 2020 and about $1 billion a year for the following couple of years. 
How do you think about this level of investment to drive success in a market 
that's increasingly full of competitive offers? Thanks.
 
Randall Stephenson
 
Phil, this is Randall. I think John mentioned it in his comments that in terms 
of the video losses, particularly around the satellite product, third quarter is 
the peak. Third quarter is 
--
 
we had a couple of significant blackouts in 
te
rms of content, and those blackouts drove some sizable subscriber losses.
 
And then we had the cleanup that's been going on in the customer base in 
terms of prior promotions and so forth. And so we have pretty much run to 
the end of those. There's a little 
bit more of the customer cleanup that will 
run into Q4, but in terms of the losses, they will be significantly improved in 
the fourth quarter and get better as we move into next year.
 
As you think about the product portfolio going forward, and you're seein
g 
this in terms of the pricing moves that we're making. But as we get into next 
year, you're basically going to see our traditional satellite platform, which is 
going to have a long life.
 
I mean this business continues to be really strong, generates a lot 
of cash 
flow. As I said in my comments, there's more than $4 billion of free cash 
flow a year and done $22 billion since we owned the thing.
 
But as we get into next year, then you'll have the satellite then you'll have 
the software platforms. And AT&T TV 
is the standardized software platform, 
and that will be our primary vehicle for going to market, particularly pairing 
it with our fiber product and our broadband product.
 
And then HBO Max becomes the workhorse for our video product as we 
move into next yea
r. And all of the muscle, and as you can see and as you 
articulated, the range of investment is going behind HBO Max.
 
In terms of are we comfortable with that level in what you called a crowded 
field, I actually think the field in terms of where we intend 
to play is not that 
crowded. We intend to play at a significant level, and we're starting with a 
product called HBO, which has a very significant position in the marketplace.
 
And as you're going to see tomorrow, we're investing heavily behind that 
brand an
d bringing additional content to bear. And I actually feel very 
comfortable.
 
And I think tomorrow, Phil, that's all tomorrow is about, is to get you 
comfortable that this is a unique product. This is a product that's going to be 
very different from anythin
g else that you've seen in the market so far. This 
is not Netflix, this is not Disney, this is HBO Max, and it's going to have a 
very unique position in the marketplace.
 
And I would tell you we feel very comfortable at these investment levels, 
that we can 
do something very significant in the market and drive some 
significant subscriber gains. This is going to be a meaningful business to us 
over the next 4 or 5 years. And we're talking a 50 million subscriber 
business and I'm really, really enthusiastic abou
t this.
 
So the video product gets really streamlined and simplified as we move into 
next year. Satellite and then software product. And then one of the big cost 
initiatives, and it's not inconsequential, is John Stankey is bringing the video 
platforms, the
 
software platforms, he will be standardizing all of these.
 
And as you can well guess, AT&T TV, we have a development and cost 
associated with that. HBO Max, there's a technology development cost 
associated with that. Putting these on a standardized platfo
rm over the next 
couple of years drives significant savings as well. So feel pretty good about 
the platform, and the numbers should improve as we move forward.
 
Philip Cusick
 
Randall, just to be clear, the 50 million you mentioned, is that current or 
foreca
st?
 
Randall Stephenson
 
Forecast. That's what we're forecasting, domestic HBO Max over 5 years.
 
Philip Cusick
 
Thanks very much.
 
Randall Stephenson
 

 
Operator
 
Your next question comes from the line of John Hodulik from UBS. 
Please go 
ahead.
 
John Hodulik
 
Great, thanks, Maybe two questions. One for John and one for Randall. John, 
could you give some more detail on the 
-
 
I guess both the near term and the 
sort of the longer term 200 basis points of margin improvement? I guess 
Ra
ndall just mentioned that some of it comes from product simplification 
within the entertainment segment. But can you talk a little bit about how 
you expect some of those cost initiatives to impact each of the segments? 
Should we expect continued improvemen
t in wireless margins and in 
enterprise and WarnerMedia?
 
And then for Randall, I guess with today's announcements, the company has 
addressed, I'd say, the majority of the issues laid out in the Elliott letter. 
What I didn't see though is with John Stankey 
taking on the role of COO, 
what's the time frame for him to relinquish leadership of the WarnerMedia 
asset? Thanks.
 
John Stephens
 
Thanks, John. Let me take the first question on the 200 basis point 
improvement in margins. Let me give a base case that we se
e 
--
 
now we are 
expecting improvement from Mobility.
 
We are expecting improvement from Mexico. We are expecting improvement 
from the WarnerMedia cost synergies. With that being said, these additional 
cost synergies that we're talking about, I would categor
ize in just a couple or 
3 buckets.
 
One, I think you'll see product simplification. I think we'll see a big effort 
with Bill and the team working with John and everyone across the enterprise 
on product simplification. I think that should provide significant
 
rewards.
 
Secondly, I would tell you that there's still general administrative expense 
savings, and I think that opportunity continues to be there. You've got to 
remember that we've only got final court clearance on the Time Warner deal 
just 6 months ago, 
so we've got more opportunities in bringing that 
together.
 
Third, the video platforms, Randall mentioned this, and the standardization 
of those platforms, bringing those platform cost and development and 
capabilities together not only is a great business r
esult but also an 
opportunity.
 
I think those are kind of 3 things I'd point to kind of real quickly and real 
briefly. We'll look at everything there are. Just like with the portfolio there's 
no sacred cows.
 
But to give you a just a more simple sense of 
it, about $180 billion of 
revenue, about $120 billion of COE gets us our $60 billion of EBITDA. If we 
can mine out 1% to 2% of our COE every year, that's in that $1.5 billion to 
$2 billion range.
 
I'm not setting a target for ourselves, but you can give us 
a sense that, that 
really gives us some comfort with regard to that overall $6 billion EBITDA 
improvement, especially when you've got great progress in things like 
Mexico, great progress in Mobility, real improvements across the enterprise.
 
Randall Stephen
son
 
I would actually just append a little bit into that. We're going to now have 
Bill Morrow and John Stankey heading up an initiative to take these costs 
out, that John just gave you the big blocks of what they will go after.
 
These are two process improve
ment hawks. They are probably as good as it 
gets anywhere in terms of streamlining process, simplifying process and 
taking cost out. And as you look at this plan of the areas that I have the 
least concern that we will achieve, setting objectives to get cos
t out, to get 
200 basis points of margin expansion, this is probably the area I feel the 
most comfortable with.
 
And so there's some big target areas in terms of what we go after to take 
these costs out. This is stuff we do, and we do it really, really well
. We all 
have a lot of experience here. The cost piece, it'll get done. I don't spend a 
lot of time worrying about that one.
 
In terms of your question on WarnerMedia, when will John Stankey 
relinquish leadership of WarnerMedia, I don't anticipate he will r
elinquish 
leadership in WarnerMedia. It's under his purview of COO. And he's got a big 
job, and he has been spending a lot of time building his leadership team and 
getting the right people in the right spots and getting HBO stood up.
 
I would tell you on th
e WarnerMedia side, I think what he has done over 
there in terms of building the team that's there, the hires he has made, Bob 
Greenblatt, you're going to get a full dose of Bob Greenblatt tomorrow, and 
as he launches the HBO Max product. This is an impres
sive guy. He's got 
great media chops, been around, a lot of experience.
 
Ann Sarnoff coming in to run Warner Bros. I mean just a really, really 
impressive hire. As you think about WarnerMedia, I have no doubt he'll find 
the right person for that job as well
. So feel really good about the team that 
John's assembling and I feel really confident about where he's going.
 
John Hodulik
 
Thanks, guys.

Your next question comes from the line of Simon Flannery from Morgan 
Stanley. Please go ahead.
 
Simon Flanner
y
 
Great. Thank you very much. Good morning. So coming back to the 
buyback, could you talk a little bit about the timing of the buyback? I think 
you're saying 9% of these outstanding over a 3
-
year period.
 
But how should we think about that flowing through i
n Q4 and in 2020? And 
is there really a number in terms of $25 billion or x number of shares? 
What's the kind of what you're 
--
 
the messaging here?
 
And then coming back to the last question on costs, is there a time frame for 
Bill Morrow to complete his ev
aluation and to come back to you and the 
Board and then potentially to us with more clarity around the buckets, diving 
into the things that we've just been going over at a high level? Thank you.
 
John Stephens
 
This is 
-
 
Simon, this is John. Let me take on t
he share retirement question. 
First off, when you take a look at Time Warner transaction, it was about 1.1 
billion shares. If you take 70%, it's about the 750 million range of shares.
 
That's the communication we intend. I would suggest to you that we haven
't 
laid out a specific time line for how much each day, how much each month 
or quarter. We're going through that process now, but I wouldn't be 
surprised if it is somewhat front
-
end loaded or at least front
-
end loaded in 
individual years.
 
I would tell you 
we are very respectful of the commitments we made to get 
into the 2.5 range, and we're going to do that. And I want to make sure this 
doesn't change that, just like we're going to do this share retirement 
consistent with getting into that 2 to 2.25 times.
 
Do feel really comfortable operating the business at that level. So it's 
--
 
and 
particularly in today's interest rate environment and our cash flow 
environment, feel very comfortable with it. But we're going to respect that 
and make sure we do that.
 
With r
egard to the process for buybacks, this is 
--
 
as you can imagine, we're 
looking at everything from accelerated share repurchases to open market 
purchases to other transactional aspects. But I do think it's fair to assume 
that we would focus on trying to fr
ont end load or trying to do more earlier. 
And within a year, I do not expect it to be smooth.
 
Additionally, within the 3 years, as I expect, we're going to be successful 
with this plan, we will see our stock price change. And as it changes, our 
dividend, 
cash cost of that equity gets adjusted downward. And so you have 
to continually evaluate the total cost and total investment and total decision
-
making process. It's a fairly direct decision
-
making process today, and we 
will continue to evaluate that.
 
But t
hat's how we're thinking about it and we feel very comfortable about 
getting it done. It's just a matter of getting the process implemented and 
moving forward. Nothing to announce on how many shares we may or may 
not buy in the fourth quarter, but clearly,
 
the commentary we put out that 
says some share retirements are in the mix for the fourth quarter is a fair 
statement.
 
Okay. On the cost
-
initiative side, I mean once again, I will tell you this. This 
is been going on for a while. We have been going through
 
this process. Bill 
Morrow, we've been talking to Bill Morrow for a while. And knowing that we 
wanted to bring on someone with those talents and those skill sets.
 
So we will give him some time to get his feet on the ground, but we expect 
him to hit the gro
und running. And we will have plans in place and identified 
opportunities already that we'll start operationalizing as soon as possible, 
many of those things before the end of this year.
 
If you're asking about when they will show up in the financial statem
ents 
and the cost synergies, the savings, I would expect that they're going to be 
somewhat back
-
end loaded. They won't all show up in the first year, 
specifically because there will be some investments and some time to get 
the plans put into operation.
 
Within our $20 billion capital number, we've set aside some resources for 
those system investments and for those activities. So feel comfortable about 
our ability to get those done within this plan.
 
But while as 
--
 
while we will show as much urgency as pos
sible to get 
savings starting with day 1, I would expect that they will be certainly more 
back
-
end loaded as opposed to our buy 
--
 
our stock retirement program, 
which may be more front
-
end loaded.
 
Randall Stephenson
 
We'll have some that are going to be qui
ck hits. G&A, those are areas where 
you can generally get some pretty quick hits on cost. We've identified some 
of those areas. Product simplification, those take a little longer because as 
John said, you got to make some investments.
 
You remember the last
 
time, though, we took this on, it was probably 5 
years ago. Andy Geisse led the effort. And that initiative over a couple of 
years generated almost $1 billion of cost savings.
 
We're back at one of those moments here again. So I feel pretty confident 
there
 
are going to be some big chunks of cost that we can get out of the 2
-
year time frame and some others that will 
--
 
we'll get them out in the 2020 
time horizon.
 
I think John 
-
 
what we should just anticipate doing and what you should 
expect, Simon. We get Q4
 
earnings, we'll give you an update in terms of 
where we are at that stage. Bill Morrow starts, I think, today. I believe this 
is his first day.
 
And so we do want to give him a chance to get his feet on the ground. But 
as we begin to put the plans together
 
and develop them, we'll give you a 
status report on the Q4 earnings call and let you know where these are 
going.

Your next question comes from the line of Kannan Venkateshwar from 
Barclays. Please go ahead.
 
Kannan Venkateshwar
 
Thank you. A couple
, if I could. Randall, from your own perspective, you've 
talked about the simplification of the product to basically 2 brands: AT&T TV 
and HBO Max. How are you thinking about the rest of the portfolio, given 
that you have a lot of other streaming brands as
 
well as brands such as 
HBO? And does your guidance contemplate some degree of cannibalization 
across your entire portfolio?
 
And then, John, from your perspective, you've talked about buybacks 
potentially being front
-
end loaded and EBITDA potentially being
 
--
 
the 
growth guidance being back
-
end loaded. Could you talk about the 
components within that in terms of things like partnerships potentially at 
DIRECTV or [financing] coming from Turner and so on and so forth? So what 
are the variables that go into that
 
guidance? If you could just highlight 
those.
 
Randall Stephenson
 
Yes. Thanks, Kannan. On the video product simplification, cannibalization or 
mix shift, I don't know how best to describe it, but obviously, as we roll the 
software products out and so AT&T T
V and this Korean client product, we'll 
be rolling that out early next year. This is really a good product. And it will 
become 
--
 
for a live streaming product, it will become the workhorse. It's 
where the lion's share of gross adds move to over the next co
uple of years.
 
And so that cannibalizes satellite, it replaces satellite. But we actually like if 
gross adds are coming in on that product, that's a good thing for us for a 
number of reasons. It's a much lower cost point to put in place with a 
customer.
 
An
d as a result, it allows us to meet a much different price point in the 
market. And 
--
 
but with content costs continuing to escalate, these price 
points are pricing a lot of customers out of the live streaming product.
 
And so we've just been very ambitious
 
to get a new cost structure on our 
video product that allow us to get people back into the live streaming 
product. Our research says there are a lot of people that want a live 
streaming product, but it's just too expensive with the way content costs 
have 
gone. So this allows us to get another product in the marketplace at a 
lower price point, lower cost point, good margins. So that's point number 
one.
 
HBO Max. HBO Max becomes our SVOD product of the future. And you're 
going to hear a lot more about this to
morrow. I don't want to steal Stankey 
and his team's thunder on this. But HBO Max becomes the SVOD platform 
for AT&T as we move forward into the future. And what you should expect is 
as we get into the future, this won't be day 1.
 
But over time, that platf
orm 
--
 
because of the platform through which we 
also deliver live stream TV. So you want an SVOD service, HBO Max, great. 
Over time, we look forward to bringing in live element into HBO Max as well. 
And so this thing gets more and more simplified and we ul
timately get down 
to where we have two products: the traditional satellite, which will be there 
for a long time; and then our streaming product, which will be premised on 
the HBO Max platform. And again, you're going to hear a lot more about this 
tomorrow 
night, and I look forward to seeing you there.
 
John Stephens
 
Kannan, it's John. With regard to the buybacks and the EBITDA discussion. 
On the buybacks side, as I discussed before, the ability to get cash, get the 
stock in at very attractive prices from a c
ash cost of capital will be our focus, 
and I do expect it to be front
-
end loaded. On the EBITDA side, I would not 
use the term back
-
end loaded on the EBITDA side gains because that would 
just suggest to you this: Mobility is growing today and it will conti
nue to 
grow in 2020. Mexico, if you look at 
--
 
and we expect Mexico to be EBITDA 
positive in the fourth quarter.
 
And when we achieve that, we'll have about a $300 million 
--
 
just under a 
$300 million improvement in Mexico's EBITDA this year. And we expect 
that 
those trends to continue next year. If you look at WarnerMedia cost savings, 
the programs are already in place.
 
John Stankey and his team already have those in place, and you see those 
growing next year. We've got a significant number of items that wo
uld 
--
 
that are propelling EBITDA improvement, which would propel our standalone 
EPS guidance that we suggested.
 
The reason for next year being flattish, so to speak, on EBITDA margins is 
because we're making close to a $2 billion investment in HBO Max. Th
at's 
the $0.15 to $0.20 that's on our schedules of EPS. So I think of it we're 
choosing to make an investment on a long
-
term product, on a long
-
term 
winning product that is going to be very important to us. So that's that 
aspect of it.
 
As I said, we'll hav
e some quick hits. As Randall said, we'll have some quick 
hits on the cost initiatives led by Bill Morrow, but the full scope of his ability 
to get all the savings is going to take 
--
 
is going to come in over years. But 
our EBITDA next year on a 
--
 
with, i
nclusive of, our $2 billion investment or 
in that range in HBO Max, is flattish. If you would take that out, that would 
be a full 1% growth in our EBITDA.
 
That right there would be about half that growth, that 200 basis point 
growth we're talking about for
 
the full 3 years. So this is a long
-
term 
investment, a good decision
-
making process like we've done with our 
acquisition of spectrum, like we've done with our buildout of our wireless 
network, like we've done with our fiber play. We believe this is a very
 
good 
long
-
term decision.
 
Operator
 
Your next question comes from the line of Brett Feldman from Goldman 
Sachs. Please go ahead.
 
Brett Feldman
 
I want to talk a bit more about wireless here. You've obviously talked a lot 
about the benefits of the 
FirstNet investment you flagged, the 50% increase 
in network capacity through the additional spectrum. You've also expanded 
your distribution both into the FirstNet or the first responder community as 
well as in just some new rural markets.
 
And those two t
hings combined you would assume are going to start 
creating some churn benefits because of the network quality, some gross 
add benefits because of the expanded distribution. And I'm just curious, 
where are we in terms of starting to see that in your perfor
mance? You've 
obviously had pretty solid phone net adds.
 
Do you think that there's an opportunity for that to keep inflecting? Is that 
the real driver of the service revenue CAGR you've put out there? Or are 
there other elements we should be considering as
 
we structure our models 
as well?
 
John Stephens
 
No, thanks for the question. Let me try and go at it this way and ask Randall 
to jump in and help me out. First of all, with regard to the service revenue 
increases and the overall performance of the business
, the additional 
spectrum capacity, the ability to put in new technologies like a carrier 
aggregation, typically it's got, like most kinds of technological improvements 
as well as this one
-
touch build opportunity we have with FirstNet, which just 
gives us 
a big lead in getting towers 5G
-
enabled and getting our network 
ready to be a national 5G network next year. Those are all the base of what 
we're doing.
 
When you look at our postpaid business, you're right. We have phone 
growth, voice growth in the third q
uarter, 100,000. That's the best we've 
had in 5 years. I think it does have something to do with the quality of our 
network, the speed of it. I also think it has something to do with the great 
offers that we have and the efforts of our folks.
 
You saw anoth
er strong quarter of prepaid. We're on track to take virtually 
our 
--
 
we're going to have a share of the prepaid net adds this year that I 
think that equates to the total growth in the market. So we're doing really 
well with our Cricket brand. It continues
 
to be seller. We're seeing great 
churn reduction. That's going to help with revenue.
 
We're in an inflection point with our reseller point. We had stepped away 
from the reseller business because of capacity issues. For the last 4 
quarters, our reseller rev
enue's been essentially flat. So we're now moving 
towards it with this new capacity from FirstNet, we now have the opportunity 
to have a real growth from that reseller perspective where we're very 
interested in that.
 
And then you continue to see what's hap
pening with connected devices, IoT, 
and quite frankly with 5G+, the millimeter wave
-
based 5G services for 
businesses as well as our overall 5G services for businesses, feel really good 
about. Those are the things that are going to make up that service reve
nue 
growth.
 
I would also tell you we continue to see customers buying up to unlimited. 
They're continuing to buy our quality insurance programs on their more 
expensive phones. And then on the nonservice side, you'll see the step up to 
5G equipment, mainly 
handsets, particularly for us, we expect to be 
measurable in share.
 
So you put all of that together, it's really, really very good. Those customer 
handsets will also bring some cost with them. But what they do, do is give 
us the opportunity to lock in that
 
customer and refresh that customer and 
make 
--
 
and allow the customer to see this really significant network 
advantage we have.
 
And so feel good about all those. That's how we're thinking about Mobility. 
At the same time, they're going through efficiencie
s and efforts. We'll look at 
product simplification, our offering simplification there, all of those kinds of 
things will continue to help keep margins heading in the right direction.
 
Brett Feldman
 
Can I ask a quick follow
-
up? That was helpful. You mention
ed the reseller 
business and putting more emphasis on that because of your capacity 
improvement. One of the key reseller communities you really haven't 
addressed is the cable MVNOs. Considering the improvement in your 
network capacity, are you strategicall
y opening to supporting that customer 
base?
 
John Stephens
 
Absolutely.
 
Randall Stephenson
 
Yes. We would actually be open to that. So you should assume that, that's 
something we'd be open to. And not just cable guys, but there are a number 
of people in the r
eseller space that are reaching out.
 
And it's just as John said, we got a lot of capacity now in this network, and 
we're at the point of evolution in this industry where we ask, how do you 
monetize most efficiently, capacity? And so we're going to look at 
all those 
channels.
 
John Stephens
 
One last thing, Brett, on the capacity, I want to make sure. We have put in 
almost 60 megahertz of spectrum nationwide on a base of about 100. So it's 
a significant increase there. Secondly, all the technology changes, the
 
carrier 
aggregation and others, have increased our spectral 
--
 
our throughput 
capacity significantly.
 
And then this ability to one
-
touch and put up 5G. The conversion from a 3G 
network and some of our older 
--
 
or this 4G network into this 5G network is 
al
so going to increase.
 
So we've not only got an increased capacity just from the spectral, that's the 
easiest way to think about it, but all the other steps the network team's 
doing is dramatically improving our capabilities. And so we have a significant 
ad
vantage over our competitors and have an ability to compete because of 
that advantage.
 
Michael Viola
 
Greg, we'll take one last question.
 
Operator
 
And that question comes from the line of Michael Rollins from Citi.
 
Michael Rollins
 
Just curious if you 
could describe how the team evaluated the value of share 
buybacks relative to some incremental investments in the operations, for 
example, accelerating investments in fiber
-
to
-
the
-
home, especially after the 
subscriber gains that you've highlighted recently
 
in the segment?
 
And then just separately, AT&T has been bundling video with its wireless 
subscribers in some form for some time. Can you describe the results that 
you're seeing and how that impacts both customer acquisition and retention?
 
Randall Stephens
on
 
Mike, this is Randall. As we think about share buybacks and capital 
expenditures, actually, we're still going to invest at a $20 billion level next 
year. And that's, I am quite confident, will be, by order of magnitudes, the 
most aggressive investment i
n the industry.
 
And we have been on a very aggressive plan for deploying fiber. And we put 
in a very short period of time 20 million locations passed with fiber. And we 
are somewhere between 20% and 25% penetrated in that footprint in the 
next couple years
 
are going to be about penetrating. It's really about 
penetration. That doesn't mean we're stopping fiber deployment. 5G 
requires us to continue deploying fiber.
 
We have business customers who have expectations and we deploy fiber into 
business locations. 
And what that does is creates capillaries that we then 
expand off of. And so you're going to continue to see the capillary of fiber in 
this company expand.
 
It's just not going to expand at the pace we've been going on. It's been on a 
torrid pace. I would s
uggest it's been the most aggressive in the United 
States. Now it's time to reap the rewards of what we've done and let's go 
penetrate the market.
 
As you think about the video bundles, the strong 
--
 
and this is something I 
find very encouraging. I don't th
ink we've put metrics out on this. I think 
you will probably talk about it tomorrow. But the most powerful video bundle 
we have with our mobile business is HBO in terms of what it does to churn 
and retention.
 
And the reason I think that's very exciting is 
now think about HBO Max and 
taking that product to a different level. And it's going to be something 
different. And now bundling that with our mobile business and the impacts 
on churn, we believe, are going to be very, very powerful.
 
And so we're very exci
ted about putting wireless with HBO Max. HBO Max is 
a natural bundle with our 
--
 
obviously our video business, whether it's 
DIRECTV or AT&T TV. It's a great bundle with our broadband business, 
particularly the fiber business. So we're really bullish right 
now on how HBO 
Max gets leveraged across the footprint.
 
When you look at HBO today, keep in mind we've really only owned the 
asset, post appeal by the courts, since February. So about 8 months is how 
long it's been under our purview. In a very short period
 
of time, AT&T has 
moved by order of magnitude into the position as the largest distributor of 
HBO.
 
And if you look at the number two distributor, we're 62% higher penetrated 
than the #2 distributor. So we think HBO is a very powerful platform to 
bundle wi
th our various distribution properties. And you turn HBO into HBO 
Max, it becomes even more exciting. So thanks for the question, Mike.
 
Michael Viola
 
Okay. Greg, that ends our Q&A session.
 
Randall Stephenson
 
So if I could, I would just close out by first o
f all thanking everybody for 
joining the call. Look, this is an aggressive 3
-
year plan. I got to tell you, this 
is a 3
-
year plan we've spent a lot of time over the last few months putting 
together. And as I keep saying, it's time to reap the rewards of the
 
investments we made over the last few months 
--
 
years.
 
And so it's a very exciting time for us. The capital allocation plan is very 
exciting, and we're really excited about HBO Max, and I'm really hopeful to 
see everybody here in L.A. tomorrow night to pr
eview this product and see 
what we have to offer at WarnerMedia. So thanks again for joining us, we'll 
talk to you tomorrow.

Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the AT&T 
First Quarter 2011 Earnings Release. [Operator Instructions] And as a 
reminder, today's call is being recorded. With that being said, I'll turn the 
conference now to 
Brooks McCorcle. Please go ahead.
 
Brooks McCorcle
 
Thanks, John. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to our first quarter 
conference call. It's really great to have you with us this morning. As John 
mentioned, this is Brooks McCorcle, Head of Investor Relations
 
for AT&T. 
And joining me on the call this morning are Rick Lindner, AT&T's Chief 
Financial Officer; Ralph de la Vega, AT&T's President and CEO for Mobility 
and Consumer Markets; and John Stephens, AT&T's Controller and CFO
-
designate.
 
We'll cover results, 
then we'll follow with Qs&As. Let me remind you that our 
release, investor briefing, supplementary information and the presentation 
slides that accompany this call are available on the Investor Relations page 
of the AT&T website, and, as a reminder, that's
 
www.att.com/investor.relations.
 
I also need to cover our Safe Harbor statement, which is on Slide 3, and that 
says that information set forth in this presentation contains financial 
estimates and other forward
-
looking statements that are subject to risks 
and 
uncertainties and actual results may differ materially. A discussion of factors 
that may affect future results is contained in AT&T's filings with the 
Securities and Exchange Commission. AT&T disclaims any obligation to 
update or revise statements cont
ained in this presentation based on new 
information or otherwise.
 
This presentation may contain certain non
-
GAAP financial measures. 
Reconciliations between the non
-
GAAP financial measures and the GAAP 
financial measures are also available on our website a
t 
www.att.com/investor.relations.
 
Before I turn the call over to Rick, I would like to call your attention to Slide 
4, which provides the financial summary. Earnings per share for the quarter 
was $0.57, which is roughly in line with adjusted EPS from first
 
quarter a 
year ago, and it's clearly up from our reported EPS of $0.41 this time last 
year. Our results this quarter also include approximately $0.02 of pressure 
from Alltel integration costs. As we have mentioned to you earlier this year, 
this merger
-
rel
ated cost will also impact margins, wireless churn and 
subscriber numbers, which Ralph will cover in a few minutes.
 
We will also see some impacts continuing into the second quarter as we 
complete customer migrations, but, overall, the integration process i
s going 
well and is in line with our overall expectations. Consolidated revenues were 
up 2.3% year
-
over
-
year, thanks to continued strength in mobile broadband, 
U
-
verse services and strategic business offerings. Consolidated operating 
income margin remained
 
stable even with strong sales of smartphones, and 
cash flow continues to be strong, with cash from operating activities totaling 
$7.7 billion and free cash flow of $3.6 billion. With that, I will now turn the 
call over, one last time, to AT&T's Chief Fina
ncial Officer, Rick Lindner. Rick?
 
Rick Lindner
 
Thank you, Brooks. Good morning, everyone. Let me start with a couple of 
comments on the quarter overall. The highlights are on Slide 5. First off, we 
had a terrific start to the year. We saw a continuation o
f the positive 
revenue trends we've seen in the past few quarters. We had a very strong 
wireless quarter, with double
-
digit revenue growth. Stable trends in Wireline 
revenues driven by U
-
verse expansion and growth in strategic business 
services. Going into
 
the quarter, we knew that with another carrier offering 
the iPhone for the first time, there was a possibility of some natural 
volatility, and our mobile broadband strategy would be tested as never 
before.
 
I'm very pleased to tell you that the results sho
w our strategy is working. 
Our wireless business is performing at a high level, and customers, both new 
and existing ones, continue to choose AT&T. Smartphone sales continue to 
be strong. Postpaid ARPU continues to grow at a good clip. Churn remains 
relati
vely stable, both year
-
over
-
year and sequentially. Plus, we continued to 
expand into new wireless growth areas of connected devices and tablets. 
Ralph will provide you more details in a moment. But mobile broadband is 
driving unprecedented growth in our in
dustry, and we're pleased with the 
results we're seeing.
 
We also continue to be pleased about the transformation of our Wireline 
business. U
-
verse continues to scale, helping drive consumer revenue per 
household up more than 6%, and strategic business reve
nues had its best 
quarter in more than two years. So on a number of fronts, it was a positive 
quarter and a good start to the year.
 
With that as background, let's look at detailed results starting with 
consolidated revenues on Slide 6. First quarter consol
idated revenue totaled 
$31.2 billion, up $717 million or 2.3% versus a year ago. That increase was 
due to double
-
digit wireless growth, continued U
-
verse growth of more than 
65% year
-
over
-
year and stable trends from our Business segment. You see 
these tren
ds transforming our revenue mix. In the first quarter, 74% of 
revenues came from wireless, from Wireline Data and Managed Services. 
That's up from 70% a year ago and 65% two years ago. Revenues from 
these growth areas were up more than 9% in the first quar
ter. We are well
-
positioned here, and we expect these trends to continue to drive top line 
growth for the company as we go forward in this year.
 
Now, I'd like to turn it over to Ralph de la Vega. Ralph, as you know, runs 
our Wireless and Wireline Consumer 
businesses for an update on those 
areas. Ralph?
 
Ralph de la Vega
 
Thank you, Rick, and good morning, everyone. It's great to be with you 
today. As Rick mentioned, we faced a lot of questions with another iPhone 
competitor entering the market. That made it a
 
little harder to predict what 
was going to happen in the first quarter, but, at the same time, we had 
confidence in our mobile broadband strategy, our network and our ability to 
compete.
 
Going into the quarter, we told you we had good plans in place. We t
old you 
about the stickiness of our customer base, and we told you we were 
prepared. I'm very pleased to say that not only did we deliver another solid 
quarter but, in many ways, we had our strongest first quarter ever. Take a 
look at some of our accomplis
hments on Slide 7: double
-
digit revenue 
growth, the best
-
ever first quarter net adds with gains in every category; 
best
-
ever first quarter smartphone sales, almost equaling our seasonally 
strong fourth quarter numbers; best
-
ever first quarter connected dev
ice net 
adds, continuing our strong performance in this area; and we continued to 
add branded computing subscribers, mobile devices such as tablets, air 
cards, MiFi and other data devices to our network at a strong pace.
 
We also posted year
-
over
-
year postp
aid ARPU growth for the ninth 
consecutive quarter as more subscribers added data services at record that 
none of our competitors can match. And in a quarter that we know could be 
volatile, we had postpaid subscriber growth. Even with these strong sales, 
wi
reless service margins were more than 40% when you exclude the Alltel 
and Centennial merger cost. All in all, an outstanding quarter especially 
when you consider the impact of the mergers. Without a doubt, it was a 
quarter that validated our strategy and o
ur ability to compete. This quarter's 
performance helps you understand why we're so excited about mobile 
broadband opportunities. We're just at the beginning of something really 
incredible. Mobile broadband has become the critical technology, driving 
growt
h and innovation. When you think about the additional capabilities to 
reach that the T
-
Mobile acquisition provides, you'll understand why we're so 
excited about this opportunity.
 
With that, let me cover wireless revenue on Slide 8. Our focus on mobile 
broa
dband continues to drive strong growth. Total wireless revenues were 
up $1.4 billion or up 10.2%, and wireless service revenues increased 8.6%, 
up more than $1 billion versus the first quarter a year ago. This includes 
growth in both data and voice revenue
s. Postpaid ARPU grew 2.4%, which 
includes pressure from the impact of the Alltel merger. Without this 
pressure, the increase in ARPU will be pushing 3% for the quarter. There's 
no better place to see the success of our wireless strategy this quarter than 
our net adds and churn, and this is covered on Slide 9.
 
Even in a quarter which we knew would be challenging, we added nearly 2 
million subscribers. This includes growth in every product category. 
Connected devices led the way. We added 1.3 million during 
the quarter. We 
also had positive postpaid net adds for the quarter, adding more than 
60,000. Excluding the negative impact of the merger integrations, postpaid 
net adds were around 165,000 in the first quarter. Prepaid net adds for the 
quarter were 85,000
, and we had another solid reseller quarter with more 
than 560,000 new subscribers. Even though iPhone exclusivity ended in the 
first quarter, the churn impact was minimal. Total churn was relatively stable 
with last year's level, and, excluding merger imp
acts, postpaid churn was 
stable sequentially and up only seven basis points from the first quarter last 
year.
 
If you dive a little bit deeper, iPhone churn by itself was the same year
-
over
-
year. And iPhone sales increased, which means we continue to grow o
ur 
iPhone base this quarter. Keeping churn levels low is critical to wireless 
growth and profitability, and that is why we have a strong upgrade program. 
We also built a sizable part of our postpaid base on family and business 
plans, about 80% overall, and
 
these customers are more loyal with lower 
churn rates. These results speak volumes about our wireless business. New 
customers are choosing AT&T and existing ones continue to stay with AT&T 
in record numbers.
 
Another part of the strategy that paid dividend
s was our focus on 
smartphones. The details are on Slide 10. Smartphone sales helped drive 
wireless data revenue growth of 24%, up nearly $1 billion year
-
over
-
year. 
We had our largest first quarter smartphone sales ever, signing up 5.5 
million customers, b
oth upgrades and new subscribers. The numbers of 
smartphones on our network increased by about 2.4 million in the quarter, 
up nine million in the last 12 months. These results reflect another strong 
quarter for iPhone activations, with more than 3.6 millio
n activated during 
the quarter. That's almost 1 million more than last year, with 23% of these 
subscribers new to AT&T.
 
We also had a strong quarter with other smartphones, selling more than 2 
million other smartphones this quarter. That's twice as many as
 
we added in 
the first quarter of 2010. This was driven by BlackBerries, Windows Phone 7 
devices and significant growth in new Android models. In fact, during the 
last six months, our monthly sales of Android devices have more than 
doubled. We still see a 
lot of upside here. About 46% of our postpaid base 
uses smartphones today, but our smartphone sales rate is approximately 
55%.
 
This quarter, we also began breaking up the number of branded computing 
subscribers added to our network. These are devices such 
as tablets, air 
cards and netbooks. We added more than 420,000 this quarter to reach 3.4 
million. That's about twice as many as we had 12 months ago. Most of these 
were tablets with more than 320,000 added.
 
These customers continue to choose AT&T for a rea
son. Network capabilities 
matter to them, a faster nationwide mobile broadband network, using voice 
and data simultaneously on their devices and international roaming to 224 
countries, thanks to our GSM network. All of these capabilities make a 
difference 
to our customers and they're a big reason we had such a strong 
wireless quarter.
 
As you might expect, our strong smartphone sales and high upgrade levels 
had an impact on margins, and the details are on Slide 11. Smartphones 
tend to have higher subsidies a
nd quick messaging devices than feature 
phones, but they also have a very attractive customer profile as well, with 
lower churn, higher ARPUs, which are about 1.8x our other devices, and 
strong data growth. That's why we implemented an aggressive smartphon
e 
promotion strategy in the first quarter, slightly increasing our advertising 
and marketing spend. You can see the results in our smartphone sales. In 
the first quarter, we had about 2 million more smartphone sales than we did 
in the first quarter of 2010
. About 9% of our postpaid base upgraded their 
device in the quarter, signing a new two
-
year contract with the company. 
Without the merger upgrades, about 8% of our base upgraded during the 
quarter. Again, that speaks volumes about the customers' confidenc
e in 
AT&T, especially this quarter.
 
These sales did impact wireless margins in the first quarter. Our wireless 
EBITDA service margin was 39%, down from the year
-
earlier quarter but up 
sequentially. Factoring in customer migration costs from the Alltel and 
Centennial mergers, service margin would have been 40.5%. Wireless 
operating income was up more than 30% sequentially to almost $4 billion.
 
Now let me take a moment to discuss our Wireline Consumer results on 
Slide 12. We had another strong quarter with our U
-
verse services. We've 
done an outstanding job scaling this business within the last few years with 
solid net adds, strong revenue growth
, growing penetration, strong voice 
and broadband attach rates, with growing triple
-
play ARPU and improving 
profitability. This helped drive our third consecutive quarter of year
-
over
-
year revenue growth in consumer Wireline. We added 218,000 U
-
verse TV 
su
bscribers in the quarter, bringing our total to 3.2 million, up about 
900,000 over the past year. Broadband and U
-
verse voice over IP rates 
remain very high. More than 3/4 of U
-
verse subscribers have a triple or quad 
play bundle with us, and ARPU for these
 
customers continues to grow 
significantly, up 15% year
-
over
-
year to reach almost $170. U
-
verse now is 
on an annualized revenue stream of approximately $6 billion. We also 
continued our recent trend of total wireline broadband net adds, up 175,000. 
Togethe
r, IP products now represent a $10 billion annualized revenue 
stream and nearly half of total consumer Wireline revenues, growing at over 
26% year
-
over
-
year. That covers wireless and consumer. I'd now like to turn 
it over to John Stephens to discuss wireli
ne business and consolidated 
results. John?
 
John Stephens
 
Thank you, Ralph, and good morning, everyone. Let's first take a look at 
business consumer trends, which are on Slide 13. What we are seeing so far 
in 2011 is consistent with the fundamental trends 
we saw last year. Revenue 
trends, while still down, have been stable the last three quarters, particularly 
when you adjust for the third quarter 2010 sale of our local Japan assets.
 
But there are some encouraging signs. Strategic business services, revenue
s 
from products such as ethernet, VPNs and application services were up 
almost 19%, our strongest quarter in more than two years. This drove 
business IP revenues up more than 8%, once again, led by the growth in 
VPNs. These results continued trends we have
 
seen throughout this 
downturn. Consistent investment in strategic business solutions and IP data, 
services that help drive productivity and efficiency. This has transformed our 
business wireline revenue mix. Data and other growth areas such as 
Managed Ser
vices now comprise 61% of our revenues, up 200 basis points 
in the past year. We expect the shift to continue as more and more 
businesses move to the cloud and IP
-
based solutions, areas where we are 
well
-
positioned. We also continue to execute well. Operat
ing expenses are 
improving, helping drive margin expansion. So there are some encouraging 
signs. Any economic improvement would be beneficial as we have not built 
an economic turnaround into our expectations this year.
 
Now, let's look at margins and cash f
low. Consolidated margin comparisons 
are on Slide 14. For the first quarter, margins were up sequentially but down 
from a year ago at 18.6%. On the wireless side, this reflects a couple of 
things. Merger integration and related costs that Ralph mentioned a
nd 
significantly higher smartphone sales. Our Wireline operating income margin 
was 11.5% in the first quarter, down slightly from the first quarter last year. 
We remain focused on cost initiatives throughout the company as evidenced 
by the total force redu
ctions of almost 6,000 this quarter. This helped offset 
margin pressure from declines in voice revenues and storm
-
related expenses 
that occurred in the last 
--
 
in the first quarter.
 
Our commitment to operate as One At&T continues to deliver financial 
benef
its as we consolidate and integrate wireless and wireline operations. 
And as we talked about operational efficiencies and simplify product 
offerings, we have continuing opportunities for cost savings. These initiatives 
are going well and help us sustain so
lid margins while also serving 
customers with a best
-
in
-
class operation.
 
Along with solid margins, we also continue to deliver a strong free cash flow. 
Our cash flow summary is on Slide 15. In the first quarter, cash from 
operations totaled $7.7 billion. C
apital expenditures totaled $4.2 billion, with 
more than 50% year
-
over
-
year increase in our wireless capital to reach $1.9 
billion. Free cash flow before dividends was $3.6 billion, and we made a 
dividend payment this quarter for $2.5 billion. In terms of 
other uses of our 
cash, we reduced debt by more than $1 billion in the first quarter and debt is 
down almost $4.5 billion over the past 12 months. Our net debt to EBITDA 
ratio is now at 1.53.
 
Our strong balance sheet and cash flow continue to give us the f
lexibility to 
invest in the business through both capital improvements and strategic 
acquisitions, while also returning substantial value to shareholders. With 
that, I will now turn it back to Rick for closing comments.
 
Rick Lindner
 
Thank you, John. Let me
 
recap the quarter on Slide 16. First, we're off to a 
good start for the year, with solid revenue growth in both wireless and 
consumer wireline and stability in our business markets. Second, we had 
another very strong wireless quarter, a performance that w
as particularly 
satisfying when you consider the challenges we faced. We told you last 
quarter that we expected positive contract subscriber growth for the year, 
even with the introduction of another carrier for the iPhone. And we 
delivered on that outlook
 
in the very first quarter. When you add in record 
first quarter net adds, strong sales of branded computing subscribers and 
higher postpaid ARPU, you can understand our confidence in the mobile 
broadband strategy and mobile broadband opportunity. We're al
so very 
pleased with the continued transformation of our Wireline business. In fact, 
fast
-
growing data and video services now exceed voice revenues in Wireline, 
thanks to U
-
verse and continued strong growth in strategic business 
services. And our financial
 
strength and cash flow remain strong, allowing us 
to return value to shareholders as we continue to invest in our business.
 
So we're off to a good start to the year, with solid first quarter operating 
results and a positive long
-
term outlook for the busin
ess. Brooks that 
concludes our prepared remarks. I think we're ready to take some 
questions.
 
Question
-
and

Answer Session
 
Operator
 
[Operator Instructions] We'll go to the line of Simon Flannery with Morgan 
Stanley.
 
Simon Flannery

Morgan Stanley
 
First, Ric
k, wishing you all the best on your retirement. You'll be missed. 
Thanks for your help. Ralph, could you update us on the LTE rollout? What 
are sort of the key steps you're going through right now? Where you stand? 
And then, what's the updated timing on PO
P coverage on that? And any 
updates you have on sort of network performance in some of the major 
markets that are currently? That would be great.
 
Ralph de la Vega
 
Sure, Simon. Our LTE rollout is on track and continues to move at the same 
pace prior to the 
announcement of the T
-
Mobile transaction. We're planning 
to commercially launch our service mid
-
year, and we plan to cover 70 million 
to 75 million POPs by the end of the year. Our network team is working 
around the clock doing the necessary modifications 
and building the 
network. We've got handsets and devices ready to go, so we're really 
excited. What I'm really excited about is we had a very good first quarter, 
and that we have not yet turned up our LTE capabilities. So I expect that 
future quarters, whe
n we have that capability in hand, will even give us 
better momentum.
 
Simon Flannery 
-
 
Morgan Stanley
 
And then on the network performance today?
 
Ralph de la Vega
 
The network performance today, Simon, is getting better. You know, we've 
got the nation's fast
est network, and it keeps getting faster. We saw an 
increase in national broadband speeds over the last six months. We've had 
solid improvement in voice metrics thus far this year, and we improved both 
voice retainability and voice accessibility. The only 
concern we have with 
network is the long
-
term capacity constraints that we face with Spectrum. 
And as you know, that's one of the things that will hopefully be relieved with 
the T
-
Mobile transaction.
 
Operator
 
Our next question is from John Hodulik with UBS
.
 
John Hodulik 
-
 
UBS Investment Bank
 
Just a couple of questions on wireless. Actually, Rick, in the past, you guys 
have said you thought the churn levels would be elevated in the first half 
and start to head down in the second half given the expiration of 
the 
exclusivity. Is this the kind of increase in churn? Churn was 
--
 
the increase 
is, certainly, much less than we thought. Is the kind of level that you think 
we should expect to see going forward here, maybe in the second quarter? 
Or do you think that th
e expiration of some of the contracts that you guys 
signed two years ago accelerates that a bit? And then, secondly, on wireless, 
the prepaid numbers, you have a net add to 85,000, a bit less than we 
thought. Verizon is testing some new prepaid plans. Is t
hat an area where 
you think you might need to get more aggressive?
 
Rick Lindner
 
John, I'll give you a perspective on churn and the impact there in the 
contract customers, and then I'll let Ralph address the prepaid wireless 
question. In terms of churn, fra
nkly, we expected a slight uptick in churn 
when another carrier launched the iPhone. Our expectations, I think we're 
generally less more modest in terms of churn increase than external 
expectations. We believed in our broadband strategy, our wireless strat
egy. 
We felt we were prepared for changes in exclusivity. And, actually, the 
results came in better than we expected. And as you heard from Ralph, 
there's very, very modest change in overall churn and in postpaid churn 
levels. And I think, one of the most 
surprising areas perhaps is the fact that 
iPhone churn basically stayed flat. It did not increase. And I think, as you 
know, as you think about what drove that and what caused those results, 
frankly, I think it had less to do with customers being under con
tract. Of 
course, we always work hard with our upgrade policy to keep customers 
under contract, and we do believe that it helps overall churn levels. But the 
fact is that, it was well known for months and quarters in advance that 
another carrier would laun
ch the iPhone. And yet, we continued to see 
customers upgrade their devices, enter into new contracts in the third and 
fourth quarters last year and in record numbers. And that continued into the 
first quarter this year when the phone was available on anot
her carrier. And 
the reality is, even if customers were under contract, they have the ability to 
break that contract, pay a termination charge and most likely, take that 
device that they had and sell it and recover most, if not all, of that contract 
termin
ation. So I don't think having customers under contract had that large 
of an impact. What I do believe has an impact is what Ralph touched on 
earlier, and that is the device. And you have to remember the iPhone is a 
device that carries a lot of data usage 
and a lot of data traffic. For heavy 
data users, being on our network, having a faster data experience, having 
simultaneous voice and data, having the ability for high
-
end users who do 
any amount of international travel to be able to use that device, not j
ust in 
the U.S. but around the world, all of those things were important to the 
iPhone customer base. And so I think that speaks as much as anything to 
what we saw in the first quarter and to churn levels. And as we go forward, 
based on what we've seen, ce
rtainly, to date, we're not expecting significant 
changes in those churn rates or in the iPhone churn rates as we go forward 
in the balance of this year. Ralph?
 
Ralph de la Vega
 
Yes, let me add a couple of thoughts, John, on that same subject and then 
I'll talk a little bit about our prepaid. One of the interesting things in the 
quarter to add to what Rick has said is that our momentum for sales actually 
increased throughout the quarter. What we saw happen early in January, 
when the iPhone was announced
 
to go to another carrier, is customers took 
notice, waited to see what was going to happen and once they compared, 
and they understood that on our network the iPhone works faster, that it has 
simultaneous voice and data, and it works in over 220 countries
, I think they 
made their choice, and we saw that increase in the February and March 
timeframe. So we're very pleased with the momentum. I think the 
customers understand the trade
-
offs, and they're making their choices. And 
I'm very, very pleased that our 
marketing message got through, and that we 
maintain and actually grew momentum throughout the quarter. In terms of 
prepaid, we continue to look at a number of things in prepaid. You probably 
saw that we just announced our first smartphone on prepaid with L
G. It's a 
low
-
end smartphone on the prepaid market. We think that there is the same 
level of interest in that market for data in a prepaid product. So we've 
launched it, and we think we have high hopes that, that will stimulate 
prepaid demand. But we conti
nue to look at all or other kinds of aspects of 
the prepaid business to grow it, but to grow it profitably.

Our next question is from Michael Rollins with Citi Investment Research.
 
Michael Rollins

Citigroup Inc
 
I wanted to just follow up on two 
things. First, on the business revenue side. 
Can you talk a little bit about how we should look at the stabilization in 
Enterprise and small business revenue, maybe what drove that in the 
quarter? And is this the turning point where maybe in the next few q
uarters, 
we could start to see some sequential growth take shape? And on the other 
side of the Global business segment, wholesale looked like it took a step 
down in the quarter. If could you talk a little bit more about what happened 
on that part of the Gl
obal business revenue?
 
John Stephens
 
Thanks, Mike. This is John. A couple of things with regard to the Enterprise 
space revenues. After taking into account the sale of our Japanese local 
asset business, we did see the stabilization and the trend. I think f
or us, it's 
the movement towards the IP and the strategic services which is helping us 
trend that. We have not planned for an economic turnaround, but, as that 
occurs, we will see those trends improve throughout this year and into next 
year. And I guess ou
r viewpoint would be that we would hope for positive 
revenue in that area in 2012. On a longer
-
term basis, we believe it to be a 
GDP or GDP
-
plus type business. On the small business side, the 
opportunities there are really in the data side in our IP DSLAM 
strategy, 
where we've got about 50% of our central office covered with the IP DSLAM 
capabilities, which is allowing us to provide some really competitive products 
in the data area. When you combine that with our unique position to provide 
mobile services, 
we believe we are seeing some traction in the small 
business area. But that has been tempered by the fact that business 
formations in that space are just really challenged right now. That's an 
economic matter that, I think, any participant in the market is
 
dealing with. 
Lastly, on the wholesale side, we just continue to see challenges on all 
aspects of that business as our customers continue to trim their networks 
and look for efficiency. And that's an area that we'll continue to focus on as 
we go forward.
 
Rick Lindner
 
Mike, this is Rick. I think just a couple of points I'd add, on the wholesale 
side and the wholesale numbers you're looking at, I think as we kind of 
disclose the breakdown of our business segments, we include, we group 
wholesale along with fe
deral and government, education and medical 
segments of the business. And so if you just look at our pure wholesale 
portion of the business, we've seen some improvement there. And, in fact, 
we've seen some nice results driven to a large degree by providing
 
Ethernet 
transport to cell sites for other carriers, but we are seeing some weakness in 
the government areas of the business. On the federal side, federal revenues 
are still growing year
-
over
-
year. But the growth rate in this quarter declined, 
and I think
, at least to some degree, that has to do with budget issues in 
Washington that are causing different agencies to tighten their belts a little 
bit. And that, of course, in the state area, the budget pressures there are 
having an impact. But wholesale by it
self is moving along pretty well. When 
you put it all together, our expectation as we go forward in this year, will be 
to see improvement in the revenue trends on a year
-
over
-
year basis, and we 
expect to see that as we move into the second, third and fourt
h quarters. I 
think the extent of that improvement and, certainly, the point in time when 
we get back to positive revenue growth in business is heavily dependent on 
the strength of the economy as we go forward in the balance of this year.

Our next
 
question is from David Barden with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
 
David Barden
 
Just questions. Number one, if we could return to the Wireline margin 
question, obviously, you guys highlighted a couple of qualitative issues. Can 
we talk a little bit more ab
out quantification in the quarter of maybe some of 
the seasonal step ups in the storm costs and how we should think about that 
margin, maybe lifting back up in the coming quarters? I mean, this was the 
first time in, I think, maybe 10 quarters that we actu
ally saw the total value 
expenses go up rather than down. And then I guess the second question 
maybe, Ralph, just on the ARPU side, could you talk a little bit about at this 
stage of the game, what's driving ARPU? Is it getting the feature phone subs 
into 
that $15 price tier? Was it really about selling these $50 iPhones and 
upselling guys who are already in the integrated device tier up to the 
smartphone level? What's really with the mechanics behind where ARPU's 
going today?
 
John Stephens
 
Greg, this is Jo
hn Stephens. On the first issue you had with the margins, 
quantifying the first quarter storm
-
related cost over time, maintenance 
repairs and some of the payroll tax issues, it's about 100 basis points or 
about $150 million. And so, we would expect that's 
included in this first 
quarter, and we would expect things to improve and grow margins going 
forward. Couple of other things that you were seeing that we're dealing with 
is with growth in our U
-
verse business, while very positive and a good story 
and good 
overall growth, brings with it some lower margins from our legacy 
products. I think you're familiar with that. But we do expect to see continued 
improvement in margins throughout the year. I'll hand the other question 
over to Ralph.
 
Ralph de la Vega
 
David,
 
the thing that is driving ARPU is our fundamental strategy to continue 
to move customers into smartphones with higher revenue data plans. So 
what we did this quarter, which worked extremely well, was to offer 
customers lower our price options to get into 
a smartphone, not just from 
the point of view of the price plans but also the device pricing. The iPhone 
3GS at $49 is selling very well. We also have the HTC Inspire and the 
Motorola Atrix, two brand
-
new Android devices that are selling very, very 
well. S
o what you see, are people that are stepping up from quick
-
messaging devices and feature phones and stepping up to the higher data 
plans, and that's what's driving ARPU.
 
David Barden
 
And if I could just quick follow up, Ralph. I know you guys shared 
smartp
hone penetration of the base this quarter. Can you share the 
integrated device penetration this quarter, which I think is something you 
guys have been sharing for the last couple of years?
 
Ralph de la Vega
 
I think that the integrated device penetration sta
yed approximately about 
the same level as we did last quarter. So we increased smartphones to 
integrated devices that are approximately the same level as they did last 
quarter, and we grew the overall smartphone base at the same time. So 
that's very positi
ve for us.

Our next question is from Craig Moffetwith Sanford Bernstein.
 
Craig Moffett
 
Can you drill down a bit on the wireless consumer versus Enterprise trends? 
It's not something you'd break out, but is it fair to assume that Enterprise 
wireles
s has started to show some acceleration, and, if so, what does that 
say about consumer on a net basis? And then, similarly, if you could just 
share a little bit about the porting ratios that you had outside of the iPhone. 
What were you seeing with respect 
to other carriers beyond just Verizon 
iPhone you met?
 
Ralph de la Vega
 
Greg, in terms of consumer versus Enterprise, we've had very good success 
on the Enterprise side, both in CRUs and IRUs. Our customers in the 
Enterprise side, of course, are just follow
ing this wave of growth that we're 
seeing with smartphones and, specifically, tablets. So we're very pleased 
with their results, and they complement the growth that we have seen in the 
consumer markets. So all that other metrics that we've talked about, ov
erall, 
are doing as well or maybe a little bit better on the Enterprise side. So we're 
very, very happy with the Enterprise results. In terms of the porting ratios, 
porting ratios since the beginning of the year and through the iPhone 
released to another c
ompetitor have actually gone up after our customers 
made their choices and started re
-
upping the contracts and signing up in 
what turns out to be a record quarter for smartphone sales. So we're very 
pleased with the performance of our Enterprise business, 
and we're also very 
pleased with the uptick in the porting ratios that we have seen subsequent 
to the launch.
 
Craig Moffett
 
Can you share any quantitation of either of those impact?
 
Ralph de la Vega
 
No, we do not provide that data publicly, Craig.

Our next question is from Mike McCormack with Nomura Securities.
 
Michael McCormack 
-
 
Nomura Securities Co. Ltd.
 
Rick, I'll test your math knowledge one more time before you step down. 
Just thinking about wireless margins, and we strip out the impa
ct of Alltel 
and Centennial, it looks like cash costs were up about $1 billion year
-
over
-
year and, obviously, you have your 2 million additional smartphones, 
including iPhones. But could you just helps us understand maybe the 
differences in SAT between an 
iPhone and a regular smartphone? And then 
just maybe secondarily, the impact of Verizon getting the iPhone with their 
marketing or advertising, is that sort of a one
-
time expense that you expect 
to go away?
 
Rick Lindner
 
I'm sorry, Mike. What was the last p
art of your question?
 
Michael McCormack 
-
 
Nomura Securities Co. Ltd.
 
When we think about that $1 billion cost increase year
-
over
-
year, how much 
of that is just incremental SAT related to smartphones and iPhones versus 
spending in advertising and marketing 
because of the Verizon iPhone coming 
online?
 
Rick Lindner
 
Mike, I think the majority of the cost increase and, certainly, the majority of 
the margin impact that you see year
-
over
-
year in our results is related to 
the smartphone sales and the increase in th
ose smartphone sales year
-
over
-
year. What we're seeing in the businesses is two factors that are impacting 
margins. One is higher upgrade levels. So those overall volumes in upgrades 
are higher, and then we're seeing a significant mix shift out of lower
-
en
d 
devices, some lower
-
end feature phones and even versus what we've seen 
the last couple of years, a lower mix in lower
-
end quick messaging devices 
toward smartphones. Now, obviously, there's some upfront costs to that. We 
believe there's significant advan
tages to that. Advantages in terms of 
customer satisfaction and churn advantages, significant advantages in ARPU, 
even when you go from a quick messaging device to a smartphone, there's a 
significant ARPU benefit there. But the actual cost by device depend
 
on the 
individual smartphones that you're selling, because those devices, as well, 
vary by device in terms of subsidy. But let me just leave it with the majority 
of that cost increase had to do with additional subsidies related to 
smartphones, along with 
--
 
obviously, we're putting a lot of investment into 
the network to handle the volumes and the traffic that we're seeing. And 
when you put that additional investment in, it increases our costs associated 
with cell sites and cell site leases, equipment main
tenance. There's a lot of 
trailing expenses, all the backhaul associated with it, and so those are the 
two areas where we're seeing some cost increases, and the cost increases in 
the network side associated, is really associated with volumes and revenues. 
And it's not having as significant an impact on the overall margin 
percentage. But the smartphone penetration, the upgrade volumes and so 
forth, is having more of an impact there. And that's something Ralph and his 
team are working very hard on in terms of
 
as we go forward, managing 
those levels and managing cost to drive margin improvement as we go 
forward in this year.

Nomura Securities Co. Ltd.
 
Rick, if you don't mind, just give us a little bit of detail on the stepdown in 
D&A. Is tha
t change in useful lives? Or is it something else that we should be 
thinking about?
 
Rick Lindner
 
No. If you look at depreciation itself, year
-
over
-
year depreciation itself was 
up slightly as you would expect. Amortization was down and that was simply 
merge
r
-
related amortization primarily in wireless but actually both in 
wireless and wireline that, that's just falling off. Within the depreciation 
categories, I think we did have a small decline in depreciation in the Wireline 
business but was more than offset
 
by increases in wireless. And on a net 
basis, consolidated, there was a small increase in depreciation.

Our next question is from Jason Armstrong with Goldman Sachs.
 
Jason Armstrong 
-
 
Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
 
In terms of that wireless trends thro
ugh the quarter, Ralph, you had some 
interesting comments on the trend rates seeing momentum improved 
through the quarter. I'm trying to get specifics here. Was this an iPhone
-
specific comment and, I guess, to what extent was this tied into the $49 
pricing
 
on the 3GS product that you have? Or was this more of a comment 
on broad momentum in wireless, i.e., you've weathered competitive LTE 
launches with Thunder Bolt, et cetera and really see holistically momentum 
improving through the quarter. And then, I gue
ss, second question is just on 
ARPU, does the rate of postpaid ARPU growth rate is positive relative to 
expectations this quarter? Are you comfortable that the rate of growth 
continues to improve from here? I guess you get some benefits from lapping 
Alltel
 
in 3Q so it's the momentum there, but are we comfortable that it 
continues?
 
Ralph de la Vega
 
Jason, this is Ralph. And, yes, what happened with momentum, it was, 
holistically, wasn't just to one specific device. What we really liked is that we 
had good mo
mentum from the iPhone portfolio but we also had some terrific 
momentum from the new Android portfolio. The sales of Android devices 
with the Motorola Atrix and the HTC Inspire, our brand new Android devices 
are off to a very good start. So we saw great im
pact on momentum from our 
iPhone portfolio but, also, the Android portfolio was very strong as were 
other devices. And so, holistically, it was a very strong quarter. Once the 
customers got over the load of what to expect, they saw what the 
competitor had,
 
and they made their choices. So I feel very, very strong 
about that. When it comes to ARPU, I feel even better because we have just 
begun to roll out the 4G Android devices, and we know we have LTE coming 
in the middle of the year and in the second half o
f the year, Jason. So my 
expectation is once customers get to see the mobile broadband strategy that 
AT&T has, where you're going to get a great LTE experience with these new 
devices, but then you're going to fall back to our HSPA+ capabilities so that 
the
 
transition from high
-
speed of LTE to high
-
speed of HSPA+ is almost 
seamless, is something they're going to love. That to us means higher ARPU, 
more data usage, and we feel very strongly that we're on the right path, 
promoting the right products. And with 
the network capabilities we're going 
to have by the end of the year, I feel it puts us in an even better position 
that we are in this quarter.

Crédit Suisse AG
 
Just followi
ng on from the wireless margin question, Rick, since this is the 
last time we'll have you, and congratulations again. Should we see margins 
in wireless expand during the course of the year as some of the pressures 
that you sort of built up for in the first
 
quarter from a cost perspective that 
you don't actually don't increase? And then over time, can we still get to 
mid
-
40s EBITDA margins in wireless given that the extra cost that 
smartphones bring with them?
 
Rick Lindner
 
Jonathan, are you hoping that 
since this is my last call, I'll give all the 
information that I wouldn't give in the past?
 
Jonathan Chaplin 
-
 
Crédit Suisse AG
 
Yes, if it's not too long, Rick. There's no cost. You could give it all to us. No, 
I was just thinking in terms of the wireless 
margin guidance just sort of 
comments that you have made in the past, I'm wondering if...
 
Rick Lindner
 
I got it, John, and I was just teasing you. In terms of wireless margins, and 
what we expect going forward, we do expect wireless margins to improve 
going forward in the year. One of the pressures as we talked about we had 
this quarter was with the migrati
on, primarily the Alltel and to some degree, 
the Centennial customer bases on to our network and our systems. And in 
order to make that migration because they're coming largely from another 
technology, we had to replace handsets, and there's a cost and sub
sidy 
associated with that. The first this quarter was from a margin standpoint the 
peak of that impact. We will see some impact going into the second quarter, 
but it will be less than what we saw this first quarter. And that migration, for 
all practical pu
rposes, will be complete by the end of the second quarter. 
And so we'll see a natural increase in margins as we go forward due to that 
change. In addition to that, as I mentioned earlier, there's a number of 
initiatives we are working to drive margin expan
sion and better margins in 
the wireless business. You saw us across the company reduce force pretty 
significantly this quarter, nearly 6,000. And some of that benefit will flow 
into the wireless business. And, certainly, it will benefit overall margins. Bu
t 
going forward, the individual quarter results can be impacted by specific 
product launches in those quarters. And obviously, the volume of 
smartphone sales and the volume of upgrades will impact individual 
quarters. But to your point, we do expect wirele
ss margins to improve, and 
our expectations and our planning still move wireless margins into the mid
-
40s that we talked with you about on a longer
-
term basis. With that, folks, if 
I can, let me offer just a couple of closing comments. First off, we entere
d 
this quarter and this year with some questions and some uncertainty, 
primarily related to the change in iPhone exclusivity and the impacts that it 
would have on our business. And as Ralph said in his remarks, hopefully, 
we've answered those questions. Wa
s there an impact from another carrier 
launching the iPhone? Well, the answer to that is yes, there was. We saw a 
very small increase in postpaid churn, and we saw a slight decline in overall 
flow share. But the impacts were significantly less than many in
 
the financial 
community and the media expected. And frankly, the impacts were less than 
we expected. And we continue to grow our postpaid base. We continue to 
grow our iPhone base. We continue to grow postpaid ARPU and had 
significant growth in wireless d
ata revenues. And I think that speaks to 
several things. I think it speaks, first of all, to the strength of our postpaid 
customer base and those specific customer relationships. I think it speaks to 
the ability of Ralph de la Vega's team to execute a plan
 
and to compete in 
the marketplace. And I think it also speaks to the strength of our wireless 
data network and our franchise overall. This quarter's results give us a base 
to build from and momentum for growth as we move into the second quarter 
and into t
he balance of this year. And beyond 2011, we look forward to 
closing our acquisition of T
-
Mobile and to delivering all of the benefits and all 
of the promise of a strong, nationwide wireless broadband network to our 
customers, to the nation and to our shar
eholders. One last thing before we 
end the call, as all of you kindly mentioned in your questions, I have 
announced my retirement, and this is my last earnings call with you. I would 
be remiss if I didn't tell you what a pleasure it's been working with all
 
the 
talented analysts and owners who have followed our company over the 
years. It's been an honor to have this position, and I know I'm leaving it in 
the very best of hands, with John Stephens and the rest of the AT&T team. 
And on behalf of that team, we 
want to tell you once again how much we 
appreciate your participation on these calls. And as always, we want to 
thank you for your interest in AT&T. And with that, I'll hand it back to our

Officer. Randall will discuss our 2013 highlights and then close with a 
strategic perspective in 2014 outlook and John will cover our results. Then 
we will 
follow up with questions and answers.
 
Let me remind you, our earnings material is available on the Investor 

Of course, I need to cover our Safe Harbor statement, which is on Slide 3

O, Randall 
Stephenson. Randall?
 
Randall Stephenson
 
Thanks, Susan and good afternoon everyone and Happy New Year. 2013 was 

formative year. We saw all competitors take out new posit
ions. We saw most 
of the players significantly changed the value proposition for their 
customers. And with smartphone penetration beginning to hit some 
impressive levels, we have seen new business models emerge around LTE in 
the cloud and our case that inc
ludes things like connected homes, connected 
cars, video and mobile business solutions.
 
So from our view, the most important development that we are seeing is 
that the entire U.S. telecom industry is investing aggressively in advanced 
networks. Today in th
e U.S., four national carriers and dozens of regional 

anywhere else in the world. The industry is now competing on price, 
customer service, technological innovation, and most importantly,
 
network 
coverage and quality. And we think this speaks volumes about where the 


approach as we move for
ward. Because of these things, the industry is 
helping and it is attracting a lot of investment.
 
So let me give you a few highlights and then what I am going to do is turn it 
over to John and he will take you through the details of the 4Q. First, our 
reven
ue and EPS growth finished right on track with our guidance. Cash 
generation was strong both from operations and from the monetization of 
non
-
strategic assets. For the full year, we invested $25 billion in CapEx and 
spectrum and then returned another $23 b
illion to shareowners through our 
dividend and share buyback programs.
 
We ended the year with really high
-
quality credit metrics and our pension 
plan funding is in great shape. And 2013 was our first year for Project VIP 
and we are well ahead of schedule a
cross the board. LTE deployment, U
-
verse expansion and fiber to the business, I would tell you, was a home run 

 
as a home run year by our Network Operations Group. In terms of LTE 

ar
e already closing in on that number. We expect to be essentially done by 
summer.
 
John is going to give you the details with growth on these platforms was 
very strong. Mobile data is now a $23 billion revenue stream and is growing 
at 17%. U
-
verse is more th
an $13 billion of annualized revenues and is 
growing at 28%. Strategic business services are now at $9 billion at a run
-
rate and the growth ramp throughout 2013 and it hit 17% in the fourth 
quarter we expect this growth rate to step up again this year. We 
have 

success with our AT&T net bond service. This combines our VPN network of 
cloud services from companies like IBM and Microsoft. What it does is it 
gives customers a secured connecti

public internet. Our mobile business solutions continue to scale, digital life 

about no contract wireless. We expect the Leap acquisition t
o close by into 

the AT&T network is going to shape things up in this space.
 
So if we go to slide 5, a year ago I told the team that 2013 would be the 
year of the network for us 
and that turned out to be an understatement. 
Today our network is best in class. We come out on top in all sorts of third 
party test for network quality and speed. In fact in a broad study of overall 

and shoulders 
about the field.
 
The chart on slide 5 shows you how we stack up and we think it's telling. 

our other national competitors are at twice the drop call rate or more. Th

the reason we posted record low fourth quarter postpaid churn.
 
At slide 6, you see our network puts us in a great position for what we think 

world ahead very different esti
mates on how fast it develops but I think 

these pervasive, superfast LTE networks with the cloud it changes 
everything. It changes every industry, every aspect of our society and the
 

smartphone wars to rethink on how we work, how we conduct commerce, 
how we learn and manage our healthy and so much more. In fact the visual 

It starts with the ultra
-
fast 
connectivity to the cloud, the smartphones are quickly becoming the remote 
control for disconnected world and the pace of innovation is accelerating and 

initi
atives like our U
-
verse 1 Gig launch down in Austin. These things give us 
the ability to drive innovation and then lead in the next ways of growth and 
so with that I want to turn it over to John to take you through the results.
 
John Stephens
 
Thanks Randall
 
and good afternoon everyone. Let me start with our 
consolidating financial summary which is on slide 7. As Randall said 2013 
was a solid year for our financial results. We grew consolidated revenues by 
almost 2% thanks to strong growth in wireless, U
-
vers
e and strategic 
business services. Consolidated margins were stable even with Project VIP 
expenses and record annual smartphone sales and we grew adjusted 
earnings per share by 8.2% for the year. Looking at the fourth quarter we 
finished the year with an e
xceptionally strong earnings per share 
performance. Reported EPS was a $1.31, however when you exclude 
onetime adjustments earnings per share for the quarter was $0.53 a 20% 
increase from a year ago. Adjustments include an $0.89 gain from the year
-
end mark
 
to market change for our benefit plans, the gain was driven by an 
increase in the discount rate as well as strong performance of our Benefit 
Plan Investments and a $0.02 gain from the sales of América Móvil shares 
was also one of the adjustments.
 
We also 
saw $0.07 of pressure from cost associated with an early debt 
repayment and a $0.06 charge for cost associated with employee retirement 
specifically an early retirement program as Randall mentioned. Our solid 
cash flow and strong balance sheet also allowed
 
us to be aggressive with our 
share buybacks. We repurchased more than 366 million shares for the year 
returning nearly $23 billion to the shareholders through dividends and share 
repurchases. And since we began our buyback program at the beginning of 
2012
 
we have bought back 737 million shares or about 12% of our 
outstanding shares.
 
All in all, we turn in a very strong financial performance for the quarter and 
for the year.
 

wirele
ss. Revenue and ARPU are on Slide 8. Strong wireless revenue growth 
was driven by the network strength and by data
-
hungry smartphones and 

continuing to grow growing at nearly 17%. That h
elped drive 4.8% service 
revenue growth and total wireless revenues were up 4.5%. Postpaid ARPU 
growth was strong. For the 20th consecutive quarter, we saw total postpaid 
ARPU growth as a record unmatched in the industry. And our postpaid 
phone
-
only ARPU i

than anyone else. We did have adjustments in the quarter that bring the 
run
-
rate closer to 3.7%, but either way, a very impressive performance. Our 
phone
-
only ARPU includes smartphones, but also incl
udes our low ARPU 
feature phones and wireless home phones, which make this growth even 
more impressive.
 

story is nothing short of exceptional. In a quarter, where we saw increased
 
competitive activity, strong seasonal promotions and competitive offers 
targeting our postpaid base, we turned in our lowest ever fourth quarter 
postpaid churn, a record of 1.11%. We are very proud of that. This helped 
drive a solid quarter of postpaid ga
ins with almost 600,000 net adds, 
including nearly 300,000 smartphone subscribers. And overall, we added 
more than 0.5 million branded smartphones in the quarter both postpaid and 
prepaid. We also added about 440,000 branded tablets as well. Network 
covera
ge and quality is the top reason customers choose AT&T and thanks 
to the high
-
performance of our 4G LTE networks. We have been very 
successful in attracting and keeping high
-
value postpaid customers. We are 
also taking steps to address the more value consc
ious customer. 
Competition for these customers is intense, but our network gives us an 
important advantage.
 
On the postpaid side, we have several initiatives underway, including new 
mobile share value plans and other targeted promotions. In prepaid, we 
hav
e made steady progress in adding smartphone subscribers. In the fourth 
quarter alone, we added more than 230,000 prepaid smartphones to our 
network that gives us a base more than 2 million prepaid smartphones. And 
ARPU for these customers is more than 70% 
higher than our non
-
smartphone prepaid base. Once the lead transaction is approved, we will be 
an even better option for value conscious consumers. We believe the cricket 
brand on our network will be a great combination.
 

ng smartphone base. Those details are on 
Slide 10. Smartphones continue to take a bigger share of our phone sales, a 
record 93% of our postpaid phone sales were smartphones in the fourth 
quarter. That increases our postpaid smartphone base by 1.2 million. 
For the 
full year, our postpaid smartphone base grew by nearly 5 million 
subscribers. Overall, 77% of our postpaid phone base are on smartphones 
that compares to about 70% a year ago. Smartphone sales were strong $7.9 
million in the quarter and data usage 
per smartphones continued to rise 
increasing by more than 50% year
-
over
-

response to AT&T Next, especially when we introduced the new mobile share 
value plans and sales improved throughout the quarter. Overall, more than 
15% of all smartphone sales during the quarter or AT&T Next sales with the 
sales percentage in company
-
owned stores much higher. These strong sales 
reinforce our belief that focusing on what the customer wants is the right 
move whether it's a new device ev
ery year or the ability to take advantage 
of bring your own device service plans we need to continue to focus on the 


eir 
credit profile. Overall this program is a great value for both our customers 
and us.
 
In the quarter we reached 7.1 million of mobile share accounts those 
accounts include more than 21 million postpaid subscribers or about 3 
subscribers per account. Tak
e rates on a high
-
tier data plans for both mobile 
share and pure data customers continue to be strong. In the last year the 
percentage of customers on those plans is nearly doubled growing from 13% 
to now 24% with about a third of the mobile share customer
s on plans of 10 
gigabits or higher. At the same time mobile share value plans are attracting 
customers who may not need such large data buckets.
 
The new plans offer customers more savings and provide no annual service 
contract options giving our existing 
and new customers even greater choice. 

by taking a look at the full year. For 2013 our wireless EBITDA service 
margin was 41.3% that is a 170 basis point increase from a year ago
 
even 
though we sold more smartphones during the year. There are a number of 
reasons for this improvement, revenue growth (indiscernible) throughout the 
year thanks to our expanding smartphone base and increasing data usage.
 
Second the strength of our netw

outstanding speed and reliability performance and great efficiencies as more 
and more customers upgrade their LTE devices more than half of our 
smartphone base are now on LTE capable devices. Our new upgrade policy 
al
so added a positive impact on margins as it's strong AT&T Next sales.
 
In the fourth quarter wireless EBITDA was nearly $6 billion an impressive 
35% increase over last year and wireless EBITDA service margin was 37.4% 
also much higher than a year ago. When 
you look at the full picture this was 
a very strong wireless quarter for us from churn to smartphone sales to 
margins to network performance, these solid results in a hotly competitive 
environment gives us confidence as we look ahead.
 
Now let me turn to 
our wireline story starting on slide 12. U

the year just as it started with strong subscriber gains increasing penetration

of nearly 3% in the fourth quarter. U
-
verse 
continued it's record of strong 
high speed broadband gains. We added 630,000 U
-
verse broadband 
subscribes in the fourth quarter and 2.7 million during the year. U
-
verse now 
represents more than 60% on a total broadband base. These subscribers not 
only have
 
a higher ARPU but churn is significantly lower as well.
 
We believe we have had a tipping point with U
-
verse broadband with the 
growing base of U
-
verse subscribers we feel confident that we can grow 
broadband subscribers even stronger this coming year. We 
also continue to 
excel in video. Well some companies are excited about actually gaining 
customers we added almost 200,000 subscribers in the quarter and nearly 1 
million for the year plus we had our lowest TV churn ever in the fourth 
quarter. That tells us
 
that customers not only want U
-
verse but they stay 
with us once they get it. But we expect to maintain this momentum. We 
continue to add new features such as TV everywhere which allows customers 
to view programming on smartphones and tablets inside their 
home and out 
and increased broadband speeds nearly 2/3rds of the U
-
verse TV footprint 
can now get speeds upto 45 megabits per second. U
-
verse is now a $13 
billion annualized revenue stream growing at 28% year
-
over
-
year and 
makes up 57% of our total consume
r revenues. U
-
verse was a solid story 
from start to finish during 2013 and we expect that to continue as we 
expand U

verse coverage with Project VIP.
 


eally good news. Strategic business service 
continues to be a bigger part of business services. Those service products 
such as VPN, Ethernet, cloud, hosting and other advanced IT services now 
make up more than 25% of business wireline and growth is acceler
ating up 
more than 17% year
-
over
-
year. We continue to see U
-
verse high
-
speed 
broadband growing in the business space. Increasing speeds and broader 
coverage open the door to new growth opportunities with small and 
medium
-
sized customers. We are also seeing
 
increasing momentum in cloud 
and integrated service offerings. We are one of the top cloud providers in the 
world and adding scale. For example, we already have more than an exabyte 
of virtualized storage. Much of this is driven by steps we are taking to 
move 
our own business processes to the cloud. Our goal is to be an entirely cloud
-
based enterprise within the next three to five years.
 
Our own IT operations are probably the most aggressive cloud operations 
around. So we are just selling cloud application
s. We are customers. We are 
users as well that helps focus us on developing new cloud
-
based products, 
such as NetBond. NetBond helps our customers safeguard their information 
by extending their virtual private networks into the cloud, which functions 
like 

NetBond reduces latency by up to 50%, which means that businesses have 
access to the data almost instantly. We believe NetBond will drive even more 
growth.
 
We already are the VPN mark
et leader with a multi
-
billion dollar annual 
business and we had our best fourth quarter VPN growth in years. These 
growth products help transform our revenue mix, but we still saw lower 
revenues in the quarter. Total revenues were down 3.4% versus the yea
r 
earlier quarter and we are essentially flat sequentially. Business service 
revenues declined 2.4% year
-
over
-
year. Behind all of this are the overall 
economic trends. The outlook is still uncertain. Customers are still delaying 
buying decisions. Business 
starts lag to slightly better than a year ago. And 
unemployment is slowly improving. The labor force participation is the 

hopeful that we will see an improving economy to get th
is part of the 
company growing again.
 

Project VIP expenses, U
-
verse gains and record
-
breaking annual smartphone 
sales, consolidated margins remained relatively stable. Wireless mar
gin 
improvements help offset this pressure. For the year, our adjusted 
consolidated margin was 18% compared to 18.2% last year. This pressure in 
wireline was expected. Much of it is tied to Project VIP and other success
-
based initiatives. We had almost 1 m
illion new U
-
verse TV subscribers and 
they were trailing expenses from VIP investments and depreciation expenses 
were also higher.
 
We continue to take steps on the cost
-
cutting side as well. This includes the 
introduction of project Agile. Project Agile is
 
a major new initiative that is 
transforming how the company organizes and operates around customers to 
deliver a best
-
in
-
class customer experience as an all IP, all mobile and all 
cloud services company. You see considerable opportunity to reduce cost 
thr
ough simplifying processes, standardizing platforms and making our 
customer interactions effortless and efficient. Randall will talk more about 
this initiative in just a few moments.
 

f
rom operations totaled nearly $35 billion. Capital expenditures were 21.2 
billion as we deployed Project VIP and free cash flow before dividends was 
13.6 billion. This was impacted somewhat by the tremendous success of 
AT&T next. We also have been very opp
ortunistic in monetizing some of our 
assets this includes the tower transaction Crown Castle, sales of some of our 
América Móvil shares and sales of some of our real estate assets. These 
items generated $7 billion in cash for the year and nearly 6 billion 
in 
additional cash in the fourth quarter alone.
 
All this and free cash flow generated about $20 billion in cash during the 
year and strengthened our cash position. Our balance sheet remains solid, 
net debt (indiscernible) during the year however our averag
e effective 
interest rate is down compared to last year thanks to debt refinancing early 
repayments to debt and at historically low interest rate and a net debt to 
adjusted EBITDA ratio 1.73 is well below our 1.8 target and down from the 
third quarter even
 
with our Project VIP investments.
 
In addition to investing in our business we also return substantial value to 
shareholders for the year. We repurchased about 366 million shares for 
around $13 billion. We make dividend payments for the year totaling nearl
y 
$10 billion. This makes our total return to shareholders for the year by at 
$23 billion and in the last two years we returned more than $45 billion a 
record unmatched in the industry.
 

 

year? On adjusted basis we expected upper single digit EPS growth, 
continued revenue growth, did wireless and consumer wireline and stable 

vered. We set out ambitious 
Project VIP targets increased them during the year and still came in ahead of 

support our Project VIP deployment. Once the deal is closed we will take a 
loo
k at how it will impact our cell sites bill plans and densification initiatives.
 

cash flow. We also took several steps to manage our debt helping reduce the 
cost of debt even as we inv
ested in future growth and through it all we 
remain focused on the shareholder returning substantial value through 
dividends and buybacks. All together a solid year during a transformational 
time in our business and I will turn it back to Randall to talk t
o you a little bit 
more about that transformation. Randall?
 
Randall Stephenson
 

expect from us in 2014. I will reiterate what we laid out when we Project VIP 
and that was 2014 is our pea
k year for VIP investment and our outlooks is 
very consistent with that original plan. We will continue to be aggressive on 
the network front. We expect to hit our LTE coverage target ahead of 
schedule this year. We also have a big effort in terms of netwo
rk 
densification and cell sites. We will further ramp our U
-
verse and business 
fiber builds, video we believe is a big growth opportunity so we have a major 
initiative to make our network the best in class for video delivery for both 
wireline and wireless 

our network to shift functionality from hardware to software. And overtime 
we believe the pay
-
offs in operating efficiency and speed to market are 
going to be significant. In terms of our investments an
d growth, mobile data 
and U
-
verse while they are beginning to scale to very large businesses in 

holds for our strategic business services. As John pointed out with the 
Cricket bra
nd on top of the AT&T network you should expect us to be 
disruptive in the no
-
contract space this year.
 
We have a number of new services that we will begin to move the needle 
this year. We will Digital Life into a number of more markets. We have taken 
a le
adership position and connected cars, we have already announced 
agreements with GM and Ford, Nissan, Audi, BMW, Tesla and there are more 
to come.
 
And as I mentioned we have a number of new cloud, security and mobile 
solutions for business and in parallel w

operate. We have a major effort this year to re
-
architect our enterprise 
customer experience, rethinking every step in the end to dramatically 
shorten our intervals. Across our business, we are driving to make 80% of 
our cust
omer interactions digital and online by 2020 and Project Agile is all 
about streamlining operations around an all IP cloud and mobility experience 
and is a first step about 5,600 employees took voluntary retirement in the 
fourth quarter. Most of those were
 
management employees. We have 
additional Project Agile initiatives underway, which will require some 
investment and we expect run rate savings in the $3 billion range by 2017.
 
If you go to Slide 18, it lays out our financial expectations for 2014. They 
ar
e very much on track with what we laid out for you. We launched Project 


include any impacts from our planned Leap ac
quisition. We expect stable 
consolidated margins with adjusted EPS growth in the mid
-
single
-
digit range 
and this does not factor in any future share buybacks. And we expect cash 
from operations in the $32 billion range.
 
2014 capital will be in the $21 bill
ion range exactly what we laid out earlier 
for Project VIP with savings from our original plan offset by capital for Agile 
and some new network projects. And again, we expect 2014 will be our peak 
investment year for Project VIP. And with the step up in ca
sh taxes, we 
expect free cash flow this year in the $11 billion range with similar levels for 
2015. Post VIP we expect free cash flow and dividend coverage to trend 
back to the historical levels. We also expect cash from divestitures from 
some non
-
strategi
c assets and all of this is based on some rather 
conservative assumptions, that includes U.S. economic growth of around 
2%.
 
Finally, I know everyone saw the filing we made with UK Takeover Panel 
yesterday. I think the statement speaks for itself. We have t
alked in the past 

Again, we are on track with and in most cases we are ahead of what we 
committed to you where we rolled out Project VIP. We have a lot of 
opportunity ahead of us. The initia
tives we are executing have really good 
payoffs in terms of growth and cost structure. And 2014 is going to be a 
very productive year for us. So Susan, with that, I think we are ready for 
questions.

Okay,
 
thank you very much. Randall, just very quickly, can you just give us 
some color on exactly why you have at this point you had to file with the UK 
Takeover Panel? And then John on the free cash flow, can you just give us a 
little bit more detail around th
e cash taxes and what the impact is in 2014 

number? And is there any impact on working capital from the Next program 
as that starts to ramp this year as well? Thanks.
 
Randall Step

Yes, hi Simon. In terms of the, they call it a 2.8 announcement we made in 
the UK yesterday, anytime you get a lot of noise around any kind of M&A, 

that are being mentione
d and ask them to make a declaration. And so we 
were contacted over the weekend because of a lot of press surrounding us in 
Europe and asked to make a declaration. So we have made the declaration 

 
technical 
requirement by the panel.
 
Simon Flannery

Morgan Stanley
 
Thank you.
 
John Stephens
 
Simon, on the free cash flow, I will take it from the standpoint of we are 
expecting that $32 billion of cash from operations in the $21 billion range 
and on 
CapEx is the biggest generator. When you look at the $32 billion and 
you compare it to this year, the major changes is the pickup in cash taxes, 


t does incorporate continued growth in 
the Next program and it does incorporate what is effectively pressure from 

the same things are happening, we will have certainly continued 
tax 
pressure, but we will also have growing, we would expect to have some 
growing pressure for Next and some growing and strong I should say CapEx 
but our operational improvements and our revenue growth and our 
profitability improvements will allow us to c
over that and keep it stable and 
keep as very comfortable in our coverage ratios.

Please go ahead.
 
Mike McCormack 

 
Jefferies
 
I guess it's good for the industry that the consumers are back to being 
willingness to pay for full handsets. Maybe John just your 
thought on recent 
in the current quarter the impact of Next on churn and then looking through 
the tracking of throughout the quarter obviously December very strong 
month. Is there a seasonality for that or should we be thinking about or how 
should we be th
inking about percentage growth adds or upgrades as we 
progress through 2014 and then secondarily your comments regarding 
Cricket, is there something to be read through that meaning that some of 
these folks who are getting EIP contracts from the industry [p
h] maybe will 
be better off in the Cricket type product or when we say shake things up I 

 
John Stephens
 
So let me take a couple of the questions Mike and kind of go from there. If 
you look at where we were at 
the end of the third quarter we had about 
10% of our handset sales being through the next program. During the fourth 
quarter that grew for the overall fourth quarter we had about 15% for about 
a 1 million handsets sold under the Next program and we came ou
t of the 
quarter at about 20%. We continue to see strong sales in the first quarter so 

for our customers. They like the program, the last thing is accusing it and 
certainly we like
 

on the churn I would suggest you that the award
-
winning customer service, 
our retail stores, give our customers and a really great network performance 
are also really significant factors in that 
real reduction in our churn rate in 

believe it's the network performance, it's the sales efforts, the quality 
service and quite frankly the good choices including that our mark
eting team 
has put out there.
 
Randall Stephenson
 
Hey Mike as it relates to the Leap acquisition we have spent the last 6 or 7 
years chasing capacity in our network build and we have been very reluctant 
to move down market because we have some very, very hi
gh value 

network quality and capacity there. As we make the move to LTE and as we 
continue to push the network build and create capacity it's created a whole 
new opportunity for us to thin
k about the value segment and the no contract 
segment and as we get into the Leap acquisition as we really study the 

believe that if that end of the market as you pull it a no c
ontract type service 
on top of an AT&T network our coverage, our quality, our performance we 

can grow from a couple of standpoints and that is what we have seen in 
terms of moving s
martphones, deeper, deeper penetration on postpaid that 
play has yet to be run in the prepaid segment in a meaningful degree and 
you should expect this to be very assertive and very aggressive to push 
smartphone penetration in the no contract space and to 
be aggressive as it 


more excited about it the closer we get to closing in the first quarter.

Hey guys, a couple. One, Randall, just to 
follow
-
up real quick in your 
regulatory conversations the last week, have you learned anything new, no, 
not necessarily about you, but of U.S. companies ability to buy assets in 
Europe whether those are NSA issues or otherwise? And then second John, 
given 

that the days of big buybacks are pretty much over for now. Is there any 
room to raise the leverage there? Thanks.
 
Randall Stephenson
 
Yes. So, Phil, I was in Davos actually and I had an 
opportunity to meet with 
several folks, there were administrations and policymakers and so forth. And 
my main objective for last week as it related to those conversations was we 
have had some business impacts from the NSA revelations and they have 
not been
 
inconsequential. We are having customers ask us a lot of 
questions. We are having policymakers ask us a lot of questions and is 
affecting our ongoing business today irrespective of anything that might 
relate to some M&A or whatnot. And so I was really the
re to discern what 
was the attitude and the disposition and try to help formulate our own plans 

the Friday before, I think that speech was helpful in terms of the 
policymakers i
n Europe understanding where the administration here. The 
President is going on beta data collection and so forth. And so I would tell 
you it was net
-
net a productive set of discussions and I feel like we have a 
path just as it relates to our ongoing busin
ess operations there today.
 
John Stephens
 
Phil, let me comment on your questions with regard to buybacks. First and 

really good about our balance sheet, you can see that our debt ra
tios are 
well within line and are within our previous guidance that we have been able 
to generate strong cash from operations, but quite frankly, we have also 
been able to generate strong cash from asset monetizations, not strategic 
assets. And we still be
lieve we have opportunities there. As the set 
transaction, announced transaction would imply, so I feel very comfortable 

being said, our assumption is the business plan and our g
uidance that we 
gave, it was not based on additional buybacks. We will continue to buyback 
opportunistically. I will tell you we have about 160 million shares left on our 
authorization, so that would give you a gating factor unless our board will 
give us m
ore guidance. But we feel real good about our payout ratios and 
where our balance sheet is. It remains very strong.

Okay, thanks. Maybe Randall, could you comment on the competitive 
environment you are currently seeing in the wireless market and maybe look 
out to when you are expecting 

 

I gu
ess specifically with T
-

promotion that really targets family plans, I mean is that something that you 
see is more of a significant change in the competitive landscape or just sort 
of more of the same prom
otion that we see in the past? Thanks.
 
Randall Stephenson
 
Yes, hi John. As I have mentioned in my opening comments, it was a 
formative year for the industry. And I would tell you what is probably most 
interesting to me as we look at what has played out in 
2013 and carried into 
the first month of 2014 is the idea that our customers are demonstrating an 
interest desire even to put more of their money into the handset in 

the marketplace r
ight now. More and more customers are moving to the 
handset financing plans picking up more of the cost of the handset with the 
desire to have a lower monthly rate. And so we are seeing that play itself 
out.
 
And you are seeing kind of the whole market move
 
there, all players are 
introducing these kind of plans and our customers are loving it. You heard 
John talk about the take rates and now in December, 20% of all of our 
smartphone sales were on these types of arrangements. And so one can say 

reat margin opportunity, but then your turnaround to 
reinvesting it back into the customer in terms of better pricing in the 

to the impact on competition, there is a lot of nois
e, but at the end of the 
day we study this nine ways to Sunday and we have made a lot of moves in 
the marketplace ourselves and fourth quarter churn was the lowest fourth 
quarter churn we have ever experienced and it just continues to reinforce 
that you ha

have your ears to the ground and attuned to what the customer expects that 
you better have a high quality network experience both data and voice and 
we really, really feel good about what was acc
omplished in 2013 in terms of 
network quality. Again our voice quality is on par with the best in the 
industry, in the United States and when you look at everybody else in the 

competi

no doubt that you will see that continue, I have no doubt that you will see us 
continue all to modify our value propositions but as I pointed our earlier I 
think what you will see us ge
t most competitive is moving down into the 
value space with the Leap acquisition and using the Cricket brand.

Two if I could, first Randall
 
obviously without a win for the carriers net 
neutrality space you guys are out at CES with some of your sponsored data 
trials visible for the marketplace. Obviously Ed Whitacre kind of started this 
con
versation many years ago with the marketplace. Could you kind of tell us 
how you see the next steps unfolding and when if ever we might be able to 
see a real monetization of this opportunity? And then second John just for 
you on the EPS guidance two pieces
 
I wanted to talk about just one 

-
over
-
year from the 
ending share count relative to the mid
-
point of 2013 and then obviously on 

booked 
for a fifth of the customers coming in the door than we do under the 
old plans, by my math we should see roughly a $1 billion more revenue 

going to be about another 4% or 5% ben

earnings per share growth year
-
over
-
year before we have even started to 
work on the business. Could you kind of talk about (Audio Gap)
 
Randall Stephenson
 
For the last couple of years the industry came together and worke
d and 
agreed to a framework as it related to net neutrality, the SEC promulgated 
into rules. We did have this court order. From our standpoint David that 


ng to change much of what anybody in the 
industry will do. As you pointed we introduced our sponsored data plans 
which you know the easiest way to articulate it is like 1800 data where 
companies may want customers to access their content and they would be 


perfectly volunteer it's opened to any company that might want to do this, 
you think about the kin
d of situations that are driving this moving on and it's 
very interesting. So for example UnitedHealth they have a number of young 
mothers who are not getting good education and training on prenatal care 
and obviously it's driving their healthcare cost up.
 
UnitedHealth says we 
have a lot of information, a lot of data. We want to motivate these young 
women to come watch and to take advantage of and they say if we would 
like to pay for it to make sure that there are no constraints, nothing gets in 
the way fro
m these women taking advantage of these training to address 

motivation and incentives for these young mothers to be to take advantage 

the argument against those types 
of services would be.
 

the same way the long distance industry grew and scaled and I think mobile 
data and mobile internet services will follow so
me of the same paths. So 

anything in terms of how we operate or most anybody else in the industry 
for that matter.
 
John Stephens
 
David on your second question a couple of quick comments
, we are giving a 
guidance of that EPS growth in the mid
-
single
-
digits range. You are right we 
will get a little lift underneath the wings from the buybacks that took place in 

expect so
me benefits not only from that, but also from our 24
-
month 
upgrade cycle. But I will tell you some of the customers on Next, while they 
are electing that, they are also as Randall mentioned electing to do, to 
choose the bring your own device pricing platfo
rms. And so those benefits 
from Next just may be moving from our service revenues. And you will see 
the different mix of revenues with the equipment and service, but we are 
positive about the wireless market and about continue to expand margins.
 
On the con
sumer side, U
-
verse is doing great. We continue to expect to see 
growth. You saw the kind of numbers they posted on video in the fourth 
quarter and early on for the year as well as high
-
speed broadband with 
initial footprint. We are real optimistic there. 
Business is still challenged with 
strategic services are going great. The base is up to 25% we expected to 
expand. And with that expansion, it should come out to expand the growth 
rate. So one of the challenges, well the challenges are in a real slow 
econo
my, lack of investment by the private sector in the U.S. economy. And 
quite frankly, we still have 

 
well, we have made a lot of progress in our 
voice, legacy voice headwinds and we brought that from what it was in 2011 
by 22% of our revenue base is now do
wn to 17% and in the fourth quarter 
down to 16%. We still have to overcome those challenges in a low 
employment slow economy environment. When you put that all together, we 
are optimistic about the year, but we are at that mid
-
single
-
digits guidance.
 
David
 
Barden

Bank of America Merrill Lynch
 
Got it. Thanks John. Thanks Randall too.
 
Randall Stephenson
 
You bet. David, I would just add on that if we can get some type of U.S. 
economic growth in that 3% to 4% range, it changes the equation for a lot 
of us. An
d I am hopeful, I am not yet optimistic, but I am hopeful and you 
can assume that we, AT&T and the business community in general, are 
going to be pushing an agenda. I hope to hear the President speak on 
several of these issues tonight, first and foremost, 
business tax reform. I 

greater extent than the business tax reform. And I do believe the 
administration and Congress are all supportive. Here is an area where 
everybody has coalesced 
and it seems like its right for getting done. Trade is 
obviously huge and immigration report, everybody is talking about these. 
Everybody in Congress, the administration is expressing a desire and a need 
to get this done. If you could just get a couple of 
these done, I think it takes 
us 2% to a 3% plus growth profile and that does change our view of this is 
what.

Thank you. Our next question in queue will come from the line of Joe 
Mastrog
iovanni with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
 
Joe Mastrogiovanni 
-
 
Credit Suisse
 
Thanks. John, you have been able to find opportunities to monetize some 
non
-
core assets, do you see any additional opportunities as we move 
forward and how should we think 
about the use of the capital from these 
types of transactions?
 
John Stephens
 
So I think, Joe, thanks for your question. First and foremost, we are always 
looking for opportunities. The most recent example of that was the 
announcement of the Southern New En
gland Telephone transaction at $2 
billion, the transaction we expect to close at the end of the year. I will tell 
you that we will continue to look at things like real estate, like we did last 
year with other opportunities. In a company of our size with a 
quarter of $1 
trillion balance sheet and a company that has the history, a 100
-
year
-
old 
plus company, we have opportunities. We will continue to search those out. 
And as some of the economics on real estate and other things improve, we 
are optimistic about
 
those. With that being said, we are going to keep our 
balance sheet strong like we always had. We are going to keep our credit 
metrics strong as we have and we are going to be opportunistic with the use 
of that cash. We feel good about where we are at, fe
el good about our, I 
think how we treated our shareholders and our ability to continue to keep 
that in the forefront as we invest for our customers and our employees.
 
Joe Mastrogiovanni 
-
 
Credit Suisse
 
And do you think this could maybe give you an opportun
ity to ramp some of 
those buybacks as we have seen it slow over the last couple of quarters?
 
John Stephens
 
Well, with certainly all of those things that we have taken into account as we 
make those decisions, but I do want to make sure I am clear on the 
gui
dance that for next year, our EPS guidance did not assume a ramp up in 
the economy and did not assume any buybacks. And as we said before, we 
are going to be opportunistic with our buybacks and make sure that they are 
done from a position of strength as we
 
have been doing, as we continue to 
remain with a strong balance sheet.

Just one question on the balance sheet side, you
 
had made a move on the 
pension plan to fully fund that. I wanted an updated on the preferred equity 
contribution if you could and then on the wireless side, the postpaid gross 
additions I know that this is a top quarter with some of the moves that were 
go
ing on but I was wondering if on the high
-

to accelerate itself in anyway? Thanks.
 
John Stephens
 
So first and foremost with regard to the (indiscernible) funding. We continue 
to work with the Department of Labor for an offic
ial approval that process 
continues to go well for purposes as we had filled and we publically stated 
we have made the contribution, we did that in September of last year and 
when you look at our audited pension financial statements this year they will 
be 
essentially fully funded. They will be at the 99.8% or a 100.2% funding. 


complimentary about the work in 
the way we have been respected by the 
individuals at the Department of Labor. They have been good to work with. 


w what 
has been just a great business for us. As Randall
 

respond not just the competition but what our customers want and we will 
continue to focus on offerings and products that will allow us to do that. I 

 
looking at sustainable growth, profitable growth, 
growth that gets for both us and the customers not growth that does not 
make economic sense long term.

First for Randall
 
if you go back to your page 6 diagram, how much of your 
strategy do you want to be the enabler of these applications with your 
network versus out rightly owing the applic
ations that scale when you 
compare it to a la carte alternatives? And John if I can broader question, 
back on the dividend coverage how should investors be thinking about the 
coverage aspirations that AT&T has on a two year view and how should they 
think a
bout how much comes from growth in revenue or cash flow from 
operations versus lowering the CapEx overtime? Thanks.
 
Randall Stephenson
 
Michael on enabler versus owing the end user or the finished service, answer 
to the question is yes and it depends. As yo
u think about LTE and cloud 
capabilities there are some we will take it all the way through the finished 
service. Classic example of that would be home security and home 

monetizing at a r

enabling other people via APIs and capabilities to monetize through us 
providing a secure environment for cloud services (indiscernible) we have 

t the retail level as well. 

allowing companies to come and put their devices and their applications and 
use our network services to accommodate that. We think this is a rather 
sizeable 

Isis where Verizon and T
-
Mobile are partners in that JV that is a finished 
service. So it's going to cover the gamut. We think the opportunities are 
really large, the connected car is probably 
going to be both.
 
They are going to be subscribers who the car is like an additional device, 
they add
-
on to their data bucket but the auto manufacturers will look at us 
as a platform and they will sell finished services in the car through our 
connected cap
ability as well. So again to answer your question is yes, all of 
the above.
 
John Stephens
 
Mike we forgot the dividend coverage, let me reiterate we feel very 

continuing revenue growth, wi
th the opportunities that the VIP network 
platform provides it's not only for products and services and revenue, but 
quite frankly for efficiency through Project Agile. We believe that you will see 
us trend fairly quickly to historic 

 
more historic levels
 
of dividend coverage. 
And quite frankly, I am opportunistic that we can get to better than that. I 

-
quality IP networks as well as the revenue growth that comes from those 
products.

On the churn front, I mean, certainly you reported the lowest fourth quarter 
postpaid churn co
ming out of you folks, given some of the recent initiatives 
in part launched by you folks during the quarter for carriers to absorb ETF 
fees, should we expect your postpaid churn and perhaps the industries for 
that matter to go up here given what seems to 
be more increased flexibility 
to shift between competitors?
 
Randall Stephenson
 
Good question and thank you for that. Let me give you a couple of 
comments. First of all, our churn improvements were not just in our wireless 
business and we are very proud of 
those, but I need to point to you that we 
had really great performance in U
-
verse churn and consumer video churn. 
So we are really pleased with churn and an overall customer satisfaction 
with this network quality we have. Secondly, I will tell you that whe
n people 
talk about things like floating ratios and offers for ETF, the real measure of 
the network and the real measure of customer satisfaction is churn, floating 
issues or ETF issues are a subset of that. Historically, about a third of our 
customers who
 
made a change ported their numbers, about two
-
thirds 



nce between those 
customers who made a change with or without porting. Well, we certainly 
have a competitive environment and we are certainly going to keep our eye 
on the ball and make sure that we continue to respond to what customers 
want in a sustainabl
e process, but we think those are the driving force, 
those choice manage the driving issues not necessarily just one ETF offer or 
another.

Randall Stephenson
 
So with that, let me take this moment to thank all of you for being on the 
call with us today. We close the year with a solid performance, solid quarter 
and a solid year. Our growth platforms are go
ing strong. Our wireless 
network is best

in
-
class and our capital structure is solid. And as Randall 
mentioned, we are positioned well for 2014. Focused on growth, we have a 
solid achievable plan that will help us get there. Thanks again for being on 
the c
all. And as always, thank you for your interest in AT&T. Have a good 
evening.

Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the AT&T 
Third Quarter 2011 Earnings Release. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, 
today's call is being recorded. With that being said, I'll turn the conference 
over to 
Brooks McCorcle, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations, Finance. 
Please go ahead.
 
Brooks McCorcle
 
Thank you, John. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our third quarter 
conference call. It's really great to have you with us this morning. As John 
men
tioned, this is Brooks McCorcle, head of Investor Relations for AT&T, and 
joining me on the call today are John Stephens, AT&T's Chief Financial 
Officer; and Ralph de la Vega, AT&T's President and CEO for Mobility and 
Consumer Markets. John will cover our 
consolidated and Wireline results, 
and Ralph will give us an update on our Wireless business. Then, we will 
follow with Qs&As. Let me remind you that our release, investor briefing, 
supplementary information and the presentation slides that accompany this 
call are all available on the Investor Relations page of the AT&T website. And 
as a reminder, that's www.att.com/investor.relations.
 
I also need to reference our safe harbor statement, which is on Slide 3, and 
that says that this presentations 
--
 
this pres
entation and the comments that 
we'll make this morning may contain forward
-
looking statements. And as 
you know, they're subject to risks and details can be found in our SEC filings 
and on AT&T's website. Before I turn the call over to John, let me quickly 
call 
your attention to Slide 4, which provides the financial summary. Earnings 
per share for the quarter was $0.61, a 13% increase over last year's 
earnings per share, excluding onetime gains and up 3.5% year
-
to
-
date. This 
includes pressure from storm and 
T
-
Mobile transaction
-
related expenses in 
the third quarter. Our consolidated revenue was stable and consolidated 
operating margin was up 260 basis points year
-
over
-
year and stable 
sequentially, thanks to our best wireless service margins in 6 quarters and 
continued strength in Wireline business. Cash flow was superb. Cash from 
operating activities for the quarter totaled $10.4 billion and free cash flow 
was $5.1 billion, which brings us to $12.4 billion through the year. That's 
even with the increased inves
tment in capital expenditures that we told you 
about last quarter. With that quick overview, I will now turn the call over to 
AT&T's Chief Financial Officer, John Stephens. John?
 
John Joseph Stephens
 
Thanks, Brooks, and good morning to everyone on the call
. Before I cover 
results, let me provide a quick comment on our planned T
-
Mobile merger. 
The SEC review is continuing and on the DOJ front, we're hopeful that we 
can reach a solution. We have a trial date in less than 4 months. The 
benefits of the combinat
ion are both significant and unchanged, and our 
expectation continues to be that we will reach a successful conclusion.
 
Now, let me turn to results and comment on the quarter overall, the 
highlights are on Slide 5. We are very pleased with what we've accom
plished 
in the third quarter and year
-
to
-
date, and we continue to see impressive 
strength in all our growth engines. Mobile broadband leads the way. Ralph 
will give you more details in a moment but we had a great quarter. Sales 
were strong across the board
, with gains in every subscriber category. 
Smartphone sales were robust, even in a quarter where you might expect 
sales to slow. Branded computing devices were also strong, and we turned in 
impressive service margin results with our best performance in 6 q
uarters. 
There also is good news for our Wireline business, where for the first time in 
3 years, we posted sequential growth in total and business revenues. IP data 
continues to be the driver for business and in Wireline Consumer, where we 
continue to see 
positive results. The thing I'm most encouraged by is that in 
addition to solid earnings, we delivered excellent free cash flow. In fact, we 
had our strongest free cash flow in 2 years. That comes even with making 
significant CapEx investments. So you're s
eeing solid execution in every area 
of the business, which puts us in a great position heading into the fourth 
quarter.
 
With that as background, let's take a look at detailed results, starting with 
consolidated revenues on Slide 6. Third quarter consolidat
ed revenues were 
stable sequentially and year
-
over
-
year, but when you look at our results 
year
-
to
-
date, we've seen revenues increase. Our growth drivers continued to 
be strong. Excellent mobile broadband growth, solid U
-
verse gains and 
improved business tr
ends. This was partially offset in the third quarter by 
declines in voice and directory. We also had an iPhone launch last year, 
which provided a lift to 2010 third quarter equipment revenues. Of course, 
we didn't see this in third quarter revenues this ye
ar. So when you factor out 
equipment revenue, consolidated service revenues actually grew 0.4% 
versus a year ago. Our overall revenue mix has continued its transformation. 
Year
-
to
-
date, 75% of our revenues come from wireless and Wireline data 
and managed s
ervices. That's up from 72% a year ago and 66% just 2 years 
ago. Revenues from these areas were up 7% year
-
to
-
date, so they're 
growing at a very good clip. We expect this mix shift to continue, and it's 
one of the reasons we have such a positive view of ou
r business. With that, 
let me turn it over to Ralph de la Vega, who will provide an update on 
Wireless results. Ralph?
 
Ralph de la Vega
 
Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. It's great to be with you 
again. As John mentioned, we are excited about th
e incredible growth that 
we're seeing in our mobile broadband business. As you can see on Slide 7, 
the third quarter continued the strong sales momentum that we have seen 
throughout the year. Smartphone sales have been strong, 4.8 million this 
quarter and 
16 million sold so far this year, exceeding even our most 
optimistic forecasts coming into the year. We're also seeing strong sales of 
data
-
only branded computing devices coming close to our best quarter ever. 
But you know what? We believe the best is yet 
to come. In the third quarter 
with those steps to make, the AT&T network experience even better.
 
First, we surpassed our end
-
of
-
year enhanced backhaul target, and we see 
this as a major tipping point for speeds on our network. Our enhanced 
backhaul now car
ries more than 2/3 of our data traffic. When you combine 
this with the advanced technology of HSPA+ devices, such as the iPhone 4s, 
we're seeing some incredible speeds across our 4G network. We also 
launched our first LTE cities in the third quarter. By th
e end of the year, we 
expect to have LTE service in at least 15 cities covering 17 million POPs, and 
we'll be turning up Boston and Washington D.C. next.
 
On the smartphone front, we have several new ones this quarter. We're off 
to a very fast start with th
e iPhone 4s. In fact, it's been our most successful 
launch in history, activating more than 1 million iPhone 4s' through Tuesday. 
Only AT&T's networks let the iPhone 4s download twice as fast and surf and 
talk at the same time and customers just love those
 
features. We also have 
some really great Android devices that we announced last week, including 
the Motorola ATRIX 2. And in the fourth quarter, we plan to launch our first 
LTE handsets. Customers who love the state
-
of
-
the
-
art LTE smartphones we 
plan to i
ntroduce, they will be fast, they'll have super bright screens and 
long
-
lasting batteries. These new devices, along with an expected seasonal 
push we get from the holidays, sets us up for a really strong fourth quarter. 
In fact, we expect the fourth quarte
r to be one of our strongest smartphone 
sales quarters ever. But before we look too far ahead, let me drill down and 
cover third quarter Wireless results, and there's no better place to start this 
quarter than in our net adds and churns. The details are on
 
Slide 8. We hit a 
benchmark this quarter when we passed 100 million subscribers, adding 
more than 2.1 million this quarter alone. We also continued the trend that 
we have been seeing so far this year, with growth across the board in every 
customer categor
y. That includes postpaid net adds of 319,000 or about the 
same number we had in the second quarter. Excluding the impacts of the 
Alltel and Centennial integration migrations, postpaid net adds were 
384,000. Prepaid net adds were 293,000, more than twice a
s many as we 
had in the second quarter, helped by strong GoPhone sales, and we had 
another solid reseller quarter, with 473,000 subscribers added.
 
We also added 1 million connected devices in the third quarter. This is a 
terrific business for us with lower
 
ARPUs, with good margins and low churn, 
plus most of these devices have little or no subsidy. And speaking of churn, 
total churn improved both year
-
over
-
year and sequentially. Postpaid churn 
was stable, and we saw iPhone churn decrease, a tremendous vote 
of 
confidence in a very competitive environment. It seems like a long time ago 
when the issue of how we would perform with iPhone competition was top of 
mind. Well, I think and believe that our results speak for themselves. These 
results speak volumes abou
t our wireless business. New customers are 
choosing AT&T and existing ones continue to stay with us.
 
Now, let's look at revenue and postpaid ARPU on Slide 9. Our track record of 
postpaid ARPU growth is unmatched in the industry. This is our 11th 
consecutiv
e quarter of growing postpaid ARPU. And we grow it from a much 
larger ARPU base than anyone else. Last quarter, our postpaid ARPU was 
more than $7 higher than our closest competitor. In the third quarter, our 
postpaid ARPU was almost $64 per subscriber. Po
stpaid ARPU for the third 
quarter grew 1.4% year
-
over
-
year. Looking ahead, we expect ARPU to 
increase to the 2% range in the fourth quarter, thanks to expected positive 
impacts from higher smartphone activations in the quarter and from the 
pressure of the 
Alltel integration being fully behind us. Total serviced 
Wireless revenues were $14.3 billion, up $600 million or 4.3% from the year 
earlier. This was driven by subscriber gains and strong adoption of data 
plans, which was offset somewhat by the lack of an
 
iPhone refresh in the 
quarter. And we continue to bring in more subscribers onto our network with 
pure data plans. 18 million or nearly half of our smartphone subscribers are 
on tiered plans with most choosing the higher priced data plan. Our lower 
price 
plan continues to be a good entry point for many subscribers and now 
that we offer a free iPhone with a 2
-
year contract for the first time ever, the 
iPhone 3GS, we expect to broaden the smartphone base even more.
 
You can also see the benefits of mobile bro
adband sales in our wireless data 
results, which are on Slide 10. Data revenues were $5.6 billion, up more 
than $850 million from the third quarter a year ago. Data revenues are now 
at $22 billion annualized revenue stream for us, growing at 18% year
-
over
-
year. Compare that to just 4 years ago when the mobile broadband was just 
beginning to emerge. Back then, it was just a $7 billion annualized revenue 
stream. So we have tripled that number in just 4 years. We've come a long 
way, yet we're still just gettin
g started.
 
We also hit a significant smartphone milestone this quarter. Smartphone 
subscribers now make up more than half of our postpaid subscriber base, 
52.6%, up from 39.1% a year ago. At the same time, smartphones continue 
to be nearly 2/3 of our postp
aid sales during the quarter, showing more 
opportunity for growth. ARPU for smartphones continued to be strong, 1.9x 
that of other devices and customers tend to be sticking with churn below our 
average. We also delivered another strong quarter for branded 
computer 
subscriber growth. This is a new growth area for us that includes data only 
connections, such as tablets, tethering and aircards. And as you can see, the 
results continue to impress. We increased sales by 505,000 to reach 4.5 
million.
 
We are reall
y excited about the opportunities here. There are a lot of 
exciting new tablets and new data
-
driven products on the horizon, and we 
have the right business model, the right products and the right network to 
really grow this business. Now, let's take a look
 
at wireless margins, the 
details on Slide 11. In addition to subscriber and top line growth, wireless 
margins expanded this quarter. In fact, we had our best wireless service 
margin performance in 6 quarters. This comes even with another strong 
smartphone
 
sales quarter. Our third quarter wireless service EBITDA margin 
was 43.7%, and when you factor in Alltel and storm pressures, margins 
would've been more than 44%.
 
I think it's worthwhile to take a moment and compare this quarter's results 
to the second qu
arter a year ago. That's the last time we had a quarter 
before an iPhone refresh. What you see is interesting and promising. Our 
service margins this quarter were actually better, and we sold almost 1 
million more smartphones than we did the second quarter
 
a year ago. And I 
think this really speaks to our long
-
term goal of building a strong 
smartphone base while working to improve margins. It's important for us to 
keep our long
-
term strategy in mind as we plan for the fourth quarter. As I 
mentioned earlier,
 
we expect blockbuster smartphone sales in the fourth 
quarter. You've seen the earlier response to the iPhone 4S, and it's been 
tremendous. Plus, when you factor in a great lineup of other smartphones, 
new devices from our LTE launch and traditionally stro
ng holiday sales, you 
start to get an idea of the kind of quarter this is shaping up to be. Obviously, 
this will impact margins in the fourth quarter but the benefits are clear, 
including lower churn, higher ARPUs and strong data growth and the 
opportunity
 
to create long
-
term value is substantial. That covers wireless. 
Now, I'd like to turn it back to John Stephens to discuss Wireline and 
consolidated results. John?
 
John Joseph Stephens
 
Thank you, Ralph. We always appreciate you being on the call, especiall
y 
when you bring such great results. Now, let's take a look at our Wireline 
business, where we had our first sequential revenue growth in 4 years. Let's 
begin with Wireline Consumer and U
-
verse. Slide 12 has that information. 
We believe we have the best vi
deo experience in the business, but you don't 
have to take our word for it. J.D. Power has once again named U
-
verse 
highest in overall customer satisfaction and that's in every market that we 
serve where J.D. Power measures us. I strongly believe the best 
is yet to 
come. Our goal is to take the best video experience and make it even better.
 
Earlier this week, we announced several connected TV apps that will further 
integrate our TV and wireless platforms, and there are several other really 
great new feature
s that are coming soon. As U
-
verse has transformed the 
viewer experience, it has also transformed our consumer results. IP data, 
that's U
-
verse plus other consumer broadband, now represents an 
annualized revenue stream of almost $11 billion, growing over 1
9% year
-
over
-
year and making up more than half of our consumer revenues. During 
the quarter, we added 176,000 U
-
verse subscribers to reach 3.6 million in 
service. Our subscriber numbers were impacted somewhat this quarter by a 
technology upgrade and storms
 
in some of our U
-
verse service areas. This 
caused us to pull back on some installations to handle those situations. But 
sales remained strong, and we feel confident that our subscriber net add 
levels will improve in the fourth quarter.
 
We're also seeing b
roadband and U
-
verse voice over IP attach rates 
remaining solid. More than 3/4 of U
-
verse subscribers have a triple or quad 
play bundle with us. ARPU for these customers is about $170, up 6% year
-
over
-
year and penetration continues to grow. We now have 25%
 
penetration 
in areas marketed to for 36 months or more and we believe there's a lot of 
room for growth. U
-
verse high
-
speed data also had another great quarter, 
adding more than 500,000 subscribers. Our U
-
verse broadband net adds 
were more than twice our T
V additions, with many of these subscribers 
buying our newer and faster IP DSL broadband service.
 
Now, let me provide a quick update on improving trends we are seeing with 
our Wireline business customers, which you can see on Slide 13. Thanks to 
robust gro
wth in our strategic business services, we had the first sequential 
growth in our Wireline business revenue in 3 years. That's sequential growth 
for the first time in our Wireline business revenue in 3 years. And what 
makes this even more impressive is tha
t this growth is occurring while we're 
still seeing pressure from the weak economy, slow employment and the 
transformation of our business to next
-
generation IP products. So while 
business continues to work their way through the economic downturn, they 
are
 
still investing in services that help drive productivity and efficiency.
 
Business service revenues were down 2.2% year
-
over
-
year on a reported 
basis and 1.7% when you adjust for last year's sale of assets in Japan. But 
when you look at sequential results,
 
revenues were actually increasing. Much 
of this success is attributable to continued strong growth of our strategic 
business services, revenues from products such as ethernet, VPNs and 
application services, which is an almost $5.8 billion annualized reven
ue 
stream and growing at 19.3% in the third quarter and 19.1% year
-
to
-
date. 
So we're not only growing the revenue but continuing to grow it at a slightly 
larger rate.
 
We are seeing data growth across a variety of industries and customers, 
both large and sm
all. Global IP data and integration services are growing at 
more than 10%. Wholesale had its second sequential quarter of revenue 
growth, and we had our first quarter of broadband growth in 2 years in small 
business. Our wireless bundles are also increasin
g. These are very 
encouraging signs, and we plan to build on this success as we go forward.
 
Now, let's look at margins and cash flow. Consolidated margin comparisons 
are on Slide 14. We said in January that we expected to deliver stable to 
improved consoli
dated margins this year, with wireless margin expansion 
and a disciplined focused on cost initiatives. Through the third quarter, I 
think it's fair to say we're delivering. Our consolidated operating margin was 
19.8%. That's up 260 basis points versus the 
third quarter a year ago and 
up sequentially. And when you adjust for the storms, the technology 
upgrades and the Alltel costs, we would've had margins of over 20%. Our 
reported Wireline operating margin was 12.1% in the third quarter, down 
both sequential
ly and year
-
over
-
year. While we remain focused on cost 
initiatives, our results were pressured from declines in voice revenues, storm 
expenses, technology upgrades as we mentioned earlier. If you take those 
costs into account, our margins are in the mid
-
12
% range. Our one AT&T 
initiatives are continuing to make progress. We continue to target cost 
efficiencies and simplify product offerings to deliver best
-
in
-
class services 
while also achieving cost savings. These initiatives are going well and help 
us sust
ain solid margins while still serving customers with the best
-
in
-
class 
operation.
 
Along with solid margins, we continue to have strong cash flows. Our cash 
summary is on Slide 15. Through the first 9 months of the year, cash from 
operations totaled $27.2 b
illion, up 7% from a year ago. Capital 
expenditures were $14.7 billion. Free cash flow before dividends was $12.4 
billion with our third quarter free cash flow at its highest level in 2 years and 
up 7% for the year. And dividend payments totaled $7.6 billi
on. In terms of 
uses of cash, net debt is down more than $8 billion over the past 5 quarters, 
and our net debt to EBITDA ratio is 1.41. Our balance sheet is solid. Our 
debt metrics sound, and we have more than $10 billion of cash on hand. Our 
strong cash f
low gives us the flexibility to invest in our business, to retire 
debt and to continue to return substantial value to shareholders.
 
Let me close with a quick recap on Slide 16. First, we are seeing great 
execution across the business, strong gains in all our major growth drivers, 
mobile broadband, U
-
verse, strategic business services. Second, as Ralph 
said, mobile broadband growth has 
been terrific, and the fourth quarter is 
shaping up to be one of our best yet. Data revenue growth is strong. Churn 
is down. Smartphone sales continue to grow. And maybe the biggest news 
this quarter is the first sequential revenue growth from business Wir
eline 
customers in 3 years. Overall, these results produced another solid quarter 
for us, with double
-
digit adjusted earnings growth and strong free cash flow, 
allowing us to have one of the strongest balance sheets in the industry. And 
as I mentioned earl
ier, we continue to move ahead with our efforts on the T
-
Mobile transaction. Brooks, that concludes our prepared remarks. I think 
we're ready for Q&A.
 
Brooks McCorcle
 
Great. John, I think we're ready to take our first question.

Stanley.

Morgan Stanley, Research Division
 
Ralph, good Wireless results given all the headwinds out there. Can you talk 
about at the LTE rollout? You've had
 
it for a few weeks now. What are you 
seeing from that? And how should we think about LTE over the next few 
quarters? To what extent are you going to be able to sort of drive 
incremental revenues, incremental ARPU from this, as well as driving better 
effic
iency gains from your sort of experience so far? I know you've made 
some comments about your upcoming smartphones and how they would 
have improved battery performance and so forth, so some color around 
those issues would be great.
 
Ralph de la Vega
 
Simon, I
 
am thrilled about what we're seeing with the LTE launch. I have 
been a part of many network and device transformations. And this 
technology quite frankly is the best I have ever seen in my career. The 
network technology is fantastic. The devices are fast.
 
They're thin. They 
have great battery life. It's the first time that I think a network transition is 
going to be a home run right off the bat. As we launched 3G, it took us 
about 6 months to a year to really get some really, really cool handsets. This 
is 
happening right now with our launch. So I think we've timed it perfectly. 
And when you complement that what we're doing with HSPA+, I couldn't be 
more happy. What I see happening with LTE and data, Simon, is just a huge 
growth opportunity. We mentioned tod
ay that our smartphones now make 
up 52% of our postpaid base. But I think the way we need to think about 
smartphones in the future is the smartphone is going to equal the phone in 
the future. It will be 100% in the next 2 or 3 years. These devices are so 
g
ood and the costs are coming down so much that I think in the future, you 
could look at close to 100% penetration, not 2/3 like we're selling today. 
Huge opportunity in smartphones. And then you add on top of that these 
new devices like tablets and MiFis a
nd e
-
Readers and telematics. And the 
growth opportunity is off the charts on this. And then you add to that the 
cloud, the fact that all of these devices in the future are going to want 
connectivity to the cloud, which means they need to have great bandwid
th, 
great data capability. And this is not just the demand that we're seeing in 
this country but all around the world. And so our business enterprise can go 
and pitch products to them that are based on the worldwide standard today 
of HSPA and LTE in the fu
ture. So I see huge growth opportunities as more 
smartphones penetrate our base, huge opportunity with tablets and a huge 
opportunity to provide a worldwide capability on a standard technology 
platform that is probably the best the world has. And the great
 
thing about 
doing all of that is that we're doing it with a technology, LTE, that provides a 
reduced cost per megabyte, that is we can produce the megabyte a lot 
cheaper on LTE, and it's also more spectrally efficient. So lower cost, lower 
spectrum requir
ements and great revenue potential. I'm very bullish on 
what we're seeing in data, and I think we've only seen the tip of the iceberg 
because customers love the devices that are coming out and they love using 
high
-
speed data.

Our next question is 
from John Hodulik with UBS.
 
John C. Hodulik

UBS Investment Bank, Research Division
 
The wireless quarter was strong. I think the one surprise was the 
deceleration you saw in the postpaid ARPU. Maybe either for John or for 
Ralph, are there any sort of incr
emental things you can call out with that 
1.4% number, that maybe fall out or is it just a function of people waiting 
for the new iPhone and that reversing in the fourth quarter, that drives the 
reacceleration?
 
Ralph de la Vega
 
John, this is Ralph. While t

driver of ARPU in the third quarter was lower smartphone growth. And 
they're very closely correlated. And so we expect that as smartphone growth 
continues in the fourth quarter, the third quarter was slowe
r than normal 
because we didn't have an iPhone refresh in the third quarter. But the fourth 
quarter is going to be unbelievable. And so we expect to probably have the 
best fourth quarter smartphone sales we've ever had. And so we expect that 
growth to pick
 
up, and we expect ARPU to pick up just as well. We're very 
confident of that. That's why we commented that we think hitting 2% is 
what we expect to see in the fourth quarter, which is right in line with what 
we have been seeing.

Given the decline in interest rates and sort of tepid returns in the market, 
John, can you just comment on what you expect in terms of cash 
contribut
ions to the pension at the end of this year, and then a related issue 
on the reversal of stimulus or cash taxes?
 
John Joseph Stephens
 
Sure, Craig. Let me tell you, first of all, with regard to the pension funding 
issue, there is some processes that we have
 
to go between 
--
 
that every 
company has to go through between now and the end of the year, not only 
seeing how our investment results and discount rates and so forth change 
and results are come out at the end of the year, but also to make some 
decisions o
n funding elections that are available to companies today. We'll 
make those decisions at the end of the year and make our determinations on 
funding at that time. I will tell you, with that being said, we commonly follow 
and review this process and in all o
ur business plans and processes going 
forward. We have assumptions for pension funding and believe that we can 
handle those in normal course of our business within the normal course of 
cash flows that we are now generating. And quite frankly, they're also 
tax
-
deductible, so while the funding dollars going in at 100%, we get the tax 
benefits that come back at about $0.40 to the dollar. So that's the issue with 
funding. We'll have more knowledge about that as the results come in for 
the plans and as we make o
ur elections on funding. Second, second piece on 
cash taxes, certainly the bonus depreciation rules have provided us a benefit 
this year, as tax planning has provided our company benefits for a number 
of years. This quarter is a great example because in co
mparing year
-
over
-
year results, when we show our 13% growth in earnings per share. That's 
after taking out a significant tax gain out of last year's results. So my point 
being though is as with the bonus depreciation rules that it provides us, we 
continue 
to plan for that. That payback period is a couple of years out for us, 
and we expect to have other opportunities to offset some, if not all, of that 
cash pressure.

hase & Co, Research Division
 
Lets switch over to the Wireline a little bit, can you talk about how we should 
think about margins going forward and what you expect for the consumer 
business in terms of promotions around broadband and DSL? I assume that 
we h
ad some tax that were allocated to different areas in the third quarter. 
How should we look at that going forward?
 
John Joseph Stephens
 
First of all, the margins, I like to look at the Wireline margins from an 
operating income perspective and from an 
--
 
an
d an EBITDA perspective. 
But if you look at this quarter, we came in around 32% for our EBITDA 
margins if you adjust for the storms and the technology upgrade costs. And 
we came in around 12.5% if you do those same adjustments on an 
operating income basis.
 
I think on a full year basis, we're probably in the 10 
to 20 basis points lagging on an operating income basis, last year's 
operating income margins for Wireline. So we're hopeful that we can make 
that up in the fourth quarter. We'll see if we can or not,
 
but we're hopeful 
about that. So we continue to believe that we have an opportunity to sustain 
margins at this level or even slightly better than we've done in this quarter, 
and we're working hard to do that. It is a challenging endeavor. Specifically, 
as
 
you all know, transforming the business from high
-
margin legacy 
products to these next
-
generation U
-
verse IP and other services. With 
regard to our DSL, the most encouraging piece of the DSL story, and while 
our net adds for the quarter were about in the 
5,000 range. The most 
encouraging piece of it was the fact that we had 500,000 high
-
speed U
-
verse/IP DSLAM net adds. So we were able to convert a huge piece of our 
legacy DSL base into U
-
verse/IP DSLAM, and we saw gains in small business 
with that IP DSLAM
 
product for the first time. We'll continue to focus on 
transforming those DSL lines into high speed. We get great speeds, great 
service to our customers, good ARPUs. On those areas where we don't have 
U
-
verse, I think our plans have been fairly clear. We 
expect to have an LTE 
rollout to 97% of the country. And as Ralph talked about, we're getting great 
results where we have it so we believe that's going to be able to provide a 
wireless solution at a high speed, good quality, good cost on a profitable 
basis
 
for us. That's the long
-
term solution to the non
-
U
-
verse areas.
 
Ralph de la Vega
 
And, Phil, in terms of your question about promotions, in the third quarter, 
we based our promotions on a market
-
by
-
market basis, only where we had 
installation 
capacity. And so we expect that some of those markets will be 
opened up in the fourth quarter. Now that we've got the technology 
transition behind us, you'll see a broader number of promotions in the fourth 
quarter back to the way we were at kind of second
 
quarter and prior to that.

Our next ques
tion is from Michael Rollins with Citi Investment Research.
 
Michael Rollins

Citigroup Inc, Research Division
 
Just 2, one to follow
-
up on the margin side. It looks like as we look at the 
third quarter outperformance in the margins, significant portion of 
that came 
from slower device sales partly related to the iPhone. Can you talk about 
your expectations for getting you a mid
-
40s margin while having a more 
normalized rate of device refresh, given that as time goes on and more 
people have smartphones, they'
ll replace those devices with smartphones? 
Second quick question was just to get your initial expectations out of the 
pending FCC proceeding to reform intercarrier comp and USF where the vote 
scheduled to come up in, I guess, a little over a week?
 
John Jos
eph Stephens
 
Mike, let me take a shot at the margins. I understand your comment about 
handset sales impacting margins and they clearly do and they clearly will in 
the fourth quarter. But with that being said, I think Ralph covered it. For our 
margins for t
he quarter reported basis of 43.7%, when you adjust for the 
merger cost, the close to 44%, they included almost 5 million smartphone 
sales. And when you compare it to the prior quarter before an iPhone 
launch, our margins are not only 60 basis points highe
r but we have almost 
1 million more smartphone sales. And so our point is that while someone 
may jump to the conclusion that it's a handset driven, and certainly the 
handsets have an impact, the reality of it is there was a lot of good hard 
work by the ent
ire management team on all fronts to generate these great 
margins. It wasn't just a differential on handsets because I sold 900,000 
more handsets this quarter than I did in the last pre
-
iPhone launch. That's 
the first point. And, Ralph, did I miss anything
 
with that?
 
Ralph de la Vega
 
I Think you did a good job.
 
John Joseph Stephens
 
Last thing, Mike, with regard to the FCC, the intercarrier comp process is 

provide our input to it. I 
think you're aware, we're a net payer in that 
environment. So some movement of those costs to more of an economic 
base could have a positive impact on us. So we're supportive of the efforts, 
trying to participate in a constructive way for the entire indust
ry and we look 
forward to seeing what the commission comes out with. And as you know, 
the devil is always in the details. So we're going to really be careful to make 
sure we do a good analysis of it. But generally speaking, we're very positive 
towards the 
idea of getting a refresh of those rules based on current 
economic conditions.

Our next question is from Michael McCormack with Nomura Securities.
 
Michael McCormack

Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division
 
Ralph, can you just give us maybe 
a little more detail on expectations for 
this sort of 2% type level in ARPU growth in 4Q? Just thinking about maybe 
more nonsmartphone to smartphone or iPhone upgrades, a change in the 
upgrade versus new customer ratio, maybe some color around the Alltel 
i
mpact that's going away in 4Q, and then on the iPhone 4s, whether or not 
we should be thinking about that more as a front
-
end loading versus more of 
a holiday, which has been the case I think historically. And then lastly, just 
sort of more detail on the U
-
verse technology upgrade, was that also 
including IP DSLAM or was there something else involved there?
 
Ralph de la Vega
 
Mike, concerning the 2% in the fourth quarter, what we typically see when 
we have a strong smartphone growth quarter is a lot of custom
ers who are 
on feature phones and what we call quick messaging devices step up to the 
smartphone category. And that's what we expect is going to happen in 
greater numbers in the fourth quarter. Third quarter was simply slow 
because we didn't have an iPhone
 
launch in the third quarter like we did a 
year ago, but we think that's going to dramatically change and get those 
back into 2% range. I also mentioned in my notes that we have another 
device that I think is going to dramatically change those people that 
are on 
smartphones and quick messaging devices, the 3GS, which is free with a 2
-
year contract. We've seen a tremendous, tremendous demand for that 
device even though it's a generation old. And actually, we're getting more 
new subscribers coming on the 3GS 
on the average than other devices. So 

optimistic on what the fourth quarter is going to look like in terms of 
smartphone growth. And that's what typically drives the ARPU growth, M
ike. 
So we feel very, very confident. The Alltel impact was in the range of about 
23 basis points, Mike. But the majority of it was driven through smartphone 
growth, and we are very confident that's going to pick up in the fourth 
quarter. Okay, the other q
uestion on the technology upgrade. Typically, 
when we provide new upgrades to U
-
verse, we required a few more 
dispatches so we planned for that. This time, we reduced promotions so that 
we could provide good service intervals to customers when they reporte
d 
any issues with the transition. It worked extremely well. That work is behind 
us, and now we'll go back to the regular output 
--
 
mode of business in the 
fourth quarter.

Ralph, the technolo

No, it's more feature related, a slew of new features and you're going to see

that was the basic upgrade platform.
 
You're going to see us now roll out

Our next question is from David Barden with Bank of America.
 
David W. Barden 
-
 
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division
 
John, just to start, could you just revisit kind of the CapEx outlook that you 
kind of see for 4Q? Obviously, we've had a number of companies that are 
suggesting that things are slowing down quickly at AT&T. If you could kind 
of just 
--
 
but yet, year
-
to
-
da
te spend seems to be pretty healthy. So I just 
kind of wanted to see if you could give us a peek into the rest of the year for 
the CapEx plans. And then second if I could, Ralph, just taking another kind 
of crack at this topic. You guys are talking about h
alf the smartphone base 
on tiered plans, which means that half the smartphones are still paying you 
kind of $30 a month and as those guys upgrade their phones and as their 
life cycle evolves, they'll probably move down the curve. And you've already 
gotten 
more than half your base on a smartphone, so the next 47% of your 
base is going to be taking cheaper smartphones and maybe cheaper plans 
and maybe not taking a smartphone at all if they can afford it. So as you 
look down the track with this pressure on the
 
existing smartphone base to 
lower ARPUs to the existing tiers and the next half of the smartphone base 
being the lower tiered customers, are you still optimistic that the ARPU can 
grow in the face of those forces?
 
John Joseph Stephens
 
David, let me break 
a comment, the questions between Ralph and I and I'll 
take the CapEx question first. I think our guidance remains unchanged. 
We're in that mid
-
$20 billion range. I think we're just under $15 billion year
-
to
-
date at $14.8 billion or so, so we're at kind of 
on a run rate that's 
consistent with what our guidance is. That's the first thing. The second thing 
is our free cash flows allow us to make this investment. I mean, our 
operating cash flows are great, and they're what's funding this. Third, we're 
going to 
continue to invest, and quite frankly, push for investment in our LTE 
and all of our successful growing products. So we'll continue to make that. 
And I expect our CapEx will run in that $20 billion range. Don't expect it to 
be certainly any expectations of
 
anything other than continuing. And quite 
frankly, we'll ramp it up a little bit just to get to that mid
-
$20 billion range.
 
Ralph de la Vega
 
In terms of the capability to grow ARPU, I think that as I mentioned before, 
we're going to see customers use more
 
data, not less. I don't see an 
environment going into the future where customers are going to use less 
data. These products are too good. There's an incredible amount of 
streaming content that's available. So we're going to continue to see 
customer data u
sage increase. We have not seen a decline, and I don't see it 
any way to decline. That's why I feel so bullish about our position of having 
50% of our base already on tiered plans, and we plan to make available 
more tiered options for customers in the futu
re so they can enjoy the data 
services that they want. So what I see is exactly the opposite of the scenario 
you suggested is where everybody is actually using more data. I see it 
across every product category we sell and that more handsets that we get 
int
o a customer's hands that are smartphones, the more data that they use, 
not the less.
 
John Joseph Stephens
 
And, Ralph, to add to that, David, I mean, we continue to add to that tier 
data plan group of customers. It's over 18 million now. And if you think 
a
bout it, we built that 18 million base in not much more than a year. And so 
we've got a lot of levers with that, and it's working well. You've seen what 
our churn has been like in the last year after implementing that. And quite 
frankly, I don't think you'
ve noticed any harm certainly, if not a benefit to 
our churn level. So we feel like we're really positioned for that growth. And 
not only from a network capability and quality of service but also from an 
ability to capture the revenue.
 
David W. Barden 
-
 
Bo
fA Merrill Lynch, Research Division
 
Okay, that's helpful. If I could just ask one quick follow
-
up, Ralph then, from 
a usage standpoint, what is overage from the tiered plans contributing to 
ARPU today?
 
Ralph de la Vega
 
I can't give you an exact number, but
 
we do have overage from both plans. 

overages, but like I said before, we plan to make available more options to 
customers that may need higher usage categories in the future, so the
y can 
feel comfortable in stepping up but not feeling that they're having to pay an 
exorbitant amount. We want to encourage customers to use more and incur 
a little more cost if that's what they want to do or stay with the plans that 
they have. But we're g
oing to have lots of data options. The other thing that 
I feel so bullish about is what is happening in the tablet arena. I mean, it's 
very obvious to me that this tablet revolution is going to continue. I don't 
see anything in the horizon that stops it, a
nd I think customers are going to 
want both, some smartphones and a tablet. And they're going to see their 
content on the tablet in ways that's going to make them use more and more 
data. So I think the future of tablet computing is going to be very good fo
r 
our industry.

Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division
 
I just wanted to follow
-
up on the Wireline margins a little bit. John, sensing 
sort of a shift in the rhetoric, I just want 

correctly. I was under the impression that you guys have made sort of 
tremendous progress on costs in the Wireline business so that when we saw 
that ramp in revenue growth in Wireline, we'd start to see sort of meaningful 
marg
in expansion. And we've got the revenue growth this quarter but the 
margin expansion didn't come through. And you sort of attributed some of it 
to storms, some of it to just a negative mix shift. Wondering if you can pull 
those 2 issues apart a little bit?
 
And just give us an update of whether we 
should start to see margin expansion as revenues continue to grow in the 
Wireline business? Or whether this mix shift is just bigger than expected?
 
John Joseph Stephens
 
Okay Jonathan, I guess, just real quickly, I 
do believe that the margins for 
the quarter were impacted by the storms and other things, so I think that 
12.5% and more of a 32% range for the EBITDA margin for the Wireline is 
appropriate for this quarter. With that being said, I still believe that there
 
is 
an opportunity to grow revenues as we're showing and then to have that 
impact on margin. Quite frankly, the distinction for this quarter is wow we 
did grow revenues and I am thrilled about our total Wireline and our 
business Wireline revenues growing. 
The growth was not dramatic. I don't 
think anybody would've expected it to be dramatic in this economic 
environment. And so it's going to take time to get more significant growth 
and also, we're still feeling the pressures of the legacy products, whether i
t 
be the legacy excess lines or high
-
margin products transitioning to lower 
margin, things like U
-
verse. But I still think there's that opportunity. It's 
going to take some time. Right now, we feel like we're doing a good job of 
managing those expenses, ge
tting focused on them and holding margins in 
line with what were our expectations for this year. I hope that's helpful, 
Jonathan.

Maybe just a couple on Wireless, just 
--
 
sorry, one more on ARPU, but I 
think a lot of the questions are focused on data. Maybe I'll angle it towards 
voice. If we can just talk about the opportunities to sort of level out voice 
ARPU, certainly on ph

was probably the bigger surprise this quarter, but data ARPU was sort of in 
line with expectations. Voice ARPU was a little bit worse. What's going on 
there is that people still trading down minute bu
cket plans, and maybe it has 
a bit of a macro component? Is it still family
-
planning penetration that sort 
of riding that curve? Maybe just give us a little bit more granularity there 
and help us think about when that can level out because that's still 60%
 
of 
the postpaid ARPU? And then second, just on handset upgrade rates, you 

contributed a very strong margins. Help us think through this. Is this tied 
more to changes in upgrade p
olicies which you guys made, which you 
lengthened some of the Windows or more tied to just lack of new handsets 
and hence, we should expect this to move back to the 8% to 9% range?
 
Ralph de la Vega
 
Jason, this is Ralph. Let me address both of those issues.
 
In terms of the 
voice ARPU, what we saw in the first quarter, it wasn't a major impact. We 
had a smaller impact as a result of us implementing the mobile to any 
mobile plans in the third quarter. We think that those migrations that 
happened in the third q
uarter will not happen in the fourth quarter because 
those plans have already been implemented and are reflected in third 
quarter results. But the biggest impact to the third quarter ARPU number 
was still data. It wasn't voice. In terms of the upgrade, the
 
changes in 
upgrade policy do not impact this year. They'll impact next year. And what 
we saw was just simply the fact that the iPhone refresh is taking place in the 
fourth quarter this year compared to the third quarter last year. The big 
unknown is what 
happens when you have an iPhone refresh in the fourth 
quarter, which is the busiest quarter of the year. And this is the first time 
that happens so we expect that it will be a little higher than average upgrade 
number in the fourth quarter. But it's hard t
o estimate because we've never 
seen this event before.

You guys had a pretty good prepaid quarter. Even if we adjust for 
some of 
the prepaid tablets, it looks like you might have had over 100,000 net adds 
in your traditional products. We haven't seen that in a very long time. You've 
actually been losing customers in that category for a while. So I was hoping 
you could just g
ive us a little bit of color on why we've seen such a swift 
turnaround in that segment of your business.
 
Ralph de la Vega
 
Of course, that's a very good observation. We launched a new $50 GoPhone 
plan. We put in that plan also some handsets that are 
very attractive. 
They're low cost, but they've been a huge hit in the marketplace, so we're 
seeing that business resurge for us. And I'm very pleased with what we've 
seen in the GoPhone and we're just getting started. We have a very strong 
fourth quarter l
ineup, so I think we're going to continue to do well with 
GoPhone sales in the fourth quarter.

I think they're going to be cumulative. I think the third quarter is a preview,
 
that I think we have a good product that should actually play out stronger in 
the fourth quarter. It's always very competitive in the fourth quarter in the 
prepaid market, but we have a great product. We have a great price, and we

digit earnings growth, strong 
consolidated and wireless margins and our best free cash flow in 2 years. In 
wireless, mobile broadband sales in both smartphones and data
-
only devices 
continued to be strong, and w

including our first sequential revenue growth in Wireline business services in 
3 years. Our job now is to execute and finish the year strong. We have good

Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the AT&T 
Second Quarterly Earnings Release 2011. [Operator Instructions] As a 
reminder, today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the 
conference over to your 
host, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, 
Brooks McCorcle. Please go ahead.
 
Brooks McCorcle
 
Thanks, Keeley. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our second 
quarter conference call. It's really great to have you with us this morning. As 
Keeley me
ntioned, this is Brooks McCorcle, Head of Investor Relations for 
AT&T. And joining me on the call today are John Stephens, AT&T's Chief 
Financial Officer; and Wayne Watts, AT&T's General Counsel. John will cover 
our results, and Wayne will give us an updat
e on the AT&T, T
-
Mobile merger 
process. Then we'll follow with Qs and As.
 
Let me remind you that our release, investor briefing, supplementary 
information and the presentation slides that accompany this call are 
available on the Investor Relations page of 
the AT&T website. That's 
www.att.com/investor.relations.
 
I also need to cover our Safe Harbor statement, which is on Slide 3. And 
that says that information set forth in this presentation contains financial 
estimates and other forward
-
looking statements th
at are subject to risks and 
uncertainties, and actual results may differ materially. A discussion of the 
factors that may affect future results is contained in AT&T's filings with the 
Securities and Exchange Commission. AT&T disclaims any obligation to 
upd
ate or revise statements contained in this presentation based on new 
information or otherwise.
 
This presentation may contain certain non
-
GAAP financial measures. 
Reconciliations between the non
-
GAAP financial measures and the GAAP 
financial measures are al
so available on our website. And again, that's at 
www.att.com/investor.relations.
 
Before I turn the call over to John, let me quickly cover our consolidated 
financial summary, which is on Slide 4. Earnings per share for the quarter 
was $0.60, consistent wi
th last year's EPS before a onetime gain, and up 
more than 5% sequentially. Our reported EPS this quarter includes $0.02 of 
pressure from Alltel integration costs and storm costs in the Southeast and 
Missouri. As we mentioned earlier this year, Alltel inte
gration costs impact 
margins, Wireless churn and subscriber numbers. After this quarter, these 
impacts will be largely behind us.
 
The fundamental trends in our business continue to be quite solid. 
Consolidated revenue continues to grow for the sixth quarte
r in a row, up 
2.2% year
-
over
-
year thanks to strength in mobile broadband, U
-
verse and 
advanced business offerings. Even with another quarter of record 
smartphone sales, our consolidated operating margin remained relatively 
stable with the prior year and w
as up sequentially. Cash flow continues to be 
strong, with cash from operating activities for the quarter totaling $9 billion 
and free cash flow of $3.7 billion.
 
With that quick overview, I will now turn the call over to AT&T's Chief 
Financial Officer, Joh
n Stephens. John?
 
John Stephens
 
Thanks, Brooks, and good morning, everyone. It's great to have you with us 
today. Much of the public discussion of late has centered on our planned 
acquisition of T
-
Mobile USA, and AT&T's General Counsel, Wayne Watts, will 
b
e along in just a minute to provide an update on the approval process. But 
while that has been going on, we have done an excellent job in executing on 
our strategies and growing the business.
 
Let me share a few highlights that are on Slide 5. Consolidated 
revenues 
were up year
-
over
-
year and sequentially, led by strong Wireless growth and 
increasing stability in our Wireline revenues. Earnings were solid even when 
including Alltel integration and storm
-
related costs. Margins expanded 
sequentially across the 
board, Wireless, Wireline and total, and were 
generally stable from a year ago. Free cash flow was strong, and we 
continue to expect growth for the year.
 
Driving these financial results was another incredible quarter in mobile 
broadband. Smartphone sales s
et another quarterly record. Postpaid ARPU 
grew for the 10th consecutive quarter, a record unmatched in the industry. 
Mobile data growth remained strong and is now an annualized $22 billion 
revenue stream. We also had solid net adds, with growth in every s
ubscriber 
category, including having our best quarter yet in branded computing 
devices. And our Wireline business is showing signs that it soon will be 
growing again.
 
U
-
verse continues to be strong, adding subscribers, increasing triple
-
play 
ARPU and is no
w a $6.5 billion annualized revenue stream. In fact, fast
-
growing consumer IP data now represents about half of our total consumer 
revenues. That's right. Our Consumer Wireline business now has over half of 
its revenues from IP data.
 
And strategic business
 
services had almost 20% revenue growth, its best 
performance in 6 quarters, driving sequentially stable business Wireline 
revenues even without significant economic recovery.
 
With that quick overview, let's take a look at detailed results starting on 
Slid
e 6. Consolidated revenues totaled $31.5 billion, up $687 million versus 
the second quarter a year ago due to continued strong mobile broadband 
growth, U
-
verse revenue growth of more than 50% and increasing stability 
in Wireline business revenues with stra
tegic business service revenues 
growing almost 20%.
 
As you know, these growth areas are driving our revenue mix to Wireless 
and Wireline Data and managed services. In the second quarter, 76% of our 
revenues came from these next
-
generation services [ph]. Th
at's up from 
71% a year ago and 66% just 2 years ago. Revenues from these areas were 
up more than 8% or $1.8 billion in the second quarter. We expect this mix 
shift to continue, giving us even stronger confidence in the long
-
term view of 
our business.
 
Now 
let's look at Wireless, starting on Slide 7. Our focus on mobile 
broadband continues to drive impressive revenue growth. Total Wireless 
revenues were up $1.4 billion or 9.5%, and Wireless service revenues 
increased 7.4%, up nearly $1 billion versus the sec
ond quarter a year ago. 
This was driven by subscriber gains and strong adoption of data plans.
 
Data continued to drive our postpaid ARPU gain. We now have an industry
-
leading 10 straight quarters of growth, up 2%, and we continue to bring 
more subscribers 
onto our network with tiered data plans. In just 1 year, 
we've added more than 15 million subscribers on tiered plans.
 
As I mentioned, we had subscriber gains across the board in every customer 
category, with 1.1 million net adds. The stats are on Slide 8.
 
We had solid 
postpaid numbers, adding 331,000 during the quarter. And when you 
exclude the impact of the Alltel integration, our postpaid net adds were more 
than 500,000. In prepaid, we had 137,000 net adds, but that number grows 
to 186,000 when excluding
 
the integration impact from Alltel, with continued 
strength in tablet activations. And we also had another solid reseller and 
connected device quarter, adding 248,000 and 379,000 subscribers, 
respectively.
 
Helping drive subscriber growth was our ability t
o keep churn in check. 
Excluding Alltel migration impacts, postpaid churn was relatively stable with 
year
-
ago numbers and improved from the first quarter of the year. 
Additionally, iPhone churn by itself improved sequentially, and iPhone sales 
increased ye
ar
-
over
-
year. That means high
-
quality customers, both new and 
existing ones, continue to choose AT&T. They know our network advantages, 
the ability to use voice and data simultaneously, the nation's fastest mobile 
broadband network and international roamin
g to 224 countries, thanks to 
our GSM network. All this makes a big difference to our customers, and you 
see that in this quarter's results.
 
You can see the benefit of smartphone and branded computing device sales 
in our Wireless data results, which are on
 
Slide 9. We grew data revenues 
more than 23%. That's up more than $1 billion year
-
over
-
year. We had 
another record quarter with smartphone sales, 5.6 million units, both 
upgrades and new subscribers, our best second quarter ever. The 
smartphone subscriber
s now make up half of our postpaid subscriber base, 
up from just 36% a year ago. And we expect that percentage to continue to 
grow as nearly 70% of postpaid sales during this past quarter were 
smartphone sales.
 
Breaking that down a little further, we had 3
.6 million iPhone activations 
during the quarter, up about 11% from the second quarter a year ago when 
the iPhone 4 was first introduced near the end of June. An impressive 
performance in this first quarter where exclusivity no longer exists. But our 
stron
gest growth was with other smartphones, BlackBerries, Androids and 
other devices, where we sold nearly 2.3 million devices during the second 
quarter. That's more than twice as many as we added in the second quarter 
of 2010.
 
ARPU for smartphones continues t
o be strong, 1.8x our other devices, with 
more than 85% on family or business plans. And these customers tend to be 
sticky, with churn below our average. We also had our best quarter ever 
with branded computing devices, adding 545,000 this quarter to reach
 
4 
million.
 
As you might expect, strong smartphone sales are having an impact on 
margins. While these devices tend to have a higher subsidies, the customers 
they attract have higher ARPUs and lower churn. The details are on Slide 10. 
So far this year, we'v
e exceeded our expectations and already had back
-
to
-
back record quarters in smartphone sales.
 
But even with our strong smartphone sales, we were able to expand 
Wireless service margins sequentially. In the second quarter, we had 1.7 
million more smartphone
 
sales than we did in the year
-
ago quarter and up 
slightly sequentially, yet our Wireless EBITDA service margins expanded 
from the first quarter. And when you exclude Alltel integration costs, service 
margins were 42%. You see that on our Wireless operatin
g income, which 
was up more than 6% sequentially to reach $4.2 billion. Looking ahead, we 
expect smartphone sales to continue to be strong through the rest of the 
year, especially when you consider the new products and services that'll be 
out, our LTE laun
ch and holiday sales.
 
That concludes our Wireless results. Now before we get to our Wireline 
results, I'd like to turn the call over to AT&T's General Counsel, Wayne 
Watts, to give us a brief update on the AT&T, T
-
Mobile merger approval 
process. Wayne?
 
Wayne Watts
 
Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. I appreciate the opportunity 
to be with you, and I'll be brief. Let's take a look at Slide 11. We remain 
comfortable with the process so far and the pace at which we're moving. The 
staffs at the Depa
rtment of Justice and the FCC, the 2 federal agencies that 
must approve the transaction, are working extremely hard.
 
They're asking all the right questions. We, of course, take each issue and 
question identified very seriously and respond quickly and thoro
ughly as we 
see this process through. In fact, in response to questions, we have 
developed a very detailed engineering and economic analysis valuing the 
enormous efficiencies that will result from the combination of the AT&T and 
T
-
Mobile networks. We have 
revealed to the agencies the results of the 
analysis and the magnitude of the efficiencies.
 
The FCC has now indicated it wants time to fully evaluate and validate these 
results and has stopped their 180
-
day clock to allow them to do so. In light 
of the sig
nificance of these efficiencies, it is important to us that the FCC 
validates this information as they continue their review, and we look forward 
to working with them to do so.
 
We said when we announced this transaction that our confidence in our 
ability t
o obtain approval is based on the facts. And while we still have work 
to do, we remain very confident that we can satisfy the DOJ and FCC that 
this transaction should be and ultimately will be approved. Those facts, 
including the enormous efficiencies we c
an realize from this merger, 
demonstrate that this is the surest and fastest way to address the unique 
network capacity constraints and spectrum shortages faced by AT&T.
 
The facts also demonstrate that the consumer and public interest benefits 
are enormous
. These include better service in the form of fewer dropped 
calls, faster speeds and a better overall customer experience, more mobile 
broadband access for more Americans. By expanding our 4G LTE 
deployment to more than 97% of the U.S. population, some 55 
million more 
people will receive LTE coverage in America than would have occurred 
without this merger. And billions of dollars of increased investments in the 
U.S. economy, which drives more jobs and economic growth.
 
These benefits are widely recognized an
d have led to the broad, diverse 
groups voicing support for the approval of the merger. Those backing this 
transaction include governors in 26 states, representing 150 million 
Americans, members of Congress on both sides of the aisle, numerous 
elected offi
cials at the state and local level, labor unions representing more 
than 20 million workers, groups representing rural and diverse constituents. 
And perhaps most telling is the support from the high
-
tech community. They 
understand the importance of this tra
nsaction and what it means for the 
continued innovation, growth and prosperity of both of our industries.
 
Looking ahead, we'll continue to be responsive to those reviewing the 
merger. Based on the facts and the law, we remain confident we will receive 
regu
latory approval in a timely manner.
 
John, that concludes my update, and I'm 
--
 
turn it back to you.
 
John Stephens
 
Thanks, Wayne. Now let's talk about our Wireline business. As I mentioned a 
moment ago, we are seeing several positive trends here. Let me sta
rt with 
our Wireline Consumer results on Slide 12. The first positive, thanks to the 
strength of our U
-
verse business, IP data now makes up half of our 
consumer revenue. U
-
verse has transformed our Consumer business. We 
have done an outstanding job of scal
ing this business from scratch just a few 
years ago to an annualized $6.5 billion business today. And it's growing at a 
57% clip year
-
over
-
year. This has helped stabilize Wireline Consumer 
revenues, which grew for the fourth consecutive quarter. And as we 
scale U
-
verse, margins will continue to improve, contributing to profitability.
 
During this quarter, we added 202,000 U
-
verse subscribers to reach 3.4 
million customers in service. Broadband and U
-
verse Voice over IP attach 
rates also remain solid. More th
an 3/4 of our U
-
verse video subscribers have 
a triple
-
 
or quad
-
play bundle with us. ARPU for these customers now reaches 
$170, up more than 8% year
-
over
-
year.
 
Penetration rates continue to grow. In areas marketed to for more than 36 
months, we've reached 2
5% penetration. And we now passed 29 million 
living units and are on track to complete our U
-
verse build by the end of the 
year.
 
We are also beginning to see U
-
verse high
-
speed data have a positive 
impact in the small business space. Our U
-
verse broadband 
net adds were 
more than twice our TV additions, with much of the difference being new U
-
verse small business subscribers. Faster broadband speeds and mobility is a 
combination small business customers are looking for, and AT&T's strength 
in both areas is a
 
competitive advantage for us.
 
We're also seeing improving trends with our Wireline business customers, 
which you can see on Slide 13. Pressures from a lack of business formation 
and weak economic and employment growth continue. With that said, the 
revenue
 
trends are showing some positive signs. As you can see in our 
results, we were essentially flat sequentially, and we remain optimistic that 
we will soon see growth.
 
Business service revenues were down 3.9% year
-
over
-
year on a reported 
basis. But when you 
adjust for last year's sales of assets in Japan, revenues 
were down just 3.2%. That's the best performance in over 4 quarters. And 
while businesses continue to work their way through the economic 
downturn, they are still investing in services that help dri
ve productivity and 
efficiency. We see this in strong IP data growth. We also see it in continued 
strong growth of our strategic business services, which is now a $5 billion 
annual revenue stream, growing at close to 20% year
-
over
-
year. So we are 
seeing so
me encouraging signs.
 
In our global enterprise operation, there is strong growth in IP data, 
outsourcing and integration services. Ethernet is driving sequential growth at 
wholesale, and wireless bundles and improving trends in broadband are 
helping in the
 
small business segment. These results, combined with 
continued solid execution on the cost side, have helped drive improvements 
in margins.
 
Now let's look at margins and cash flow on Slide 14. For the second quarter, 
consolidated margins were up sequentia
lly and stable from a year ago at 
19.6%. These results were achieved with pressure from a couple of areas: 
the completion of the Alltel integration, the storm
-
related costs and a record 
second quarter smartphone sales. In Wireline, our operating income mar
gin 
was 13.1% in the second quarter, essentially flat from the second quarter of 
last year, but up 160 basis points sequentially.
 
Improving revenue trends and our focus on cost initiatives throughout the 
company helped offset pressure from declines in voic
e revenues. Our One 
AT&T initiatives continue to do well. We continue to target cost efficiencies 
and simplify product offerings to deliver best
-
in
-
class services while also 
achieving cost savings. We still see a lot of opportunity here as we move 
forward.
 
Along with solid margins, we continue to have strong cash flow. Our cash 
flow summary is on Slide 15. In the first half of the year, cash from 
operations and working capital initiatives totaled $16.8 billion. Capital 
expenditures were $9.5 billion, with a
 
29% year
-
over
-
year increase in 
Wireless capital to reach $4.4 billion. Wireless capital includes work with our 
LT [ph] build, which is on track to be launched later this summer. And as 
noted in our earnings release, we're slightly increasing our guidance 
for full 
year capital investments. We now anticipate capital expenditures in the $20 
billion range as we continue to invest in our wireless network.
 
Even with this increase in capital spending, we still expect free cash flow 
growth year
-
over
-
year, and we'r
e not changing that guidance. For the first 6 
months of the year, free cash flow before dividends was $7.3 billion, and 
dividend payments totaled $5.1 billion. In terms of uses of cash, debt is 
down almost $3.4 billion over the past 12 months, and our debt
-
to
-
EBITDA 
ratio is 1.48. Our strong cash flow and balance sheet give us the flexibility to 
retire debt as it comes due, to invest in the business, including funding the 
T
-
Mobile acquisition, and to continue to return substantial value to 
shareholders thro
ugh dividends.
 
Let me close on Slide 16 with a quick recap and a look ahead to the second 
half of the year. First, revenue trends are moving in the right direction. 
Continued strong Wireless growth, IP data driving stability in Wireline 
results, both of th
ese helping expand margins sequentially in both 
businesses.
 
Second, Wireless continues to exceed expectations. Record smartphone 
growth and strong branded computing device sales drove our net adds. 
Stable churn and increasing postpaid ARPU brighten our out
look for the full 
year. Our plans to launch 4G LTE service this summer remain on track, 
providing even more opportunity for us. And as Wayne mentioned, the T
-
Mobile review process continues to move forward.
 
And third, the transformation of our Wireline bus
iness is driving positive 
revenue trends with year
-
over
-
year consumer growth and relatively flat 
sequential business revenues. These results add to our financial strength 
and our sound balance sheet.
 
In summary, we had a solid quarter, which adds to our co
nfidence as we 
head into the second half. We expect continued solid results as we focus on 
executing on our strategy and growing our business. And we are excited 
about the industry's potential and about our position for long
-
term growth.

udes our prepared remarks. We're ready for the Q&A.

John, I wanted to come back to the point on the Wireline revenue growth. I 
think you'd said Wireline soon will be growing again. I know Randall has 
commented that enterprise revenues could turn po
sitive exiting 2011. So 
can you perhaps just give us a little bit more specificity around when you 
think Wireline may be able to turn positive overall and some of the 
--
 
just 
get into some of the drivers of that?
 
John Stephens
 
We almost had sequential reve
nue growth this quarter. So we're on the cusp 
of that now, and whether that happens in the third quarter, the fourth 
quarter or soon thereafter, we're really right on the cusp of that now. What's 
driving it is a number of things. We're still getting great 
results out of our 
wholesale business and Ethernet and other products, doing some good 
business in network integration, supporting some of our key partners in that. 
We're starting to see some improvement through the U
-
verse product in 
small business and ou
r ability to bundle that with Wireless. And we are 
continuing to see some investment in the global enterprise space by 
companies. So we're real optimistic that we're going to see it. We just 
missed it this quarter.

And macro
 
isn't assumed to do anything major for the rest of the year?
 
John Stephens
 
We are not 
--
 
as we said from the start of this year, we have not assumed a 
significant return to

or significant growth in the economy, either in 
employment or in GDP growth. We
've been fairly conservative on that and 
consistent with what has been said on these calls in prior quarters.

We'll go next to the line of John Hodulik at UBS.

Quick question on ARPU. It looked like the postpaid 
ARPU growth 
decelerated a little bit quarter
-
to
-
quarter. Is that a function of the higher 
sales of the computing devices? And if you could talk a little bit about maybe 
what the differential is between computing device ARPU and maybe handset 
ARPU and the t
rends in between there? And then I guess just going forward, 
do you expect that deceleration to continue as we move through the year?
 
John Stephens
 
I think there's a number of items that are going on. First of all, our 
smartphone ARPUs continue to be 1.8x 
or better our non
-
smartphone ARPU. 
So we continue to get some positive results from that as we penetrate that. 
You get a higher penetration of the smartphone in the postpaid base. But 
specifically, with our tiered pricing and our $15 and $25 plans that we 
have 
out there, as well as our new emphasis on postpaid computing devices, we 
are getting into a segment of the market that has somewhat lower ARPUs 
than are standard but are still very profitable for us. We're not going to turn 
away those sales. Those are
 
very good, profitable sales. But they do have 
some slight impact on the margin 
--
 
or excuse me, on the postpaid ARPU 
percentages. I will tell you this. We're still very pleased about the growth 
we've had, and we're pleased that we 
--
 
--
 
on a run rate, our
 
smartphone 
sales are about 70% of our unit sales. And we are currently 
--
 
only about 
50% of our postpaid customers are smartphones. So we have some room to 
grow in that area.
 
Operator
 
We'll next go to the line of David Barden, Bank of America.
 
David Barde
n
 
Just a couple of questions, if I could. First obviously, Alltel, Centennial 
impacts had a little bit of a depressing effect on margins and churn and subs 
this quarter. Have we worked all the way through that? Or is there still going 
to be a tail heading 
into third quarter? And then I guess second, maybe, 
Wayne, if I could just ask a question on the T
-
Mobile merger. Obviously, 
plan A is to press ahead and get this deal done by the first quarter of next 
year. But if it were to emerge that the headwinds were
 
gathering against 
you, what is the plan B strategy? Would it be to cut bait and say, ""We just 
couldn't do it?"" Or would it be to press ahead for as long as is necessary and 
kind of keep this deal alive into the second quarter of next year, the third 
quart
er of next year, however long it took to get it done?
 
John Stephens
 
David, let me 
--
 
this is John. Let me take the question on the Alltel and 
Centennial. Effectively, the customer migration and virtually all of the 
integration effort is completed. There ar
e always some trailing expenses. We 
expect those to be 
--
 
not to be material. But there will be some slight 
amount. As I said, we don't expect those to be material. Our experience also 
is after we've done some of these conversions, churn could be a little 
bit 
higher for a few months as customers get used to their new devices and 
make a decision. As you know, we completed our customer migration near 
the end of June. And so these customers are using these phones, some of 
them for the first time in June. And s
o as they get through July and August, 
there may be a little bit of churn impact, but we're not expecting any of that 
to be material. And effectively, we believe we are completed with the 
integration process. Wayne, you want to take the T
-
Mobile question?
 
Wayne Watts
 
Sure. David, it won't surprise you to hear that our focus is entirely on plan 
A. We're confident that plan A is going to be the result. We're going to keep 
working towards that, and we think that's the result we'll attain. I would 
point out the
 
contract does allow extensions. It allows time for an additional 
6 months, which would take us into the second and third quarter. But we're 
entirely focused and we will remain entirely focused on finishing in the first 
quarter.

Going back to the Wireless side, one of the things that you guys have been 
dealing with as you've been increasing the penetration of smartphones to 
both new and existing 
customers is that higher subsidy and replacement 
cost. Are we getting close to the point where if you look at the totality of the 
activity, the dollars that you spend on replacement start to peak out, and so 
that then becomes maybe a source of future margi
n expansion at some time 
down the road? Or is this something that just as the activity of your 
subscribers continues to pick up, that we just have to build into the business 
case for the Wireless segment?
 
John Stephens
 
Mike, I think the critical piece here
 
is the change we've already made in our 
upgrade policy, Mike. And when we announced the change, we made it 
prospectively effective, which means that effectively, we don't see any of the 
impacts of that upgrade policy for 12 months or until the first quart
er of next 
year. But we've lengthened that upgrade policy to more of a 24
-
month 
standard. That had been more of a 13
-
month average for us in most of our 
situations. So we believe that, that management of that cost, we've 
addressed it. But I will tell you w
e continue to focus on it, and we continue 
to be sensitive to it because it is an important piece of the value equation 
and it's an important piece for us in determining the value of our customers 
and the profitability of our Wireless business.

Just maybe a quick follow
-
up on the Wireless margin question. I guess you 
guys identified the fact that you'd be at about 42% if it weren't for Alltel and 
C
entennial. Is that a good starting point when we're thinking about 3Q? I 
know you talked about the idea that we might have some bleed
-
through, but 
it didn't sound like it was a big deal. So I just wanted to get a sense of what 
we should be thinking about f
rom a starting point. And then obviously, if 
there's an iPhone refresh, there might be other issues there. And then 
secondly, can you guys give us any sense of the percent of the iPhone 
activations that were the 3GS? And also, how many of the iPhones are 
u
pgrades?
 
John Stephens
 
Yes. Mike, on your first question with regard to margins, I certainly view it 
as a good starting point, the 42% as a good starting point to looking 
towards the margins for the rest of the year. And certainly, that's how our 
team is l
ooking at it. And as you point out appropriately, we've had some 
great sales. And depending upon volumes exceed where we've at today, that 
will pressure margins. But quite frankly, we've had great sales already, and 
we're at the 42% level that you referenc
ed. So that, I think, is a good 
starting point. I think, Mike, we'll pass on giving you the details on any of 
that information, and I'll leave it to Brooks' team to distribute that 
information as appropriate.

That's fine, John. Just maybe a quick follow
-
up on the storm cost. I'm 
assuming that, that hit Wireline. Can you give us an impact on the Wireline 
margin for the quarter?
 
John Stephens
 
Yes. I mean, the impact of the costs were about $50 million. So it woul
d 
have been about 30 basis points on that margin. So that's what they were. 
Those were really the tornado costs. We refer to them as storm costs, but 
those were the tornado costs that hit the Southwest and Southeast part of 
the United States.

I wonder if I could ask a question about cash taxes. You've obviously 
benefited, as have all capital
-
intensive companies, from the stimulus plan
 
and the accelerated depreciation. Can you just look forward into next year, 
and particularly into '13, as that starts to reverse and give us a sense of 
what we should expect in terms of cash taxes?
 
John Stephens
 
Yes. Everybody here knows I like talking ab
out taxes. Specifically, it has 
provided us a benefit. And it is providing some benefit for us in our decisions 
to invest in capital. While we've got great demands on our mobility network 
and great customer adds, it is an appropriate time to make those 
inv
estments because of the bonus depreciation rule, so we're trying to take 
all things into account in making those decisions. I view it this way. Yes, 
depreciation is something, and these bonus depreciation rules are something 
that even out over time. But we
 
continue to focus on cash strategies at the 
company. And if you look at my 12/31/10 financial statements, my annual 
report, you'll see that even though we had significant bonus depreciation 
over the last 3 years, our deferred tax liabilities actually went
 
down fairly 
significantly. So we managed that tax liability from all aspects of our 
business. But you are right, the bonus depreciation does level out over time, 
and we see that in, quite frankly, in the '13 and years after viewpoint.
 
Operator
 
We'll go ne
xt to the line of Jason Armstrong of Goldman Sachs.
 
Jason Armstrong 
-
 
Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
 
Maybe just a quick one and then a broader question. First, on the CapEx 
guidance, the move higher here. I'm just wondering, is this sort of one
-
off 
and tied to s
pecific projects in Wireless? Or is the interpretation here that 
we're sort of stepping up longer
-
term capital intensity in the business? And 
then secondly, I guess just broader question. There's been a lot of talk and 
focus recently on cannibalization ris
k to traditional text messaging, and in 
particular with some of the data points coming out of Europe. Could you 
guys talk us through maybe why it's different here? And what, in your mind, 
are the real barriers you have in place to seeing cannibalization of
 
text 
messaging?
 
John Stephens
 
On, Jason, on your first question on CapEx, I don't view it as a step up or 
down either way and a change in kind of the long
-
term viewpoint of CapEx 
for the Wireless business. I view it as our business unit sold a lot more 
ph
ones and was real successful in the business and the volumes of use by 
our customers is greater than we expected. So we're making the 
investments today so that we can provide them the best
-
quality service. 
Additionally, I will tell you that because of the 
current environment, the 
bonus depreciation rules, it makes it economically, from a cash flow 
perspective, better to do it today than maybe wait till next year. So we're 
just trying to be prudent with the shareholders' money and have that 
opportunity that 
was provided by the economic recovery legislation and 
utilizing it. That's really how we view it. And really focused on the customer, 
making sure they get the best service. With regard to text messaging, it's 
just a really different set of facts for us. Fi
rst of all, we have bundled plans 
that tie text messaging into our voice and data services. We have unlimited 
texting plans that are very attractive. We just have a much different 
economic situation that doesn't easily invite anybody to come in and try to 
interrupt that revenue flow that's coming to us. Particularly, we have a 
postpaid contract environment where we provide subsidies on the phones, 
and customers come to us because we do, do that. And while it does 
generate some issues with regard to our marg
ins, it also provides us a tie 
into the customers that allows us to manage through some of those issues 
that you're referring to. So we monitor it real closely. We keep our eye on 
that revenue stream because it is important to us, but I do believe we're 
mu
ch different than many of the stories that are coming out of the European 
markets for the texting issue.

Maybe a follow
-
up and then a question. First on 
the branded data devices, 
you talked a little bit about this earlier. This has been a fairly slow grower 
versus the industry overall. As you roll out LTE sort of second half and then 
next year, do you expect that to accelerate and get a little more aggress
ive 
there? And then second, on Wireline broadband, sort of net neutral for quite 
a while here, at least relative to the industry. Is the shrinking overall sort of 
losses in non
-
U
-
verse areas? Or is this just fairly neutral across the board?
 
John Stephens
 
P
hil, on the data devices, we saw some growth this quarter. Computer 
branded devices, I think, were in the 550,000 range, 545,000 range, and we 
saw 
--
 
and certainly driven by tablets. And particularly, we saw some growth 
in our postpaid tablets. I think abo
ut 1/3 or a little less than 1/3 of our 
tablets were sold on a postpaid basis. So we're seeing that growth today. 
And yes, as we roll out LTE and get into a different collection of products 
that are going to be out there, we're real excited about that. So 
yes. 
Additionally, because we're in this unique position of onerous economics on 
a business that touches not only Wireless, but Wireline Consumer and 
Wireline Enterprise, we feel like we're pretty uniquely positioned to utilize 
those data devices with our 
enterprise customers, providing their employees 
mobility opportunities. So we're excited about it. We look forward to it, and 
we have seen some growth in this quarter better than we've had in the past. 
With regard to broadband, the critical issue for me is
 
while we did perform 
better in this second quarter than we did last year, we did have about 
12,000, 14,000 lost customers. But the reality of it is, is we had over 
400,000 customers convert from DSL to higher
-
speed U
-
verse
-
type 
broadband. That includes so
me small business customers. The point there 
for me is that we're here once again, giving you another example of where 
we're transitioning the business to the next
-
generation high
-
value services 
where we have real good retention, real good service opportun
ities and 
really good value opportunities for our customers. I'm much more excited 
about that and what that will play out, particularly with the ability to bundle 
it with mobile that we have. And that's where we're focused on the business.

And so as we think about the areas that are not being upgraded, is there 
sort of a 
--
 
the business is falling off in those areas? Or again, they're sort of 
stable in those markets?
 
John Stephens
 
I think we are seeing some challenges in
 
those markets. And I guess the 
long
-
term response that we're going to have to that really is going to come 
out of what Wayne was talking about with regard to the merger transaction 
in the sense that once that approval is reached and we're able to build ou
t, 
we're going to have 97% of the country covered, which is really going to be 
probably a similar level of percentage of all our customers. And we'll be able 
to, if necessary, if it's appropriate to provide that kind of service to them. I 
think that's the 
longer
-
term answer.
 
Operator
 
Next we'll go to the line of Chris Larsen of Piper Jaffray.
 
Christopher Larsen

Two different areas of questions. First, maybe, Wayne, if you could just talk 
a little bit about there's been some high
-
le
vel departures at the DOJ, and 
then yesterday, a senior senator came out on the judicial committees saying 
we should block the merger. Do either of those things have a material 
impact on your ability to close the transaction? And then secondly, the 
increme
ntal spend that you're talking about here, so the extra $1 billion, is 
this an acceleration of your 4G LTE spend? Is it traditional backhaul? Is it 
extra 3G? Is it all the above? Could you give us an idea of where that might 
wind up falling?
 
Wayne Watts
 
Ch
ris, this is Wayne. I'll go first. With respect to the changes at the 
Department of Justice, look, I had a lot of respect for Christine Varney, and I 
would have loved to see her stay there until we finished this transaction. She 
obviously had an opportunit
y she took advantage of, and we wish her the 
very best there. Having said that, she's left behind an extraordinarily 
talented staff, a staff that we've been working with on a day
-
to
-
day basis on 
this transaction. And they're going to continue to work hard 
and push 
through. And I think that's why even Christine said that she did not view 
that her leaving would change the timing of the transaction, and I believe 
that to be accurate. With respect to Senator Kohl, we have a great deal of 
respect for Senator Koh
l and his staff. I've met with him and his staff a 
number of times. And we often have very candid discussions, and this is one 
where we simply disagree on, on the outcome here. But most importantly, 
we have to recognize that while Senator Kohl's opinion de
serves a great deal 
of respect, he's not a final decision
-
maker. And there are certainly examples 
where Senator Kohl has opposed transactions that were approved, and we 
believe that'll be the case here as well. So the short answer is, Chris, I don't 
think 
that either one will have a material impact on the timing or the 
outcome.

Wayne, if I could follow up, and this may be more Jim's area, but any sense 
for how fast you might see new appointments at the FCC for th
ose 
vacancies, or soon
-
to
-
be vacancies?
 
Wayne Watts
 
The only thing I could say is the understanding we have is the 
administration's working hard to get those slots filled. And I'm sure they're 
going to continue to do that, and we hope that they do.
 
John St
ephens
 
Chris, with regard to your questions on CapEx, I think the answer is yes. It's 
on all of the items you mentioned, but I'd give you this focus. It's really a 
focus on the Wireless CapEx spend, and it's across in the categories you 
talked about. But i
t's really focused on providing a better experience to the 
customer and handling the volume increase we've seen because of customer 
growth and quite frankly, more customer usage. So the short answer to your 
question was yes.

We'll go next to the l
ine of Brett Feldman at Deutsche Bank.
 
Brett Feldman

Deutsche Bank AG
 
I'm actually going to kind of follow up on one of the questions Phil was 
asking about the data devices. I mean, if you isolate the announcements 
here around tablets, what's 
interesting is what a small percentage of overall 
tablet sales are being sold with cellular capabilities. And it just seems like 
you've got this huge opportunity to penetrate this rapidly growing product 
category, and you haven't quite clicked on it yet. I
'm just wondering is it as 
simple as getting the LTE and putting more speed into the device? Or are 
you considering something maybe broader here in terms of how customers 
would pay for those things? For example, would you move to more of a 
subsidy model to
 
get the price point down? Do you think that the service 
pricing could be tweaked a bit? I'm just wondering where you think your 
best opportunity here is.
 
John Stephens
 
Well, I think we're looking at it from a number of different perspectives. I 
think one 
thing we need to realize is the ability to have these float on the 
WiFi networks and utilize the capacity on the wire networks is important to 
the customers and important to us. Secondly, I would tell you that I think 
one of the ones 
--
 
opportunities we're
 
most excited about is incorporating 
this, connecting it with our enterprise customers and working with the CIOs 
on all the different aspects of security and availability and so forth. And 
we're working 
--
 
we'll work hard to do that. That's an opportunity 
we're real 
excited about. But I will tell you, in this quarter, we did make progress. So I 
don't want that to be lost. I think it is important. I understand your 
commentary on, comments on long term, much greater opportunities. I 
don't disagree with all th
ose at all. But we are making progress, and we are 
looking at how we 
--
 
and working very, very actively on a number of 
different approaches with regard to that. LTE will certainly help. That's for 
sure.
 
Operator
 
And that will come from the line of Jonathan
 
Chaplin of Credit Suisse.
 
Jonathan Chaplin

Crédit Suisse AG
 
Two quick follow
-
up questions. So the first on, I think, CapEx. I'm wondering 
if you can give us some context for how much of the increase in spending is 
sort of front
-
loading capacity 
buildouts to take advantage of depreciation, 
that beneficial tax regime, versus just dealing with the massive amounts of 
data growth that you're seeing on the network right now. What I'm really 
trying to get a context for is what happens to Wireless CapEx 
in 2012 and 
beyond. And then quickly on ARPU, as you sort of take that, the penetration 
of smartphones from 50% to 70%, can you maintain that ratio of 
smartphone ARPU to non
-
smartphone ARPU? Or does the sort of the next 
slug of smartphone ARPU have to come
 
in at a lower base so that we 
continue to see sort of overall postpaid ARPU continue to decelerate?
 
John Stephens
 
Quite frankly, on the CapEx issue, it's both. It's both prudent, taking 
advantage of the financial rules that are out there today with regard
 
to taxes 
and with regard to our strong balance sheet, our ability to do it and also 
demand. I'm not trying to 
--
 
we are not changing in any way, shape or form, 
guidance on a long
-
term basis with regard to our CapEx. I'm not even 
commenting on that. I'm no
t suggesting that you change that. What I am 
suggesting is that we're prudently taking the opportunity, because of the 
incentives that are there today, to move forward to give our customers 
better service, and we feel good about that. And we feel really 
--
 
quite 
frankly, it's 
--
 
we feel good about having the demand. The customers are 
demanding the subs. That's a good thing. With regard to the ARPU issue, 
remember, much of the increase in the 
--
 
or the increase in its penetration is 
from existing customers. 
So generally speaking, when they go from a non
-
smartphone to a smartphone, their ARPUs, whether they're above the 
average or below the average, are going up. And so they're going to that, 
maybe only incrementally, but they are going up. And so they're goin
g to be 
positive towards that postpaid ARPU average growth because they're coming 
out of the quick messaging devices or whatever and moving up the chain. 
What is going to be challenging to us is more of the tablets and the other 
devices that are going on t
he postpaid that may have lower ARPUs than are 
average today. But we are still optimistic about the revenue situation in total 
and quite frankly, the postpaid situation.

What would CapEx be if you 
--
 
if there weren't sor
t of bonus depreciation 
rules in place this year?
 
John Stephens
 
Jonathan, I can tell you that we had guidance out there at the mid
-
$19 
billion range, and now we're moving it to around the $20 billion range. I'll 
leave it to you to make your judgments on wh
ether you want to tie that to 
bonus depreciation. But I will tell you it was certainly taken into account. 
And I've got to tell you, my Wireless business unit has done well and added 
more subscribers than even I thought, and I have a very high opinion of 
t
hem. So we're responding to that.
 
I think we're going to wrap it up here. I want to take a moment just again to 
tell you thank you very much for taking part in the call.
 
And let me close by highlighting a few key points. First, we delivered another 
strong 
Wireless quarter in a very competitive environment, led by our mobile 
broadband strategy. We had record mobile broadband sales, smartphones 
and data
-
only devices. We had solid revenue growth and our 10th 
consecutive quarter of postpaid ARPU growth. And as 
you heard from 
Wayne, we are comfortable with the progress of the T
-
Mobile merger 
transaction, and we remain confident of its approval.
 
Second, we continue to see encouraging signs in our Wireline business as we 
transform it from voice to next
-
generation I
P data business. Revenue trends 
continue to improve, and U
-
verse is leading continued consumer year
-
over
-
year growth. Strategic business services are driving improvements in 
business trends.
 
And third, we had solid financial results and strong cash flows, 
which allow 
us to continue to invest in our growth platforms and to return significant 
value to our shareholders. This gives us good momentum going into the 
back half of the year and makes us optimistic about our future.
 
Once again, my sincere thanks for b
eing on the call today. And as always, 
thank you for your interest in AT&T. Have a good day.

Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to AT&T's 
third quarter earnings release 2013 conference call. At this time, all 
participants are in a listen
-
only mode. Later, we will conduct a question
-
and
-
answer session and 
instructions will be given at that time. (Operator 
Instructions). Also as a reminder, this teleconference is being recorded.
 
And at this time, I will turn the conference call over to your host, Senior Vice 
President of Investor Relations, Ms. Susan Johnson
. Please go ahead.
 
Susan Johnson
 
Thank you, Tony. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome. It's great to 
have you with us today. I am Susan Johnson, Head of Investor Relations for 
AT&T. Joining me on the call today is John Stephens, AT&T's Chief Financial 
Of
ficer. John will provide an update with perspective on the quarter, then we 
will follow with Q&A.
 
Let me remind you, our earnings material is available on the Investor 
Relations page of the AT&T website at www.att.com/investor.relations. I also 
need to cov
er our Safe Harbor statement, which is on slide two. This 
presentation and comments may contain forward
-
looking statements that 
are subject to risks. Results may differ materially. Details are on our SEC 
filings and on AT&T's website.
 
Before I turn the cal
l over to John, let me cover our consolidated financial 
summary which is on slide three. Consolidated revenue was $32.2 billion, up 
2.2% driven by continued wireless growth, impressive U
-
verse gains and 
rapid growth in strategic business services. Reported
 
EPS for the quarter 
was $0.72. That's up more than 14% over last year's third quarter. This 
includes $0.03 from the previously disclosed transfer of spectrum and $0.03 
from income tax items. When you exclude these items, earnings per share 
was $0.66, an i
ncrease of almost 6.5% year
-
over
-
year.
 
Cash flow continues to be strong. Cash from operating activities for the 
quarter totaled $9.2 billion and free cash flow was $3.2 billion and more 
than $11 billion, year
-
to
-
date. Also in the third quarter, we bought b
ack 
about 55 million shares for $1.9 billion and year
-
to
-
date, we have returned 
more than $18 billion to shareholders through dividends and buybacks.
 
With that overview, I will now turn the call over to AT&T's chief Financial 
Officer, John Stephens. John?
 
John Stephens
 
Thank you, Susan, and good afternoon, everyone, and as always, thank you 
for your interest in AT&T. Let me start with an overview on slide four. There 
is a lot we really like about the quarter. we grew revenues and EPS and cash 
generation con
tinues to be robust.
 
But when you look at what's driving the business, the one thing that stands 
out is Project Velocity IP or Project VIP. As you recall, we announced this 
plan just about a year ago. We said we would invest aggressively to expand 
our 4G L
TE footprint, that we would expand U
-
verse broadband reach and 
that we take fiber connectivity to a million new business locations. Thanks to 
the great work of our network organization, we have made terrific progress 
on all of these fronts, including havin
g the nation's fastest and most reliable 
4G LTE network. And you can see the positive results in our third results.
 
Our total Wireless subscribers increased by nearly 1 million and our mobile 
data revenues grew nearly 18%. Revenues from our strategic busin
ess 
services, including VPN, Ethernet, hosting and other advanced IP services 
posted strong growth of nearly 16%, and the one thing that has been the 
most excited is the outstanding performance and future potential of U
-
verse, 
we reach 10 million total U
-
v
erse subscribers this quarter. Thanks to our 
best TV net gain in nearly five years and a record third quarter broadband 
sales. That's quite an achievement in this tough economy.
 
This helped drive our first $1 billion U
-
verse revenue month ever and that's 
g
rowing at 28% year
-
over
-
year. This has been an incredible seven years 
since we first introduced the service, but project VIP has allowed us to take 
this platform to a whole new level and we are obviously excited about the 
road ahead as we build on the VIP 
platform to create a network that is 
increasingly software
-
defined and video
-
centric.
 
With that in mind, let me give you a quick update on the progress of project 
VIP, starting on Slide 5. Our project VIP initiative, focused on expanding the 
growth platfor
ms of our business. These include expanding our 4G LTE to 
300 million POPs by the end of 2014, executing on our spectrum and 
network quality initiatives, expanding our highly successful U
-
verse services 
to 8.5 million new customer locations with high
-
speed
 
broadband going to 
57 million or approximately 75% of our wireline customer locations while 
also bringing faster speeds and brining fiber to 1 million additional customer 
locations. We are going to get this done, but at the same time, we are going 
to move
 
to enhance our spectrum portfolio to meet the massive growth 
needs of our wireless data business today and into the future.
 
Un
-
drawing all of this, we are strengthening our financial structure and our 
balance sheet to give us the ability to invest and mai
ntain financial flexibility. 
Even though it hasn't been a full year since we first laid out our plans, we 
are on track or ahead of schedule with each of these initiatives.
 
To give you a build update our wireless progress on Slide Six. Our 4G LTE 
build cont
inues to exceed our original expectations. We now reached nearly 
250 million pops. The performance of our network has been outstanding. We 
have the nation's most reliable 4G LTE network according to our analysis of 
data from Nielsen, a well
-
known and leadi
ng global information and 
measurement company.
 
PC World and PC Magazine also said our speeds are the fastest and 
RootMetrics, who study national network performance in 125 cities, said 
overall call, data and text networks ranks first or tied for first in 5
6 of the 78 
cities studied today in the second half of this year. At the same time, we 
have also made significant progress in our spectrum position.
 
Last November, we laid out a carefully planned spectrum strategy that would 
help us meet our mid
-
term needs
, I am pleased to say, we have successfully 
executed those plans. That includes the purchase of WCS spectrum, 700 
megahertz B Block and other recently closed deals and we have already 
placed into services substantial part of the acquired 700 B Block spectr
um. 
Along with other pending transactions, this gives us a strong runway for our 
LTE expansion as we look ahead to future SEC auctions to address longer 
term spectrum needs.
 
Our U
-
verse deployment is also well underway. Those details are on Slide 7. 
We had
 
increased our U
-
verse broadband customer locations by about 2.5 
million this year, with about 1 million of those being video capable. 
Ultimately, our 8.5 million customer locations will be video enabled.
 
In the third quarter, we also increased U
-
verse bro
adband speeds up to 45 
megabits per second. We continue to rollout new markets but we already 
offer those speeds in every region to almost two
-
thirds of our U
-
verse base. 
And we are moving forward plans for speeds of 75 megabits per second and 
faster.
 
We h
ave also begun deployment of 100% fiber broadband network in Austin, 
Texas that will deliver speeds up to one gigabit per second. So while this will 
help drive a strong U
-
verse sales in the third quarter, almost all our gross 
adds of the third quarter came
 
from non
-
Project VIP areas. This means that 
there is even more room for growth. More opportunity as we go forward with 
our VIP footprint.
 
On the business side, our fiber build to multitenant buildings now reaches 
about 200,000 new customer locations. That
's well on our way to reach our 
year
-
end target and our one million locations target by 2015. We have also 
made tremendous progress with our financial objectives.
 
Let's turn to slide eight for those details. We committed to optimize our 
capital structure w
hile investing aggressively in our networks. I am pleased 
to report that we are on target across the board. First, we have moved to 
equalize our pension plan assets and liabilities for essentially fully funded 
pension plan. The Department of Labor has publ
ished a proposed exemption 
for our voluntary contribution of a preferred equity interest in our wireless 
business and this, along with an expected increase in discount rates, would 
move us to essentially fully funded status with our pension plan by the end
 
of this year. We are very proud that we are one of the few companies that 
still provide a pension benefit and with these moves our employees and 
retirees can have the confidence in knowing that these benefits are very well 
funded.
 
At the same time, we hav
e also taken steps to help manage our healthcare 
costs, both for employees and retirees and continuing to move toward low
-
premium, high value consumer driven plans. We have also been focusing on 
finding efficiencies in financing our debt. And even though o
ur total debt is 
up, year
-
over
-
year, our interest expense this year is down. Our average 
effective interest rate is down more than 60 basis points per year, while the 
weighted average time of the majority of our portfolio has basically 
remained unchanged. 
We have also been active in monetizing asset which 
improves our cash position, the recent tower sale adds to our financial 
strength and adds to the flexibility provided by earlier transactions. These 
moves help support our A credit rating, the highest cred
it rating among U.S. 
based telecom companies and the foundation for all of this, cash flow 
continues to be strong.
 
On top of our capital investment, we have continued our share repurchase 
program. To
-
date we have bought back 684 million shares with annuali
zed 
future dividend savings of more than $1.2 billion per year. Combining share 
buybacks with our dividend, we have already returned more than $18 billion 
to shareowners this year. More than $40 billion returned since the beginning 
of 2012 and we are doing
 
this while maintaining a best
-
in
-
class credit rating. 
A significant achievement at a time of increased capital investment. That's a 
quick update on Project VIP.
 
Now let's turn to our operational performance, starting with wireless on slide 
nine. Data reve
nue continues to drive wireless revenue growth. Data is now 
at $22 billion annualized revenue stream and it's growing at nearly 18%. It 
has a lot of runway as customers continue to increase their data bundles. 
That helped drive 3.7% service revenue growth 
this quarter. And total 
wireless revenues were up more than 5% in the quarter.
 
Postpaid ARPU continues to be industry leading for the 19th consecutive 
quarter. We saw the total postpaid ARPU growth. That's a record unmatched 
in the industry and our phone
-
o
nly ARPU, again, increased by more than 
3%. Our phone
-
only ARPU includes smartphones, but also includes our lower 
and feature phones and wireless home phones as well, which makes the 
growth even more impressive.
 
We also had a very strong net add 
quarter. Those details are on Slide 10. In 
fact, we had close to a 1 million total subs. Versus the third quarter a year 
ago, our postpaid net adds more than doubled. Our 363,000 postpaid gain in 
this quarter, included 178,000 new smartphone net adds, they
 
are part of 
our overall 1.2 million new smartphone customers which will I will walk you 
through on the next slide.
 
This was accomplished even though we did see some impact from handset 
supply constraints. We also lead the industry in postpaid tablet gains
. 
Tablets continue to be strong growth opportunity for us, with strong margins 
and much lower subsidies and the vast majority of tablet added in the 
quarter were LTE devices.
 
While we are positive on smartphone net adds, we are seeing some pressure 
with ou
r more price
-
sensitive subscribers on low
-
end 2G feature phones. We 
continue to be excited about our pending acquisition of Leap Wireless that 
allow us to better compete in the prepaid space and we are continuing to 
move forward to an expected first quarte
r 2014 close.
 
Speaking of prepaid, it had its best performance in two years. As many of 
you know, the migration of tablets to postpaid plans has pressured this part 
of the business and we are still seeing that, but the introduction of LTE
-
capable go phones
 
and new pricing plans that helps for growth at the higher 
end of the prepaid space for customers interested in usage
-
based pricing.
 
When you add up the acquisitions on top of our organic growth, we added 
more than 1 million retail postpaid and prepaid sub
scribers in the quarter. 
Connected devices are also doing well as more businesses turn to us for 
productivity, through machine
-
to
-
machine solutions.
 
Reseller revenues increased year
-
over
-
year, however resell had a net loss of 
285,000 subscribers, primarily
 
due to losses in the low revenue 2G 
subscriber accounts. We are also seeing solid results in churn. Postpaid 
churn was down slightly year
-
over
-
year and total churn both, sequentially 
and year
-
over
-
year. Both are notable achievements in this noisy competit
ive 
environment.
 
Let's now talk about our smartphone growth, which I mentioned earlier. 
Details are on Slide 11. We continue to grow our smartphone subscriber 
base, both from new customers and some current feature phone subscribers 
upgrading to smartphones
, a record 89% of our postpaid phone sales were 
smartphones and we now have 75% of our postpaid phone base on 
smartphones. We expect that percentage to keep growing. These are the 
premium subscribers in our business. They have twice the ARPU of non
-
smartph
one subscribers and much lower churn and the average usage on 
smartphones is continuing to grow at a rate more than 50% year
-
over
-
year.
 
Smartphone set another third quarter sales record of $6.7 million and we 
added 1.2 million new smartphone subscribers in
 
the quarter. We also 
continue to subscribers moving to the usage
-
based data plans. Overall, 72% 
of our smartphone base has selected these plans and a growing number are 
choosing mobile share plans. We added more than 1 million new mobile 
share accounts fo
r the quarter to reach 5.3 million. These accounts include 
more than 16 million devices on mobile share keeping us on a pace of about 
three subscribers per account.
 
We continue to see strong take rate on high
-
end data plans for both mobile 
share and tiered
 
data customers. In the last year, take rates have grown 
from 9% to 22%. With 58% of the remaining on medium
-
size data plans. So 
we have got a strong base but we still have room to grow. We have 
announced earlier this month that all new customers will now 
be on mobile 
share plans. Mobile share plans have already been popular with new 
customers and we offer several different plans that will best meet their 
needs.
 
Now let's take a look at margins on slide 12. Our wireless EBITDA service 
margin was 42%. That's
 
does not include the impact on the gains from the 
transfer of spectrum. We sold 600,000 more smartphones in the third 
quarter than a year ago and we had a third quarter record number of 
postpaid tablets as well. But even with this growth, our wireless EBI
TDA 
service margins expanded 40 basis points year
-
over
-
year. Upgrades were far 
ahead of last year's pace and flat sequentially and our upgrade rate for the 
quarter was 7.3%. The upgrades continue to solidify our high
-
value 
customer base and move them to mo
re efficient LTE phones.
 
So with a high level of upgrades, we have increased the number of 
subscribers under contract in the quarter. These subscribers continue to 
bring long
-
term value including our higher ARPU, lower churn and strong 
data growth. And inc
reasing the number of LTE devices on our network is 
driving greater network efficiency as well as increasing data usage. It is also 
moving customers offer our 2G network, which eventually will allow us to 
repurpose that spectrum for other uses. More than 4
0% of smartphone 
subscribers are now on 4G LTE devices.
 
These efficiencies were offset somewhat by costs associated with new 
product offerings such as Digital Life and expanding our prepaid wireless 
offerings. We now offer Digital Life in more than 50 mark
ets. Looking ahead, 
we expect lower year
-
over
-
year upgrades in the fourth quarter as we start 
seeing the benefits from our new 24 month upgrade model. Customers are 
also responding well to AT&T Next as sales increased through the quarter 
and we have contin
ued to expand the program to additional channels. The 
strength of our network has become a real selling factor for our wireless 
business. We are seeing outstanding speed and reliability performance and 
greater efficiencies as more and more customers upgrad
e to LTE devices. 
Our accelerated Project VIP, LTE build and improved coverage add to this 
momentum.
 
Now let me turn to U
-
verse. And I would simply say, that I don't think there 
is a better wireline growth story in the industry than U
-
verse. Turn to slide 
13 for those details. Strong revenue growth and record net adds are a 
compelling combination. And when you add in expansion of our platform to 
millions of more customer locations, it's pretty easy to see the runway for U
-
verse is very long. We have several
 
important U
-
verse milestones in the 
quarter.
 
First, we reached 10 million total U
-
verse subscribers. More than doubling 
the number we had just two years ago. That includes high
-
speed broadband 
subscribers where we added third quarter record 655,000 custom
ers. Almost 
60% of our broadband subscribers are now on the U
-
verse platform. We also 
had a second
-
best U
-
verse TV net adds ever and the most in almost five 
years, which keep us as the fastest growing pay
-
TV provider in the country. 
In fact, we now have mo
re pay
-
TV subscribers than any other telco. U
-
verse 
revenue growth has been just as in process and is the fastest growing part 
of our business. We had our first $1 billion U
-
verse revenue mom in the third 
quarter and this seven
-
year
-
old startup is now a $1
2 billion annualized 
revenue stream, growing at more than 28%. U
-
verse now represents 54% 
of total consumer revenues, which grew 2.4% in the quarter. The record of 
success gives us even more confidence in project VIP and U
-
verse build that 
goes with it.
 
No
w, let's move to wireline business, which you can see on Slide 14. The 
broad outline for our wireline business trends continue what we have seen in 
recent quarters. Obviously, there's a challenging economic environment for 
business services. At the same ti
me, we are seeing growth in productivity 
services, like advanced data, the cloud and the mobility. In fact, as I 
mentioned earlier, revenues from strategic business services, were up 
almost 16% in the quarter and have grown to almost a quarter of business 
wireline revenue.
 
Our U
-
verse broadband is definitely making noise in the small business 
space with record gains up nearly 100,000 new high speed broadband 
customers in the third quarter. That's quite an achievement in this tough 
economy. As our integrated
 
solutions that take advantage of our global 
network and mobility strengths, we had several key wins recently. For 
example, GE announced that it will connect its machines through AT&T 
network and cloud, creating the first highly secure wireless communicati
ons 
network for GE's industrial Internet.
 
Another recent win Delta Air Lines will put over 19,000 mobile devices in the 
hands of flight personnel to help personalize the in
-
flight experience for 
Delta's passengers. These contracts highlight the importance 
of mobility and 
integrated IP network. The majority of our large business customers also 
purchased wireless services from us. We think the integration of wireless 
and wireline services for our business customers will be a big advantage 
going forward.
 
Now, 
let's look at consolidated and wireline margins on Slide 15. For the 
quarter, our reported quarter consolidated operating margin was 19.2%. 
This includes a 70
-
basis point benefit from the previously disclosed transfer 
spectrum. On and adjusted basis, year
-
over
-
year margins were down. 
Margin pressure was largely due to record smartphone sales and expenses 
related to project VIP investments. We told you a year ago that there would 
be pressure on wireline margins with project VIP, we are seeing that this 
quart
er, including success
-
based U
-
verse customer addition costs and 
trailing expenses from our capital spending. This pressure was partially 
offset by growth in consumer revenues, operational improvements in 
network sales and support functions and a solid exec
ution of cost initiatives.
 
Now, let's move to cash flow. Summary is on Slide 16. In the first nine 
months of the year, cash from operations totaled $26.9 billion, capital 
expenditures were $15.8 billion as project VIP investing rose and free cash 
flow befo
re dividends was more than $11 billion.
 
In terms of uses of cash, total debt was stable in the third quarter with a 
debt
-
to
-
capital ratio of 46.9% and a net debt to EBITDA ratio of 1.76. If you 
include the cash from the recently announced transaction with 
Crown Castle, 
our net debt to EBITDA ratio would drop to around 1.64. We also continue to 
buy back shares. We repurchased about 55 million shares in the quarter for 
just under $2 billion with our dividend. This makes our total return to 
shareholders year
-
t
o
-
date of more than $18 billion, more than $40 billion 
since the beginning of 2012.
 
We continue to look for opportunities to improve our business. We are 
working with regulators on our proposed acquisition Leap Wireless, and we 
continue to expect that deal
 
will close in the first quarter of 2014, and we 
expect to close our recently announced tower transaction before the end of 
the year.
 
As I mentioned earlier, keep a strong financial foundation is a priority for us. 
Our balance sheet is sound, our debt metr
ics are solid and our strong cash 
flow gives us the flexibility to invest in growth initiatives while returning 
substantial value to shareowners.
 
Now before we take questions, let me close with a quick recap of the 
highlights for the quarter. Those are on 
slide 17. Project VIP network 
initiatives continue to move ahead of schedule. Revenue growth was solid.
 
Consolidated wireless and consumer wireline. Consolidated wireless margins 
were stable. Even with pressure from strong smartphone sales and Project 
VIP 
expenses. And EPS continues to grow. A solid wireless quarter was 
complimented by a tremendous performance by U
-
verse. And when you add 
in strong strategic business service results, our confidence in Project VIP 
growth platforms gets even stronger. Looking
 
forward to finishing the year 
strong and building momentum as we move ahead.
 
With that, Susan, let's go ahead and take some questions.

Cusick with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.

Hi, guys. Thanks. John, I guess the first question is, how do you think about 
using the tower 
proceeds? And the 1.64 you just mentioned, is that the way 
the rating agencies looks at it, given the shifting obligations?
 
John Stephens
 
That's good question, Phil. First of all, I think the rating agencies will take 
into account the lease commitment and 
we are working through that with 
them for the stated first lease plus some level of renewals. We are going 
through that process now. Don't have a certain number for how much they 
will but I would expect it somewhere in the 10 to 15 year range of lease 
paym
ents is what it seems to be approaching, which is certainly less than 
half of the total proceeds. I know those are real general numbers but you 
are right, they will take some of that into account. That's the first question.
 
The second question is, with reg
ard to what are we going to with the 
proceeds. I don't have a specific answer for you on that. We are going to 
follow the same pattern we have had before. One, keep the dividends 
strong. Two, keep investing money in our networks to grow the business and 
to
 
transform the business. Three, keep financial flexibility. We have been 
able to do all that before we got these proceeds. So we feel good about that.
 
The next issue is then, what do you do with the money afterwards? You pay 
down debt, you buyback shares, 
do you keep it for additional flexibility? We 
will go through that evaluation, but I will tell you, we are going to continue 
to be opportunistic and buyback shares. I think we have shown that over the 
last year and a half and that hasn't changed. But we wi
ll be careful and 
opportunistic with that.

And if I may, just one other quick one. What have you seen from the last 30 
days in terms of the impact of the government shutdown and business 
decision making, government decision making an
d how should we think 
about that for the fourth quarter?
 
John Stephens
 
Phil, it's an interesting question. First and foremost, from directly from the 
business that we get from the government, I wouldn't suggest you that it's a 
significant or material amoun
t anyway. There has been some changes. There 
is so many from usage changes and some adjustments in the amount they 
are using. So from that perspective, it's not material, not significant in 
anyway.
 
From an overall perspective, on just the business environm
ent, the 
regulatory environment and now the inconsistency or instability of the 
government environment, I think it affects all businesses and we are seeing 
that. Our customers are being careful and being prudent and because of 
that, business investment in 
general has been slower and as you can see in 
the employment levels, employment may also be impacted. So I think it is 
much more of an indirect impact on us than a direct impact.

Thanks a lot. John, you went through Project VIP in some detail and 
obviously some add results. Can you help us t
hink through the trajectory of 
the wireline margin? When do you see the peak dilution from some of this 
investment? Is this something that we are kind of close to bottoming or is 
there a few more quarters of pressure. Related to that, CapEx was up 
signific
antly. If you would spend the same level in Q4, you would be above 
your 21. Any sort of changes in the timing there or it a little bit higher than 
the 21. Thanks.
 
John Stephens
 
First and foremost, Simon, with regard to the CapEx spend, we are not 
trying to
 
limit CapEx spending by a standard compared to last year. We are 
were trying to smooth it out and get into a normal course, so I think we are 
on track for the guidance we provided and comfortable with that, but I will 
tell you that the team that is buildi
ng our networks is keeping things moving 
very quickly and we are encouraging that activity in the sense that if they 
can build it, we are going to be supportive of it. We think that's really good 
for the customer and services and the company as a whole, bu
t I do not 
expect any variance from the guidance we provided previously on CapEx.
 
Secondly, with regard to margins, I will tell you that way the sales activity 
has gone and the way the build has gone, I would expect some continuing 
pressure, because of suc
cess
-
based customer costs and quite frankly trailing 
expense on the build out of the U
-
verse base and we are going to have build 
out the U
-
verse base certainly well in defense, certainly throughout '14 and 
into '15 
-
 
certainly expected in the '15, so we wi
ll see some continuing 
pressures.
 
I don't mean to suggest that it would be accelerating in any way, but I don't 
expect us to get back to our norm, higher level of normal margins for at 
least another year, but I am more than happy to pay for the success the
 
team is having with regard to the customer additions.

Thanks, guys. John, on the 
wireless side, I have heard you guys say that 
that you are seeing pressure on the low end of the postpaid with some 
subscriber loss there. Is there anyway, one, you could maybe sort of trend 
that for us how that's been trending or talk about anything you c
ould do to 
aggressive or maybe even sort of size the exposure there, because I think 
you guys have mentioned it before and I think that [some focus]. Then 
related two more major announcement today related to tablets. How are you 
guys think of that compared
 
to the fiber that is another relatively small 
change or something there could be more [meaningful].
 
John Stephens
 
Let me go to the first question. With regard to the wireless market overall, it 
continues to be competitive and there continues to be a lot o
f, as I 
mentioned in my comments, noise around what's going on. I think the first 
thing to step back from is to realize that our churn was down year
-
over
-
year 
in total churn on postpaid basis and [churn], so even with all this activity our 
churn numbers ar
e doing really well. We had expected, we are hopeful to 
improve on that, but we think the power of our network and the power of 
our customer service is certainly helping that churn aspect and that's the 
real measured business.
 
Secondly, I really want to po
int out, we are seeing some pressure in feature 
phones. We are seeing it from quite frankly two perspectives. One is about 
close to 70% of our feature phone losses come to us as smartphones. If you 
see in the quarter, we added 1.2 million smartphone custom
ers to our base, 
but only 180,000 of those were new adds, the rest of them were conversions 
basically for our existing feature phone base, so that's where the most of 
them came from, so that's the pressure of the 2G, as a lot of our customers 
are stepping 
up and frankly doubling their revenue with us.
 
Now, there are some customers who are really price
-
sensitive, who are 
looking to others and we have come out with new plans both, in mobile 
share and in the tablet area to addresses those needs and try to give
 
value 
on a reasonable basis to those customers, so I view this as kind of normal 
competitive process and with a great network, great customer service, we 
are going to be able to work through this very quickly.
 
Lastly, when we get Leap closed in the first 
quarter, we will have even 
another avenue, another methodology, another process, really to put in your 
portfolio and to challenge that low
-
end side of the business.

Thank you. Our next question in queue will come from the line of David 
Barden with
 
Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.
 
David Barden

Bank of America Merrill Lynch
 
Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I want to start off just by, maybe 
taking that question another step, John. On the network conversation we are 
having to
day, its night and day. You guys have really started to try to take 
ownership of that most reliable network position in the marketplace. But if 
you look at the subscriber performance, year
-
over
-
year, this year versus two 
years ago, you aren't really seeing
, I think, a commensurate amount of 
market share that you are able to take from the rest of the marketplace with 
that ownership position of the most high quality network in the market. Can 
you kind of address how you want to try to monetize the increased c
apital 
investment that you have been making in creating this network in terms of 
more than just converting existing customers into smartphones but try to 
make more of it in terms of share gains?
 
Then I guess, the second question, if I could, just in terms 
of the Next 
program. Obviously, getting people to take the Next program is very value 
accretive to the business, both in terms of the absolute value that these 
guys pay you and also from an accounting perspective you get better 
margins from that. Can you t
alk about what percentage of gross you are 
seeing that are taking this program? So we can think about how its going to 
have an impact positively on the fourth quarter? Thanks.
 
John Stephens
 
Okay, good question. Let me kind of comment on both the questions,
 
David. 
First and foremost, I would suggest to you that more than doubling our 
postpaid phone adds is something that I am impressed by. I understand you 
are challenging it, but I am very pleased with it, especially at the same time 
when we are growing the 
prepaid market with regards to the GoPhone 
because of the challenges that we have there. When you add that 
performance to 700,000 connected device adds, we are adding about 1 
million customers to the network in the quarter. It is very good. And the 
reselle
r customers that we add, as we said, we have low revenue, we still do 
reseller revenue in the quarter even with the reduction in customers and 
there are mainly 2G type customers, which quite frankly, as everyone 
knows, we are in the process of repurposing 
that spectrum anyway. So it's 
dealing with a situation we are going to have to deal with over the next few 
years. So we are, if you will recognize the fact that there has been real 
improvement, we certainly are striving for further improvement.
 
When you ge
t into the getting a return on the investments we are making I 
would suggest you this way, when you look at the total revenue growth of 
5%, you really bring that Next issue into the revenue story in the sense of it 
is real economic revenue we are getting. 
And so our revenue growth, when 
you take into account are both service and equipment, it is down to 5% 
level. But if you look more at just, what you call a service revenue piece of 
it, David, the story goes like this.
 
First, we are growing smartphone penet
ration. So we are getting more 
people on smartphones. As they do that, they are using more data. That's 
why our key data growth of nearly 18% is. When you look at that then, we 
look at what they are buying and they are continuing to buy in high level 
data 
usage plans. So we doubled the percentage of customers who are 
buying, kind of the 10 gig plans over the year. It went from 9% to 22% of 
that customer base on usage plans.
 
If you think about that, that is just the start. There is a long way to go to 
add re
venue through existing customers. When we complete the LTE build 
and we have this video centric network out there on the wireless space, we 
expect to see continued growth. All of that is just on the existing customer 
base and then you move forward with thi
ngs like Digital Life, like the 
connected car, like the additional prepaid business we will be investing in. 
We are pretty excited and pretty confident in our ability to get really solid 
returns out of our investment.

Hi, thanks. John, you mentioned that the competitive enviro
nment is getting 
a little more aggressive. As we look over the next six to 12 months in 
wireless, how should we think about the balance between subscriber growth 
and profitability and are you willing to accept some pressure on the margins 
to maintain or ev
en pick up share if there is an opportunity with the new 
network quality metrics that you have been showing.
 
John Stephens
 
Yes. Good question. We are always interested in growth, but we are always 
interested in smart growth, the profitable growth. We are n
ot going to do 
anything to build one stead up at the cost of our shareholders return to 
investment, but yes, you know, we are going to watch it very carefully.
 
The biggest change over the next six to nine months we will see I think is 
the continued build o
ut and completed build out of our 4G LTE network, 
because that's a big advantage for us. Two, it will be our ability to close the 
Leap transaction and use that Cricket brand and infrastructure to really take 
advantage of that marketplace in a different way
 
with different capabilities 
than we have today and that's what real positive for us.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question in queue will come from the line of Jason 
Armstrong with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
 
Jason Armstrong

Goldman Sachs
 
Great. Thanks maybe a couple of questions. First, John, in relation to your 
comments on and you said this a couple of times the best credit rating 
amongst U.S. telcos. Is that merely sort of statement of where you are now 
or is that a commitment to maintai
ning this credit rating in the future?
 
I guess I am getting the obvious question here, clearly there's an ability to 
add a lot of leverage. Verizon just proved that out and you have pointed to 
rather large opportunities for a potential global M&A, so just 
trying to think 
that up.
 
Then secondly on U
-
verse, as you talk about the speeds, 45 megs and 
moving higher just how quickly can you sort of cover the footprint with these 
types of speeds. Has this started to change that market share momentum in 
those marke
ts at all?
 
John Stephens
 
Great. Jason, let me take the second one first. On the 45
-
megs Verizon 
although reaching today two
-
thirds of the footprint today and we are already 
seeing 
-
 
it's still early with the 45 megs, but just with the U
-
verse platform, 
we 
are already seeing significant changes improvements in churn and in 
customer retention capabilities. It's what is fueling the decision to invest not 
only in the capital, but also in the success based expenses of converting 
these customers to this U
-
verse p
latform, so we are already seeing that 
today. We expect that with the 45
-
meg speeds become standard and as we 
move even towards 75 or higher speeds, we think that just improves our 
opportunity. They would be sticky to lower churn and to retaining the 
custo
mers.
 
We are also seeing some good ARPU activity in the overall Broadband 
segment. That also gives us confidence, so direct question of 45
-
megs, two
-
thirds of our customers have that capability receiving today in footprint. We 
are ramping that up and we ar
e moving forward to go towards 75. It's early 
to say a specific tied into the 45 megs, but what we have seen with the U
-
verse platform in total has been really positive.
 
With regard to the credit metrics, quite frankly, having the best credit rating 
and ha
ving a solid A just the facts of where we are today. We are very proud 
of that, we have committed back last week or last year where we did the VIP 
announcement that are going to strive to stay in a single A rating, we have 
done that and we have done that w
hile we are paying great dividends, while 
we are buying back shares or making capital improvements, so it's worthy a 
note that we, if you will, did what we said we are going to do and we 
continue to hold those ratings and continue to have a lot of flexibil
ity.
 
With regard to any transactions, I have got now comments. There has been 
enough written and said about a variety of M&A. There's nothing new to add 
there. No comment with regard to any of that.

from Michael Rollins with

Citi Investment
 
Hi. Thanks for taking the questions. Just a couple if I could. First, as you 
think about the multi
-
year trajectory for the wireless margins, what would 
you say th
e three key things are there to deliver a better margin, especially 
in the context of the performance that you are looking for this year versus 
last year where the change maybe was a little bit more muted than maybe 
what the anticipation was at the beginni
ng of the year?
 
Just secondly, could you talk a little bit more about the evidence that you 
are seeing in terms of more usage from the customers. You mentioned the 
tiers of rate plans that customers are in terms of high versus mid for data 
consumption plan
s. Is the upgrade rate at people going to more data usage 
driving a meaningful amount of that wireless service revenue growth yet? 
And is that something that you would expect to continue to get better as we 
progress each of the next number of quarter? Than
ks.
 
John Stephens
 
Thanks, Mike. Let me give you four high numbers with regard to your first 
question as opposed to three. One, continuing the network efficiency that 
LTE provides and driving that efficiency that LTE provides. As we give our 
customers LTE d
evices, as we are sure to get them, we are able to grow 
more networks, I think will be a real driver of margin expansion. I think as 
we continue to manage the subsidy side, not only in educating the 
consumers about what this phones cost, not only getting v
alue from a trade
-
in process and capturing the economic value of the trade
-
ins that Next might 
do, but also getting fair pricing on the equipment side, I think, will drive our 
margins.
 
I think the data growth you just talked about is a real driver of reven
ue 
growth and it's a driver of revenue that doesn't come with any of the normal 
billing, administrative, sales costs. It's existing customers buying and getting 
more value by using more and buying more from us.
 
Then the last thing is just a real focus, a m
anagement of focus on efficiency 
and a management of focus on streamlining our cost structure. We have had 
that around here under our One AT&T initiative. So we are going to continue 
those efforts. Those are the four things from a company perspective that 
really will drive continued progress in our wireless margins.
 
On the data growth, we definitely believe there's more opportunity for data 
growth. If you look at the $5.5 billion quarterly revenue base or about $22 
billion annualized revenue stream, it's gr
owing at nearly 18%. That is 
coming from having this great network experience which enables people to 
use it more, so they want to use it more. They are getting a better 
experience. So they are buying up.
 
As we mentioned, our usage
-
based plans, only 22% of
 
them have high data 
buckets today. On mobiles here, that's 10 gig. On individual plans, that's 
four gigs. But we have seen that more than double over the last year. It was 
only 9% last year. Now it's 22%. That's a lot of runway to grow. So we feel 
really 
good about that. We think as these customers have a good 
experience, they continue to use it more. They are going to buy more gigs 
and be happy with it because of the experience. So that's where we see the 
data growth. I won't get into specifics about how 
much of the 5.1% growth 
is related to that or how much of the buy up of that, but we are excited 
about the opportunity it provides.

Thank you. Our next question in queue will come fro
m the line of Brett 
Feldman with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
 
Brett Feldman

Deutsche Bank
 
Thanks. I am going to stick with the wireless margin theme. You mentioned 
Next, which you launched during the quarter. You have new upgrade policies 
that are tak
ing effect now. In light of all that, how should we be sort of 
sizing the margin trends in wireless into the fourth quarter? Along those 
lines, what are some of the key inputs? In other words, what's your outlook 
for things like postpaid upgrade rates or o
verall smartphone sales within the 
context of levels that we have seen in the past?
 
John Stephens
 
So, Brett, it's a good question and I feel a lot of comments you had will be 
parts of the answer of the question. First and foremost, we are not giving 
specif
ic guidance for the fourth quarter on those margins. But we are not 
changing our overall guidance for the year. We are going to stick by the 
guidance we gave specifically on wireless margins that we are going to grow 
margins, year
-
over
-
year. So that will g
ive you some indication of what we 
expect in the fourth quarter.
 
Secondly, the push points that you mentioned, the upgrade cycle going to 
24 months tied to the contract is a policy now tied to the contract. The Next 
improvement, this data revenue 
growth that we see, other efficiencies we 
put in, not only from the LTE network being more efficient but what we put 
in the cost structure, all of those things give us confidence that we are going 
to be able to meet that year
-
over
-
year LTE objective. So th
at's really how I 
think about it and why I feel comfortable with standing by the guidance we 
gave at the beginning of the year.
 
Brett Feldman

Deutsche Bank
 
And do you have any initial color you can give us on the adoption rate of 
Next?
 
John Stephens
 
Yes,
 
we haven't been giving that publicly. And quite frankly, we are still 
pretty early in that. So as we get through a full upgrade cycle with the new 
device and plenty of supply on those devices and go through a holiday 
season, we will probably have a lot be
tter insight. I am not committing to 
release that data at that time but I will tell you, it's early in the process. We 
have been pleased and we think it's been a good customer experience where 
they can capture the value of the trade
-
in phone, which is real
ly the key to 
it. It's the economics that makes sense for both parties.

Thank you for taking th
e question. Just a question on the mobile share plan, 
I think you said 72% of your smartphone base is now under hedged. You 
have a year under your belt with this experience. Are these customers 
proving to be stickier customers I would think so, because you
r postpaid 
churn was lower than I was looking for.
 
John Stephens
 
Yes. Thanks, Jennifer. I think 72% of our smartphone customers are on 
usage based plans, so Jennifer that would include not only the mobile share, 
but the tier data. The mobile share is about
 
16 million of our customers. It's 
about 5 million accounts, about three per account but, yes, we are having 
good results with those with regard to the plans, not only with smartphones, 
quite frankly, in general. On churn, on revenues and on the quality of
 
the 
customer experience, so while we don't publish those specific numbers, yes, 
we are having good results with that. We believe as we have shown with 
some recent changes in mobile share plan, it's an appropriate way for us to 
move forward.

Thank you very much for taking the question. John, it does
 
seem that you 
folks are benefiting from your investment initiatives that you announced just 
under a year ago. I was wondering if you may be able to provide us with 
some color on where you expect spending trajectory to go perhaps beyond 
just the near
-
term,
 
because I know you addressed that in earlier question 
and if that has shifted given the fact that you seem to be ahead of plan with 
respect to your initial plan.
 
Also, I was wondering, if you could provide any color around the Supplier 
Domain 2.0 initiati
ve that you have seen now that it's been unveiled and to 
the vendors, because it does seem that longer
-
term that initiative could 
provide significant cost savings down the line.
 
John Stephens
 
Let me try to address your questions. I think we said in the pas
t that we 
would expect the CapEx for this year to be in $21 billion range and for '14 
and '15 to be in the $20 billion range and at this time we are not adjusting 
that or changing that.
 
Once again, we are going to be very thoughtful about accelerating any 
build 
programs, and where we can do it efficiently, we will do that. I will tell you 
that the one due issue or one issue that's coming up is that with the Leap 
announcement and with our ATNI purchase, we may have some additional 
capital requirements relate
d to those.
 
As we said publicly, we will announce the financial implications, specifically 
of Leap, when we close the deal which we expect to do in the first quarter, 
so we are not changing any of the guidance that we talked about for the 
three
-
year.
 
Longe
r term, we really do believe that software
-
directed networks are an 
opportunity for us. We think it gives us an ability to not only improve 
quality, but manage cost effectively, so we are excited about that. I think 
early results from that have been encour
aging and the early results of our 
network team has been encouraging but I don't want to suggest to you that 
it is going to have an impact in the guidance that we have already given. I 
don't want to suggest or imply that we are going to move away from that
.

First, let me close with a quick recap. We delivered strong EPS and strong 
revenue growth. We delivered solid wireless gains and terrific U

Thank you, Susan, and good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for being with 
us today. And thank you for your interest in AT&T. Let me start with our 
consolidated financial summary, which is on slide four.
 
Consolidated reve
nue was a solid $32.1 billion, up $500 million or 1.6% on a 
reported basis and is up an impressive $800 million or 2.6% when you 
exclude the divested advertising solutions business. We were able to do this 
with no lift from the economy. These gains were du
e to solid revenue growth 
in wireless, strong gains in U
-
verse services and with improving revenue 
from our wireline business.
 
Reported EPS for the quarter was $0.71. That's up almost 8% over last 
year's second quarter. OUR results this quarter include abo
ut $0.04 lift from 
the sale of some of our América Móvil shares. You may recall that América 
Móvil shares. You may recall that América Móvil has a share buyback 
program underway and we were selling shares to maintain our ownership 
closer to our historic le
vel of about 9%. When you exclude this help earnings 
per share were $0.67, our adjusted EPS is up about 5% for the year and up 
nearly 2% in the second quarter.
 
Consolidated margins were down year
-
over
-
year, primarily due to success 
based initiatives in bot
h, wireless and wireline. Cash flow continues to be 
strong. Cash from operating activities for the quarter totaled $9.5 billion, 
which allowed us to have strong capital investment in Project VIP and still 
have free cash flow of $4 billion. And in the secon
d quarter, we bought back 
about 90 million shares or $3.3 billion. And with our strong dividend, we 
returned more than $5.7 billion to shareholders.
 
Now let me give you the highlights for the quarter on slide 5. As you can 
see, we continue to execute at a 
high level. Our network performance is 
nothing short of terrific. We have posted impressive metrics across our key 
growth drivers. And as a result, we have improved momentum heading into 
the second half of the year. And as I said, we see this across our mo
st 
important growth areas. That includes about 20% growth in mobile data, 
strong postpaid net adds and record
-
setting smartphone sales.
 
Total U
-
verse subs reached 9.4 million, while video subs topped 5 million 
customers for the first time. Total U
-
verse re
venues grew better than 30%, 
and U
-
verse now represents more than 50% of consumer revenues. And 
even with little help from the economy, business wireline showed sequential 
revenue improvement and strategic business services grew by more than 
15%. All this 
resulted in improved revenue growth, continued EPS gains and 
strong free cash flow even while investing more in our customers and in our 
Project VIP.
 
I now would like to turn the call over to Ralph de la Vega, who is going to 
update us on all the work goin
g on in wireless. Ralph?
 
Ralph de la Vega
 
Thank you, John, and hello everyone. It's great to be with you today. Before 
we get to the wireless highlights for the quarter, I would like to take a 
moment to give you a quick update on our 4G LTE wireless networ
k, which is 
now the nation's fastest and most reliable 4G LTE network. Details are on 
slide 6.
 
Our network team has done an incredible job with our LTE deployment. All 
LTE networks are not built the same. They all don't use the same network 
architecture, n
ot all have the same network reliability and density and they 
all don't have the fastest speeds. Our goal was to build the best LTE 
experience from the very first market we deployed.
 
You can see by the high praise and recognition our network received that 
the 
results speak for themselves. PC Magazine called our 4G LTE network, the 
nation's fastest. PCWorld say we have the fastest average download and 
upload speeds of any competitor in its test for the second year in a row. And 
according to independent third
-
party data, we now have the most reliable 
4G LTE network as well.
 
We already cover more than 225 million people with our 4G LTE network 
today and we are on track to reach nearly 270 million pops by year end 
covering 400 markets, and we continue to move fa
st with our 4G LTE 
deployment. We now expect to substantially complete our 4G LTE network 
by the next summer.
 
Customers love our LTE experience. We already have more than 35% of our 
smartphone subscribers on LTE, and that number is accelerating quickly. 
Th
anks to our impressive line of LTE devices. The recognition is great to see, 
but this network also provides a solid foundation for wireless growth 
platforms and those details are on slide seven.
 
Having the nation's fastest, the most reliable network gives 
us an advantage 
when it comes to growth and the growth story is very powerful. Smartphone 
data usage is up 50% year
-
over
-
year and more than 70% of those devices 
are on usage
-
based plans with most taking larger data plans. This growth 
plus an increasing num
ber of smartphone subscribers and new data devices 
being added to the network drives a strong 20% mobile data growth that we 
are seeing.
 
We also rolled out our first Digital Life market in the second quarter. We are 
now up and running in 33 markets and exp
ect to be in 50 by year
-
end. I 
already have Digital Life in my home and let me tell you, it's really amazing 
what it can do. We believe, home security and automation is a large 
untapped opportunity for us.
 
An other opportunity is the Connected Car You alre
ady know our GM 
agreement to begin wireless connectivity for all GM vehicles in the U.S. 
market beginning in 2014. We have also announced an agreement with 
Sirius/XM satellite radio to provide mobile connectivity supporting a suite of 
security and services
 
for Nissan Automobiles in North America and yesterday 
we announced an agreement with Audiovox to provide network connectivity 
to Audiovox's telematics and location
-
based service systems.
 
You also know of our recent moves in the prepaid space. We recently 
introduced a new prepaid service and the proposed Leap Wireless deal will 
accelerate our expansion in this segment. We believe we have the right 
strategies in place to make a stronger impact in the prepaid segment and 
think there is a strong growth opportu
nity there as well.
 
Finally, last week we announced AT&T Next, a program where customers can 
get a new smartphone or tablet every year with no down payment, no 
activation fee, no upgrade fee and no financing fees. This is a great program 
that provides grea
t value and more choice for our customers. Many 
customers don't want to wait for the latest and greatest device and with 
AT&T Next, they don't have to.
 
Now, let's move on to our second quarter results starting with a look at 
postpaid net adds on slide eigh
t. Led by solid gains in tablets, we added 
more than 550,000 postpaid subscribers in the quarter and that's a 72% 
increase from the year ago quarter and our best second
-
quarter postpaid net 
add quarter in four years. We added about 400,000 postpaid tablets
, which 
we expect to be the largest gain of any carrier in the second quarter.
 
In addition, prepaid net add increase as a result of solid GoPhone sales. 
Total prepaid sales continued to be impacted by the migration of session
-
based tablets to postpaid plan
s which is a transition that we are happy to 
see. Gains in connected devices more than offset losses in the reseller 
segment where we saw subscriber losses primarily in low revenue accounts. 
However, reseller revenue increased by almost 30% year
-
over
-
year.
 
Postpaid churn was up slightly year
-
over
-
year, but down from the first 
quarter and smartphone churn was even better, less than 1%.
 
Strong postpaid net adds helped drive solid revenue growth and those 
details are on slide nine. Revenues continue to be 
led by data growth. We 
saw nearly 20% growth in data revenues in the quarter and that helped to 
drive a 4.1% service revenue growth. Total wireless revenues were up 
nearly 6%. The growth of smartphones, tablets and other data devices is 
fueling this data g
rowth. Mobile data is down nearly $22 billion annualized 
revenue stream for us.
 
This growth can also be seen in our expanding postpaid ARPUs. Total 
postpaid ARPU which includes tablets was up nearly 2% in the quarter but 
phone only ARPPU was up 3%. Our pho
ne only ARPU includes smartphones 
but also includes our lower ARPU feature phones and wireless home phones 
as well which makes this growth even more impressive. Postpaid data ARPU 
grew at nearly 18%.
 
Smartphone sales were also strong this quarter and those
 
details are on 
slide 10. A second quarter record 88% of our postpaid phone sales were 
smartphones. Smartphone subscribers now make up 73% of our postpaid 
phone base and that's an increase of more than 1.2 million new smartphone 
subscribers in the quarter.
 
These are the premium subscribers in our 
business.
 
They have twice the ARPU of non
-
smartphone subscribers and much lower 
churn. We also set another second quarter smartphone sales record of 6.8 
million, an excellent performance in a very competitive envir
onment. This 
helped drive record Android smart smartphone sales, both in total number of 
phones sold and in the highest percentage of total sales.
 
Now we did this while also selling more iPhones than we did a year ago. 
Several promotions and our new low co
st trading program helped to fuel 
these strong sales brining in new customers while also keeping existing ones 
on two
-
year contracts and it also increased the number of LTE devices on 
the network. More than 35% of smartphones now our LTE, the moved to 
usag
e
-
based data plans also continued in the second quarter.
 
Overall more than 70% of our smartphone base has moved to usage
-
based 
plans and data use on the smartphones is growing by about 50% year
-
over
-
year, so we have more smartphones on usage
-
based plans, d
ata growth is 
strong and growing number of subscribers are taking bigger buckets of data 
from us. About 80% already take the larger data plans and we are seeing 
more than a quarter of mobile share accounts on data plans of 10 gigabytes 
or higher.
 
And speak
ing of mobile share, we now about 4.3 million mobile share 
accounts and those accounts include more than 13 million subscribers on 
devices such as smartphones and tablets and we continue to see a steady 
movement of subscribers on limited plans to mobile sh
are. More than 15% 
of subscribers to
-
date moved over from unlimited plans, and remember that 
our customers have a choice. They can keep the plan they have or move to 
mobile share whatever plan that works best for them.
 
Strong postpaid net adds, smartphone 
sales and upgrades impacted margins 
and those details are on slide 11. Our wireless EBITDA service margin was 
slightly below our first quarter levels at 42.4%, but we sold 800,000 more 
smartphones in the second quarter than we did in the first. We made a 
s
trong effort to get people into our stores or on our website through 
promotions that allowed customers to trade in their phones and sign new 
contracts with us and that strategy worked extremely well.
 
Upgrades were much stronger than a year ago and the firs
t quarter, and we 
had a higher percentage of customers on contract at the end of the second 
quarter than we did at the end of the first quarter. The long
-
term value they 
bring is impressive, higher ARPU, lower churn, strong data growth and 
greater network 
efficiencies from our new LTE devices.
 
The trade
-
in program also gave customers a chance to upgrade their phones 
before upgrade period moved to 24 months. At the same time, our new 
AT&T Next program gives customers the best choice if they want a new 
device
 
every year. So, as you can tell, we were very busy this quarter 
introducing new programs and delivering a strong second quarter 
performance and you will continue to see us drive strategies to grow our 
business as we move throughout the year,
 
John, those w
ere the highlights in wireless. And with that, I will turn it back 
to you to discuss wireline results.
 
John Stephens
 
Thanks, Ralph. I appreciate it. Now, let's look at our wireline operations 
starting with consumer, which you can see on slide 12. As I ment
ioned at 
the outset, we passed a crucial threshold with U
-
verse. It now accounts for 
more than half of all consumer revenues. Two years ago, U
-
verse was less 
than a third of consumer. Now it's more than half and growing very fast. 
That's a remarkable bench
mark as we transform our business. We now have 
9.4 million total U
-
verse subscribers. That's more than double the number 
we had just two years ago. We added more than 640,000 U
-
verse high
-
speed broadband subs in the quarter and 233,000 new U
-
verse T.V. 
sub
scribers, topping 5 million video subscribers for the very first time.
 
U
-
verse broadband now makes up more than 50% of our total broadband 
base with total broadband ARPU growing at more than 9% year
-
over
-
year. 
These gains helped drive overall consumer reve
nue growth of 2.4%, with 
total U
-
verse revenues up nearly 30% in the quarter. U
-
verse is now a 
nearly $12 billion annualized revenue stream. Not bad for a business that 
was just started seven years ago and it also shows clearly that we know how 
to build an
d scale new businesses as we move forward with Project VIP.
 
Now let's move to wireline business, which you can see on slide 13. The 
economy continues to be challenging, and it's not providing any assistance 
to our efforts here. But on the bright side, we d
o see some signs of 
improvement from the first quarter. Business revenue was down 2.2% year
-
over
-
year, but increased sequentially with both enterprise and small 
business showing sequential revenue growth.
 
Small business also showed growing customer momentu
m with U
-
verse 
broadband net adds. Part of the business continue to do very well. Growth 
continued to be strong in strategic business services. That's products such 
as VPN, Ethernet, hosting and other advanced IP services which were up 
more than 15% in the
 
quarter. These services represent more than $8 billion 
annualized revenue stream and are approaching 25% of total business 
wireline revenues.
 
We continue to do well with wireless in the business space. We had our best 
ever wireless business adds in the qu
arter. More and more businesses want 
solutions that include wireless. For example, earlier today we announced an 
agreement with Disney Parks that makes AT&T, the official wireless provider 
for Walt Disney World Resort and Disneyland Resort.
 
We have talked 
often about the transformation of wireline from legacy 
products to advanced IP services but we are also seeing businesses 
transform to mobility. AT&T is well positioned to deliver these types of 
solutions to the business market. Our full ownership of our g
lobal IP network 
and our leading 4G LTE wireless network are a powerful combination when it 
comes to meeting business customers' needs.
 
Before we get to cash flow, let me give you a quick update on some of our 
Project VIP initiatives. Details are on slide 
14. Ralph told you about the 
incredible progress, both quality and coverage that we are making in 
wireless, but we are also breaking ground on several wireline projects as 
well. Our network upgrades are on track and we expect to boost top U
-
verse 
speeds up
 
to 45 megs per second in the next few months. We are moving 
towards speeds of 75 megs and 100 megs in the near future.
 
We have increased our U
-
verse video consumer locations by about 500,000 
year
-
to
-
date. Those locations also include U
-
verse broadband. We
 
have also 
added 1.3 million U
-
verse broadband only customer locations so far this 
year. When you add those together that's nearly 2 million new U
-
verse 
broadband locations to serve customers. This gives us more than 50 million 
U
-
verse broadband customer l
ocations across our wireline footprint. We are 
on track to hit our goal of reaching approximately 75% of our customer 
locations within our wireline footprint with wired high
-
speed broadband by 
the end of 2015.
 
Our fiber builds to multitenant buildings is a
lso underway. We expect to 
reach approximately 250,000 of our 1 million customer locations targets by 
the end of 2013, or just six months into our plan. But as you can see, we are 
making progress and we are very excited about the growth potential of 
Projec
t VIP brings to AT&T.
 
Even with our progress on Project VIP plus success based initiatives, margins 
continue to be solid. Details are on slide 15. For the second quarter our 
consolidated operating margin was 19.1%, an increase from the first quarter 
but do
wn year
-
over
-
year due largely to stronger actually record smartphone 
sales and higher costs associated with U
-
verse adds.
 
Wireline margins saw pressure from success based initiatives in consumer 
and Project VIP investment costs. Wireline pressure was parti
ally offset by 
growth in consumer revenues, operational improvements in the network, 
sales and support functions and solid execution of cost initiatives. As Project 
VIP moves ahead, we will continue to look for more opportunity to reduce 
expenses.
 
Now, let
 
us move to cash flow which continues to be a solid story for us even 
as we increase investment in our Project VIP. Our summary is on slide 16. In 
the first
-
ever year, cash from operations totaled $17.7 billion, which is up 
from last year's level. Capital 
expenditures were $9.8 billion as Project VIP 
investing starts to ramp and free cash flow before dividends was $7.9 billion.
 
In terms of uses of cash, net debt was stable in the second quarter with a 
debt
-
to
-
capital ratio of 46.6% and a net debt to EBITDA 
ratio of 1.6%, well 
below our guidance of net debt in the 1.8 range and actually slightly lower 
than our ratio of 1.68 in the first quarter.
 
We are [a second] 300 million share repurchase authorization and began 
buying shares back from the third authorizat
ion. However, the pace of 
buybacks slowed when compared to recent quarters. We repurchased about 
89 million shares for $3.3 billion. With our dividend, this makes our total 
return to shareholders in the second quarter almost $6 billion. Even with our 
progr
ess on Project VIP, plus success based initiatives, margins continue to 
be solid.
 
During the quarter, we also took several steps to strengthen our balance 
sheet. We continue working with the Department of Labor on our plan that 
would contribute to preferre
d equity interest in AT&T mobility to fund our 
pension plan. We are optimistic on the strategy and expect approval of this 
proposal later this year.
 
During the quarter, we monetized some of our shares of América Móvil soft 
while keeping our ownership level
s roughly the same, about 9%. We 
continue to keep our focus on a strong financial foundation, our balance 
sheet is sound, our debt metrics are solid, our strong cash flow gives us the 
flexibility to invest in growth initiatives and make strategic investmen
ts such 
as Leap Wireless while returning substantial value to shareholders through 
our strong dividend.
 
Before we take questions, let me close with a quick recap of the quarter on 
slide 17. The second quarter was a story of growing revenues and 
growing 
momentum. Our revenue gains were strong, our cash flows were solid and 
we continue to grow EPS. The mobile internet drove strong wireless results, 
including strong mobile data revenue growth, growing postpaid ARPUs and 
our best second quarter postp
aid growth in three years, plus our 4G LTE 
network has been winning praise and recognition for being the nation's 
fastest and most reliable.
 
During the quarter, U
-
verse hit an important milestone when it exceeded 
more than half of consumer revenues. And wi
th project VIP, we feel the best 
is yet to come. Our strong execution this quarter puts us on track to meet 
our full
-
year guidance, including revenue growth, EPS, free cash flow and 
margins, so a solid quarter with strong momentum heading into the back 
hal
f of the year.
 
With that, Susan, let's go ahead and take some questions.
 
Susan Johnson
 
Thank you, John. Tony, we will turn it back over to you to open it up for 
questions.
 
Question

and

Answer Session
 
Operator
 
Thank you very much. (Operator Instructions) Yo
ur first question in queue 
will come from the line of Phil Cusick with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
 
Phil Cusick

JPMorgan
 
Ralph, I guess, if we could start with start with the net add number, can you 
just help us break it down a little bit 500 and something
 
thousand, nearly 
400,000 tablets. If you take out the on home phone sort of fixed devices and 
Digital Life, was there growth in mobile voice postpaid? Thanks.
 
Ralph de la Vega
 
Phil, thanks for the question. We had a really strong quarter in all aspects. 
A
nd in fact, we ended up in June with significant gains in the smartphone 
only growth, not just wireless phones, so we feel this is one of the best 
quarters we could have turn in especially considering the fact that one of our 
competitors got the iPhone in 
the same quarter to churn in the performance 
that we did.
 
When you consider all the factors it was a remarkable accomplishments and 
we are very pleased with the overall phone growth, not just on smartphones 
but feature phones and wireless home phones and w
e have shown in the 
ARPUs that we have given you the fact that that even when you include all 
of those feature phones and wireless home phones, the ARPU is up in every 
nice way and the good thing about wireless home phones by the way is that 
soon there wil
l be wireless homes phones and internet access.
 
In the next few days, you will see us announce that we will be adding data 
capability which will add substantial ARPU to wireless home phones and we 
think that's going to drive significant ARPU growth to the 
phone only 
category in the future.
 
Phil Cusick 
-
 
JPMorgan
 
Okay, and then known, I guess, a second if I may, can you just help us a 
little bit on Digital Life. Just sort of round numbers for that. Was that single 
digit, double
-
digit, thousands in the quarte
r and how should we expect that 
to ramp through the rest of the year?
 
Ralph de La Vega
 
No, we are not providing that detailed information yet, Phil, but I can tell 
you that the early responses by customers has been very positive. The ARPU 
is higher than we
 
had planned. They are adding a lot of video cameras to the 
services. With every video camera there is an additional charge. Customers 
love the product and net promoter scores are one of the highest that we 
have ever seen for any product that we have launc
hed.
 
We announced recently that we added six new markets. That brings the total 
to 33, going to 50 by year
-
end. The platform is brand
-
new but its stable. It 
is taking all the load that we can give it. So, right now, we are cracking up 
the sales as we turn 
up market
-
by
-
market. I am very confident that our 
company
-
owned retail employees are going to do a bang
-
up job selling this 
product. So far what we have seen is a very nice lift and we are going to 
continue to increase our advertising spend to promote the 
product and 
continue to see it, I think, executed very well in the company
-
owned retail 
stores.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question in queue will come from the line of Mike 
McCormack with Nomura Securities. Please go ahead.
 
Mike McCormack 
-
 
Nomura Securi
ties
 
Ralph, or John maybe. Just some thoughts what's your tolerances for 
wireless margin pain? We have seen a lot of announcements from 
competitors recently. I am just trying to get a sense because if you look at 
the current guidance, you guys are talking 
of wireless margin expansion for 
the full year. Year
-
to
-
date, it stands at about 110 basis points. Maybe the 
change in upgrade policy could help the fourth quarter but just trying to 
think towards the back half of the year. How do you still thinking about 
the 
puts and takes? Thanks.
 
Ralph de La Vega
 
Thanks, Mike. Let me give it a shot and ask Ralph to join in. I will only give 
you a couple of push points here, reference points to start with. First of all, 
the change of the upgrade policy will certainly help
 
in the second half of the 
year. Second, if you will AT&T Next, our new offering for our customers 
upgrade every year will also help. Third, its something we need to point out 
is that, as Ralph mentioned, our phone ARPU grew 3% this quarter. Actually 
more 
than 3%. We actually converted, we had actually 1.2 million 
smartphones this quarter.
 
Many of those conversions from feature phones which bring higher ARPUs. 
So we have got a lot of revenue momentum going on in the business. When 
you add that to the growth
 
we are getting out of Digital Life, Connecting 
Cars and other things like that, one other thing that I will tell you, it is really 
strong and Ralph mentioned in his remarks, data usage is growing on a per 
device basis. Over 50%.
 
So as data usage goes up, 
we are seeing customers buy bigger buckets. Big 
tiers of data. So all of those things added together give us comfort that we 
will be able to meet the guidance we gave in January. I think those are the 
points, if you will, Mike, to look through this to say,
 
how do we get from 
where we are at to where we expect to be by the end of the year.
 
John Stephens
 
Mike, there is one other point that I wanted to add because I think it is 
important to understand and I mentioned the advances that we have made 
with our 
LTE network deployment. What we are finding out is that the more 
we deploy LTE, the lower it costs us to produce a megabyte of data. So the 
cost structure in the future is something that I think as we produce more 
data it will be cheaper to produce it. We 
have over 90% of our backbone 
now being enhanced backbone, which means we typically have Ethernet to 
cell site.
 
So its Fiber Ethernet to the cell site with LTE with the radio head on the top 
of the tower. It's a very, very good architecture. When we execut
ed like we 
are executing and it had the tendency to make it more efficient in terms of 
how you run the network up to 50% more efficient on the spectral efficiency 
as well, and so we feel really good about the infrastructure cost.
 
In addition to that, you h
ave heard us mention that we started the process 
of turning down the subscribers onto our 2G network in order that we can 
turn off that network completely by one 117, and so a lot of work going on 
in the infrastructure, some of it being short
-
term, but als
o long
-
term as we 
turn down our 2G network that will be another source of margin 
improvement.
 
Mike McCormack 
-
 
Nomura Securities
 
John, so you mentioned briefly regarding the third quarter initiative to 
increase U
-
verse broadband speeds. Is that something y
ou are seeing? I 
mean, we are hearing a lot about Wi
-
Fi household in the home are you 
seeing and the huge explosion of usage in the home right now to drive sort 
of a need to accelerate that program?
 
John Stephens
 
The plan to implement that was really part 
of Project VIP and really was just 
to give a higher quality continuing to group quality of service to our 
customers. We are seeing continued demand for our U
-
verse product. And, 
as we mentioned, the 640,000 sales in what has traditionally been very slow 
qu
arter for us, seasonally slow quarter and we are over 1.3 million 
broadband U
-
verse net adds for the year, so we are continuing to see the 
demand. It just gets in with that program and with the overall project VIP 
strategy.
 
Mike McCormack

Nomura Securiti
es
 
Okay. Makes sense. Thanks, guys.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question in queue will come from the line of John 
Hodulik with UBS. Please go ahead.
 
John Hodulik 
-
 
UBS
 
Okay. Thanks. Two questions. First for John. The 1.67 leverage ratio, plus 
the Leap, yo
u are getting up close to that 1.8 times target. Could you talk 
about whether that's setting store or if that could potentially change going 
forward. Then maybe update us on the possibilities for asset sales going 
forward and then I got a question for Ralp
h.
 
John Stephens
 
Sure. We are not changing our guidance. We feel really comfortable with the 
net debt to EBITDA and the 1.8 range and we are sticking with that. We 
believe that the cash flows we are generated from the business are going to 
be able to allow
 
us to successfully manage to that, so we feel good about 
that.
 
I won't comment on any particular or specific asset sales, but I will tell you 
we do have a great collection of assets with the company, and we think it's 
our responsibility to manage those as
sets and manage the balance sheet. 
We believe that that management includes putting focus on working capital 
which we have done, lower our borrowing costs which we have done and 
monetizing assets as appropriate when we can do that.
 
I think you saw us do th
at in the second quarter with the cash proceeds we 
received for Yellow Pages and from América Móvil shares. And in both cases, 
we effectively retain the same ownership we had before, we generated that 
cash. So, we are going to continue that focus. But with
 
that and with the 
balance sheet that we have and cash flows we have, we feel real good about 
sticking with our net debt to EBITDA in the 1.8 range.
 
John Hodulik

UBS
 
And then, Ralph, if you could talk a little bit about the Leap transaction, 
maybe the ma
in drivers behind the transaction. And then if you could clarify 
the sort of prepaid strategy. It looks like you have two brands going 
forward. How aggressive should we expect you to be in that market and 
what the go
-
forward strategy is there?
 
Ralph de la

John, the rationale behind the Leap transaction is basically to accelerate our 
entry into the prepaid segment much more so than we would have been able 
to do by ourselves. We plan to keep that Cricket brand and the distribution 
and I think that will i
gnite our growth into all aspects of the prepaid segment 
that I think has some really nice growth opportunities for us. So, that is our 
strategy. We will keep the prepaid brand at Leap brands with Cricket. I think 
it's a good brand and will leverage our di
stribution and that will fuel our 
entry in nationwide prepaid offerings.
 
John Stephens
 
John, I will tell you, let me add to it. What Ralph says is that I think what 
you will see is we are going to bring more competition and we are going to 
bring more choic
es to customers. And, the combination of Leap and our 
resources will bring an acceleration and a further deployment of that offering 
into that segment than either one of us could have done on the standalone 
basis. So I think this will be very good for the 
competition in the prepaid 
segment and we are really excited about the opportunity it provides us.

A couple of questions. Ralph, the first, the 50% usage per smartphone 
device, it's pretty impressive. Can you decompose that into the change from 
people going to 3G, to 4G? Is that a big part of the growth? Then what kind, 
the 3G
-
on
-
3G, or the 4G
-
on
-
4G g
rowth is?
 
Then, as you see more Androids in the mix, are you seeing a lower per 
device subsidy cost or a lower purchasing price for AT&T either now or is 
there some hope that you will be able to either subsidies or device purchase 
prices down going forward
 
and lowering your equipment subsidy? Thanks.
 
Ralph de La Vega
 
Yes, Simon, I was really pleased to see the Android sales and they do carry 
a lower subsidy than some of the other phones we carry. We are seeing 
some nice opportunities as well coming up in 
the Windows Phone line with 
the Lumia 1020. That's a great device that, I think, is going to help to drive 
lot sales of Windows Phone. So we are really, really pleased with the 
diversity of the portfolio. That's increasingly more diverse up almost every 
qu
arter that goes by.
 
Now the thing about the usage, I think this is really a great highlight and I 
want to make sure everybody gets what we are seeing when we move 
customers from HSPA network to LTE, we see a significant increase in the 
usage of data. We al
so see them buy larger buckets of data. So more usage, 
buying bigger buckets and guess what, the net promoter scores on our LTE 
network are much higher.
 
So happy customers are buying more of our product and are buying in 
bigger quantities. I think that is 
what I see driving it and we are just getting 
started. What I love about the LTE network that we have built is it's getting 
great service but at the same time that that network is performing as good 
as any network, I think, on the planet right now, the mor
e customers and 
usage that we move to the LTE network the better the HPA network 
performs.
 
So as a result, we are waiting in market after market where we deploy LTE. 
We are winning not just the fastest and most reliable 4G LTE network, we 
are winning on vo
ice reliability, text reliability and better reliability. So I feel 
really good that we have prospects to continue to grow usage and to get 
customers to buy bigger buckets in the future.

Thank you. Our next question in queue will come from the lin
e of David 
Barden with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
 
David Barden

Bank of America
 
So two questions, if I could. Just the first one, strategic services had one of 
the strongest quarters it had in a really long time. I think you guys added 
maybe annual
ized $500 million of revenues this quarter in that segment. 
Could you talk about some of the drivers and whether those are going to 
continue and whether we can look for that growth out of that segment for 
the rest of the year?
 
Then, the second question wou
ld be, obviously you have talked a little bit 
already on the call about the changing nature of competition as we look in 
the back half of the year. Verizon, for its part, is suggesting that they think 
they can not just keep share but take share as the incr
ease postpaid 
subscribers in the second half of the year. Obviously Sprint and T
-
Mobile 
have their ambitions. Could you kind out map out what is AT&T's position on 
balancing market share margin? What should we be expecting from AT&T as 
an objective functio
n for the business? You don't have to tell us the strategy 
but what do mean managing this business to in the second half of the year 
would be helpful. Thanks.
 
John Stephens
 
That is great, thanks. Let me take a shot at it and I will ask Ralph to join in. 
Fi
rst and foremost on strategic services. We are just saying that there is an 
acceptance across business for VPN, Ethernet, hosting and those high quality 
IP services. We are specifically seeing an improvement in our small business 
high
-
speed broadband.
 
I th
ink we have noted in our presentations there were 81,000. That's a 
quarterly record for us in our small business customers. So even in a difficult 
economic situation and a challenged economic segment, we are seeing 
customers willing to upgrade to higher qu
ality speeds.
 
With that, we also have a focus from our sales team and our sales effort on 
strategic services. They are really performing well and last year, I will tell 
you that with Project VIP, we are really now beginning to address the 
opportunities bui
ldings which we are now taking fiber to and selling into 
those customer locations as we start the build process and we start making 
progress.
 
So its all of those things, David, but in summary, it's a real focus and it's an 
acceptance by customers of the va
lue of those strategic services, even in 
some of the challenged spaces of the business segment.
 
Specifically with regard to wireless, as we have shown this quarter, we are 
going to compete. We are generating good margins. We going to improve 
those margins 
in the second half of this year. But we are going to be able to 
compete. I will give you one just simple point. In this quarter where a new 
competitor got the iPhone on a sequential basis, our churn is down. So I 
think we need to put it in that focus
 
So, I
 
think we need to put it in that focus, our churn is down even in this 
quarter where a new competitor comes in. And even with all the new 
offerings that we are putting forward, so we will be ready to compete, we 
are going to be smart about it, we are going
 
to be customers
-
focused about 
it and quite frankly we believe that our network superiority is going to lead 
us to be able to perform very well in the second half of the year and quite 
frankly for years to come.
 
Ralph de la Vega
 
Dave, I would like to add a
 
couple of views here. First, let me speak about 
the postpaid segment. I don't think we have ever been better positioned in 
the postpaid segment than we are today and that's basically driven by the 
network performance that is the best than has ever been, w
inning awards 
right and left, just providing outstanding performance and as the LTE 
networks gets all those awards, as we move customers there, the HSPA 
network gets better. So, from a network perspective, which is a key driver of 
churn, I don't think we h
ave ever been better positioned.
 
Our network team has done a great job and you can see dramatic 
improvements in drop calls and it's just a great, great story. In addition to 
that, we continue to find ways to differentiate on devices. We just are about 
to r
ollout the Nokia Lumia 1020, which I think is an exceptional device. We 
also launched earlier this year, the Samsung Active, which we call Whatever
-
Proof pone, and so great network, great devices and great service 
differentiates us at the postpaid segment.
 
In the prepaid segment, I mentioned that our GoPhone sales were on the 
rise and that as a result of an upgrade in the platform that now finally 
allowances to sell LTE devices on the GoPhone platform and those sales are 
doing very well as we populate the G
oPhone family with state
-
of
-
the
-
art 
devices that prior to this we couldn't turn on GoPhone platform.
 
So, GoPhone sales were doing very well, our prepaid services that we 
recently launched is doing well and now with Leap and the Leap acquisition, 
I don't th
ink we have ever been better positioned on the prepaid segment, 
so I like our position positioning for the second half of this year better than 
almost any second that I have faced in recent history.
 
In addition to all of this, as we move our data growth in
to LTE, it's improving 
our cost structure and we feel good about that. So I think as you look at, we 
are really in the best shape that we have been heading into a second half 
that I have seen for a while.

Thank you. Our next question in queue will
 
come from the line of Jason 
Armstrong with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
 
Jason Armstrong 
-
 
Goldman Sachs
 
A Couple of questions. Maybe first on handset trade
-
ins which are obviously 
said to be a little bit bigger part of the model going forward. I think,
 
John, 
you talked about Next helping wireless margins. Maybe if you can offer some 
more context around it? Maybe a framework for volumes you would expect 
here and what you can make on a resale or refurbed device from a margin 
perspective?
 
Then second quest
ion, Verizon, I think talked about promotions at third 
party distribution channels negatively impacting wireless margins in the 
quarter. I am just wondering if you saw something similar to this that you 
would call out? Thanks.
 
John Stephens
 
Well let me try the Next question and I ask Ralph to join in. The way I view 
it is simply this. In the marketplace for the last few years there have been 
high quality used phones that neither the customer nor the provider, the 
transport provider have taken
 
advantage of their value. So when someone 
comes in for a new phone they often ignored and maybe head it out, but 
they don't necessarily capture the value.
 
What Next allows the customer to do is by bringing that phone and a high 
quality phone that still ha
s some value, giving it to us, it lowers their cost to 
getting a new phone every 12 months. So they get value for it and then we 
have a network of capabilities whether using our refurbishing and our 
insurance business, whether we resell to a wholesaler or 
whether we resell it 
in our stores.
 
So we are able to capture that value. Up to this program, it hasn't been a 
captured value, and as you all know, those phones, many of the phones 
could have a $200 or $250 value. That's what makes this project work. That 
makes this offer work for both the customers and for us.
 
Ralph de la Vega
 
Jason, there was a news once that we did that really drove the volume of 
trade
-
ins something like 500% to 600% compared to the prior period. The 
key was for customers to realize that
 
they didn't have to worry about what 
they were going to get for the handset. If they brought us a handset that 
was within three years old and good working condition then we would give 
him a $100 off. All of a sudden they didn't have to worry about going i
n 
checking what it was worth. We would guarantee them that price.
 
We actually took the risk in what the value of that trading would be. As it 
turns out, when they actually start to trading them in, the value of the 
phone that they were trading in was much 
higher than what we had 
anticipated we were going to get. So it was good for the customer. It 
assured them that they could had a get a certain amount for it and for us, it 
turned out to be a good strategy.
 
In addition to that, Jason, when we lead out our A
T&T Next program, we 
knew that in order for that program to work well, we had have to have a 
very good trade
-
in program. So the trade
-
in program preceded AT&T Next 
and appropriately so, so we can get customers educated on the value of the 
trade
-
in, so we c
ould get our reps to process it and now it's part of the AT&T 
Next program and I think it's going to hit with all cylinders firing as we have 
really educated the customers and our reps on how to process and do trade
-
ins.
 
Jason Armstrong 
-
 
Goldman Sachs
 
Gre
at, and then the third
-
party?
 
Ralph de la Vega
 
I am sorry. On the third
-
party distribution, yes, we did see some upgrade 
activity through our third party distribution that's usually a little bit more 
expensive. But I would say that that wasn't the big driv
er for us. It was 
essentially the volume of upgrades that were done in the quarter that drove 
the pressure and the margins that you saw.

Amir Rozwadowski

Barclays
 
Ralph, I just wanted to follow
-
up on some of the discussions around your 
recent promotion plans. While I recognize it's still early stages, how 
successful have these plans been in helping to manage equipment cost and 
ultimat
ely fuel your belief in hitting your margin expansion target for the 
back half of the year? I am thinking about the extension of the upgrade 
cycle here. I guess we are just trying to understand the different drivers 
here given your comfort and sort of your
 
guidance.
 
Ralph de la Vega
 
Well, before we introduced AT&T Next, we did a lot of customer research and 
there was overwhelming support for program just like the one that we have 
launched. We actually launched the program early in a couple of markets 
and th
eir response has been good.
 
We are feeling real positive about the impact that this could have both, on 
customers and our financials, so we are full speed ahead, but I think the key 
with the program as we heard from customers is they essentially wanted to 
upgrade their phones in a yearly cycle, which is typically when they get 
refreshed and they wanted to do it with minimal outlay. And the fact that we 
can do that now for our zero down, no upgrade, no activation fees and no 
finance fees, means that you can 
actually walk out the door with a Lumia 
1020 device with a 41 megapixel camera the best of the best in camera 
technology with zero money down and a very reasonable payment.
 
So, I think that is what gets me excited knowing that we can put that kind of 
techn
ology in the hands of people and that they will enjoy it, but part of the 
process there was to get a trade
-
in program that was workable and we have 
done that already as a result of the promotions that we have launched. And 
by the way, because of our large 
base of iPhones, we stand to gain the 
most, because the value of those smartphones is the highest.
 
Amir Rozwadowski

Barclays
 
That's very helpful. Thank you. Then John, just had a question on your 
capital deployment strategy. You mentioned that your plan 
is to be 
opportunistic on your buying back going forward. Clearly, you are focused on 
finishing the Leap deal. Where can we see other areas of capital deployment 
in sort of near
-
to
-
midterm, perhaps I guess the way to look at it is, what are 
your strategic 
priorities for capital deployment here?
 
John Stephens
 
Clearly, our strategic priorities, two things in the short
-
term here is finishing 
off our Project VIP for us this year, which includes our LTE and additionally 
U
-
verse and fiber to building built all 
those aspects of VIP. Then secondly 
being prepared to close the deals we have in place before the SEC with 
regard to some of the spectrum deals, whether it'd be tuck
-
in or whether it'd 
be spectrum deals. Then third to be have all of that done where we stil
l can 
very easily which is something we are very confident we can accomplish 
close the Leap deal whenever that becomes available, so those are our 
priorities, if you will.
 
I have said this before and I will say on this call. Our dividend is clearly a 
sacre
d matter for us, we clearly understand as managers of AT&T, the 
importance of our dividends to our shareholders. That's never a question, 
and so what we do after we have taken those responsibilities satisfying 
those responsibilities, but those are the orde
r of things. And, with our strong 
cash flows, we will continue to have opportunities to buy back shares. We 
will just be opportunistic as we go through that.

Thank you. Our next question in queue will come from the line of Timothy 
Horan with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.
 
Timothy Horan 
-
 
Oppenheimer
 
Thanks, guys. I have two questions. Well, first, John, it seems like the 
underlying strength in the quarter was re
ally somewhat driven by the 
improvements in the networks both, wireless and here on wireline.
 
Would you maybe think about accelerating velocity or extending out a little 
further to maybe upgrade the networks a little bit more given what we are 
seeing is re
ally great in the quarter in terms of acceleration growth and 
volumes? And then a follow
-
up for Ralph.
 
John Stephens
 
Sure. Tim, I agree with you. The performance by network team in both, 
wireless and wireline has been exceptional and finding good quality s
ervice 
to our customers is always key to success. With that being said, we are in a 
position from our balance sheet to fund things on an opportunistic basis and 
as we can get them done efficiently. I think that's what you saw in the 
second quarter with our
 
CapEx stepping up to near $5.5 billion range, but 
$900 million higher than last year and higher than the first quarter. We 
spent that money at this time, because the network team could get more 
done and efficiently get it done and so we want to make sure 
we fund that 
and we will stick to that philosophy.
 
With that being said, I still believe we are going to be in the $21 million 
dollar range for our CapEx for this year. I think the network team has 
continued to outperform all aspects of their LTE build. We
 
had originally 
targeted 150 million for last year we finished near 175 million. I think Ralph 
mentioned today that were 225. So I feel very comfortable that we going to 
be near 270 by the end of this year.
 
We are expecting to substantially complete the wh
ole build by the middle of 
next year. So we are doing exactly what you are suggesting in the wireless 
space. In the wireline space, we are going through the same process. So we 
are not afraid to go faster. We are just going to do it prudently and we are 
go
ing to do it efficiently. So let me ask for your next question for Ralph.
 
Timothy Horan 
-
 
Oppenheimer
 
Thanks. Ralph, just only two small ones. Have you seen a slowdown at all in 
the iPhone impact that T
-
Mobile has had on you? It usually lasts about a 
quart
er or so? When do you expect that to hit? And then secondly, I guess 
on wireless data, are customers starting to bump up against our caps in a 
way that with the pricing lead to maybe some elasticity? Are you worried 
about that at all or seeing that at all?
 
Thanks.
 
Ralph de la Vega
 
Okay. First, on the iPhone impact. We have seen what, in terms of T
-
Mobile 
and then getting the iPhone, the same impact that we saw when Sprint got 
the iPhone and when Verizon got the iPhone. There is usually a spike in the 
timefr
ame that they get the iPhone. Then it comes back down. Quite frankly, 
the spike that we have seen from the T Mobile getting the iPhone is 
significantly less than the spike that we saw with Sprint and the spikes that 
we saw with Verizon. My expectation is t
hat they will continue to come down 
overtime. So that's kind of where we stand today.
 
In terms of wireless data and people hitting the caps or bumping against 
them. We are not seeing a lot of that. What we are seeing, which is part of 
our strategy all alon
g, Tim, is we know that there is an explosion going on 
with tablets. Our firm believe, all the time, was we needed to get mobile 
share out in the market place, so customers could easily add a tablet and at 
the time they add the tablet, then the increase to
 
size of the data bucket. 
That's exactly what is happening.
 
So as customers add tablets, they are being smart enough to add or to 
increase the size of the data bucket and so we are not seeing anything at 
this point that gets me concerned, especially from a
 
customer satisfaction 
point of view in terms of usage. Customers are being smart. They can 
monitor their usage now more than ever before. They are being cautious to 
make sure they don't have overages.
 
So I really think that this is huge for us and that's 
why you saw the 
emphasis that we have on getting tablets. Those tablets are getting added to 
the network. Data use is just going up. The size of data buckets is on the 
rise as well.
 
John Stephens
 
As Ralph had mentioned, 80% of the customers we have on tier
ed data 
programs, 80% of them are picking the higher tiered buckets of data. So 
they are buying up and we are pleased with our mobile share where over 
25% are buying the 10 gig bucket. So it is working out just as Ralph 
mentioned where these customers are 
buying those bigger buckets and 
generating that revenue which is generating our service revenue growth and 
it continues to have great ARPU growth on our phones.

Thank you. Our next question in queue will come from the line of Michael 
Rollins with 
Citi Investment Research. Please go ahead.
 
Michael Rollins

Citi Investment Research
 
Just a couple of clarifications, and then maybe one higher level question. 
First, is it possible to break out the dilution that you are seeing from VIP 
from an operating 
perspective, both for the second quarter and for the full 
year '13? The second clarification is, last quarter you talked a lot about the 
impact of U.S. debt on the revenue. I was wondering if you can give us an 
update. Was that also a headwind in the quart
er or was there any help from 
the U.S. debt? Just maybe directionally how that changed from the first 
quarter to the second quarter? Thank you.
 
John Stephens
 
Yes, Mike, this is John. Let me take the second question first and that is, the 
out of balance sit
uation with U.S. separate those rates being different from 
last year to this year. The same situation occurred in the second quarter at 
about the same level or about the same amounts in the same relationship as 
it did in the first quarter. So our numbers t
hat we reported to you are 
overcoming in that pressure, both on the wireless side and the wireless 
ARPUs and also in the wireline side for both, business and consumer. So, 
there is no change in that situation. We have overcome and these numbers 
that have b
een reported.
 
Michael Rollins 
-
 
Citi Investment Research
 
Then on VIP?
 
John Stephens
 
On the breakout, we don't do that, Mike, but let me say it to you this way. If 
you look at our CapEx spend on a year
-
over
-
year basis for the quarter and 
on the sequential b
asis for the quarter, it's about $900 million in both cases 
increased. We don't give a trailing expense impact on our capital, but I will 
tell you that even our construction project have some level of trailing 
expense. Then quite frankly, our software proj
ects have a much higher level 
of trailing expense.
 
The pressure for the quarter really relates to what I would view it is that 
$900 million increase times whatever percentage you would apply to it. I 
would suggest you that numbers could vary in anywhere fr
om 10% to 20% 
to 25%. We are not going to get into what ours are specifically, but I don't 
think in the industry those kinds of percentages will be unusual. I will leave 
it to you guys to determine your own.
 
Michael Rollins 
-
 
Citi Investment 
Research
 
Then just one higher level question on the wireline business and also the 
sort of prior to the enterprise business, so you have talked about in the 
second quarter that you stepped over that line where you had sequential 
growth, albeit, still down 
year
-
over
-
year. And I feel like, if you go back 
historically, we have crossed that line into positive sequential before, but we 
have been brought back to that negative territory for a variety of factors 
from time
-
to
-
time, whether it was USF, whether it was
 
the legacy parts of 
the business.
 
In addition to your comments on the strategic services, are there aspects of 
what you are seeing in the legacy or other aspects of your portfolio that 
make you believe that the step over to positive sequential growth coul
d be 
more sustainable on a one or two year basis?
 
John Stephens
 
Yes. Let me give you two different perspectives on that. One on our 
consumer business, that now greater than 50% U
-
verse, that was growing 
nearly on the consumer U
-
verse pace nearly just below
 
30%. I think the 
math will show you that when you have got now more than half of the 
business growing somewhere between 25% and 30%, is a more sustainable 
situation than it was a year ago or two years ago when that was percentage 
of the business 40% or ma
ybe a third, so the math is different with regard 
to consumer, because that base is so much bigger and so much bigger 
piece.
 
On the business side, I agree with you. The economy has given us 
challenges. We are pleased that we have gotten our strategic busin
ess 
services up to nearly 25% of our business revenues, but the economy is still 
uncertain. Such that we are not in that same point and that is why we 
mentioned that we were slightly positive on a sequential basis and we will 
have to see how this plays out
 
the rest of the year.
 
The one encouraging piece there is what we mentioned in small business 
and how well our team has done in beginning to put U
-
verse or high speed 
broadband into our small business space and the 80,000 high speed 
broadband net adds they
 
had this quarter and we are optimistic about what 
we can do with that going forward. Particularly, when you look at our trend 
that's a highest quarter we have had on record and significantly better than 
the first quarter or the fourth quarter of last year
.

in the quarter? Secondly.
 
John Stephens
 
Jonathan, I would just say no we are not disclosing that number, but I th
ink 
we disclosed the total number in our slide presentation. Our smartphone 
sales of 6.8 million and I think we have disclosed that we had a record 
Android sales, but we are not giving the specific iPhone number.

Got 
it. Okay. Then could you give us a little bit more detail, John, just 
around the synergies that you expect from the Leap deal and how quickly 
you expect to be able to realize those?
 
John Stephens
 
Well, let me say this. We will get into synergies and realiz
ations and all of 
the normal impacts that we discuss as we get the deal closed. So we are not 
going to be in the position to talk about those now. We are confident. We 
are expecting that the transaction is going to get closed after the 
government carries o
ut its responsibilities and there is a fair review.
 
I will tell you, we are looking forward to getting this done. We believe that 
Leap is going to provide us the opportunity to expand services to customers 
and a segment of the mobility market that is now u
nder served. So we are 
excited about it. We believe it's going to be a positive but we are going to 
wait and let the DoJ and the SEC go through their normal review process.
 
Ralph de la Vega
 
Thank you. Let me close down. I want to thank you for being with u

afternoon. We have delivered a solid quarter with strong subscriber gains, 
growing revenues and improving networks. At this time we are going to 
continue to invest in our business with our Project VIP and we believe it is on 
pace to provide us even 
more opportunity going forward.
 
With that being said, we think this gives us a strong momentum as we head 
into the second half of this year and into the years to come. So we are very 
excited about where we are at in our business. We believe our plans are

Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the AT&T 
Fourth Quarter 2011 Earnings Release. [Operator Instructions] As a 
reminder, today's call is being recorded.
 
With that being said, I'll turn the conference now to 
Brooks McCorcle. Please 
go ahead.
 
Brooks McCorcle
 
Thanks, John. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to our fourth quarter 
conference call. It's really great to have you with us this morning. As John 
mentioned, this is Brooks McCorcle, Head of Investor Relation
s for AT&T, 
and on the call joining me this morning are Randall Stephenson, AT&T's 
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and John Stephens, AT&T's Chief 
Financial Officer. Randall will provide opening comments, then John will 
cover our results, and then we
'll follow with Qs & As.
 
Let me remind you that our earnings material is available in the Investor 
Relations page of the AT&T website. As a reminder, that is 
www.att.com/investor.relations.
 
I also need to reference our Safe Harbor statement, which is on Sl
ide 3, and 
that says that this presentation and comments may contain forward
-
looking 
statements. They're subject to risks, and details are in our SEC filings and 
on AT&T's website.
 
With that, I will now turn the call over to AT&T's Chairman and Chief 
Execu
tive Officer, Randall Stephenson. Randall?
 
Randall L. Stephenson
 
Thanks, Brooks. Good morning, everybody. I'll start with just a couple of 
brief comments on 2011, then what I want to do is just move into our plans 
and outlook for 2012. And 2011 was obvious
ly an eventful year not only for 
us but the entire industry, and what I hope didn't get lost in all the news 
cycles on mergers and iPhones is what AT&T accomplished during the course 
of the year and really how that positioned us for 2012.
 
We came out of 20
11 with each of our key growth platforms, mobile 
broadband, strategic business services and U
-
verse, all growing at strong 
double digits. That means better than 3/4 of our total revenues now come 
from wireless data and managed services and those have a com
bined 
growth rate above 7%. We had really strong mobile sales throughout the 
year. In fact, we had a blowout holiday season. And in the fourth quarter, 
we sold 9.4 million smartphones, that's 50% above our previous record.
 
In the year, when our competitors
 
began selling the iPhone, we outsold 
them in every single quarter. We also led all competitors in total wireless 
subs added, 7.7 million for the year. And we're #1 in just about every key 
mobile broadband growth metric: smartphones, emerging devices, post
paid 
data ARPU and customers on tiered pricing plans.
 
And when you look at the network side of the equation, this was, for us, an 
unprecedented year. We challenged our network team to push call 
retainability on our 3G network above 99% by year end, and we'
ve now hit 
or beat that 3 months running. We closed the year with 80% of our total 
mobile data traffic on Ethernet backhaul. That's well ahead of our original 
plan. And we're pleased to have that deployment behind us because we 
believe we now have the most
 
robust backhaul infrastructure in the industry. 
And this is a backhaul infrastructure that is built for data.
 
On top of this infrastructure and on our HSPA+ platform, we're now 
deploying 4G LTE. And today, we have the best data speeds in the country. 
The 
iPhone 4S on our network has download speeds that are 3x our peers.
 
In wireline, our U
-
verse build is now largely complete, so we have in place 
an IP video and broadband platform that reaches 30 million customer 
locations, which gives us significant headro
om now to drive penetration.
 
On the business side of the equation, despite the economy, we've executed 
a very steady climb in revenue trends. We're now 2 straight quarters of 
sequential increases and we have line of sight to year
-
over
-
year growth this 
year
. And we continue to be very, very strong in terms of cash generation 
capabilities on operations, better than $34 billion for the year.
 
So with these data points, I'd like to 
--
 
I like how we're set up for 2012. And 
as we sit here in January, I'd tell you,
 
we probably have the best visibility 
going forward than we've had in quite some time. John is going to cover the 
outlook in detail, but at a very high level, here is what you ought to expect 
from us as we go into 2012.
 
We're going to continue to be very a
ggressive in growing our mobile 
broadband franchise. We'll return to revenue growth in our business 
segments. We'll expand wireless and consolidated margins. We'll achieve 
mid
-
single
-
digit EPS growth or better. Cash generation continues to look 
very strong
 
again next year. And given the operational momentum we have 
in the business, all of this appears very achievable and probably at the 
conservative end of our expectations.
 
I'd add that this outlook is not dependent on any kind of boost from the 
economy. Ho
liday sales suggest there's a possibility for some light tailwinds 
and we're hopeful for that, but all the core fundamentals suggest we're 
looking at continued slow U.S. economic growth and then higher 
unemployment so we built our plans around a fairly low
 
growth scenario.
 
As we look ahead, the issue that gives me the most concern, quite frankly, 
isn't our ability to execute. The #1 issue for us as we move forward, and for 
the industry, I believe, it continues to be spectrum. This industry continues 
to see 
just explosive mobile broadband growth and is providing one of the 
few bright spots in the U.S. economy, but I think we all understand this 
growth cannot continue without more spectrum being cleared and brought to 
market. And despite all the speeches from 
the FCC, we're all still waiting.
 
The last significant spectrum auction was nearly 5 years ago now. And this 
FCC has made it abundantly clear that they'll not allow significant M&A to 
help bridge their delays in freeing up new spectrum. So in the absence o
f 
auctions, our company and others in the industry have taken the logical step 
of entering into smaller transactions to acquire the spectrum we need to 
meet this demand. But even here, we need the FCC's action and leadership, 
and unfortunately, even the sm
allest and most routine spectrum deals are 
receiving intense scrutiny from this FCC, oftentimes taking up to a year and 
sometimes longer before these are approved.
 
Now I hope I'm wrong, but it appears the FCC is intent on picking winners 
and losers rather 
than letting these markets work. A lot of recent comments 
and speeches about certain members of this FCC suggest that they and not 
Congress should decide how spectrum auctions are conducted, including who 
can participate and what the conditions should be f
or participating. 
Meanwhile, we pile more and more regulatory uncertainty on top of an 
industry that is a foundation for a lot of today's innovation, making it difficult 
for all of us to allocate and commit capital. And in this industry, we all know 
capita
l investment equals jobs. So the end result of this is we have a 
industry that is just really stuck in terms of creating real capacity.
 
We will certainly do our part, as we move forward, to provide leadership on 
these issues, but it's also clearly time for
 
Congress and the FCC to step up. 
And in the interim, this environment has a lot of clear implications for our 
business and these are in 3 different areas. First, while our current overall 
spectrum position is competitive, we've led the way in mobile data.
 
Therefore, our utilization rates are running very hot and demand continues 
to accelerate so we'll continue to do a number of things. In a capacity
-
constrained environment, usage
-
based data plans, increased pricing, 
managing the speeds of the highest volum
e users, these are all logical and 
necessary steps to manage utilization.
 
LTE deployment is also going to play a role. We ended 2011 with 74 million 
LTE POPs covered and we'll accelerate that pace considerably in 2012. This 
setting us up to complete our de
ployment to 80% of the U.S. population in 
2013. And LTE does give us a 30% to 40% lift in network efficiency, but at 
current growth rates, that equates to only about a year's increase in traffic, 
so while LTE is important, it's not the silver bullet in ter
ms of capacity 
planning. What that means is, to meet customer demand, we have to 
continue our push to add spectrum in the open market. You'll see us being 
active there and we'll continue to advocate for more open auctions as soon 
as possible.
 
And then seco
nd, in this environment, we'll accelerate our efforts to improve 
our overall growth profile. We'll do that by looking at opportunities to either 
divest or restructure low
-
performing and nonstrategic assets. You've seen us 
do this in the last year or two wi
th our Sterling Commerce sale and the 
restructure of our Telmex holdings. And you'll see more of these actions over 
the next 24 months.
 
And third, given the economic and regulatory situation, it makes sense for 
us to begin to resume our share repurchase pl
an. We currently have a 300 
million share authorization, that's about 5% of our shares outstanding, and 
we'll begin to execute on that immediately. And as we go through the year, 
our Board will likely evaluate further actions.
 
So our cash flow's strong, th
e balance sheet is rock solid. We reduced total 
debt by $6.5 billion in the fourth quarter alone and this gives us a lot of 
flexibility and a lot of capacity to return value to our owners.
 
And so with that, I'm going to turn it over to John to cover result
s and I'll 
stick around for Q&A. So, John?
 
John Joseph Stephens
 
Thank you, Randall, and good morning, everyone. Let me begin by providing 
consolidated financial summary, which is on Slide 6.
 
2011 was a story of record mobile broadband sales and solid 
revenue gains. 
Revenues were up 2% for the year and 3.6% in the fourth quarter alone. 
Stronger
-
than
-
expected smartphone sales also impacted earnings and 
margins.
 
In the fourth quarter, we reported earnings per share of a negative $1.12. 
Excluding $1.54 of 
mainly noncash onetime items, earnings per share for the 
fourth quarter was $0.42. Onetime items included $0.65 of noncash 
pressure from the year
-
end mark
-
to
-
market change for our benefit plans. 
The actuarial loss on benefit plans was driven by a reduction
 
in the discount 
rate from 5.8% to 5.3%. While our investment returns were better than the 
overall market, they were less than our expectations but that was largely 
offset by better
-
than
-
expected force retention and medical cost 
management. $0.48 of the no
ncash pressure is due to asset impairments in 
our yellow page and directory operations. This was part of an annual review 
in tangible assets, comparing them to fair market values of similarly situated 
companies. $0.44 of pressure is due to the previously
-
a
nnounced 
termination of the T
-
Mobile USA transaction, and we have $0.03 of help 
from a tax settlement.
 
Cash flow continues to be strong: $2 billion in the quarter and $14.4 billion 
for the year. And when you adjust out the onetime contract termination 
paym
ent, it was outstanding. Looking ahead to 2012, we expect earnings to 
grow in the mid
-
single digits or better for the year.
 
Now let's look at revenue growth and how our growth drivers are 
transforming our revenue mix. Details are on Slide 7.
 
Fourth quarter
 
consolidated revenues totaled $32.5 billion, up 3.6%. For the 
year, consolidated revenues grew by almost $2.5 billion. The growth drivers 
were strong mobile broadband results, very good U
-
verse gains and 
continued strength in strategic business services. 
In 2011, 76% of our 
revenues came from wireless and wireline data and managed services. 
That's up from 68% or more than $10 billion from just 2 years ago. And 
revenues from these areas grew about $7 billion last year or more than 7% 
for 2011. We're confide
nt this mix shift will continue. In fact, in 2012 we 
expect consolidated revenues to continue to grow, thanks to strength in 
these growth drivers with little expected lift from the economy.
 
Now let's take a look at wireless on Slide 8. Our mobility sales c
hannel did 
an outstanding job, delivering not only the best sales quarter in our history 
but the best smartphone sales quarter in the history of the industry. We 
added more than 2.5 million subscribers. This includes gains in every 
customer category. Postp
aid net adds were terrific, with our best 
performance in 5 quarters, adding 717,000 subscribers. Tablets drove 
prepaid net adds. Reseller sales continued to be strong, and we had another 
million
-
plus quarter with connected devices. We did see churn increas
e 
slightly, only 6 basis points for the postpaid side during what we view as the 
most competitive quarter of the year.
 
Strong smartphone sales also drove impressive revenue growth. Total 
wireless revenues were up $1.5 billion or 10% and wireless service re
venues 
increased by $0.5 billion. We grew postpaid ARPU, as we have done for 
every quarter for the last 3 years. We also grew it from a much higher base 
than anyone else. Our postpaid ARPU is $6 higher than our closest 
competitor. And in 2012, we expect po
stpaid ARPU to continue to grow and 
to grow 2% for the year, thanks in part to new pricing plans that we 
announced last week.
 
We also continue to bring more subscribers onto our network with tiered 
data plans, more than 22 million at the end of the quarter
, with most 
choosing the higher
-
priced plan. As more of our base moves to tiered plans 
and as data use increases, we expect our compelling ARPU growth story to 
continue.
 
Our wireless data results are on Slide 9. If our mobility chief Ralph de la 
Vega was o
n the call today, he would say something like, we had a 
blockbuster smartphone sales. Well, I'm not Ralph, but I've got to tell you, I 
share his enthusiasm. Our mobile broadband sales were nothing short of 
incredible.
 
Our wireless team sold 9.4 million sma
rtphones or more than 100,000 
devices a day for every single day of the quarter. That's nearly twice as 
many as we had in the third quarter and 50% higher than our previous 
record. Smartphone subscribers now make up about 57% of our postpaid 
subscriber bas
e. That accounted for 82% of postpaid sales during the 
quarter. Much of this growth was driven by the launch of the iPhone 4S and 
record iPhone sales. But we also had record Android device sales, doubling 
sales from the year
-
earlier quarter.
 
Branded comput
ing sales also had a best
-
ever performance. We added 
571,000, thanks to strong tablet and tethering plan sales. We now have 
more than 5 million branded computing devices on the network.
 
Strong mobile broadband sales helped drive data growth. Data revenues 
were $22 billion in 2011, growing at 21% for the year. ARPU for 
smartphones continues to be strong, nearly twice that of our other devices. 
And about 87% of smartphone subscribers are on family or business plans. 
These customers are an excellent investment
 
because they have lower 
churn.
 
I can't say enough about how well our mobility crew did in the fourth 
quarter. We not only held our own in a very competitive quarter but we set a 
new industry sales standard as well. But you don't have these results 
without
 
having a terrific network. We are committed to creating not only the 
world's most advanced network but also the network most open to 
innovation. And we made tremendous progress towards this goal. Highlights 
are on Slide 10.
 
First, we had a great LTE launc
h last year, making AT&T the only U.S. carrier 
to provide 4G speeds through both LTE and HSPA+ technologies. This means 
we deliver the best possible blended speed which enables a better mobile 
experience for our customers. This pays off big for iPhone 4S c
ustomers with 
download speeds up to 3x faster than on any other carrier's network. You 
can also see the impacts of our CapEx investments in network upgrades and 
in expanded mobile broadband coverage. These investments are having a 
positive impact on our wi
reless quality metrics. As Randall mentioned, our 
average national 3G call retention has exceeded 99% since mid
-
September.
 
In 2012, we expect to double our LTE coverage with continued 
improvements in capacity and enhanced backhaul. We're very proud of what
 
we have accomplished and full credit goes to our hardworking network team 
for an incredible effort.
 
Now let's look at wireless margins, details are on Slide 11. As you know, the 
investments we made to drive record smartphone sales and record upgrades 
have
 
impacted wireless margins, but you also know long
-
term value of these 
subscribers: lower churn, higher ARPUs and strong data growth. Our 
strategy has been to grow this space, which we continue to do, while 
keeping existing smartphone subscribers in our ne
twork, which we did at 
record
-
breaking levels in the fourth quarter. Handset upgrades were about 
12%.
 
Looking ahead, we expect service margins to improve in 2012. In fact, I 
expect we'll get service EBITDA margins back to 40%. Driving this will be 
continue
d strong but stabilizing smartphone sales during the year, helped in 
part by the full impact of the upgrade policy that was introduced last year. 
Additional revenues are expected from the new data pricing plans that we 
announced last week and greater effic
iencies both in operations and billing. 
This really speaks to our long
-
term goal of building a strong smartphone 
base while working to improve margins.
 
Now let's take a look at the wireline business, starting with consumer, on 
Slide 12. U
-
verse continues t
o drive consumer growth: 6 straight quarters of 
year
-
over
-
year revenue increases. U
-
verse was a $6.7 billion revenue 
stream in 2011. That's almost triple the revenue from just 2 years earlier. 
And in the fourth quarter, revenues grew about 44% year
-
over
-
ye
ar. And as 
we scale, U
-
verse margins continue to improve, contributing to profitability.
 
During the quarter, we added 208,000 U
-
verse subscribers to reach 3.8 
million customers in service. Meanwhile, our U
-
verse broadband net adds 
accelerated 3x our TV add
itions, which includes new U
-
verse small business 
subscribers. Faster broadband speeds plus mobility is a combination small 
business customers are looking for and AT&T's strength in both areas is a 
competitive advantage.
 
We're also seeing broadband and U
-
v
erse Voice over IP attach rates remain 
solid. With our U
-
verse build largely complete, we now passed more than 30 
million living units, but penetration continues to expand. We now have 25% 
penetration in areas marketed to for 36 months or more and we belie
ve 
there is a lot of room for growth. Our video service is recognized as the best 
in the business and we are growing faster than any other pay TV provider. 
In 2012, we expect continued U
-
verse subscriber growth, helping keep 
consumer revenue stable.
 
Now le
t's look at wireline business, which you can see on Slide 13. We have 
been watching revenue trends slowly get better in business even without the 
benefit of an improving economy. For the second quarter in a row, we had 
sequential revenue growth, thanks to 
growth in our strategic business 
services. That's things such as Ethernet, VPNs and application services, 
which were up 18.4% for the year, and it's now nearly a $6 billion business.
 
We are seeing positive trends in almost every part of the business. Our 
g
lobal enterprise business had its second straight quarter of year
-
over
-
year 
data growth. Wholesale had its third straight quarter of sequential revenue 
growth and revenue trends in small business continue to improve with 
another quarter of broadband growth
. We now have 80% of our target 
central offices ready for IP DSLAM broadband sales and we'll soon begin 
selling into those central offices. This success helped wireline business 
margins improve year
-
over
-
year for the fourth consecutive quarter.
 
We expect t
hese positive wireline business trends to continue in 2012 and 
that the wireline business will return to revenue growth this year, thanks to 
growth in network sourcing, mobility applications and virtualized services. 
And as we said, we expect this growth w
ith little lift from the 
macroeconomy.
 
Now let's look at margins and cash flow. Consolidated comparisons are on 
Slide 14. Record
-
breaking smartphone sales and postpaid net adds 
considerably higher than initial estimates, had an impact on our consolidated 
m
argins. For the year, our adjusted consolidated operating margin was 
17.8%. That compares to 18.5% in 2010. Our wireline operating margins 
were relatively stable from 2010. We were able to offset declines in legacy 
services in a sluggish economy, thanks to
 
improving revenue trends, scaling 
IP data and solid execution with our One AT&T initiatives. Across the 
business, total force was down more than 10,000 in 2011.
 
In 2012, we expect to expand consolidated operating margins, driven 
primarily by wireless expa
nsion with stable wireline margins.
 
Our cash flow story continues to be outstanding. Our cash summary is on 
Slide 15.
 
Cash from operations totaled $34.6 billion. Capital expenditures were $20.3 
billion. Free cash flow before dividends was $14.4 
billion, a very strong 
performance especially when you consider these things: We increased 
capital spending during the year; we made a $1 billion contribution to the 
pension fund in the fourth quarter; and a $3 billion payment as part of the 
T
-
Mobile trans
action in the fourth quarter. Dividends totaled $10.2 billion for 
the year.
 
In terms of uses of cash, total debt is down almost $6.5 billion from the third 
quarter of 2011 levels with a debt
-
to
-
capital ratio of 38% and a net debt to 
adjusted EBITDA ratio o
f 1.5. And as Randall mentioned, we also plan to 
begin aggressively buying back stock from our previously authorized share 
buyback.
 
Looking ahead in 2012, we expect capital expenditures to be about $20 
billion with continued investment in our growth driver
s. And we expect free 
cash flow in the $15 billion to $16 billion range for the year. Our balance 
sheet is sound, our debt metric's solid. Our strong cash flow gives us the 
flexibility to invest or to retire debt while returning substantial value to 
shareh
olders.
 
Let me close with a quick recap of 2011 on Slide 16. We executed very well 
this year, with good momentum across our business. We grew revenues and 
had incredible cash flows. We set industry records for mobile broadband. 
Strength in strategic busine
ss services has business wireline poised for 
growth, and U
-
verse drove growth in consumer wireline. We also continue to 
invest in the future, almost $100 billion over the last 5 years. And we've 
done all of that while continuing to return value to our shar
eholders.
 
Let me also do a recap of 2012 guidance that we have provided throughout 
this call, that's on Slide 17. Looking at 2012, we have a solid strategic plan 
in place that will help us grow revenues, expand margins, increase earnings 
while continuing t
o have a very strong cash flows. In wireless, we expect to 
expand margins while growing postpaid ARPU by 2% for the year. We expect 
to return wireline business to revenue growth and keep wireline consumer 
revenues stable while also keeping wireline margins
 
stable. We are targeting 
capital expenditures at the same level as 2011, approximately $20 billion. 
We expect free cash flow in the $15 billion to $16 billion range, and we will 
begin share buybacks.
 
This is a growth
-
focused outlook and also reflects our 
ability to execute on 
the cost side. We expect little help from the economy but are certainly 
prepared to take advantage of any opportunities that exist. This is a time of 
unprecedented growth for an incredibly dynamic industry. We have a great 
position an
d a solid track record of creating value for our owners and we 
expect to improve on that record in 2012.
 
Brooks, that concludes our prepared remarks. We are ready for Q&A.
 
Brooks McCorcle
 
Okay, great. Thank you, John. Okay, John, I think we're ready to ope

[Operator Instructions] And first, we'll go to Simon Flannery with Morgan 
Stanley.

Morgan Stanley, Research Division
 
Randall, I think one of the things you were hoping to get from T
-
Mobile was 
a better prepaid platform. Prepaid's about 2/3, 70% of the new subscribers 
coming on. Can you talk about how prepaid will fit into your strategy, given 
what Verizon and some others have done here recently for 2012? And 
perhaps, you could expound
 
a little bit more on your comments about 
looking at underperforming assets. Might we see spinoffs of rural lines and 
sales of directories, is that the sort of thing we should be thinking about?
 
Randall L. Stephenson
 
On the prepaid platform, we've been rat
her transparent about the prepaid 
area in terms of when you're spectrum
-
constrained, you get really focused 
on the markets you want to pursue. And we have obviously been very, very 
focused on the high end of the market. And the beauty of T
-
Mobile was it 
no
t only came with spectrum, which would allow for some efficiencies, but 
then a prepaid platform that allowed you to move down market. As we're 
getting more and more of a better performance out of our network and as 
we move to LTE and begin to free up some 
of the 3G spectrum, this is 
probably an area that we'll look to for growth, Simon. In fact, we have a lot 
of work going on in this right now. I wouldn't expect or I wouldn't have you 
expect to see that in the next 6 months, but when you look at the next 12
 
to 
24 months, prepaid will obviously become a focus for us especially when you 
think in terms of mobile data because, mobile data, that's probably an 
underserved area where that segment of the market does not have a robust 
data offering in a prepaid envir
onment. So that will be a focus as we begin 
to mine out some capacity as we move to LTE. In terms of the 
underperforming assets, you hit a couple of areas. Obviously, we just took a 
rather large charge in our directory operations to reflect a lot of the cu
rrent 
comparable pricing in the market for those types of assets. That's one area 
that we're going to obviously take a very hard look at. And while I don't 
want to give any indication of M&A activity, it's one of these areas where 
we're going to have to de
cide: Do we keep it, or do we restructure it as we 
move forward? So the other being rural access lines, we have been 
apprehensive on moving, doing anything on rural access lines because the 
issue here is, do you have a broadband product for rural America? 
And we've 
all been trying to find a broadband solution that was economically viable to 
get out to rural America and we're not finding one to be quite candid. The 
best opportunity we have is LTE and we were obviously rather excited about 
the opportunity to 
use LTE to get it to rural America with the T
-
Mobile 
transaction. That having been set aside, now we're looking at rural America 
and asking, what's the broadband solution? We don't have one right now. So 
you'll see some activity and some structuring change
s over the next couple 
of months that will provide some idea in terms of where we're headed. We're 
going to have to either completely restructure those businesses. The cost 
structure has to change, not only the wage and benefit cost structure but 
just the 
cost structure associated with the technology, legacy TDM 
infrastructure out there. And leaving them as they are, they'll continue to be 
underperforming assets so we're going to have to make some fundamental 
changes, and there's more to come on that. But a
s I said, the next 12 to 24 
months will bring more clarity to that, but these are areas that we as a 
company have to address in short order.

Our next question is from John Hodulik with UBS.
 
John C. Hodulik

UBS Investment Bank, Research Division
 
Randall, maybe picking up on the spectrum issue, maybe a little bit more 
detail, if you could, on your spectrum needs. I mean, obviously, you have 
some runway with the new 4G network, but you said you'd be more 
aggressive in that area or then, say, in 2012
. I mean, what kind of 
opportunities are out there? I mean, is it more private companies like Aloha 
or even potentially other larger companies out there that are operating 
businesses that have spectrum that you guys could look at? If you could just 
charact
erize the sort of environment for new spectrum that already exists. 
And then maybe talk a little bit about, from a frequency standpoint, I mean, 
obviously, for you guys, the lower the better, but where would you look at 
spectrum? Basically trying to get a 
sense for how badly and how soon you're 
going to need new spectrum.
 
Randall L. Stephenson
 
Yes, okay, John, what I'd tell you is the immediate time frame. In terms of 
through our LTE deployment through 2013, I feel really good about where 
we are. We've got 
sufficient spectrum to get us through LTE deployment. 
And then, as you to begin to transition off your 3G networks to LTE, it'll buy 
you some more time in using data [ph] solutions and Wi
-
Fi solutions. But 
when you kind of look out and span the horizon or 
scan the horizon, there 
are no secrets. Everybody knows where the spectrum resides and who is 
holding it. Our biggest issue isn't identifying it and pursuing it. Our biggest 
issue is understanding what we're allowed to do. And we're literally sitting 
here 
in a situation where we don't know how much spectrum we're allowed 
to hold, who we're allowed to do business with and so forth. That was the 
basis of my comments in the opening session. We've just gone through a 
process where we tried to get a transaction 
approved and the FCC came out 
with a report and said that we exceeded the spectrum caps in over 200 
markets. You can imagine how surprised we were to read that until you've 
read deeper into the report and realized they had changed the spectrum 
screens. It 
might have been nice to have known they were going to change 
those spectrum screens ahead of time, but that is what it is. Then literally, a 
couple of weeks later, they approve our acquisition of the Qualcomm 
spectrum, and in reading the report, they evalu
ated it using the old 
spectrum caps. So we're literally sitting here in a situation where we don't 
know what spectrum caps are going to apply from one transaction to the 
next. So our first issue is not identifying which spectrum we go after but 
identifying
 
what the rules are. How will these transactions be evaluated? 
Who are we allowed to do business with and who are we not allowed to do 
business with? In terms of the frequencies that we're interested in, it's no 
surprise. We tend to favor the lower band, t
he 700
-
megahertz spectrum. We 
have a very, very good position in that particular location so we obviously 
have a lot of interest in the spectrum that resides down there. We've done a 
number of transactions in that particular area since the auctions occurre
d in 
2007, so that's obviously an important area for us. AWS is obviously a good 
area for us to operate. We've launched our LTE network in the Chicago area 
on the AWS spectrum, that frequency, and it's performing quite nicely. So 
those would obviously be t
he priorities, but again, that's, the who and the 
what is not the question. It's what can we do and what are we allowed to do, 
it's the real question for us right now.

Our next question is from Michael Rollins with Citi Investment Research.
 
Michae

Citigroup Inc, Research Division
 
First on the wireless side, you've talked about the improvements in network 
quality but also that the network is running hot. Can you talk about the 
opportunities that you have to continue to manage the high qua
lity of 
service to the broad base of HSPA+ customers and what the implications are 
for CapEx? And then secondly, a little bit more on the business side. If you 
could just give maybe an expansion of comments in terms of what you're 
seeing on strategic reven
ue growth and what's been driving the strong 
growth there. And also maybe what you're seeing on the legacy service 
guide, maybe some slowing in the rate of revenue erosion there?
 
Randall L. Stephenson
 
Sure, Michael. On the network quality side, wireless ne
twork quality, with T
-
Mobile behind us, we're back to blocking and tackling, if you will, and that 
means reinitiating significant sales splits. So we had a sales split strategy 
that was on hold till we got to the T
-
Mobile transition. So we're back to doing
 
sales splits. We continue to go very, very aggressively on distributing the 
antenna system solutions and so going inside of buildings and lighting up 
buildings from the inside, Wi
-
Fi solutions, all of these, we just continue. And 
there's no new science he
re per se. Obviously, additional spectrum, where 
we can pick it up, is another part of the equation so you'll continue to see us 
be aggressive there. We have, I think we had some transactions approved 
by the FCC last week, but before last week, we had 8 tr
ansactions sitting in 
front of the FCC waiting for approval so we can begin investing. So you'll 
just continue to see us do a lot of the typical blocking and tackling. And 
you'll also see us, in markets where we've launched LTE, be very aggressive 
in migra
ting customers to the LTE platform. And if you're buying today an 
Android smartphone by 
--
 
from AT&T, you're probably buying an LTE
-
equipped handset, so as we turn up LTE in any of these markets, you're just 
inherently on the LTE network. So that obviously
 
facilitates getting us the 
capacity relief that we need, as well. So it's going to be a number of 
initiatives. In terms of the business services side, what's driving it, again, 
there's no big secrecy here. VPNs are a huge part of this. Our business 
custom
ers are moving aggressively to VPN solutions and we continue to run 
mid
-
teen type growth rates on VPN. The other is Ethernet, and native 
Ethernet solutions, whether to businesses, or a really big business 
opportunity for us right now is deploying this to c
ellular companies. Wireless 
companies are buying Ethernet to the sales side aggressively, as we told 
you. We now have 80% of our mobile broadband traffic on native Ethernet. 
All mobile companies are trying to get there as fast as they can. We think 
we're w
ay ahead of the game in this regard. The benefits from it are 
dramatic in terms of the throughput increases you see by getting that 
backhaul infrastructure in place on Ethernet. So we're seeing big 
opportunities there and then lots of opportunities in term
s of new application 
services that are riding on top. Once you put the VPN in place, customers 
are buying more and more applications and services that ride on top of that 
whether it be videoconferencing, telepresence and so forth, so we're having 
a lot of 
success there. So you put it all together, we continue to get 17%
-
type growth from these strategic businesses and service. That's helping 
offset the migration that we're seeing from a lot of the legacy products, as 
you said. So traditional voice continues 
to be in decline, as you would guess. 
Traditional data services, and really, they are somewhat flat, but data is 
growing in spite of flat legacy data services. So all in, we're feeling really 
good about the business side of the house. What I would remind y
ou is that 
these strategic services are growing at this 17% clip and what we're seeing 
is still a very sluggish economy. I mean, this is not a high
-
growth economy. 
These businesses tend to invest in telecom as they hire people. These 
businesses have not be
en hiring but our spend from these companies and 
these services are growing. What we're hopeful for, and we're seeing some 
signs, just very kind of faint signs, but we're seeing some signs that maybe 
there's some economic tailwinds here. If we get those, t
hen we think there's 
some serious upside to our business side of the house and business revenue 
growth.

Our next question is from Mike McCormack with Nomura Securities.
 
Michael McCormack

Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division
 
Randall, I guess, just thinking back about the introduction of the iPhone. And 
obviously, a lot has happened since then, but clearly, there was an 
expectation for an improvement and the approving of an NPV positive story. 
But maybe just help us with what t
he headwinds have been there because, if 
you look back over the past couple of years on churn metrics, ARPU growth 
rates and margins we're just, it just doesn't seem like we're getting the 
benefits of either iPhone or smartphone penetration. Can you just w
alk us 
--
 
I think voice is obviously an issue there, but any other headwinds that you 
think that you can address as we go forward? And then John, just thinking 
about the EPS guide, have you included a thought process on iPhone 
refresh?
 
Randall L. Stephenso
n
 
I guess what I would suggest is, while we've had margin pressures as we've 
gone deeper and deeper into the smartphone category, they continue to be 
high
-
NPV product categories. And in fact, the ARPUs are significantly higher 
than traditional mobile
-
phone
-
type capabilities. And to think that we're 
getting to 57% penetration of our smartphone base 
--
 
or of our postpaid 
base, excuse me, with smartphones and keeping margins in that 40% range, 
to penetrate that deeply and keep margins at this 40% range, I actu
ally 
think is better than I might have hoped for. I 
--
 
it was a while before we had 
expectations that 80% of our sales would be in smartphone categories. But 
to sell 80% of all of your sales being smartphones and keep margins in this 
40% range for the year
, I, actually I'm not too disappointed with that. And I 
think it's going to prove to be a terrific platform for us because here's what 
we're seeing, Mike, and that is, you get a customer on smartphone and then 
you get a customer with FamilyTalk plans or fa
mily plans on smartphones 
and the smartphone becomes the platform for the new services that we're 
now selling. Somebody buys a tablet and puts their tablet on a 3G or 4G 
network. That customer puts that device on the same network as their 
smartphone. So we
 
think it's going to prove to be a very important platform 
as we move forward. That's why we're not shying away from continuing to 
pursue this market. We have done some things where we've tightened up 
the upgrade policy to try to begin to manage the cost o
f the upgrades in this 
particular base. But all things considered, I'm pleased with the smartphone 
category and we'll continue to do things to tighten up margins as we go 
forward. We also took some actions during the course of this year that had 
an effect 
on our ARPU, and we believe it's going to prove to be a temporary 
effect on our ARPU, and that is, with 2011 being the year when we first had 
competition for the iPhone, we made some strategic moves. We introduced 
unlimited mobile
-
to
-
mobile calling if you 
had an unlimited text plan. That 
proved to be a very sticky move from a pricing standpoint, but it's had a 
negative effect on ARPU over a couple of quarters. We're seeing that 
stabilize now. We don't expect to continue to see that dilution on ARPU as 
we mo
ve forward, but that did have an effect this year that we think is 
largely behind us, and as we move to 2012, it should not continue to 
suppress ARPUs. But all in, it continue to be a bull, a big
-
time bull in the 
smartphone category and iPhones in general.
 
Michael McCormack

Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division
 
And just a, I'm sorry, Randall, just as a quick follow
-
up on that. You 
identified part of the voice pressure there, but are you seeing, obviously, 
upgrades are running pretty high across th
e entire industry, but are you 
seeing the people coming to the store for the upgrade to the smartphone, 
making decisions on how many voice minutes they want? Because it seems 
like, and I mean, I got a couple of younger kids, but they just don't talk on 
the
 
phone anymore. So are we seeing sort of the pricing down to these 
lower buckets?
 
Randall L. Stephenson
 
Without a doubt. And well, you're seeing it from the phenomenon you just 
described, and that is, young people, it's almost uncool to talk on a phone, 
ri
ght? I mean texting and messaging are keys. But, and so that has had its 
effect. But also, when we did go to mobile
-
to
-
mobile calling, this will tell you 
how efficient these markets are, but people began to immediately, 
particularly in small business, smal
l businesses immediately rightsized their 
plans to reflect the mobile
-
to
-
mobile calling feature. And so we did see a 
step
-
down very quickly, but as I mentioned, we're beginning to see that 
mitigate.
 
John Joseph Stephens
 
Mike, with regard to your question w
ith regard to the 2012 expectations, 2 
points on smartphone sales with an iPhone refresh: We do have smartphone 
sales flat compared to '11 in our expectations and that is in a 25
-
million
-
unit 
level, which is a record for us. So we did assume that we would 
have that 
same level again, and that's after we've fully implemented during this year 
our new handset upgrade policy so that also takes into account some growth 
opportunities.

Our next question is from Phil Cusick with JPMorgan.
 
Philip Cusick 
-
 
JP
 
Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division
 
First is just a follow
-
up on what you just said, John. So that's a flat from the 
fourth quarter smartphone run rate, right?
 
John Joseph Stephens
 
I'm sorry. We're going to 
--
 
we 
--
 
the annual run rate for the smartphone
s in 
2011 was $25 million and we have plans that assume we're going to stay at 
that level for the year in 2012. It just may be mixed differently by quarter. 
That, in my opinion, is a significant number particularly since we'll have the 
new upgrade policy f
ully implemented this year.
 
Philip Cusick 
-
 
JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division
 
Got it. So you would expect the upgrades to moderate somewhat in '12?
 
John Joseph Stephens
 
Yes.
 
Philip Cusick 
-
 
JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division
 
Okay. So a bigger qu
estion: Can you talk about the wireline business a little 
bit? It just sounds like you said it'll turn positive in 2012. Does that mean 
sort of positive for the year, or at some point, maybe during the back half, it 
switches to positive? And then talk abou
t margins there. So flat year
-
over
-
year, is there any potential for additional cost cuts? Or is that really sort of 
mix shift still and there's not much to be done with that level?
 
John Joseph Stephens
 
So I directly expect revenue to grow for the entire ye
ar, for the overall. 
Whether it occurs fully in the first quarter or it occurs later, it will occur for 
the full year. We expect revenues to grow. Secondly, there are additional 
cost opportunities and savings opportunities. We've gone a tremendous 
distance
 
in getting our One AT&T initiatives and other cost efficiencies in 
place, but there's always, as one of my peers would say, there's always 
more, and we're going to continue to work for that more. We do have a 
headwind of continued legacy product challenge
s, and so those cost savings 
may go to offset that. And finally, as we've mentioned here previously, we're 
not assuming a significant lift, a measurable lift at all from the economy. 
And as such, if we had that lift, there would be an opportunity to perfor
m 
better than what we've expected.
 
Operator
 
Our next question is from Jonathan Chaplin with Crédit Suisse.
 
Jonathan Chaplin 
-
 
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division
 
A couple of quick questions for John. So firstly, on the share repurchase, is 
there any 
impact of share repurchase that's included in your EPS guidance, 
and if so, how much does that contribute? And I'm wondering if you can just 
talk a little bit about how you sort of manage between wanting to take as 
many shares out as quickly as possible ea
rly in the year versus maintaining 
that 1.5x debt
-
to
-
EBITDA ratio. Can you go significantly above that and 
maybe implement something like an accelerated share repurchase program 
early in the year and then trend back down to that over the course of the 
year
? And then, sorry, one final question: On the impact of the upgrade 
policy change, can you just run through when you think that impact will start 
showing up? And how much you think the upgrade rate could come down in 
2012 over 2011?
 
John Joseph Stephens
 
So
 
Jonathan, let me to try to take them in short order. First of all, with 
regard to the assumptions we made in the plan with regard to share 
repurchase, I would suggest to you, my guidance, our guidance for the year 
wouldn't be any different based on moving
 
that share repurchase 
assumptions around. It wouldn't have changed 
--
 
it did not change the 
guidance we're giving you, so if we had no share repurchase, we'd stay with 
that mid
-
single
-
digits EPS growth. That's the first question, I hope that's 
responsive.
 
The second question, with regard to our debt ratios, I think you 
need to understand, and I know you do, Jonathan, but I think you need to 
step back and look at our balance sheet today, with over $3 billion in cash 
on our balance sheet. Look at the cash fl
ows that we are expecting to 
generate, over 
--
 
close to $6 billion over our dividend requirements. That 
total of $9 billion gives you a good insight into how much shares we can 
repurchase or can give you one insight into how much shares we can 
repurchase w
ithout affecting debt metrics. And so we'll be prudent. We are 
sticking to our standards with regard to the 1.5x and in the debt
-
to
-
equity 
kind of guidelines we've given. But we have cash generation. A company like 
ours has significant flexibility in the t
iming of those kinds of activities. The 
upgrade policy, I would expect it to go in full force at the end of the second 
quarter. We've put it in place in the first quarter of a year ago and it takes 
about a 1.5 years to be fully implemented. You probably wo
n't see the full 
effects of it until the second half of this year. That's our expectations. I will 
tell you that, in this first year, we are expecting to see some improvement, 
but we have not given, and I don't believe we are giving guidance on the 
specifi
c impact on upgrades. Anything else?
 
Operator
 
And next, we'll go to Jason Armstrong with Goldman Sachs.
 
Jason Armstrong

Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division
 
Randall, maybe just a quick follow
-
up on the regulatory environment. What, 
in your mind, i
s the path to more clarity out of D.C.? What would you need 
to see from them? Or are we just to assume that you effectively need a 
complete reset at the FCC to contemplate anything else of size that you'd 
take to them? And then maybe just a quick follow
-
up
 
on the upgrade 
percentage. Obviously, such a big swing factor for wireless margins. The 
industry seems to go through waves of tightening and loosening upgrade 
policies. Your latest move, obviously very constructive and tightening, but 
maybe you can talk b
igger picture and longer term, can we as an industry 
get into a sustained period of tightening that would really reflect sort of a 
greater degree of discipline?
 
Randall L. Stephenson
 
Okay. In terms of the regulatory environment, Jason, I would tell you the
re 
is one thing that could be done in very, very short order that would kind of 
lift the veil or cloud of uncertainty surrounding a lot of this, and that is, 
Congress passes legislation initiating the auctions and it's very prescriptive 
to the FCC in terms
 
of what the FCC's role is in the auctions. And the House 
has a bill that is, has been drafted and it accomplishes exactly that. The FCC 
is obviously contesting that language. I think the chairman made a speech 
the week after the holidays, the chairman of 
the FCC, where he said he 
needed the rules to be fluid. My interpretation is these rules are so fluid you 
can drink out of them with a straw right now. So what we need from 
Congress is prescriptive legislation on how these auctions should be 
performed. And
 
the language is presently in the current House bill. If that 
bill were to get passed, I think it starts to lift the veil of uncertainty 
surrounding the industry. In terms of upgrade policy, Jason, what you're 
articulating and discussing is the indication 
of an incredibly competitive 
environment in the mobility world. And I think what you're beginning to see 
is the smartphone market is maturing a bit, and as it matures, I think you'll 
begin to see different behavior among all the players. I probably can't g
o 
much further than that, but our 
--
 
as I've said at the very beginning, I feel 
like we have about as much visibility into the future as we have had in quite 
some time, so that intimates a certain degree of predictability that has not 
been there before. An
d we'll see. We've built our plans and our margin 
expectations around selling a comparable number of smartphones as we did 
in 2011, so 25 million. Will there be some new iconic device that nobody 
anticipated come out during the course of the year? Perhaps.
 
But I do think 
25 million sales is probably a reasonable expectation for us. And if we can 
get, if we do a 25 million sales level, then a 40% margin is probably an 
achievable level.
 
John Joseph Stephens
 
Jason, one thing, if I could add, Jason, one point I
'd make is, as we go 
through this transition in our network and the ability to provide LTE, one 
aspect of this refresh process, as Randall mentioned, that doesn't get loss on 
is we really don't necessarily have to give much in the way of financial 
incentiv
es to get our customers, as this was clearly shown in the fourth 
quarter, to get them to go to the latest technology. So we have an 
opportunity to shift dramatic levels of traffic to LTE. Also, as the industry all 
begins to fall into a similar situation wi
th us with regard to wireline, wireless 
handset subsidies and cost and structure, we would hopefully expect that 
everyone would act rationally in the process.

Our next question is from David Barden with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.

I guess, just first, John, when you mentioned that you thought that wireless 
margins could be as high as 40% in 2012, were you meaning that you 
expect it to be able to maybe touch 40% at some point in time, or is 
that 
kind of more of a full year look? And then on the consumer revenues, for the 
last couple of quarters, it looks like they've been coming down sequentially. 
I know you've talked about some of the headwinds that you're facing with 
the legacy businesses a
nd trying to restructure those, but is there a risk that 
consumer revenues might dip back down into negative territory and then get 
offset by some of the advances in business, as we look in the 2012 mix?
 
John Joseph Stephens
 
First of all, on the wireless m
argins, the expectations I mentioned, 40% 
were for the full year. We'll see how the different quarters go because of 
volumes and new handset issuances and so forth, but the comment was 
intended for the year. With regard to the consumer revenues, a couple o
f 
things I think I'd point out to you. We've got the U
-
verse build complete or 
essentially complete. And we'll continue to do a little bit more here and 
there, but we've passed 30 million homes so now we have a full 30
-
million
-
home capability to sell into 
so we have opportunities to continue that 
growth. I think we mentioned that there was 16% penetration in our eligible 
living units, and in those that are longer than 36 months, we're more like 
25%. The other piece of that is we're having tremendous results
 
with our 
high
-
speed U
-
verse
-
type broadband, not only in consumer but in small 
business. And so those opportunity to sell into more U
-
verse markets and 
that continued push on high
-
speed Internet and attach rates for VoIP give 
me optimism over continuing to
 
have a good performance in consumer. With 
that being said, we are expecting even better performance in business. And 
they've proven it, they've shown it. The strategic services give us factual 
support for that thought process.

If I could just follow up real quick, Randall, just one quick one for you. If we 
could just get your kind of take on the Verizon agreement with the cable 
companies, their cross
-
marketing agreement now kind of anticipating 
potent
ial Verizon selling of cable products in your territory. How do you look 
at that transaction? Are you, would you support it at the FCC? How do you 
think about it competitively? What does it make you want to do to respond? 
That'd be very helpful.
 
Randall L.
 
Stephenson
 
Yes, as it relates to them selling cable products, it's interesting. It was 
obviously, their footprints don't overlap so much and so I don't know. I think 
it'll be interesting to see how the FCC deals with it. It appears to me to be a 
logical t
ransaction. I obviously will be watching very closely because, again, 
it's, hopefully it's one more data point on what the spectrum screens really 
are, which if it does nothing, it should give us some clarity on what we're 
able to do as we move forward. So
 
we won't be a participant in terms of 
comments or anything on this, just watching as a very interested bystander, 
hopefully getting some indication on what it means for us in terms of what 
we're able to do.
 
Brooks McCorcle
 
Okay, John, I think we have time
 
for one more question.
 
Operator
 
And that will be from the line of Craig Moffett with Sanford Bernstein.

I wonder if you can just help me, Randall, with the growth outlook. If I'm 
doing th
e math right, it looks like service revenue growth in the wireless 
business, excluding the hardware sales, has now actually dropped to about 
4%, and as you said, the smartphone penetration is now at about 57%. How 
do I think about kind of re
-
accelerating g
rowth in that business? Where does 
it come from since the incremental data penetration rates and the growth 
rates are starting to subside a bit?
 
Randall L. Stephenson
 
Yes, so 57% smartphone penetration. As we said, sales, smartphones 
represented 80% of our sales. So every time we peg what the penetration 
rate will get to, it seems like the percentage of sales moves up another 
notch. And so we think we still have quite a
 
ways to run in terms of 
smartphone penetration and you continue, we'll continue to see ARPU lift as 
we penetrate smartphones more and more into the base. Also, I believe that 
what you're seeing right now, 1.4% postpaid ARPU growth, I believe you'll 
see th
at accelerate next year as we work through some of our unlimited 
mobile
-
to
-
mobile calling price changes. So we think we'll see some ARPU lift 
in terms of the growth rate, going into next year, so that will be very 
important. And then again, as I mentioned,
 
I'm absolutely convinced the 
smartphone is a platform. And the customer that you hold with the 
smartphone is the customer that you will sell the tablet, is the customer that 
you will sell connected devices, is the customer you will sell home 
monitoring ca
pabilities. We 
--
 
I just really believe that it's becoming more 
and more a factor in terms of, or a platform in terms of further penetration 
in mobile data and that's why we're going so aggressively on LTE. And then 
we haven't really begun to broach busine
ss mobility and business mobility in 
terms of applications. I think we're very early in the cycle in terms of 
businesses mobilizing all aspects of what they do, whether it be sales force 
automation or imaging, and there's just so many applications that 
bus
inesses are just starting to get their hands around that will become a 
significant driver of growth. So I'm feeling pretty good that we have a long 
way to run in terms of growth in the mobile broadband infrastructure. You're 
seeing us invest heavily. We'll
 
continue to invest, again, getting to LTE 80% 
coverage by 2013 and we just think it's going to be a terrific opportunity.
 
So with that, I, we're going to close. And I want to thank everybody for 
taking part. As I said, 2012, we've probably got the best vi
sibility we've had 
in quite some time. Our growth engines are on track. It is being led, as you 
heard by our comments and your questions on this call, by mobile 
broadband. The key for us is spectrum. We need the FCC and Congress to 
get us, to open up and g
et us to a point of open auctions, and that needs to 
be done as soon as possible.
 
We're committed to making sure that AT&T is structured for growth. We're 
going to look at low
-
growth and nonstrategic assets and make some 
decisions over the next few months.
 
And given this environment, we'll begin 
significant share repurchases and we'll do that immediately. So we're looking 
forward to a good 2012.
 
Thank you, again, for joining us, and we'll talk you later. Thank you.

Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to AT&T First 
Quarter Earnings Release 2013 Conference Call. At this time, all participants 
are in a listen
-
only mode. Later, we will conduct a question
-
and
-
answer 
session, and 
instructions will be given at that time. (Operator Instructions) 
Also as a reminder, this teleconference is being recorded.
 
And at this time, we will turn the conference call over to your host; Ms. 
Susan Johnson. Please go ahead.
 
Susan A. Johnson
 
Thank you
, Tony. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our first 

Johnson, Head of Investor Relations for AT&T. Joining me on the call today is 
John Stephens, AT&T's Chief Financial Officer.
 
John will provide an update 
with perspectives on the quarter then we'll follow
-
up with questions. Let me 
remind you, our earnings material is available on the Investor Relations 

 
I also need 
to cover our Safe Harbor statement, which is on slide 2. This 
presentation and comments may include forward
-
looking statements. 


 
Now before I turn
 
the call over to John, let me quickly cover our 
consolidated financial summary, which is on slide 3. Reported EPS for the 

Our results this quarter include about $0.03 help from an i
ncome tax 
settlement, when you exclude this earnings per share was $0.64 for about 

is adjusted to exclude our divested Ad Solutions unit.
 
Consolidated revenues excluding Ad Soluti
ons were up 0.9% year
-
over
-
year. 
Thanks to solid revenue growth in wireless, continued gains in U
-
verse 
services and growth in strategic business services. Revenues were impacted 
somewhat by lower regulatory fees this quarter. When you normalize for the 
di
fference in these charges, consolidated revenue would have grown 1.3%. 
Consolidated margins were down slightly year
-
over
-
year primarily due to 
wireline pressure.
 
Cash flow started the year strong. Cash from operating activities for the 
quarter totaled $8.2
 
billion and free cash flow was $3.9 billion. And we 
continued buying back shares as part of our repurchase program. In the first 
quarter, we bought back 168 million shares for $5.9 billion.
 

 
Financial 
Officer, John Stephens. John?
 
John Stephens
 
Thank you, Susan and good afternoon everyone. Thank you for being with 
us today and as always thank you for your interest in AT&T. Before we get to 
the detailed results, let's start with a quick overvi
ew, highlights are on Slide 
4.
 
First, we had a solid start to the year. Earnings per share growth was strong. 
Adjusted consolidated revenues increased. And cash flow continues to be a 
success story for us. We added more than $2 million IP broadband 
connect
ions in the quarter when you combine both wireless and wireline 
connections.
 

smartphone sales set another first quarter record. Tablet showed post
-
paid 
growth with an exceptional quar
ter, and customers continued to flock to our 
mobile share plans making it easier than ever to add new devices and drive 
further growth. This resulted in improved revenues, better margins, post
-
paid ARPU growth and lower churn.
 
In wireline, U
-
verse continue
s to shine. We had our best ever U
-
verse high 
speed Internet sales in the first quarter. This drove positive broadband 
growth. In fact, we had our best total wireline broadband growth in nine 
quarters. U
-
verse video sales also were strong, as we added more
 
subscribers than we have in any quarter over the last two years.
 
So the team is executing at a high level and we have the right strategy. Our 
financial results were solid, our capital structure sound, all in all a solid start 
to the New Year.
 
Before we mo


already have made tremendous progress with our LTE deployment. We are 
running ahead of schedule with near
ly 200 million LTE POPs covered to date. 
And we expect to complete nearly 90% of our $300 million POP
 
LTE build out 
by the end of this year. The LTE network also is operating at high levels. 

ed by an 
independent third
-
party testing group.
 
Then on wireless network performance including call, text and data. 
RootMetrics ranked AT&T number one or tied for number one in 14 of the 23 
markets they have surveyed so far this year. And this comes on top
 
of 
ranking first or tied for first in more than 70% of the markets RootMetrics 
surveyed in the second half of last year where we had deployed LTE.
 
Our U
-
verse VIP deployments will begin rolling out later this year. But the 
incredible first quarter U
-
verse
 
results add to our confidence in making this a 
larger part of our growth strategy. We had record high
-
speed IT broadband 
net adds along with increasing U
-
verse video games. We continue to gain 
market share in areas where we offer U
-
verse and Project VIP e
xpands those 
areas even more.
 
The same holds true with our strategic business service revenue growth and 
our fiber build into business. Even in uncertain economic times, we are 
seeing growing demand for high
-
speed connectivity and our advanced dial 
service
s. These results once again are going to show that Project VIP is 
working and the right strategy for AT&T.
 

had another solid quarter. Thanks to continued growth of the mobile 
Inter
net. Revenue and ARPU are on slide 6. Mobile data continues to surge. 
Revenues were up 21% in the quarter that helped drive 3.4% service 
revenue growth and total wireless revenues were up 3.4%. You will recall 
that we adjusted the way we book our data reve
nues which no longer 
include text messaging, and as you can see this quarter mobile data 

growing at 21%. You also can see the impact of data growth when you look 
at postpaid ARPU.
 
Data A
RPU grew 18% and total postpaid phone
-
only ARPU was up 2%. Total 
postpaid ARPU, which includes high margin, but lower
-
ARPU tablets and 
other non
-
phone devices, also grew in the quarter, up about 1%.
 
Our postpaid smartphone base also continues to expand. Th
ose details are 
on slide seven. Smartphone subscribers increased by more than 1.2 million 
in the quarter and by more than 7 million in the last 12 months. Overall 
smartphones now make up more than 70% of our postpaid phone base and 
smartphones accounted fo
r nearly 90% of postpaid sales in the quarter, 
giving us even more room for smartphone growth. These are the premium 
subscribers in our business.
 
They have twice the ARPU of non
-
smartphone subscribers and much lower 
churn. So their conversion brings additi
onal revenue. Another new first 
quarter smartphone sales record of 6 million helped drive that growth. We 
had 4.8 million iPhone activations in the quarter while our upgrade rate was 

 
The number of postpaid su
bscribers on usage base data plans also continues 
to grow. Overall, almost 70% of our smartphone base has moved to usage 
base plans.
 
Mobile share plans continue to be popular by the end of the first quarter, 
mobile share accounts reached $3.3 million. Thes
e accounts include about 
$10 million subscribers or devices such as smartphones and tablets. This 
growth is even more impressive when you remember that we give customer 
the choice when picking a data plan allowing them to pick the one that 
works fast for t
hem. At the same time, take rates in the higher mobile share 
data plans those that are 10 gigabytes or higher continue to run above 
expectations with more than a quarter of mobile share accounts on those 
plans.
 
And we continue to see a steady movement of s
ubscribers on unlimited 
plans taking advantage of Mobile Share, more than 15% of subscribers have 
moved over from unlimited plans or about 1 million subscribers today.
 
During the quarter, we introduced larger Mobile Share plans targeting 
businesses as well
 
as consumers who need more data. These plans offer up 
to 50 gigabytes per month and provide an attractive revenue yield. We also 
see the impact of the mobile Internet on our postpaid net adds, details are 
on slide 8. We have strong gains in tablets, this 
new growth area draw 
postpaid growth of almost 300,000 postpaid subscribers in the quarter. We 
also had another solid quarter with our connected devices adding 431,000 
subscribers primarily with security and tracking devices.
 
Reseller and prepaid 
impacted our overall result or overall net adds. Reseller 
had a net loss this quarter primarily due to resellers rationalizing there are 
no or low usage accounts. These disconnect had a negative impact of more 
than 600,000 on reseller subscriber net ads in
 
the quarter and on total 
subscriber net ads in the quarter. Although the reseller volumes involved 
were significant, it had little impact on revenue. In fact, our reseller revenue 
is up more than 50% year
-
over
-
year.
 
Prepaid sales continue to be impacted b
y declines in session
-
based tablets. 
We do see some changes across the mobile marketplace. As always, we 
continue to evaluate and look for opportunities to take advantage of our 
network, including new product offerings, funding opportunities and 
alternativ
e forms of distribution, but we also continue to see improvements 
in churn.
 
Postpaid churn had another strong quarter, down year
-
over
-
year and 
sequentially. And we had our best ever first quarter smartphone churn, 
which was less than 1%. We did have a poli
cy change with regard to third
-
party retailers that had a small impact on churn, but with or without that 
change, we saw a reduction in churn and we continue to see year
-
over
-
year 
improvements in postpaid churn.
 

n slide 9. Our wireless margin 

continue to be strong, but even with increased sales, margins are 
expanding. The story is no different this quarter. We set our first quarter 
record of 6
 
million smartphone sales, yet our wireless EBITDA service margin 
was 90 basis points higher when compared to the first quarter of 2012 or 
43.2%.
 
Smartphone subscribers continue to be a wise investment. You know the 
long
-
term value they bring; higher ARPU,
 
lower churn, strong data growth, 
driving growth in operating income, which was up more than 4% year
-
over
-
year.
 
We really feel good about our wireless position. Revenues continue to grow 
with expanding margins. The mobile Internet continues to bring strong
 
data 
growth with more and more subscribers on usage
-
based data plans, 
customers continue to embrace our Mobile Share plans helping drive tablet 
growth and our LTE deployment is ahead of schedule and winning praise as 
the fastest in the industry. So, all i
n all, a really solid wireless performance 
has set the stage for a strong year in 2013 and beyond.
 

can see on slide 10. Once again, we had another impressive U
-
verse 
performance 
with accelerating subscriber gains. The growth of our high 
speed IP broadband has been nothing short of dramatic. We added more IP 
broadband subscribers this quarter than ever before, more than 730,000, 
which helped drive our best total broadband net ads i
n two years. IP 
broadband now makes up more than half of our total broadband base with 
an ARPU growing at more than 9% year
-
over
-
year, plus we are gaining 
share against our competition.
 
U
-
verse TV also had a great quarter. We added 232,000 U
-
verse video 
cu
stomers, our best showing in nine quarters. These gains help drive overall 
consumer revenue growth of 2%. Adjusted for changes in regulatory fees it 
would have been nearly 2.5%, with U
-
verse revenues up more than 30% in 
the quarter often ever increasing ba
se. So once again another solid quarter 
in consumer, and we see more opportunity for growth with our increasing U
-
verse penetration and planned Project VIP expansions.
 

you look at th


small business starts is still pressuring that part of the revenue stream. 
Wholesale and government solutions cont
inue to be challenged and our 
enterprise revenues after showing some positive signs last year were 
challenged in the first quarter. Combined business revenue was down 
sequentially and year
-
over
-
year, pressured somewhat by regulatory fees. 
Adjusting for tho
se fees total business revenue was down 2.7%.
 
One bright spot was the strong growth in strategic business services. Those 
are products that are part of our Project Velocity investments including VPN, 
Ethernet, Hosting and other Advanced IP services. These 
were up 10.8% 
even in a very difficult economic environment. Expenses were down year
-
over
-
year to help offset some of the revenue decline, but uncertainty with 
the economy continues to be the issue.
 
Customers are delaying buying decisions, unemployment imp
rovement 
continues to lag, the business overhang from regulatory uncertainty persists, 
and government budget issues are all having an impact on our customers 
and on our results, but the most challenging aspect for us is trying to 
forecast the future in thi
s environment. Like others, we are looking for 
consistent signs of improvement. One thing that is not faltering in our 
confidence in the future is that it will be driven by high
-
bandwidth 
connectivity, mobility and the clouds. Nobody is positioned better t
o take 
advantage of these opportunities once the uncertainty passes and the 
economy turns.
 
Let me give you more detail on slide 12. AT&T is a recognized leader in 
solutions for hosting and cloud services. We offer network
-
centric integrated 
solutions that 
provide value to customers on a global basis. The foundation 
for our cloud services is having one of the worlds most powerful and 
advanced global MPLS networks that span 187 countries. We operate 38 
datacenters that are fully integrated with that network, 
providing top
-
of
-
the
-
line security, reliability and management.
 
We see a future where our wireline network assets and mobility come 
together in the cloud that will mobilize workforces to access business 

 
in this area has been 
recognized recently by industry analyst Gartner, who gave the company the 
highest rating for important capabilities for network services. We have the 
network, the right tools and the right products to win in the fast developing 
cloud
 

opportunities in this space.
 

are on slide 13. For the first quarter consolidated margin was 18.9% down 
slightly fro
m the year ago first quarter.
 
Wireless margin expansions offset wireline pressure. However expenses from 
corporate and new business initiatives did impact the overall margins. In 
wireline, pressure from business as well as success based expenses in 
consume
r drove operating margins down slightly. Helping offset this 
pressure were growth in consumer revenues, operational improvements and 
solid execution of our one AT&T cost initiatives.
 
We continue to expect consolidated margins to be stable this year with 
gr
owth in wireless offset by pressure in our investments in our wireline 
business.
 

A summary is on slide 14. In the first quarter, cash from operations totaled 
$8.2 billion. Capital
 
expenditures were $4.3 billion with more than half of 
that invested in the wireless business, which gives us free cash flow before 
dividends of $3.9 billion more than $300 million improvement over last 

 
Our CapEx expectations continue
 
to be in the $21 billion range as we ramp 
Project VIP throughout this year. However, we are adjusting our longer
-
term 
capital spending expectations. We now expect capital spending to be in the 
$20 billion range for both 2014 and 2015 that is down from the
 
$22 billion 
level we expected when we announced Project VIP last November. This 
reduction brings no slowdown in our Project VIP deployment.
 
As we have refined our VIP planning, we are seeing greater integration 
efficiencies in our spending curves. Our LTE
 
build is accelerating into this 

-
Project VIP 
spending gives us confidence to revise our expectations without changing 
our overall build targets. Post Project VIP, we expect capital spending to 
take
 
a step down to more normal levels.
 
Moving to dividends, payments for the quarter totaled $2.5 billion and we 
repurchased 168 million shares for $5.9 billion. This makes our total return 
to shareholders in the first quarter more than $8 billion and more th
an $30 
billion in the last five quarters. Plus, as we announced last month, the AT&T 
Board approved an additional $300 million repurchase authorization. The 
Company expects to make huge repurchase decisions opportunistically, 
which will likely slow the pac
e of buybacks compared to recent activity.
 
In terms of uses of cash, total debt was up in the first quarter as we took 
advantage of historic low interest rates with a debt
-
to
-
capital ratio of about 
46% and a net
-
debt
-
to
-
EBITDA ratio of 1.68, well within ou
r guidance in the 
1.8 range or lower.
 
We also continue working with the Department of Labor on a plan that would 
contribute a preferred interest in our AT&T Mobility to fund our pension 
plans. We continue to be optimistic on the strategy and expect approva
l of 
this proposal in 2013.
 
So all in all, another solid financial performance. Our balance sheet is sound, 
our debt metrics solid and our strong cash flow gives us the flexibility to 
invest in growth initiatives while returning value to shareholders.
 
Now,
 
before we take questions let me close with a quick recap on slide 15. 
We are off to a good start to the year, and what gives us a lot of confidence 
looking ahead is that we built a strong, very strong foundation for growth for 
2013 and beyond.
 
The spectru
m position is solid. We are tracking ahead of schedule with our 

quality awards across the country. Our capital spending is more effective 
and efficient than we originally expected. Insu

and our smartphone and tablet gains continue to be very strong. The 
number of subscribers we have on usage
-
based plan is climbing fast. And on 
top of this, we have one of our best U
-

our Pro
ject VIP wireline expansion really starts to ramp, which we expect to 
only make all of these things stronger as we move into the second half of 
2013 and beyond.
 

momentum we have. We 
are positioned to grow even in this slow economy. 
And we are well positioned to continue returning substantial value to 
shareholders.

Thanks and good afternoon. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit 
about the business revenue in more detail in terms of implied erosion of 
legacy services relative to strategic, is that being hurt by the cyclical as well 
as the se
cular, and is that something that continues at this rate, or do you 
see some improvement coming over the next 12 months to 24 months in 
that segment? Thanks.
 
John Stephens
 
So, good afternoon, Mike. Real quickly, if you breakdown the three 
segments, so to s
peak, of our business revenues into the small business 

-
verse 

seeing some positive improvement in our Wholesale 
business, but in our 
Government, Education And Medical, are still being really challenged by the 
economy and by funding, and Enterprise is continuing to be challenged by 
uncertainty and, if you will, delaying decisions even though they are 
spending on spee
d and advanced data services.
 
When we look at the overall business services, Mike, I think about it this 

unemployment or regulatory concerns or government spending maybe 
affecting 


hard to predict. But what we do feel good about it is the position we are in, 
when it turns, because we can provide
 
that combination of integrated 
services like no other. Hopefully, that answered your question, Mike.

Thank you very much. Good afternoon, John. You had a very good U
-
verse 
numbers, can you talk a lot about, what was driving that specifically? It 



there and do you think that this is sort of a new kind of turn in the corner as 
the DSO base becomes lower and then given your sort of leverage
s, is that 

asset sales or other monetization? Thanks.
 
John Stephens
 
Thank you, Simon. And quite frankly on our U
-
verse positive developments 
both in small business and in consumer,
 
I would tell you that the simple 
answer is really, really quality execution by our people and their teams. 
Certainly there were some promotions, certainly there were good 
opportunities that presented itself from existing assets, but I would tell you, 
that
 
it focused on reducing churn, that it focused on shortening installation 
times, they focused on converting customers from legacy DSL services to 
the high speed U
-
verse services. It was really a whole collection of really 
quality execution by the team and 

 
As you can see, we still drove revenue growth and we still are getting very 
good revenues on their triple
-

incentive driven, it was really performance.
 
With regard to our bala
nce sheet and our wherewithal, I guess the first item 

we got a great balance sheet, very strong, strong cash flows, very great 
coverage of all of our responsibilities. So, we feel good
 

 

strategies, we have a responsibility to look at all of those because we are 
here to monetize and maximize value for our shareholders, but with the 
strength of 
our balance sheet, we can be careful and prudent with regard to 
taking those steps and are not necessarily in a position, where we need to 
do any of that.

talked about in wireless for mid single
-
digits long
-

ing 
to figure out and sort of goes into subscriber and ARPU side as more of the 
subscribers come from tablets and assuming Digital Life launches fairly soon 

in wireless this quarter. 
Can that be sustained given sort of where want the 
industries going and not growing by much, and two, coming to the other 
side of the smartphone growth or do we really need to prepare ourselves for 
us lower ARPU, lower revenue growth in wireless going forw
ard, thanks
 
John Stephens
 
Thanks, Phil. First and foremost, we still feel good about our guidance about 
mid single
-
digits throughout the growth in the mobility business. I would 
suggest a couple of things, one; we do still have room to grow on the 
smartpho
ne as we mentioned. Sales rates are 90%, current customer base 
is at 70%, that give us a lot of room to grow.
 
Secondly, we continue to see the adding of tablets and other DAM devices so 

deployment, we 

forth. So that should provide us with future growth aptitude and all of that 
as before we roll out things like Digital Life, the connected card, Mobile 
Premise Solut
ions and a lot of the other opportunities that we have moving 
forward.
 
So we still feel good about where we are at, we are opportunistic and 


 


year in the spring of this year and so I think you will be hearing more about 
that soon.

of voice. Is ther
e an acceptable situation for AT&T and can you continue to 
be set of negative on voice overtime as competitor set of loose your 
subscribers or do you need to tun it up a little bit and try and be positive 
there.
 
John Stephens
 
I guess, let me make one of th
e point that (inaudible), and I think people 
going to work our churn is done, and the fact that is continuously going 
down or really optimistic about growing revenues from that perspective, and 
as that happens we will see impacts on our total revenue base,
 
but if you 
are asking, are we going to continue to see some form of conversion of 
revenue from voice to data that would surprise us, but we are positioned 
well with usage base plans to capture the revenue opportunity the Bad Data 
provides. So still feel g
ood about all those opportunities, we just need to 
continue to execute and continue to move forward with our LTE, Bill.

Thank you. Our next question will come from John Hodulik with UBS. Please
 
go ahead.
 
John C. Hodulik 

 
UBS Securities LLC
 
Hey, thanks John a quick follow
-
up just on Bill question, really more focused 
on the ARPU, you saw some deceleration if you look at some of the 
components I think at least phone
-
only ARPU went from 2.5% growt
h last 
quarter to 2% this quarter, and then the dilution from these other high 
margin low ARPU devices almost doubled from 0.6% to 1.1%. I guess first 
what is driving the phone
-
only deceleration, is that just you still got a lot of 
penetration to go, but m
aybe the incremental penetration from a 
smartphone standpoint is slowing, and really if you put all these points 
together, should we continue to expect to see deceleration going forward or 
is it more of a alternative subs sort of story and less of an ARPU 
story, and 

customers last quarter, I wondering if you guys are giving our that number, 
thanks.
 
John Stephens
 
John a couple of things, one ARPU is always impacted by quarterly 
fluctuat
ions and level of sales and so forth, but quite frankly this quarter is 
impacted compared to prior quarters, but a change in the regulatory rates, 
there was 10% change in the regulatory fee rates that are charts are 
included our revenues, and so that I thi
nk it explains a fair amount of the 

perspective when you take that into consideration, still feel real good about 
where ARPU is going and our phone
-
only ARPU.

Hey, guys, thanks. John, can you just talk a little bit about, again on the 
wireline margin side. I know there is typically some first quarter seasonality 
to the others. Are there pieces that we
 
should be thinking about the Project 
VIP impact, I guess I was expecting more of a sort of 2014 impact on 

give a little more detail around that? And then lastly, any reaction to th
e 
upgrade policy chains on wireless at Verizon? Thanks.
 
John Stephens
 

-
verse. A couple of 

for U
-
verse services from Proje
ct Velocity is really a leader this year in 2014 
type event. The sales and success in customers at both video and IP 
broadband was really great execution in this first quarter. It was an 
expanded selling space, but with that we still had success based cost
 
and so 

-

expect of it.
 
Two, I had expected as we expand the footprint and get additional coverage 
that we got out of Velocity, you will continue to see some really solid 
numbers and s
ome pressure from the success of sales. I just believe the first 
quarter results there are real positive for going forward. So, I mean, you are 
right, we always have some first quarter pressure with regard to margins, 

mparison to last year also.
 
Mike McCormack 

 
Nomura Securities International, Inc.
 
Is this the run rate we should be thinking about John as we progress 
through the next couple of quarters?
 
John Stephens
 

re going to come in 

margin amount, but we feel good about the efforts the team has gone 
through to manage the margins and if you think about the challenges we 
face in the business reve
nues, were really performing well on cost 
management.

rying to stay 



at a very
 
high level.

Thank you. Our next question will come from Jason Armstrong with Goldman 
Sachs. Please go ahead.
 
Jason Armstrong 

 
Goldman Sachs
 
Hi, great. Thank you. John, ma
ybe a couple of questions, first on, tablets, 
you obviously had a really good quarter. You had a partial subsidy model 
attached to that and I am wondering and thinking through that is the 
subsidy maybe something you used just to stimulate demand temporaril
y 
and to replace these devices in the base or is that more of a sort of recurring 
part of the model if you go forward.
 
And then second question just on leverage, the 1.8 turn, I think my 
understanding was to create room to invest in Project VIP and to go t
hrough 
a big capital cycle over the course of 3 years and still leave room to buy 
back shares aggressively if you wanted to. With reducing the capital 
spending targets here but still leaving the leverage target out there, sort of 
the same ratio does that s
ignal an intention to continue to tap that capacity 
for additional share buybacks? I know you said buybacks were slowing from 
here but it seems like you still have plenty of room, is that the case? 
Thanks.
 
John Stephens
 
Okay, great Jason. Let me cover you 
second question first. With regard to 
the 1.8, it was a couple of things, yes it was a recognition of the fact that 

recognition of historically low interest rates. If you look at our intere
st 



lot of really inexp
ensive or attractively priced debt capital and with company 
like ours who has a very solid dividend, we are finding prudent in making the 
decisions about which capital to utilize.
 
With that being said, yes the reduction in the project VIP capital projectio
n 
of the last two years will provide us additional flexibility and that is 



ect to finish this $600 million share 
authorization in the second quarter and we will be opportunistic and 
potentially buy at a slower pace as we go forward.
 
The other question, I think you had, Jason, was on tablet and I would 

tified it right. We put that in place to see how it 
would work to stimulate demand and see what kind of, not only take rates 

initial testing of that in the fourth quarter we decided
 
to stay with it because 
we have found that the economics make a lot of sense.
 

it will continue to moderate and make a decision as we go forward with 
regard to keeping in place 
or adjusting it, just like we do with all our product 
offerings.

Synesael with Cowen & Company. Please go ahead.
 
Colby A. 
Synesael 

 
Cowen & Co. LLC
 

wireline, curious if those all began on January 1 or if that happened mid
-
quarter and therefore there is more of an impact to be seen in the second 
qua
rter, and also how that relates back to your previous guidance of 2% or 
greater than 2% consolidated revenue growth? And then, my second 

particularly outside the U.S. and even more so in
 
Europe. Has that increased 
or decreased perhaps over the last, I guess, since the beginning of the year? 
Thanks.
 
John Stephens
 
So, welcome Colby. The first thing I want to mention to you is that right now 
we are not changing our guidance with regard to gr
eater than 2% of 
revenue growth for the year or certainly sensitive in a situation at hand with 

we want to be respectful of that and we understand those aspects. So the 
challenges of
 
the economy and the challenges arise from business is 
something we follow very closely.
 
With regard to the regulatory fees, those rates are in place for the quarter. 
That differential was for the first quarter. The new rates have been 
established for the 
second quarter and I believe the differential year
-
over
-

So somehow that regulatory fee pressure will continue throughout the 

ng that into account in 
all of our planning.
 


that the U.S. marketplace that we operate in is well ahead o
f, appears to be 
well ahead of the rest of the world and mobility and the developments 

see if we can provide and take advantage of the assets and knowledge we 
have and provide value

Thank you. Our next question in queue will come from David Barden with 
Bank of America. Please go ahead.
 
David W. Barden 

 
Bank of America Merrill Lynch
 
Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. John, it looks like with the tax 
benefit in the income statement and the deferred tax gain in the cash flow 
statement, it looks lik
e you guys got about $1 billion tax contribution 
positive to the quarter. Could you talk a little bit about how you see that 
shaping up over the course of the year contributing to the $14 billion free 
cash flow or better guidance, and then obviously how th
e contribution of the 
wireless business is going to layer in over the course of the year on that 
front?
 
And then, a second question, if I could just kind of go back to this. I just 

wer
e saying is that from a competitive standpoint, from a wireless subscriber 
of growth standpoint, AT&T is satisfied with how you did this quarter, say 

going on T
-
Mobile. And then, 
as the LTE business kind of ramps up look to 
that for future revenue growth opportunities. Is that a fair assessment of 
what you said earlier? Thanks.
 
John Stephens
 
Thanks, Dave. Let me take one at a time. First of all, on the tax side of the 
earnings, we 
recognize the fact there was around a $0.03 benefit in the 

our presentation. If you pull that out that leaves us with an effective tax rate 
just under 33% and I think those of you wh
o probably know that are kind of 
normal effective tax rate to somewhere in that 33% to 34% range, they 

 
Secondly, with regard to taxes and cash flow, first of all, we take into 
account and a
s with our cash tax payments as we determine cash flow and 

guide that pre
-
cash flow will be in excess of $14 billion this year. I 
understand people questioning that number based
 
on the fact that we are 

the question, but right now we will continue to guide to greater than $14 
billion.
 
With regard to mobility business, make sure I clarify the sense of we
 
follow 
the marketplace. We continue to look at what others are doing and what we 
are doing ourselves and we continue to develop ideas and methodologies 
and processes to be more competitive. The best example I can give you is 
the Mobile Share plans as well
 



to you that, there is a lack of activity on improving our bu
siness or growing 

 
David W. Barden 

 
Bank of America Merrill Lynch
 
All right. And John, just a follow
-
up quick on how the contribution of the 
wireless stake is going to get flow through the tax fine and casual benefi
t for 
rest of the year?
 
John Stephens
 
Yeah. We have taken into account any of the tax benefits at cash or expense 
benefits into account in our planning, in the guidance we gave in January 
and quite frankly the cash flow guidance which I just refreshed and 
EPS 
guidance which is what I was changing has already taking that into account.

Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question in queue will come from the line of Tim Horan 
with Oppenheimer. Pleas
e go ahead.
 
Timothy Horan 

 
Oppenheimer
 
Well, thanks guys. Just two broad questions; back on the wireless front, 
John maybe to go into little bit more, do you think you have pricing power in 
wireless as it improve versus where you were couple of years ago and do 
you think you can take advantage 
of that?
 
And then secondly, maybe you can built into on the supplier side a little bit 


from just bette
r pricing that you are seeing on the supplier front?
 
And I guess back to question I have on second quarter, can we start to see 
the same thing on the handset side? Do you think you have a little bit more 
leverage at this stage on the hands of supplier fron
t. Thanks.
 
John Stephens
 
So, good to hear from you, so let me pick a few things. One thing, I would 
tell you this on the wireless side, the way I think about it is this improving 
network that we have and the recognition from RootMetrics now, the fastest, 
b
ut the highest quality and this more rapid deployment than we expected 
that I expect with regard to our LTE really gives us feeling good about the 
opportunities for the overall wireless business to add more customers 
through lower return, retain more custo
mers and to generate revenue from 
usage
-
based devices. So I think, if you will, the powerful piece of our 


 
With r
egard to CapEx, I would suggest you that there is couple of things 
going on. One, we got deployment out of the LTE faster on an accelerated 
basis even last year when we guided to finish at 150 million LTE POPs and 


guiding to be nearly 90% complete with our 300 million POP by the end of 
this year. So that acceleration is taking some of the CapEx pressure off of 
2014 and 2015.
 
Secondly, we are finding that the integration opportunities when
 
we do, if 
you will, a bottoms up build plan analysis or finding more integration 

driving a lot of the savings. And third, the ability to get out there quicker is 
really taking of
f some of the pressure that we expected there with some of 
our core non
-

efficiency and the build and effectiveness of build and pushing it that way. I 

vings are coming from.
 
The last thing Tim, I would suggest you as we are always looking at ways to 

important and we continue to look for ways to do that, but I will tell you we 
co
ntinue to do with the focus on the customer and making sure we 
developed ideas that are not only focused on economic efficiency for us but 
for customer satisfaction. We believe we have to have both piece of that to 
really be successful long
-
term within.

ahead with your question.
 
Chris M. Larsen 

 
Piper Jaffray, Inc
.
 
Yeah, I wonder if we could switch over to slide 12 where you talked about 
the cloud and hosting there. And two questions specifically, first, if you could 
talk a little bit about what you have been seeing in terms of pricing on cloud. 
There has been a lo
t made, the recent pricing declines out of the Amazon 
and Rackspace and how that has affected you? And then given the fact that 
you dedicated a slide or two in your slide deck, maybe you can size up that 
opportunity, how big does that have to come before, 
can begin to move the 
needle here on the top line for wireline results? Thanks.
 
John Stephens
 
So a couple of things. One, we forgot to how move the needle on wireline 
results, as you all know our wireline revenue base is in that $60 billion plus 
range. So 


growing that revenue and also providing us the opportunity to continue to 
provide those network base services.
 
So, keeping the traffic on our services 
as well as providing the security and the other hosting services.
 
So, we believe that the opportunity is strong for us. I would suggest you 
even recent events will tell you that with regard to our managed network in
 

one.
 
With regard to recent pricing activities, I would suggest you that I think 


d for that. But we feel long
-
term we can provide a quality 
product with good margins to generate returns for our shareholders. So we 

because, we have the, if you will dual side of no
t only providing the cloud 
and the hosting. But also being able to provide the mobility connectivity to 

of it.

with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
 
Brett J. Feldman 

 
Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
 
Thanks for getting me in. So some of the
 

eluding to the fact that your postpaid phone base slipped a little bit in the 

read into that. But if you put seasonality aside, what do you ant
icipate for 
your traditional phone base going forward? Is it something that we should 
see outside of a seasonally slow period continuing to grow or are you 

real revenue growth driver
 
going forward is data volume on your network 
and not necessarily the net changing your phone base quarter
-
to
-
quarter.
 
John Stephens
 
Yeah, so I think we do find important to continue do if you will grow our 
phone base, but more importantly convert our phon
e base because if you 
think about that the differential between 70% of our postpaid and the 90% 

when you convert them to smartphones you may think of them as a phone 
but there ar
e generating significant data usage on the network and an 
opportunity for real revenue creation, so we are focused on, but we are also 


believe we are positioned well 

network like we do and great sales operations like we have and a customer 
focused approach, we are optimistic about our ability to be very successf
ul.

Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the AT&T First 

listen
-
only mode. [Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, this conference 
is being 
recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to our host 
Michael Viola, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please, go ahead.
 
Michael Viola
 
Thank you and good morning everyone and welcome to our first quarter 
conference call. I am Mike V
iola, Head of Investor Relations for AT&T. And 

CEO; John Stankey, President and Chief Operating Officer for AT&T; and 
John Stephens, our Chief Financial Officer. Randall is going to b
egin with an 
overview of the COVID
-
19 impact on our employees, our customers and our 
business, John Stankey then will discuss how we are managing our business 
through this crisis, and then John Stephens is going to discuss COVID
-
19 
financial impacts, how w
e are managing our liquidity and capital during this 

and then we will take your questions.
 
Before we begin, I need to call your attention to the Safe Harbor statement 
which says 
that some of our comments maybe forward
-
looking. They are 
subject to risks and uncertainties. Results may differ materially and 
additional information is available on the Investor Relations website. And as 
always, our earnings materials are also available 
on the Investor Relations 
page of the AT&T website.
 
So with that, I will turn the call over to Randall Stephenson. Randall?
 
Randall Stephenson
 
Thanks, Mike and good morning. We appreciate everybody joining us this 
morning. I want to start with a look at ho
w we are responding to the COVID
-
19 pandemic. It has been chaotic few weeks for all of us, and the COVID 
pandemic had a significant impact to our first quarter to the tune of $0.05 
per share. But if we set the COVID
-
19 impact aside for a moment, the first 
quarter was pretty much what we had expected. We expected to produce 
solid wireless results that would cover the HBO Max investment. The net 

we delivered. John Stephens will explain,
 
the wireless EBITDA was up 7% for 
the quarter and that largely offset the significant investment we made in 
HBO Max.
 

-
19 situation. We have 
about half of our employees working from home, and this ranges 
from our 
frontline customer support teams to our executives. For our folks who 
cannot work from home because they are on the frontlines providing 
essential services, we have instituted several policies to help keep them 
safe, everything from personal prote
ction protocols and equipment to social 
distancing and additional cleaning, and we gave all our employees 4 weeks 
of additional paid excuse time off for a broad range of COVID
-
related needs.
 
Turning to our customers, it all begins with the AT&T network, th
e best and 
fastest wireless network in the country. We are seeing unprecedented 
volumes of voice calls, text, video streaming, and our network is performing 
very well. And FirstNet is doing exactly what it was designed to do, provide 
critical connectivity 
to our first responders, healthcare providers, 
governments, military, police, fire, and EMS. The demand from our FirstNet 
customers has been tremendous. These first responders are the true heroes, 

isis is putting 
unexpected financial pressure on many households and small businesses, so 
to give them some breathing room, we have adopted flexible payment 
options, waived late fees and overages, and we have lifted data caps.
 
Connectivity is more essentia
l now than ever and we want to do what we 

to overstate the impact of COVID
-
19 on all of us. I expect it will have long
-
lasting implications for many things we used to take for gr
anted like how we 
congregate, work, travel, and interact. The economic impact has been swift 
and there is no consensus on how long this downturn lasts. A lot hinges on 
when and how we open things back up, when do we have sufficient testing 
and protocols in
 
place, so people feel comfortable returning to work or 
school or even going shopping. Bottom line, we have very little visibility into 
the broader economic situation, which makes it impractical to provide 
detailed financial guidance at this time.
 
So here 

suspended share retirements. We have a strong cash position, a strong 
balance sheet, and our core businesses are solid and generating good cash 
flow. We are sizing our operations to reflect t
he new economic activity level 
and we are leaning into our cost and efficiency initiatives. As a result, you 
should expect the following. We will continue investing in our critical growth 
areas like 5G, broadband, and HBO Max. We remain committed to our 
di
vidend. In fact, we finished last year with our dividend as a percent of free 
cash flow a little over 50%. And even with the current economic crisis, we 
expect the payout ratio in 2020 to be in the 60s, and we are targeting the 
low
-
end of that range, which
 
is a very comfortable level for us. And last, we 
will continue to pay down debt and maintain high quality credit metrics. 
AT&T has been through a lot of other crises before. And each time, you have 
seen us emerge in a stronger position, and I am confident
 
we will do it again 
with this one.
 
So, with that, I am going to turn it over to John Stankey for an operational 
review. John?
 
John Stankey
 
Thank you, Randall and good morning everyone. As Randall said, these are 

r of how our employees have 
selflessly committed to doing everything they can to keep our society 
connected, informed, and entertained. For me, the highlights of what have 
been some pretty tough days are the wonderful stories of our employees on 
the frontl
ine supporting healthcare professionals, enriching lives, and 
facilitating connections and commerce. This intrinsic tie to the essential 
functions of everyday life is why I am heartened by the fact in our core 
subscription
-
based businesses, wireless, broad
band, and enterprise 
networks are critical and valued services in these times. They connect, 
inform, and entertain our customers. And for our business, they represent 
more than 60% of revenues and more than 70% of EBITDA. These 
businesses have proven to be
 
resilient and they help provide a recurring 
stream of revenue and solid cash flows even in times of economic stress. 
They also provide a foundation that can absorb pressure from the other 
parts of the business that are facing headwinds because of COVID
-
19
. In the 
media business, COVID has impacted us on the theatrical and TV side, with 
production studios and theater shutdown and less advertising revenues with 
the postponement or cancellation of sporting events. We also expect our pay 
TV business to be impa
cted by the economic headwinds. As you might 

initiatives that remain largely under our control. If anything, we see this as 
an opportunity to approach all our businesses differently and b
etter align our 
work with how COVID has reshaped customer behaviors and the economy.
 
As I shared previously, we are working on 10 broad areas of opportunities 
that we expect will deliver $6 billion in cost savings over the next three 
years and improve mark
et effectiveness, everything from IT and field 
operations to call centers and retail distribution. Leaders and teams are in 
place to work the portfolio of opportunities. We have a solid senior 
governance structure to guide and resource this work.
 
Since our
 

underway to yield over $1 billion in recurring cost improvement and improve 
our overall customer experience. First is our retail and third

distribution capabilities. To address our dist
ribution strategy, we will be 
adjusting locations, location size, own versus agency mix, and point
-
of
-
sale 
support systems and compensation structures. The second initiative is 
focused on our field operations, which will benefit from our product evolution 
to customer self
-
install, the shift of our broadband base to lower
-
cost fiber, 
and improved systems and AI capabilities that will reduce truck rolls and 
eliminate second visits. These efficiencies will enhance our ability to continue 
to invest in our key g
rowth initiatives.
 
Our 5G deployment continues, although we continue to navigate workforce 
and permitting delays. We expect nationwide coverage this summer. We also 
continue to be opportunistic with our fiber build beyond the 14 million 
household locations
 
we reach today. HBO Max continues to be a high 
priority, and we are set to launch May 27. We were right about the 
streaming model on HBO Max. Streaming that appeals to all demographics is 
in high demand. We have announced distribution agreements that cove
r 
nearly 50% of the HBO embedded wholesale base and over two
-
thirds of the 
retail base with more still to come prior to launch.
 
Now, our technical teams are working to finish the platform that will offer 
one of the best customer experiences in streaming. W
e also have great new 
programs for nearly every key demo, such as Love Life with Anna Kendrick, 
The Not

Late Show With Elmo, the unscripted voguing competition, 
Legendary, hosted by Dashaun Wesley, and much more. All this paired, with 
the day and date 
strength the award

winning HBO programming lineup and 
curated with one of the highest quality TV and film libraries available. The 
studios are dark for now, but as soon as we can resume production, we plan 
to get back where we left off in March with the st
eady stream of new 
offerings in the fall and winter. We are also deep into planning how priority 
operations will return to the workplace as we come out of this pandemic. 
This experience will change many things, including customer behaviors and 
expectations

We are evaluating our product distribution strategy, re

of the business to come out 
of this crisis stronger than before.

impacts 
from this pandemic on Slide 5. With the uncertainty caused by COVID and 
the recovery, we have withdrawn all prior financial guidance. No one knows 
the full duration and magnitude of this situation. We have been running 
several different stress tes
t scenarios with varying degrees of severity. 
Through it all, we expect to come through this healthy and expect that our 
cash flow will allow us to continue to invest in growth areas, to provide 

alk more about 
that in just a moment, but first there are some short
-
term and recurring 
financial impacts we want to discuss.
 
In mobility, the most immediate impacts are the reduction of roaming 
revenues as well as a reduction in late fees. The waiving of 
late fees is a 
commitment to our customers during these difficult economic times and 
roaming should gradually increase as people start to travel more. The first 
quarter impact of these items was approximately $50 million, with virtually 
all of it in the se
cond half of March. We are augmenting our digital sales 
team to mitigate the impact of store closures on equipment and service 
revenues, but we are still forecasting lower wireless gross adds and 
upgrades. In fact, equipment revenues were down nearly 25% y
ear
-
over
-
year in March. As a result of COVID, we anticipate an increase in bad debt 
expense across the various businesses, and accordingly, have recorded a 
$250 million incremental reserve in anticipation of that.
 
In our entertainment group, we anticipate 
increases in premium TV 
subscriber cord
-
cutting as well as lower revenues from commercial locations 
such as hotels, bars, and restaurants. Labor unit costs will increase 

employees. At Warn
erMedia, content production has been placed on hiatus. 

revenues and lower costs from sports rights. This crisis has shown the value 
of premium streaming entertainment and we anticip
ate strong demand for 
HBO Max when it launches next month. Fiber and broadband are more 
important than ever and we saw a pickup in demand for both in the quarter. 

expect a negative impac
t on small business, which makes up about 15% of 
our total business wire line revenues. A detailed schedule of the COVID 
impacts is included in our investor briefing.
 

with the fin
ancial summary. COVID impacted first quarter results, but we 
expect the full effect to be felt during the second quarter, assuming the U.S. 
economy and businesses begin to recover in the second half of 2020. For the 
first quarter, adjusted EPS was $0.84 a 
share, which includes about $0.05 of 
COVID impacts. We expect more than half of these impacts will be short
-
term in nature. Revenues were down from a year ago. COVID and FX had 
about a $900 million impact on revenues, mostly due to lower advertising 
from t
he cancellation of March Madness, as well as lower wireless equipment 
revenues. Much of this impact was offset by lower expenses. Strong growth 
in wireless service revenues were offset by reduced video revenues, tough 
year
-
over
-
year theatrical comparisons 
at Warner Bros., and reduced 
business and consumer legacy service revenues. At the same time, 
corresponding expense reductions generally offset the impacts on operating 
income. In fact, adjusted operating income margins declined by 20 basis 
points, but wer
e up when excluding COVID impacts.
 
Our ability to generate cash continues to provide a strong foundation for our 
capital allocation priorities. Cash from operations came in at $8.9 billion and 
free cash flow was about $4 billion. The first quarter is typic
ally our lowest 
free cash flow quarter due to the timing of employee incentive compensation 
and vendor payments for holiday equipment sales. It also includes about $1 
billion of working capital timing items that we expect to balance out later 
this year. We
 
also saw COVID
-
related costs that impacted free cash flow. 
CapEx was nearly $5 billion, consistent with last year. Prior to the 
suspension of share repurchases, we retired about 142 million shares in the 
quarter and we retired about 200 million shares sin
ce the beginning of the 
fourth quarter last year.
 

Communications segment on Slide 8. The power of our core business 
continues to be crucial in these times, and we see the resiliency in our 
results. In Mobility, service revenue grew by 2.5% in the quarter. EBITDA of 
$7.8 billion grew by more than $500 million or 7%, and EBITDA margins 
expanded by 280 basis points. COVID did impact our top line revenue 
numbers in the quarter by about $200 mill
ion due to lower equipment and 
roaming revenues. Our subscriber counts for wireless, video and broadband 
this quarter exclude customers who we agreed not to terminate service for 
non
-
payment. For reporting purposes, we are treating those subscribers has 
di
sconnects. Even with that, our industry
-
leading network and FirstNet drove 
postpaid phone net adds of 163,000. Postpaid phone churn was down 6 
basis points to 0.86% and our 5G deployment continues. We now cover 
more than 120 million people in 190 markets, 

nationwide this summer.
 
In our entertainment group, cash generation remains a focus. We added 
209,000 AT&T Fiber subscribers and now serve more than 4 million. We 
continue to drive ARPU growth in both video and IP 
broadband. In fact, 
premium video ARPU was up about 10% as we continue to focus on long
-
term value customers. We launched AT&T TV nationally late in the quarter 
and subscriber growth was in line with our expectations even with COVID 
impacts. Premium video 
net losses again improved sequentially. Business 
wireline performance was solid, with EBITDA and EBITDA margins remaining 
stable. Revenues were consistent with recent trends as declines in legacy 
products were partially offset by growth in strategic and ma
naged services. 
Business wireline continued to be an effective channel for our mobility sales. 
Including wireless, total business revenues grew 1.7%.
 

Slide 9. Coming into the quarter, w
e knew we had tough year
-
over
-
year 
theatrical comparisons and some continuing investment in HBO Max, and the 
sudden impact of COVID weighed on advertising, specifically around the 
cancellation of March Madness, and television and theatrical production 
dela
ys. Altogether, COVID had about a $400 million revenue impact and a 
$250 million EBITDA impact on the quarter. And HBO Max is launching next 
month.
 
Turning to our Latin American operations, Vrio continues to work against 
economic and foreign exchange headw
inds, while Mexico continues to show 
solid EBITDA improvement. First quarter Mexico EBITDA improved $63 
million year
-
over
-
year and we expect improvement to continue. And even in 
this economic environment, Vrio continues to generate positive EBITDA.
 
Now, le

capital and liquidity. Even in this economic environment, the company has a 
strong cash position, a strong balance sheet and substantial liquidity. We 
plan for scenarios such as this. Wh
ile none of us can predict exactly what is 
going to happen in the remainder of the year, we do know the work we have 
done over the last few years has put us in a strong position to deal with a 
wide range of macroeconomic outcomes. We have reduced debt and 
restructuring of our debt towers, de
-
risked our pension plan assets and sold 
non
-
strategic assets. We expect free cash flow after dividends and cash on 
hand to more than cover our debt maturities this year and through 2023 
even in this current economic env
ironment. And we expect to be able to do 
that even if we choose not to access debt markets, while still investing in our 
key capital projects. We continue to take a prudent approach and we have a 
lot of levers we can pull to optimize our capital structure.
 
In April, we took on a $5.5 billion term loan agreement at competitive rates 
to provide additional flexibility and our revolver is in place like it always has 
been. We have a long history of not drawing on this facility and we have no 
plans to do it now, 
but this is a $15 billion facility, which provides us 
significant financial flexibility. Adding to our financial strength are proceeds 
from asset sales. We expect to close about $2 billion in sales from CME, real 
estate and tower monetizations this year an
d you should expect us to 
continue exploring other opportunities. We expect the sale of our Puerto Rico 
wireless operations to close in the second half of 2020. Our strong balance 
sheet allows us to remain focused on our capital allocation priorities and w
e 
remain committed to investing in growth opportunities for the business now 
and in the future, returning value to shareholders through dividends and 
paying down debt.
 

 
Michael Viola
 
Operator, we 
are ready to take the first question.
 
Question
-
and
-
Answer Session
 
Operator
 
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the 
line of John Hodulik from UBS. Please go ahead.
 
John Hodulik
 
Okay, great. Thanks, guys. Randall, obviously 
given the size and breadth of 

broader economy. Can you give us a sense on some of the trends that you 
are seeing in April here? And then if you can dig a little bit deeper into AT&T,
 
anything you can tell us about trends that you are seeing maybe in terms of 
wireless or maybe small business or advertising or those areas that might be 

 
Randall Stephenson
 
Sure. Hi, John. Probably, I 
am not going to be able to give you any more 

would tell you the most disconcerting, troublesome area that we are seeing 

nder
-
index 
the small business, but the small business trends are pretty significant in 

that was going to drive, I think probably here in the next couple of months 
the unemployment iss
ues more than anything and those are rather 
dramatic. On the 

 
as you move up the stack on business, you are starting 
to see people obviously just like everybody else get really cautious in terms 
of how they are deploying capital spending. From our standpo
int, we are 
seeing and you heard John Stephens mentioned this in his comments, from 
our standpoint, we are actually seeing businesses begin to step up 
bandwidth needs as you get into the medium and margin business, 
particularly around people working at hom
e, consumers doing commerce 

requirements and then we are seeing a lot of that. The consumer, obviously 
activity wise is really, really stagnant. There is no retail, and so the 
consumer is not o
ut walking the streets and spending in retail, but you are 
seeing obviously the e
-
commerce trends pretty strong.
 


e going in 


are seeing is the volumes of network usage moving out of urban, out into 
suburban areas
 
and the volumes have moved into the homes, and we are 
seeing heavy, heavy volume on the networks out in homes. This caused us 
to have to do some enhancement in a quick basis. Stankey and his team 
have been doing a lot of work to kind of make sure that the
 
networks are 

the work volumes, the commerce volumes, the school, video streaming 


sive to see. While economic activity has slowed 


something obviously none of us have experienced before. 
But I would tell 
you, we as a company and I would even say we as an industry are taking a 
lot of satisfaction in terms of how these networks are standing up to the shift 
in volumes and the increase in volumes, and it should not be missed that 
this is no ac
cident. The public policy positioning in the United States has 
been different than it has in most of the rest of the world. And as a result, 
the incentive to invest into building capacity and to have cushions of 
capacity for times like this are playing out
, and I hope as we come out of 
this, our public policy folks will take a hard look at this and recognize that 


hat you 
are seeing in general in the business?
 
John Stankey
 
I would just offer two additional thoughts on that. I think as Randall 
indicated in the wireless space, clearly new switching and change activities 

 
distribution changes out in 
the environment. Engagement of the product is not suppressed. Engagement 
remains incredibly high. And as a result of that, some of the dynamics of 
customers choosing to go up the continuum of higher priced service plans to 
acco

consistent with one of the expectations that we had in our plans this year as 


bly two reasons behind that. One as you know, 
there is no sports content, one of the best yielding pieces of inventory that 
we have access to. And so with that, we are moving from the portfolio you 
are going to see pressure as a result of that. And then se
condly, economic 
activity is down. We have complete segments that have come out of the 

in automobile, hospitality, and lodging. So, as that occurs the scatter market 
is not as rob

at the end. Certainly ratings are still there. They are stronger than probably 

economic activity goes, I expect we will 
see that move back one way or the 
other, and then the theatrical business is obviously a stressed business right 


s
omething that we are going to have to watch the formation of consumer 
confidence, not just about going to movies just in general about being back 

 
John Stephens
 
John, if I could, let me just give you a qu
ick view, commercial paper 
markets, bond markets, asset financing markets and as we have shown 
bank term loan markets are all open. There was some rockiness there as we 
went through March, not for us, but for the overall markets. We always had 
access, but 
what we are seeing today is the federal stimulus and the federal 
reserves action really starting to work its way to the system and things 
getting back to what I would consider more normal state. But I will say 
those markets are open for us and working and 
we are getting to make 



m
ade I think are having a positive effect.
 
Randall Stephenson
 
Hats off to the Fed. I would have to give good marks for how they have 
managed through this to making sure the capital markets have been able to 
function.
 
Michael Viola
 
Thanks, John. We will take
 
our next question.
 
Operator
 
Your next question comes from the line of Phil Cusick from JPMorgan. Please 
go ahead.
 
Phil Cusick
 
Hey, guys. Thanks. Two if I can. First on video, you mentioned faster cord
-
cutting and commercial issues, what are you seeing so 
far in April and as 
well as AT&T TV nano trends? And then second, you mentioned some of the 
financial markets, what does the asset sale picture look like for you now and 
working capital was a drag in the first quarter versus a year ago, what has 
to happen 
to reverse this? Thank you.
 
Randall Stephenson
 
So Phil, on the first part actually where we stand right now is there has 
really been no acceleration or change in trends. If anything, it slowed down 
a little bit as people are engaging more with product and clearly at home 
having more time gaining more u
tility out of it. However, we are expecting 
that there is going to be a stressed economic environment in the second half 
of this year at some point and one would conclude that in a stressed 
economic environment, there probably are going to be adjustments t
hat 
people make within their lifestyle and their home. So I would expect that we 


itself right now in terms of 
decisions to remove. As I said earlier on the 
wireless side inbound activity, new add activity suppressed right now, you 

and the dynamics that are going on, there is just a lower gross
 




customers self inst
all. And so it matches up well to that environment. But 

there. Our expectations on AT&T TV have been very consistent with what we 
have seen even with the suppression of the pandemic
 
in the latter part of 
March where we were restricted on the certain number of dispatches and 
some of our capacity there. So, we feel pretty good about that launch and 
where we went. As you know, we have to ramp that throughout the year, so 
one month is no
t a year make, but we are right on the plan of what we 
expected in terms of volume and the customer feedback on the customers 
we have put on the product has been probably stronger than what we 

some of the 
gaps that we know the satellite product was a little bit soft on and we feel 
really good about that.
 
John Stephens
 
So with regard to the asset sales, to your two buckets, one, the sale of CME 

about a $1.1 billion in 
proceeds, debt relief about $600 million. We expect that to close in the 
second half of the year just going through the normal EU regulatory review. 
We also have in that bucket some other towers, some remaining towers that 
we are se
lling under contract and some remaining real estate we would 
expect those to get closed in the second half of the year. So we are thinking 


he Puerto Rico wireless operations that 
process is continuing to go through as a normal federal review process 
regulatory we expect that to close in the second half of the year. And in 
both, in all cases, the buyers have the financial resources to close th
e deal. 
We have earmarked those funds already. So we want to make sure the 
flexibility for those. We already decided what we are going to do with those 
funds with regards to reducing some preferred partnership interest. Lastly, I 
will tell you that we are 
looking at other real estate, other 

 
evaluating other 
transactions, there is some slowdown, but as I mentioned before, there still 
is availability of funds out there. So we are continuing to work through it and 

but we are continuing to work 
through it. With regard to the working capital, we had the impact of COVID 
on the first quarters working capital only about a $1 billion of what I call 
timing items that will bounce out in the rest of the year so the one point
 
I 
think I'd make to you is, if you look back the last 5 years of first quarter free 
cash flow this is the second highest we have ever had last year was a stellar 
performance because we had some securitization of receivables and so forth 
we continue to be 

balance this year as much as we had in the past so as such is a comparison 
that is differentiated but I to point out that the expectations or the results 
we had were expected other than COVID and that we
 
expect that to balance 
out so the cash flow numbers still feel pretty good when you take into 
account this challenging environment.
 
Michael Viola
 
Thanks, Phil. We will take our next question.
 
Operator
 
Your next question comes from the line of Simon Flanne
ry from Morgan 
Stanley. Please go ahead.
 
Simon Flannery
 
Thank you very much. Good morning. I wonder if you could talk about 
capital spending. We just saw Rogers in Canada say year
-
on
-
year CapEx will 
be well below prior guidance I understand you are not giv
ing guidance but 

kind of. restrictions from COVID
-
19 or maybe fewer housing starts, etcetera 
so is it likely that may be the run rate in the rest of the year will be a little 
bit be
low prior trends or prior expectations and then on the online channels 
where are you on your kind of proportion of wireless gross adds upgrades 
that can come through the online channel where do you see that going and 
maybe the same for broadband? Thanks.
 
R
andall Stephenson
 
So let me first take the capital issue we go through is we regularly do a real 
scrub of the process. John 

 

operations folks. We are constantly going through that. The message we 
really we want to give
 
to you right now is that we can continue to invest and 
continue to paying out our debt and continue to pay our dividend all in a 
very flexible environment, in this. So while we are going or we are going to 
scrub capital very, very significantly like we al
ways do or we or not we are 
not announcing any kind of levels today with that being said the critical 
things that we had going is the completion of the FirstNet build. And we are 
staying committed to that we have talked about 5G being nationwide this 
summe
r so there are such things that we are committed to the stay 
committed to so it will be revolving story but we feel really good about the 
financial capabilities to continue to invest and quite frankly the unknown 
might be is when we come out this what will
 
be the new things we want to 
invest in that will benefit consumers, that will benefit our shareholders and 
will retain their flexibility alright John take care of the to respond to kind of 
the online channels and that question.
 
John Stankey
 
Yes. Simon, I 


of a question and to add to this point of time are to the pandemic consumers 
wanted to spend more time in retail stores as
 
a percentage of total gross or 

that there are period of time like when a major device comes out that 
number spikes to a pretty high percentage of mix often times customers just 
had
 
this desire that they wanted to come in and touch and feel the device 
and compare it to look at it pick up a couple other items all they were there 
that was the most convenient way for them to do it I would fully expect that 
is retail capacity may be dimi
nishes and spokes start to think differently 
about the behaviors more broadly that we are going to see people start to 
experiment to use all the great tools that we have out there and all the 
abilities to actually complete a transaction online and I would 
tell you I think 
that in a mixed environment where our customer does a combination of 
acquiring the device online and then fulfilling they were in a great position 
because I think you are probably aware of where we have been doing a fair 
amount in market w
ith concierge services where we have been partnering 
with third
-
parties to actually deliver the handset into the home free setup to 
work with the individual we have doctored those processes to actually make 
them cleaner and less contact associated with the
m to make customers 
more comfortable about that kind of an approach we have been moving 
some of our employees into the mode of being able to do that we have been 
shifting stores the curb side pickup where our customer can order online and 
then drive throug
h store location and pick it up at the curb in a sanitized bag 
to get it. So, I think we are prepared to adjust to whatever the customer 
chooses to do after they decide that they no longer want to suppress buying 
a handset and they need to go out and do so
mething if traditional retail 
channels are unavailable.
 
Randall Stephenson
 
But before you go off that and Stankey you may want to follow
-
up on this, 
but Simon, back to the issue on the capital spending, the issue that John 
Stankey and his team are running 
into right now is obviously in our industry 


-
side 
acquisition which we are doing a lot for FirstNet and enhancin
g density. 
These require permitting and government officials and government officials 
are sheltered in place and a lot of the permitting and a lot of the logistics to 
go into allowing us to invest are a little bit hampered right now. And so while 
we have n
o intention of slowing down on 5G and fiber deployment and such, 
reality is that a lot of it is not in our control. We are having to work through 
some of those issues. So, there is probably going to be relatively to what the 
targets we gave you on the CapE
x of downward proclivity on that number, 
just because of logistical issues that we are running into.
 
Michael Viola
 
Simon thanks for the questions. We take the question, Greg.
 
Operator
 
Your next question comes from the line of Michael Rollins from Citi. Ple
ase 
go ahead.
 
Michael Rollins
 
Hi, thanks and good morning. Can you unpack how you consider the credit 
risk across the different operating segments and can you share with us some 
of the historical experiences you may have looked to try to estimate the 
poten
tial impacts?
 
Randall Stephenson
 
Sure. Good morning to you, Mike and let me answer the question. First and 
foremost, the issues with regard to the accounting side in the simplest 
sense, is out of the existing new rules that we can look forward in the bad 
d

with regard to recording the $250 million. What we have looked at is for 
example, in the WarnerMedia business, we look at the theater owners that 
are out there, but still they hav
e some payables to us or we have receivables 
from them and we went in and said in this environment what is our estimate 
of collections, right. On the wireless business, on a month to month business 
so to speak with whether it be prepaid or whether it be se
rvices there is 
much more knowledge and much more information on that when you look to 
theirs on the equipment sales and on the next receivables financing. And we 
take into account what we think is a percentage of those based on their 
payment history, but 
based on this new environmental situation, what we 
think that might be done. So, we broke it down into, so to speak, that 
category. Conditioning on a going forward basis, we have been accruing up 
and outside of that 250 accruing up all those, I think there
 
is about, for 
example, 40,000 postpaid voice customers that we are still providing the 
service to, but that we did 

 
we counted as disconnects in our numbers. 
They are not in the 163. We are continuing to reserve those. But we 
effectively went through tha
t kind of process that I just laid out a mobility 
that I laid out in more immediate and we continue that throughout the 
process. And so we are going to continue to update that, be careful with 
that, but we believe we are, if you will, current and got every
thing from 

them into the future.
 
Michael Viola
 
Thanks. Thanks for the question, Mike.
 
Michael Rollins
 
Thanks.
 
Operator
 
Your next question comes from the line of David Barden from 
Bank of 
America. Please go ahead.
 
David Barden
 
Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the questions and I hope you guys are all doing 

kind of a low 60% payout ratio, it implies that the new free
 
cash flow 
guidance for 2020 is between $23 billion and $25 billion. John, I was 
wondering if you could 

 
John Stephens, I was wondering if you could 
maybe bridge us between the $28 million that you thought the free cash 
flow would be and where that $23 bi
llion to $25 billion lands us? And then 
the second kind of related question would be I think that there is specific 
question about some of the more exotic kind of financial market liquidity 
situations, for instance, last year you did a significant media re
ceivable 
financing? Is the market open to refinance that, to roll that? What is the 
market for equipment receivables look like, is it liquid, is it affordable? If you 
could kind of walk us through some of those situations will be very helpful? 
Thank you.
 
R
andall Stephenson
 

particularly the financial instruments, but also just the free cash flow 

weeks trying to get our 
arms around where this economic situation can go 
and we bring in the smartest and most genius economists in the world and 
you can bring a dozen of them in and the range of possible outcomes just for 
the second quarter of 2020 is unbelievably wide. And then
 
you begin to push 
that out for what the full year 2020 looks like, and it remains as wide. And 
so, trying to discern where you think the economic scenario lands for this 
year is proving to be pretty difficult right now. And so, as we begin to 
formulate ou
r actions and look, we 

 
this team here has been through a 


-
19, and one 
thing we really like to do is just 

 

ngs up when you have 
this kind of uncertainty, suspend the share buyback program just to ensure 
that we have good solid foundation in cash position as we migrate through 
this. Where can this thing go and what are the implications to our free cash 
flow numb

number that we feel very comfortable that we can hit this year, that payout 


es a target that we feel 
comfortable in terms of meeting. And so, there are, as, in these businesses 

 
you follow these businesses a long time, David, there are a lot of levers to 
pull that are underpinning the free cash flow number and what happens with 
c
apital spending and what can you do on working capital, and John is going 
to talk to you about working capitals and some of our ability to finance some 


 
cash flow payout, the dividend as a percent of free 

achieve. Okay? So John, do you want to add anything to that and then talk 
about...
 
John Stephens
 
Yes. So, first of all, David, the ma
rket is open to us in all forms. The terms 


very open. If you look at what our bonds are trading at today, 

bit higher, 15 basis points, 20 basis points higher than they were in mid
-

-
March and the end of March. So, my point is, the financial markets are open 
to us, includi
ng asset
-
based financing next receivables, accounts receivable 
securitizations. With that being said, as we mentioned in our call, equipment 

sales are going to be down, so the dema
nd on the financial markets to pick 

demand being down, there may be more flexibility in getting it, maybe 

 


sion. 
But we certainly 

 
and we took advantage and we participated in those 
markets throughout the first quarter and in March, as we often 

 
as we 
usually do. So there has been 

 


markets even become what I would 

 
move 
back toward more operational, more normal operational activity as we get 
through April, and we 

 

congressional efforts. Secondly, what I go to is, when I think ab
out free cash 



lot of our customer

going out in just record amounts and what will that do to the collections we 
have with regard to these really great resilient products like wireless and 
connectivity. You got to take into account whether
 
the deferral of payroll 
taxes for a company like ours with 250,000 domestic employees, the ability 
to defer those payroll taxes into 2021 and 2022, not only on a Fed basis, but 
many states is really pretty important. Whether the other aspects out there 
ar
e going to provide us some assistance or provide us some pressure, we 
are going through that. With regard to the businesses themselves, 
WarnerMedia as John Stankey said earlier, we talked about the theatrical 
and the advertising piece of those business, we
 
have to go through that. 
Quite frankly, you can understand when you take production goes on hiatus, 
we are paying our people and making sure they are personally taken care of, 
but a lot of the other costs that are cash outlays go away during that time. 
An
d so there is a balance there. Business, we did see some businesses 
trying to extend their terms, weeks, days and weeks and we are working 

through that, but this ability on mobility,
 
which is quite frankly the big 
engine to deal with the service revenues and collect those gives me great 
confidence that we have something to build off of and something to rely on. 
And when you add broadband, when you add business services, quite 
frankly,
 
we are seeing some really reliability in some of our entertainment 
products feel good about our ability to manage through this. We are leaving 
ourselves lot of flexibility as Randall said, because there is a wide rage of 

pen and we are just working through all 
the different alternatives. The variance is off that base case.
 
Michael Viola
 
Okay. Thanks, David. We will take the next question.
 
Operator
 
Your next question comes from the line of Mike McCormack from 
Guggenheim. Pl
ease go ahead.
 
Mike McCormack
 
Hey, guys. Thanks. I guess John Stephens, the partial quarter impacts you 
are seeing from COVID, is it fair to try to quarterize those things and get a 
forward look at the 2Q or is there some front
-
end load in there that we 
sh
ould be thinking about? And then I guess on the competitive side for 
wireless, what do you guys think is going to happen over the next, call it 3, 
4, 5 months given the fact that you have the new T
-
Mobile out there, but 
obviously this virus overhead, but s
hould we expect a continued sort of 
dampening of the competitive landscape as we go through this? Thanks.
 
John Stephens
 
So on the COVID items and I think there is some information we have made 

so to speak 
reserve what do you 

 
what I would expect to see is that is a one
-
time item 
for this quarter that is so to speak putting us all on part at the end of the 
quarter and will include changes in our reserve rates just on a run
-
rate basis 
going forwa



got to figure out what happens with the stimulu
s funds that are going out 
and how that affects our collectibility and so forth. But I would expect to do 
with that. On our, what we call, our compassion pay, that will go on in some 
of the, if you will, bonus pay for some of our technicians. That will go 
on into 

going to have to make decisions on how long it goes. I think they are going 
to evaluate that with regard to the current economic conditions and the state 
by state kind of impac
ts and shelter in place and so forth, but that could 
continue. The production disruption costs quite frankly could continue. We 


I think about those 
things. As I mentioned, we had about 40,000 postpaid voice customers that 
we have counted as disconnects that we are actually still providing service, 
that number will grow as we go through time, but it will get to a peak as we 
go throu

will call, similar numbers in video and broadband, but they are 

 
at this time 
within our base of customers, I think we are in a manageable state. Let me 
hand it off to John to talk about t
o answer your other question, Mike?
 
Mike McCormack
 
I am sorry, on the equipment revenue side, down 25%, is that a decent 
proxy as you think about 2Q?
 
John Stephens
 
Yes. Let me answer. We just want to give you and John could comment is 
we just want to 
give you a factoid on something that actually happened, but 


 
if the shelter in place orders stay in place and retail stays 
closed, certainly you could have a significant reduction. As you know, that 
reduction in revenues also comes with signi
ficant reduction in expense and 
so customers can really streamline their billing relationship with us without 
necessarily impacting our profitability. So, we will see how that goes. I am 

dictable, 
but yes, we intended to give you that information about the 25% reduction 

 
John Stankey
 
Yes, I would echo, Mike, but I think to your point on what happens over the 


the next quarter suppressed because of inability for people to be out and 
about doing things and being restricted and still given the nature of this 
purchase maybe wanting to have a little bit more of phys
ical experience at 
times. I would then suspect that as we get the latter part of the year, you 
look at discretionary decisions like do I get the handset and a stressed 
economic environment, I think that discretionary decision on the purchase of 
the next ha
ndset maybe has a little bit of suppression on it as a result of 
that, not use of the service. Service is indispensable, but the choice to 

household that is trying to make some d
ecisions on discretionary income is 
likely to have a downward bias on it. In terms of the plays we run, our plays 
remain the same. The strength that Randall talked about in how the 
networks performing in this moment in time is testament to what we have 
put
 
in place with the massive increase of capacity and performance that we 
have been working on through the combination of the FirstNet deployment in 
deploying our spectrum inventory all at the same time and you are seeing 
just the strength of the network and
 

net promoter score results from our customers and their impressions of the 

that solid momentum you are seeing in customer acquisition and I expec
t 
that as people continue to use the network more aggressively for their 
indispensable work day in and day out that we are going to see that 
impression continue to improve and move in the right direction.
 
We are going to add to that a boost of adrenaline w
ith the HBO Max 
promotion that you saw just started yesterday. We are going to start get 
pretty loud in the market with that. So, the combination of growing the HBO 

products and s
ervices, I think is going to drive up awareness and there are 
some great opportunities that pair tablets and devices together and see 
great entertainment with it and get good values on that. That will be helpful. 
Our 5G deployment as we said we are going t
o be out in the summer where 
we have nationwide coverage and that will further improve and also allow for 
a marketing position that I think would be helpful. And then we are going 

 
last couple of weeks in the first responder community and some of the 


from that as well and continued
 
great performance. We are now over 1.3 
million devices connected to that network and we are seeing that pace 
accelerate over the last several weeks. And so not that I am enamored with 
the pandemic, but it has helped that product category and the awareness
 
of 
that product category. So, we are going to run our plays and we are going to 
be in a good position, because the plays we have set up are built on the 
strength that we have been working on over the last couple of years to put 
in place.
 
Michael Viola
 
Mik
e thanks for your questions. Greg, we will take one last question.
 
Operator
 
Okay. That question comes from the line of Brett Feldman from Goldman 
Sachs. Please go ahead.
 
Brett Feldman
 
Yes, thanks and I will like to follow
-
up just on that question 
about wireless 
sales, with equipment sales being down, is that a good way of thinking about 
how much activity is down meaning you noted gross adds are down, are 
they down about the same amount or a disconnects down about the same 
amount? And the reason I a
sk is that you know there is a variable cost 
associated with all these customer transactions and so the real question is, 
is there indeed a cost buffer you are getting as a result of that lower activity 
level and are you finding that it is sufficient to of
fset or nearly offset some of 
the commitments you have made to your customers by giving them more 
flexible payment terms and some of the commitments you have made to 
your employees through the compassion pay? And ultimately are you 
comfortable that the dur
ability of your EBITDA stream and wireless is going 
to playing out the multiple scenarios here?
 
John Stephens
 
Hey, Brett. This is John. Let me take the first numbers question and hand off 
to John Stankey for the business question real quick. Think about it
 
this way, 
our service revenues are up about $350 million. Our EBITDA was up $500 
million. So, we are getting cost savings throughout the operations. I mean, 

the COVID impact. So wh




 


 

 
say to you that I think 
it answers that question directly that if your service revenues went up $300 



business. John?
 
John Stankey
 
Yes, I would 

 
just to build on what John said, our service revenues are not 
increasing just in one single category they are improving across the board i
n 

improvements in our connected devices categories. So service revenues are 
strong across the board. And I would just say structurally, Brett, if we step 
back and think about this fr
om a macro perspective, in an environment 



 
when customers 

e seen in past 

their cell phone bill. And so 

 

go on there and the suppressed activity is suppressed activity, but we got a 
great base a
nd an important product and with the network performance 
getting better and better, that churn number has been hanging in there and 
getting a little bit better, I think we feel good about it all the way around.
 
Brett Feldman
 
Okay, very good.
 
Michael Viola
 
Thanks, Brett.
 
John Stephens
 
Thanks, Brett. And everybody stay safe.
 
Randall Stephenson
 
And let me just close by the question centered around what are you 

there is very little visibili
ty in terms of what the general economic 
environment is going to be? When is America going to go back to work? 

slower than most of us like. What kind of effect does this government 
s
timulus is going to have on economic activity? How the unemployment 


bit defensive in terms of how we 
positioned AT&T. We have a good cash 
position. As you heard John Stephens say, we have ready access to the 
capital markets. And as you heard John Stankey talk about, the resiliency of 

e were 



should see our debt leve
ls come down as we move through the course of 

this year. So, thank you again for joining us and we look forward to talking 
to you next time. Thank you.

Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the 2016 
AT&T First Quarter Earnings Call. At this time, all lines are in a listen
-
only 
mode. Later, there will be an opportunity for your questions and instructions 
will be 
given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this 
conference is being recorded.

may differ materially. Additional information is available on the Investor 
Relations page of AT&T's website. I also want to rem
ind you that we are in a 
quiet period for the SEC spectrum auction, so we cannot address any 
questions about spectrum today.

slide 4. Slide 4 provides a consolidated financial 
summary. We had a very 
good first quarter at AT&T. First quarter consolidated revenues grew to 
$40.5 billion, largely due to the acquisition of DIRECTV, but we also saw 
growth in video and IP
-
based services on a comparable basis. This offset 
pressure from 
lower equipment sales as well as foreign exchange.
 
We continued our streak of double
-
digit adjusted EPS growth, and after 
adjustments 

 
and, by the way, the adjustments included removing over 
$700 million of benefit from spectrum swaps with other industry 
participants. And so with those adjustments, first quarter EPS was $0.72, up 
10.8%. This strong growth comes even with about $0.03 of earnings 
pressure from our Mexico wireless operations.
 
Margins also continue to be a great story. We saw consolidated marg
in 
growth, with margin expansion in every domestic business segment. 
Operating cash flows were up more than $1 billion year
-
over
-
year, with free 
cash flow of $3.2 billion, a 17% increase from a year ago. Capital 
investment is on plan, coming in at $4.7 bil
lion.
 
And so with that, I will now turn the call over to AT&T's Chief Financial 
Officer, John Stephens.
 
John Stephens
 
Thanks, Mike, and hello, everyone, and thanks for being on the call. As Mike 
said, we turned in another solid financial performance. Reven
ues grew, 
margins expanded, and we had our fourth straight quarter of double
-
digit 
adjusted EPS growth. Growth in strategic business services, IP broadband, 
and video were big factors. And ad sales in our entertainment group is now 
more than $1 billion in 
annualized revenues and growing.
 
What makes our revenue results even more impressive is we did this with 
lower equipment sales and with more than $500 million of pressure in 
foreign exchange and with the ongoing pressure of exiting some of our 
marginal bus
inesses.
 
We are on track to reach a run rate of $1.5 billion in cost synergies from the 
DIRECTV deal. We are also taking cost out of the business and driving 
greater savings through efficiency initiatives such as Project Agile, and 
transforming our network
 
with software. This gives us the financial flexibility 
to invest in growth initiatives such as our Mexico operations.
 
At the same time, we are also executing on our commitments to transition 

ars, 
transforming our smartphone base, transitioning from subsidies to 
equipment plans, moving our broadband
-
based IP and our legacy database 
to strategic services. We have done a lot of work, but we have a lot of more 
to do.
 
Our video customers are shifti
ng to satellite. We are moving our 2G 
customers onto our new LTE networks and we are continuing to use bundling 
offers to take advantage of our integrated networks. All of this makes us feel 
really good about our direction and the strong start to the year.
 

a solid record of setting goals and achieving them. We are very confident 
that we will continue to do that and transform our business.
 
Let's now take a look at our business operations, starting with growth in our 
business solutions segment. Th
ose details are on slide 6. Solid wireless 
revenue gains drove overall growth in business, and more than offset lower 
equipment sales and foreign exchange pressure. Total business solution 
revenues were up slightly, with business wireless revenues up 2.3%,
 
reflecting smartphone and tablet gains, as well as more customers on lower
-
churn business plans.
 
Margins also continued their growth trend. EBITDA was up more than $300 
million as cost reductions added to our revenue gains. Margins grew to 
38.7%, up 180 b
asis points year
-
over
-
year, thanks to a focused 
performance by the entire team.
 
Looking at our customer segments in business, all retail customer segments 
showed growth and our wholesale business is on plan, even though revenues 
were pressured. Legacy data
 
continues to migrate to our IP strategic 
business services.
 
Total wireline data grew slightly in the quarter, and is now about 60% of 
wireline business revenues. Driving that growth is strategic services. 
Revenue grew by nearly $250 million over last year
's first quarter. That is up 
9.3%. And if you adjust it for foreign exchange, growth would have 
exceeded 10%.
 
Strategic business services are now more than $11 billion in annualized 
revenues. We also are seeing continue demand for highly secure mobile 
busi
ness solutions. Security continues to be the top of the mind for our 
business customers. Every enterprise must rethink its place in today's 
connected world. We are managing highly secure networks, given our unique 
experience. And our ability to provide bus
iness solution sets us apart, and 
we intend to be very active in this space.
 
Now, let's move to our entertainment group results on slide 7. As a 
reminder, our entertainment group provides video, broadband, and phone 
services to residential customers. On a 
reported basis, entertainment group 
revenues showed strong growth due to our acquisition of DIRECTV. 
However, if you look at results adjusted to include prior
-
year DIRECTV on a 
comparative basis, revenue still grew by more than 3% as IP, video, and 
adverti
sing revenue growth outpaced legacy service declines.
 
Our high
-
speed Internet service grew by more than $250 million and now 
generates more than $7 billion in annualized revenue. And we are seeing 
solid growth with our add sales, which are now more than $1
 
billion 
annualized revenues and going strong. At the same time, we again saw 
exceptional margin expansion, which points directly to the profitability 
benefits of the merger. Our EBITDA margins nearly doubled year
-
over
-
year.
 
Taking a look at our metrics, s
atellite net adds continue to be strong as we 
added more than 300,000 in the quarter. Total entertainment group 
broadband net adds were positive in the quarter, driven by 186,000 IP 

base to IP, and that transition is nearly complete. About 95% of the eligible 
broadband subs now have IP broadband. Half of these customers choose 
higher speeds, which helped drive the 16% revenue growth in IP broadband.
 
We also made several strategic move
s in the quarter as a premier integrated 
communications company. We announced our new DIRECTV streaming 
services in the first quarter. We are actively working the content deals for 
these new services, and we are on target for launch in the second half of t
he 
year.
 
And Fullscreen's ad
-
free subscription service launched today. Fullscreen is 
majority owned by Otter Media, a partnership between AT&T and the 
Chernin Group. AT&T has signed on as the premier launch sponsor for the 
new service, and will collaborate
 
with Fullscreen to market and promote the 
service with special offers for AT&T's more than 100 million video, mobile 
and broadband customers.
 
We are also seeing our broadband [audio dip] DTV go up. The attach rate of 
DTV sales with broadband in our wireli
ne footprint has increased 50% since 
last summer. And in GigaPower areas, the attach rate improvement is even 
greater. Our new unlimited wireless with video offer started fast and 
continues at a solid pace. More than 3 million wireless subscribers signed u
p 
for this plan at the end of the first quarter with thousands more being added 
every day. These are some of our highest ARPU subscribers who are even 
more valuable to us now that they have combined these services.
 
Our entertainment group team is performin
g well on every level: merger 
integration, cross
-
selling, special bundle offers, advertising, and now 
streaming services. But the second half of the year is when our integration 
efforts really take hold. Single truck rolls, cross
-
selling, and new product 
r
ollouts are just beginning to take off. We are on track with all our targets, 
and we are very excited about what is to come.
 
Now, let's move to our U.S. mobility results on slide 8. Another reminder, 
AT&T's domestic mobility operations are now 
divided between the business 
solution and consumer wireless segments. For comparison purposes, the 
company is also providing supplemental information for its total U.S. 
wireless operations.
 
We continue to see margin expansion and stabilizing service revenu
es in the 
quarter. Service revenues were stable year
-
over
-
year, thanks in part to 
having completed most of the transition to the Mobile Share Value plans, as 
well as adding new customers; while overall wireless revenues were down 
slightly due to lower equi
pment sales. We have changed the game with our 
equipment installment plans. We started the transition more than two years 
ago with Next, and are substantially through that transition. Our strategy is 
working and you can see it in our results.
 
Our laser foc
us on cost efficiencies and fewer upgrades drove our best ever 
first quarter wireless EBITDA margins. Wireless EBITDA increased more than 
$600 million when compared to the year
-
ago first quarter. And wireless 
service EBITDA margin came in at 49.5%, its bes
t quarter ever.
 
Phone
-
only ARPU plus Next billing continued its strong growth. This ARPU 
was up more than 5% year
-
over
-
year, and also up sequentially. Nearly half 
of our smartphone base is now on AT&T Next. More than 70% of postpaid 
smartphone subscribers 
are on a no
-
device subsidy plan. During the quarter, 
we discontinued the availability of subsidized phones for most subscribers. 
This will drive continued growth in the no
-
subsidy model. In fact, 90% of 
postpaid smartphone sales and upgrades were all on AT
&T Next or BYOD. 
Our branded percentage is even higher.
 
Now, let's look at wireless net adds. During the first quarter, AT&T posted a 
net increase of 2.3 million total net adds, our best first quarter ever. That 
includes 1.8 million domestic wireless subs.
 
Net adds were driven by 
connected devices, branded phones, and tablets.
 
Branded domestic net adds, both postpaid and prepaid, were up more than 
600,000, thanks to strength in prepaid. That included 137,000 branded 
phone net adds. And when you include Mexi
co, we had nearly 1.2 million 
branded net adds in our wireless operations, and more than 700,000 
branded phone net adds.
 
Cricket continues to be a great option for our value
-
focused customers. We 
had 500,000 prepaid net adds in the quarter, and nearly 1 mi
llion prepaid 
net adds when you include Mexico. Our ARPU for the new prepaid Cricket 
subs continues to run about $41. That compares to feature phones ARPU of 
about $35. Feature phones make up the bulk of our postpaid phone losses. 
And the Cricket momentum 
continues to grow.
 
We expanded our cricket to distribution to Best Buy and Aaron's locations. 
Crickets will be available in more than 12,000 outlets across the country. We 
also just introduced a new Cricket unlimited plan, including talk, text, and 
data fo
r $65 a month with auto pay, and no hidden fees. We had 1.6 million 
connected device net adds, matching our best
-
ever net add quarter. We now 
have nearly 28 million of these devices on our network, and we are laying 
the foundation for future growth.
 
In the
 
first quarter, we also continue to grow our high
-
value smartphone 
base. We added 1.1 million branded smartphones during the quarter. More 
than 95% of our postpaid phone sales in the quarter were smartphones, and 
nearly 90% of our postpaid phone base has s
martphones. Total churn was 
essentially stable year
-
over
-
year.
 
On a related note, we are moving forward with our previously announced 
shutdown of our legacy 2G network. We plan on decommissioning it by the 
end of the year. We have taken steps to migrate ou
r 2G customer base, and 
expect most to take this transition. We expect to continue to see 
manageable pressure in the last half of the year from subscribers, mostly 
connected devices, choosing not to make this migration. While this might 
have a slight impac
t on revenues, we also see the cost benefits from 
shutting down the network; and the spectrum will be redeployed to help 
meet the growing data demand of our customer base.
 
Now, let's look at our international operations. That information is on slide 
10. We
 
continue the hard work and heavy lifting to make our Mexico 
wireless operations world
-
class. That includes deploying of 4G LTE network, 
integrating operations and support services, and rebranding to the AT&T 
name. The team is doing a great job with all of
 
this. Even more impressive, 
they are adding customers at the same time. We added more than 500,000 
wireless subscribers in the first quarter, and nearly 1.1 million in just the last 
six months. That brings our total subscriber count to 9.2 million.
 
Rebran
ding is also gaining speed. We've launched nationwide advertising 
where branding in Mexico City is nearly complete. Our LTE deployment now 
reaches 51 million people. In just a year, we're more than halfway to 
reaching our commitment to deploy LTE to 100 mi
llion POPs by the end of 
2018. And we are also on target to reach 75 million POPs by the end of this 
year. First quarter revenue reflects seasonally lower equipment sales, as well 
as the impact of foreign exchange, as we successfully continue to execute 
ou
r strategy.
 
In Latin America, our video operations continue to show solid revenue 
growth on a local currency basis, but foreign exchange rates significantly 
impacted our published results. Revenues are being hampered by a 
challenging economy. Subscriber pr
essures in Brazil impacted net adds, but 
foreign exchange also impacted lower company expenses. We did see 
sequential profitability trends in the quarter, and continue to expect self
-
sustaining cash flow for the year.
 
Now let's move to consolidated margins
 
on slide 11. Consolidated margins 
reflect the overall strength of our business. EBITDA margins were slightly 
up, and adjusted consolidated operating income margin came in at 19.9% in 
the quarter. That was a 110 basis point improvement over the year
-
ago fi
rst 
quarter. Strong margin expansion in our domestic segments more than 
offset nearly 90 basis points of margin pressure from our growth initiatives 
in Mexico.
 
Our drive to have the industry
-
best cost structure also is continuing on 
track. Efficiency initi
atives and our software transformation are driving 
productivity gains and expense savings. On a comparable basis, our 
expenses were down more than $300 million year
-
over
-
year, driven by 
excess costs efficiencies, automation efforts in service delivery, IT 
rationalization, and software savings. We also continue to see lower call 
volumes and improvements in cycle times for our efforts to improve the 
sales experience.
 
During the quarter, we also eliminated subsidized phones for most of our 
postpaid customers. 
This should sustain further margin improvement, even 
though most of our smartphone base is already off the subsidy model. Our 
margin momentum continues to be strong. We are confident we can 
continue to expand domestic margins and cut costs to offset pressu
re while 
in the investment cycle in Mexico. And we expect Mexico to improve its 
profitability late in the year. Cash flows were another strong story.
 
Let's take a look at the results on Slide 12. Along with solid earnings, the 
margins 
-
 
we also continued t
o deliver strong cash flow growth. In the first 
quarter, cash from operations was nearly $8 billion, up 17% year
-
over
-
year; 
and free cash flow was $3.2 billion, also a 17% increase from the year
-
ago 
first quarter. The strong free cash flow growth comes eve
n with more than 
$1 billion of pressure from timing of fourth
-
quarter payables. With these 
first
-
quarter results, we are on track to meet guidance, and on plan to grow 
free cash flow for the year.
 
We continue to find ample demand and great rates in the sec
uritization 
market to help us manage our Next receivables. We have received about 
$1.5 billion in the first quarter, or about the same amount as last year's first 
quarter. Capital investments totaled $4.7 billion for the quarter. Wireless 
CapEx is down sli
ghtly from the fourth quarter when we accelerated 
purchases of equipment to capture significant savings.
 
On average, wireless CapEx was about $2.2 billion for the last two quarters. 
But not captured in those costs are investments in shared infrastructure. 
For 
example, running fiber to a cell site, but also using that fiber connection for 
our business wireline services. Shared infrastructure is about half of our 
non
-
wireless spending, and is one of the benefits from our integrated 
network carrier strategy. W
ith our industry
-
best cell density and balanced 

efficiently than anyone in the industry.
 
Our virtualization and software
-
defined networks are already delivering 
material CapEx savi
ngs. We will be adding 2.5 times more capacity at 75% 
of the capital costs compared to just a few years ago. In our other uses of 
cash, dividends totaled $2.9 billion. Our net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio 
declined to 2.27 times. And during the quarter, we
 
successfully exchanged 
$16 billion of DIRECTV debt, and issued $6 billion of debt at very reasonable 
rates.
 
We ended the quarter with $10 billion in cash and short
-
term investments, 
giving us the flexibility and financial strength to manage the overall ne
eds of 
our business. Before we get to your questions, let me close with a quick 
recap of the quarter on Slide 13. The first quarter demonstrated our ability 
to deliver strong, consistent results as we execute the strategy we have laid 
out for you. Our appr
oach has been methodical. Our results have been 
consistent.
 
We again grew revenues, expanded margins, and delivered double
-
digit 
adjusted EPS growth. Our DIRECTV integration continues to go smoothly. 

 
or more in cost 
synergies by the end of this year. We are also providing the first glimpse of 
what it means to be the premier integrated communications carrier in the 
world with our integrated offers and streaming plans.
 
Our business solutions segment con
tinues to outperform the market with 
strategic service revenue gains and margin expansion. Wireless again had 
record margins, growing phone
-
only plus Next ARPU, and had strong growth 
with its Cricket prepaid perform. In Mexico, wireless is fast becoming an
 
emerging growth story as we quickly build that business and expand our 
North American 4G LTE network.
 
We are convinced our strategy is working, and our momentum is strong. We 
are proud of what we have accomplished this quarter, and even more 
excited about
 
what lies ahead.
 
With that, let's get to your questions.
 
Question
-
and

Answer Session
 
Operator
 
[Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Mike 
McCormack with Jefferies. Go ahead please.
 
Mike Mccormack
 
Hi Guys, thanks. John, maybe 
just a comment on handset phone additions 
and postpaid, what strategies do you guys have in place to kind of 
turnaround or stem the losses there? I presume as the feature phone base 
continues to decline, that will become less of a headwind. And then just 
t
hinking about ARPU, I think the trajectory on phone on the ARPU without 
Next payments continues to get better. Is there a point at which you can see 
that starting to turn positive later this year?
 
John Stephens
 
Yes, thanks for the questions Mike. Couple th
ings; one, our strategies with 
regard to the overall business, but including our phone market is really on 
this integrated carrier strategy. So as we roll out these products that we can 
combine or video and our mobility and our broadband; and as we see the
se 
values net to the customers, we are optimistic we are going to be able to 
continue to improve our business. One other point I will make to you, 
though, too, is with these kinds of margins and these kinds of expansions in 
margins, it gives us the flexibi
lity and, quite frankly, it grows the universe of 
customers that are long
-
term value
-
creating customers for us with these 
new margin standards that the team has set. So, we are real optimistic 
about being competitive.
 
With that being said, we are still vie
wing the Cricket and the prepaid 
platform as a very viable, profitable long
-
term strategy. We believe it gives 
us an entree into a market that is significant, and, as you can see, 
generating great results. We are seeing continued improvement in service 
rev
enues. We saw it, as you can see, in the first quarter, and in ARPU. So 
we are very positive about that. We believe there is real opportunity to 
continue that. But we will continue to worry about performing first, and 
predicting it afterwards. But we are o
ptimistic; we like what we see. We like 
what happened when we combined the video and wireless offerings and the 
number of customers, for example, that not only added their phones, but 
added their tablets to the program. That was very encouraging, so we are
 
really optimistic. Thanks for your question Mike.
 
Mike Mccormack
 
Do you think that is having a negative impact on ARPU, if you think about 
the tablets coming on, as well is the bundled offers? Or is that not a 
significant impact?
 
John Stephens
 
The tablets
 
come on at $40 for the video offering, so they come in at a real 
strong rate. Depending upon whether they are a new and they are an 
addition, or whether they are a conversion of an existing tablet, you could 
have different impacts on ARPU. But we are cert
ainly very pleased with 
those coming on.
 
Mike Mccormack
 
Great. Thanks, John.
 
John Stephens
 
Thank you.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question is from John Hodulik with UBS. Please go 
ahead.
 
John Hodulik
 
John, could you just maybe frame the service revenue im
pact you talked 
about with the second
-
half shutdown of the 2G network? I think you said 
you have gotten back to flattish. Is that going to change the dynamic in the 
second half, first of all? And then second, upgrade rate was even lower than 
we thought, at
 
5%. Obviously that also helped the EBITDA margins. How 
should we look at that over the next few quarters, both, say, the second and 
third quarter? Obviously, fourth quarter is a little bit of a wild card. But do 
you expect the same kind of margins in thos
e quarters that we 
-
 
the 
strength that we have seen this quarter? Thanks.
 
John Stephens
 
John, with regard to 2G, we have been on this path to convert our 2G 
customers for a number of years. If you recall, we first announced, I think a 
year and a half ago 
-
 
or more than a year and a half ago 
-
 
our plans for 2G. 
So we have migrated much of that base already, a significant amount. In 
fact, in the last 12 months, we have migrated something like 6 million 
customers off that base. And that has been flowing throug
h the numbers 
that you have seen.
 
So, we are working through that on a regular basis already. So that impact 
is included in the service numbers that we 
-
 
service revenue numbers that 
we've reported and that we talk about going forward. So it is already in 
that; 
and because of that, we're going to be careful. But it is already in that 
optimism that we have. With regard to the upgrade rate, I could see it 
continuing to be very moderate until a new device, until a significant or 
iconic device comes out. Once t

But I could see this, a lower rate continuing throughout most of the year.
 
John Hodulik
 
Got you. Okay, thanks.
 
John Stephens
 
Thank you, John.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. We will go next to Phil Cusick with JPMorgan. Pl
ease go ahead.
 
Phil Cusick
 
Hi guys, thanks. Similar theme, the overall video decline, a little better than 
we had expected; U
-
verse a little bigger; DTV a little better, so, two things: 
one, do you still expect that you can get to positive for the full yea
r on the 
video numbers? And just confirm that that does not include the over
-
the
-
top 
product. And second, I have been under the impression that you are trying 
to stem some of the U
-
verse declines through some efforts. Is that still 
happening? Or are you go
ing to sort of watch this tail off at this pace? 
Thanks.
 
John Stephens
 
Thanks for your question Phil. First of all, folks, we want to keep all our 
quality customers and so we will do prudent, rational steps to keep all of our 
customers, and keep them as 
part of our AT&T family. We are interested in 
doing that in any event. With regard to the video perspective, let me give 
you this thought. In the second half of the year, we will have had the 
integration efforts really completed and fully ramped. So, singl
e truck roll, 
which for example, we didn't really start training nine of our states in the 
Southeast region until this year. They have now been all trained. But we will 
see that start to 
-
 
we are seeing it have improvements now.
 
But as that becomes a norma
l part of the business over the next few 
months, and we get repetition with regard to the success base on that, and 
we continue to have all our sales channels fully up to speed and selling those 
territories as we add those single truck roll capabilities, w
e see real optimism 
on the second half of the year. Secondly, just from a traditional basis, I think 
the NFL package has a real positive effect on net adds, and it occurs 
generally in the second half of the year. And we think the ability to add 
further int
egrated products and expand our wireless bundling further will 
give us that opportunity to, for the full year, grow video customers.
 
Phil Cusick
 
I'm sorry, just not to push, but you had guided to full
-
year video growth. Is 
that still the guidance?
 
John Ste
phens
 
Yes. That's what I said. We are still getting there to total video growth. And 
we think those 
-
 
the reasons I laid out; the fact the NFL contract comes 
really has impact on sales in the second half. The fact that quarter
-
over
-
quarter, every quarter s

fact that the full single truck roll integrated sales, integrated customer 
service, will be most effective in the second half of the year will give us that 
ability to add video for the year.
 
Phil Cusick
 
And it sounds like that does include the stand
-
alone over
-
the
-
top product, or 
it does not?
 
John Stephens
 
No, we don't have 
-
 
we have not made any predictions on the stand
-
alone 
over
-
the
-
top video product yet. And so we are expecting to reach positive 
with 
not including those numbers.
 
Phil Cusick
 
Perfect. Thanks, John.
 
John Stephens
 
Sure.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. We have a question from David Barden with Bank of America. Go 
ahead please.
 
David Barden
 
Hi guys, thanks for taking the questions. First question, John,
 
would be just 
in terms of getting to the $1.5 billion synergy savings run rate by the end of 
the year. Could you kind of size what was this quarter, and what is on the 
come for the rest of the year? And then second, just on the unlimited, I saw 
in the dis
closures that there's about 3 million unlimited customers. Obviously 
some of those are going to be related to the video bundle that you are 
doing. Could you talk a little bit more about the learnings, about what people 
are doing with mobile video, with an 
unlimited wireless capability? And what 
is the economic model that you see supporting giving away unlimited data 
for this purpose? Thank you.
 
John Stephens
 
So, the first thing with regard to the $1.5 billion, we are making real 
progress on our content cost
 
savings. We are getting those from new 
content 
-
 
contract negotiations; as well, quite frankly, as the fact that our 
base is shifted more to DTV, and we get that from the existing contracts. 
Two, we got a lot of it from our headquarters advertising the tr
aditional 
things you find with headquarter companies merging together 
-
 
those 
savings in professional fees and contractors in consulting fees settings 
-
 
we 
are getting that. And then we are seeing some savings, and we would expect 
to see more as we go thro
ugh not only on the expense side, but on the cash 
flow side from aligning vendor contracts, best price of both companies' 

 
We've been at this almost 9 months now, or a little over nine months,
 
and 

meet the $1.5 billion run rate, but that we have the opportunity to exceed it. 
So that piece of it, David. I think the first thing on the 3 million unlimited, 
those are the cu
stomers that are buying video from us. Many of those 
customer, most of those customers, were already buying a video product 
from us. So you can imagine when they buy the video, when they buy the 
wireless, and they often buy the broadband, these are some ve
ry high ARPU 
customers, and customers that are very valuable long
-
term to us.
 
And so, giving them this opportunity to use our services any time, any place, 
where they live and work is very positive for them and creates not only 
satisfaction for them, but a
lso high value for us. It also has added some 
video customers. We have been able to use this as an opportunity to add 
video customers for the wireless customers who want to get this 
opportunity. Secondly, we are still in the learning stage of it. But we ar
e still 
finding that 80% of our video traffic, or some number like that, is on Wi
-
Fi 
or it gets offloaded very quickly. So, while the impact is convenience for the 
customers, so far, it looks like it is going to be a manageable exercise for us. 
We are cont

the common place where people use this video still allows us to have Wi
-
Fi 
supplement for it, and that is providing us some measure of opportunity for 
success. But the real issue is when the 
customers are paying us for all those 
services, it makes real sense. We can really get comfortable with offering 
the unlimited. So far, it is working well.
 
David Barden
 
Alright, thanks John.
 
John Stephens
 
Thanks.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next 
question comes from Amir Rozwadowski with Barclays 
Capital. Go ahead please.
 
Amir Rozwadowski
 
Thank you very much and good afternoon folks.
 
John Stephens
 
How are you Amir?
 
Amir Rozwadowski
 
Well, John. I was wondering if we could talk a bit about the standa
lone OTT 
offerings. You had mentioned in your prepare commentary that you have 
had some progress with the content partners. How should we think about 
the positioning of those offerings going forward in terms of potential 
opportunities set to either expand 
the addressable market for DIRECTV or, 
conversely, there have been some concerns that it could come in and cause 
some level of potential cannibalization for certain types of users. And then 
I've got a follow
-
up question, if I may.
 
John Stephens
 
Yes, So the
 
AT&T now and the AT&T mobile are really specifically 
-
 
the DTV 
Now, excuse me, the DTV mobile 
-
 
the DTV Now is really expected to look 
and appear and have a channel choices very similar to what we have on the 
traditional subscription DTV product today. Th
e attractiveness for us is that, 
yes, there is a market of 20 million households that don't have it today. 
There is a collection of, if you will, core nevers, young people who have 
never had their own subscription that they might be able to get this. And 
q
uite frankly, the cost efficiency of being able to deliver it without having the 
cost of installation of a satellite dish or possibly a set
-
top box 
-
 
whatever the 
cost that may be eliminated out of this 
-
 
are really attractive and make it 
something that no
t only could grow the customer base, but also can be a 
very reasonable profitability for us.
 
So, we believe that we are very excited about that opportunity, and it gives 
us a way to compete in different places, even those places where we don't 
have the bro
adband product in place. So, we are excited about that. Right 
now, the people who buy our DIRECTV and U
-
verse video products are the 
high
-
end customers who generally want a subscription video product in their 
home, with three or four televisions connected,
 
and that variation. So it is a 
slightly different marketplace or different customer base with regard to 
DIRECTV Now.
 
Likewise, we are excited about the opportunity to do it on mobility, and 
provide the DTV mobility to those customers who use mobile device
s as their 
broadband alternative. With that being said, we are really excited about 
growing the market. And, at this time, we are excited about the ability to 
package a collection of content that is very similar to and very attractive to 
the customers that
 
we would be targeting with this.
 
Amir Rozwadowski
 
Thank you very much. And then just a quick follow
-
up, thinking about the 
cash flow generation capabilities of the company at this level, you had 
mentioned you feel like you are on track when it comes to th
e synergies 
associated with the DIRECTV integration. There have been other cost 
synergy or cost reduction initiatives ongoing at the company for some time 
now, be it Project Agile or other initiatives. How should we think about the 
opportunities for improv
ing the cash generation capabilities of the combined 
entity?
 
John Stephens
 
Real simply, the numbers we have out in public was our Project Agile 
initiatives, which are going quite well. We are about $3 billion of annual cost 
efficiency, cash operating expen
se savings or cash savings. Our merger 
initiatives are $1.5 billion a year or more, once they get up to the run rate. 

-
defined networks which are really 
driving the opportunity to, if you will, reduce capital cost and re
duce cash 
operating expenses from the ability to eliminate truck rolls and other 
installation costs.
 
When you roll those up, it's pretty easy to take those public numbers we 
have given and get to a number that is a $4 billion or $5 billion, $6 billion 
oppo
rtunity, whatever totals you want to get to. That kind of opportunity is 
very exciting for us. We are striving and working very hard. If that is to 
occur, we will have a very strong opportunity over time to grow cash flow.
 
Amir Rozwadowski
 
Great. Thank you
 
very much for the incremental color.
 
John Stephens
 
Sure.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. We will go next to Michael Rollins with Citi Research. Please go 
ahead.
 
Michael Rollins
 
Thanks. Just a couple of questions. First, can you give us an update on the 
initiatives that management discussed around deploying 40 megahertz of 
new spectrum to fuel capacity for the emerging video strategy and mobile 
broadband demand that you are seeing? And then secondly, if we can just 
an update on your thoughts more broadly 
on the strategy in Latin America, 
and how you perceive the need to [indiscernible], to either scale up or scale 
out of those markets over time? Thanks.
 
John Stephens
 
So, with regard to 

 
and I will stay away from anything with regard to the 
auction, as Mik
e mentioned at the first, can't make any comments with 
regard to that. Our overall spectrum plan, though, as you all know, we 
started the IP some years ago, and put in a lot of fiber in the ground and put 
LTE nationwide. It was our effort to have a network
, and particularly a 
wireless network that had extremely strong backhaul capabilities, and would 
be built in a manner such that we could upgrade the technology rather 
easily, as new technologies came along.
 
With regard to having that network, it is a very 
dense network with macro 
towers, and as such, we are now in a position that with our 40 megahertz of 
WCS and AWS
-
3 spectrum, we are now in that position of taking that 
spectrum and rolling it out and putting it to use over top of this very high
-
quality, de
nse, fiber
-
rich network that we have already built. That allows us 
to deal with the capacity needs of our business for a long period of time and 
continue to then position us, as appropriate, to do software upgrades as we 
move onto the next group of technol
ogies.
 
That allows us to deal with the capacity needs of our business for a long 
period of time, and continue to then position us, as appropriate, to do 
software upgrades as we move onto the next group of technologies. So we 
feel in a very good position an
d feel like the overall strategies that we 
started with some years ago with Project VIP, and getting the 300 million 
LTE POPs out there, and getting a fiber
-
rich backbone out there support the 
backhaul for the right decisions that are really paying off wit
h this, as well as 
the decisions we made to buy the WCS and buy the AWS
-
3 spectrums. They 
are really coming into value for us in a very significant way.
 
With regard to Latin America, as we mentioned in our comments, we 
mentioned before 

 
tough 
environment, but the team down there, we have 
been impressed with, they are operating very well. Brazil is a challenging 
environment, both economically and politically. But the team is performing 
quite well and the overall profitability is impressing us fo
r a management 
team to be able to operate in that environment and produce the results they 
are. We are focused not on customer accounts, but on profitable growth and 
quality.
 
And quite frankly, we are recently encouraged by the change in some of the 
exchan
ge rates. If you look at where the Brazil real is today, at closer to 3.5, 
you can look at where the Argentine peso is at 14.5; and even some 
improvements, quite frankly, in Mexico and the peso coming up, we are 
starting to see some light. It's very early,
 
and so we will continue to work 
very hard to improve operating results. We will keep flexibility with it. We 
are impressed with the teams that are there. We're going to keep working 
hard to make it the best business we can.
 
Michael Rollins
 
Thank you.
 
John
 
Stephens
 
Sure, Mike. Thank you.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question is from Tim Horan with Oppenheimer. Please 
go ahead.
 
Tim Horan
 
I wanted to focus on the handsets a little bit more. Do you think the quality 
of the handsets have gotten better, so that 
the life can be extended here? 
And do you think customers are going to look to save money on handsets? 
And if so, can we see some elasticity in terms of service spending with you 
guys a little bit more? Thanks.
 
John Stephens
 
Tim, the first thing is, to you
r first point, on the quality 

 
I do think that is 
part of it. But what I also think is, if you will, the BYOD aspect of our 

the equipment installment plan or the Next program. An
d so I think there 
were a lot of phones that were still very operable, very good shape, that 
were in, quite frankly, that were idle in the drawer, so to speak. And I think 

numbers grow
 
from 80,000 to 90,000 a quarter, some years ago, to 
400,000 or more in a quarter. So I think your point on that is best 
exemplified or best described by that.
 
With that being said, I think when consumers get the choice and understand 
that they are making 
spending decisions with their money, they are going to 
be very efficient. Last, I think that there are 

 
it's a fluid market; and there 
is, quite frankly, developing a lot of quality, lower
-
cost handsets. We are 
seeing that really in our prepaid business e
xtensively, where there is a lot of 
good quality smartphones that are much lower per
-
unit cost. All of those 
things are impacting the marketplace, and they are impacting our equipment 
revenues, but they are impacting our equipment expenses. And as both of 
those go down, we certainly are striving to have the opportunity to have the 
customer continue to reinvest some of those savings in our services. And we 
will strive to continue to do that. We will see how that plays out. In the first 
quarter, we did have g
ood, solid performance in our wireless service 
revenues. We are extremely encouraged by that.
 
Tim Horan
 
Thank you.
 
John Stephens
 
Thank you, Tim.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. We now have a question from Brett Feldman with Goldman 
Sachs. Please go ahead.
 
Brett Feldma
n
 
Thanks, two quick ones, one just coming to cash flow, and a statement you 
made earlier in your remarks about seasonality of payables. It looks like you 
used about $4 billion cash on payables. And I was just hoping we would get 
some color on how to think 
about working capital items impacting cash flow 
for the balance of the year. And then the 3 million subs who took the 
unlimited wireless plan, a lot of them were existing customers. It is generally 
ARPU accretive when the customers move into the unlimited 
plan? And since 
it is still ongoing, should we view that as a source of ARPU stability going 
forward?
 
John Stephens
 
Good question, Brett. I think, Brett, you're looking at the cash flow 
statement and you're looking at that change in accounts payable. It wa
s 
about a $1.8 billion impact last year for the first quarter and about a $4 
billion impact this year. And you are looking at the right numbers. The 
reason that increased was twofold. We had the opportunity to invest a lot of 
CapEx. There's a lot of equipm
ent and a lot of inventory in the fourth quarter 
at very good prices and rates, and satisfying contractual commitments. 
Those things turn around and get paid for in the first quarter.
 
With that being said, we think that is a timing item, and we don't think
 
it will 
have a permanent impact for the year. It will just reverse out as we go 
through, so that is it. We bought up some inventory, enhanced that to the 
other items, and we made some investments in equipment. So that is that 
aspect of it. That is why we 
are encouraged about free cash flow not only 
meeting guidance, but actually growing year
-
over
-
year.
 
Secondly, the 3 million subs are mostly existing subs. And initial times 
where that 

 
many of them brought not only their device, their handsets, 
but their 
tablets with them, and there was some positive impact for those 
who did bring those tablets. We are encouraged by that. We are optimistic 
about that. But we are going to be very patient and careful about that to see 
how that plays out. We did, though, get 
some new video customers out of 
this. And I won't suggest it was a significant amount of the 3 million, but we 
did get some new ones. And we are also very encouraged about that. And 
we are learning from that to find out how we might be able to make that a 
more 

 
grow that addition of video customers even more through these 
types of offerings. So, positive on both ends of your questions.
 
Brett Feldman
 
Okay. Thank you.
 
John Stephens
 
Sure.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. We now have a question from Simon Flannery with 
Morgan 
Stanley. Go
-
ahead please.
 
Simon Flannery
 
Thanks a lot, John. You touched on GigaPower and the attach rates for your 
broadband. Can you just update us on the build out or is that going to be 
fairly linear? Where do you stand today in sort of the FCC 
commitments? 
And going back to the 2G decommissioning, perhaps you can just let us 
know how much spectrum is tied up in 2G that will get freed up by this 
initiative? Thanks.
 
John Stephens
 
Thank you, Simon. On the GigaPower, I think we are at 1.6 million fi
ber
-
to
-
the
-
prem locations that are active and running today. We are on track with 
our FCC commitments and are confident we are going to meet those on a 
timely basis. And included in our CapEx plans for this year, and our longer
-
term multiyear plans include
s fully funding all that activity, so we are 
optimistic about that.
 
With regard to the 2G commissioning, the one item I want to make sure I 
am straightforward with is as the volume of data traffic or volume of traffic 
on the wireless network has gone down 
from 2G devices, we have been, if 
you will, taking parts of that spectrum and repurposing it as we go. So, in 
some markets, we may only have a 2 by 5 slice of spectrum left to 
repurpose. So we have been doing that, if you will, so to speak, ratably or as 
w
e go as we have been able to free up spectrum.
 
So there is more spectrum to free up. I don't have the specific numbers at 
my disposal, here, Simon. But I will tell you, even with that, there still is a 
lot of cost that are left just to operate even a piece
 
of the 2G network. And 
so we are anxious to capture that savings and use it to continue a strong 
EBITDA story for our wireless business, and a story that is coming from good 
quality network operations and efficiency.
 
Simon Flannery
 
Great, thank you.
 
John 
Stephens
 
Thank you
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question will come from Frank Louthan with Raymond 
James. Go
-
ahead please.
 
Frank Louthan
 
Great. Thank you. Can you give us a little update, as you have been making 
the transition between the U
-
verse customers
 
there, what is sort of the 
cannibalization rate between some of the DIRECTV and the wireline U
-
verse? 
And the same thing on the broadband, are you seeing a shift more to taking 
advantage more of the GigaPower and away from DSL? How much of that is 
just lo
sing share?
 
John Stephens
 
Yes, Frank. Thanks for the question. On the broadband side, Frank, we are 
through most of the opportunity of where they have DSL and also have the 
choice of either GigaPower or high
-
speed broadband products. About 95% 
have already
 
transferred. So we have got some left. The rest of it is just a 
legacy DSL footprint. We will continue to support those. We will continue to 
try to provide good service to those customers. But, if you will, that trade
-
off 
has 

 
the team has worked hard to
 
get people to upgrade into speeds and to 
take advantage of our better
-
quality products and services. I think of that as 
a success.
 
With regard to U
-
verse and DIRECTV, it is really the focus has not been so 
much about cannibalization as it is that the sale
s channel has been focusing 
on selling DTV satellite service. And the reason is, is because it is a lower 
cost structure. We can get, if you will, the content synergy savings by 
adding the customer there. So, that's really what's going on. It's not so 
much
 
a cannibalization or a concerted effort, if you will, to shift. It is more of 
getting the new customers on DTV. And then in some cases, certainly, when 
we have same desk opportunities, one of the ways we can do it is getting 
onto the lower cost structure.
 
So, that is really the focus. We still get good 
Net Promoter Scores and good quality scores on both the DTV and the U
-
verse platform, and we are still pleased to support both. I have U
-
verse in 
my own home, so it works very well for me.
 
Frank Louthan
 
All 
right, great. Thank you.
 
Michael Viola
 
Kathy, we will take one more question.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. That will come from Amy Young with Macquarie. Go
-
ahead 
please.
 
Amy Yong
 
Thanks. I was actually wondering if you could talk a little bit about your 
Mexico busi
ness. You had two quarters now of consecutive net add growth. 
What sort of trajectory should we expect going forward? I think in your 
commentary, you mentioned profitability improving in the back half of the 
year. What kind of metrics should we expect? Tha
nk you.
 
John Stephens
 
Thanks, Amy. We are not going to give specific guidance on customer 
accounts in Mexico, but we are excited about the progress we've made. And 
certainly when you have got two quarters in a row growing customers at this 
level, you 
want to keep that momentum going. I think the more important 
aspect on Mexico is this: one, we do expect at the end of this year we will 
have 75 million of the population covered with LTE. That will probably bring 
our total North American footprint to well
 
over 390 million.
 
So we will be at essentially 400 million POPs by the end of this year, but 
certainly by 2018 on the North American footprint. That growth in LTE POPs 
then gives you the opportunity to expand your sales in other markets. 
Including in that
 
is launching additional markets with an effective market 
strategy where we not only have the network, but we also have customer 
care, customer service, the AT&T brand, and acceptable distribution. And we 
will continue to grow that effective marketplace. W
e have got, if you will, 
markets launched of about 42 in Mexico today and we expect it to be up to 
160 by the end of the year.
 
So you can see that getting the LTE to 75 million POPs, and getting the 
customer care service and the distribution at that same l
evel is going to 
provide us a much greater opportunity than we have today and will give us 
some time to establish ourselves in those markets that we have just joined. 
So, you can understand why we are optimistic about it, and that we believe 
that the team 
is on the right track in doing that. It is a long
-
term investment 
for us. We believe highly in the market. And we think it is a natural addition 
to our North American operations, not only for wireless, but also for our 
business opportunities.

Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to AT&T Fourth 
Quarter 2018 Earnings Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen
-
only 
mode. Later we will conduct a question
-
and
-
answer session. Instructions will 
be given at 

that this conference is being recorded.
 
I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Mr. Michael Viola, 
Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
 
Michael 
Viola
 
Okay. Thanks, Lea. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the fourth 
quarter conference call. As Willy said, I'm Mike Viola, Head of Investor 
Relations here at AT&T. Joining me on the call today is Randall Stephenson, 
AT&T's Chairman and CEO; John St
ephens, AT&T's CFO.
 
Randall is going to provide an overall business update, as well as discuss our 
2019 business initiatives. John's going to cover results along with the 2019 
outlook and then we'll get to a Question
-
and
-
answer session.
 
Before we begin, ne
ed to call your attention to our Safe Harbor statement. It 
says that some of the comments today may be forward
-
looking. They're 
subject to risk and uncertainty and results may differ materially and I'd tell 
you that additional information is available on t
he Investor Relations 
website.
 
I also need to remind you that we're in a quiet period for the FCC spectrum 
auctions, 101 and 102, so we can't address any questions about that today.
 
So as always, our earnings materials are available on the Investor Relatio
ns 
website, includes our news release, 8
-
K, investor briefing, associated 
schedules, et cetera.
 

CEO Randall Stephenson.
 
Randall Stephenson
 
Okay. Thanks, Mike. I'm going to start on
 
Slide 4 of the deck with a brief 
overview and then I'm going to give some highlights for the past year. And I 
would characterize our results as basically doing exactly what we committed 
during our Analyst Day in November and in fact I would say we're ahea
d of 
schedule on each of our key priorities, and as we said our top priority for 
2019 is driving down the debt from the Time Warner acquisition, and I 
couldn't be more pleased that how we close the year.
 
We generated record free cash flow of $7.9 billion i
n the fourth quarter with 
the dividend payout as a percent of free cash flow below 50%. Our full year 
free cash flow was also an all
-
time record even with near record capital 
spending. For the full year, our dividend payout as a percent of free cash 
flow w
as 60% and that allowed us to increase the dividend in December for 
the 35th consecutive year.
 
So while I'm pleased with our financial results for the quarter, we also feel 
good about the progress we made during 2018 on all of our strategic 
imperatives. Fi
rst, we finally closed Time Warner and we have brought 
together the leaders in content and distribution and as committed this 
transaction has been accretive since day one. And as John is going to 
discuss shortly, WarnerMedia had a terrific fourth quarter.
 
We also launched Xandr, our advertising business and then following our 
acquisition of AppNexus, Brian Lesser and his team are integrating that 

and with fourth quarter revenues g
rowing at 26%, our enthusiasm around 
this opportunity is continuing to build.
 
In terms of our networks, our quality and performance are on a very strong 
trajectory. GWS named us the best network in the most comprehensive 
study that's been conducted. We int
roduced the first standards based mobile 
5G network in parts of 12 cities last month and our first net deployments 
finished the year well ahead of schedule.
 
We also accelerated our fiber deployment and we now reach 11 million 
customer locations in addition
 
to 8 million business locations. As a result, 
our broadband business grew by over 6% in the quarter and it's really 
important to note that this fiber deployment is foundational to our 5G 
network. And I would highlight a couple of other items on this slide
.
 
First, strong wireless performance with growth in both revenue and EBITDA. 

American business which grew subscribers in Mexico and in Vrio. And last, 
our total company pro forma EB
ITDA grew by 7.2% for the quarter.
 
If you go to the next slide, you're going to see our key priorities for 2019, 
there is no surprises. It's what we discussed back in November and our top 
priority is to delever the balance sheet. We have strong operational
 
momentum coming out of 2018 and this is going to allow us to reduce our 
debt and continue our strong record for paying dividends.
 
And it's important to note that we're doing all of this while investing at 
industry leading levels in fiber, 5G and FirstNet.
 
We expect to continue 
growing wireless service revenues. The entertainment group that's obviously 
our heaviest lift for 2019 that we're on a path to stabilize EBITDA in 2019 
and we're actually quite confident that you're going to see significant 
improveme
nt in the first quarter.
 
The focus at WarnerMedia is delivering the merger synergies and continuing 
to build on our 2018 momentum and in the back half of the year we plan to 

WarnerMedia
 
brands, specifically Warner Brothers, HBO and Turner.
 
And then last Xandr and it's quickly scaling its capabilities into the ad 
inventories of Turner, our mobility business and all of our TV and over the 
top product. So we're focused 
-
 
that's what we're f
ocused on 2019. We do 
feel very good about our ability to deliver in each of these areas.
 
And so with that, I'm now going to turn it over to our CFO, John Stephens 
and he'll take you through the results. So John.
 
John Stephens
 
Thanks, Randall. Good morning
, everyone and thanks for being on the call. 
Let me begin with our financial summary which is on Slide 7. As we've done 
in previous quarters we'll be referring to comparable results for most of our 
segments for the next few slides.
 
For 2018 AT&T was requir
ed to adopt new accounting standards, that deal 
with revenue recognition, pension cost and instalment receivables. These 
changes impact our income statements and cash flows. At the same time the 
company made a policy decision to record universal service fe
es and other 
regulatory fees on that basis. And I'm happy to add this should be the last 
quarter we'll have to open the call this way, as we've rolled through a full 
year of these accounting changes.
 
Let me start with earnings, adjusted fourth quarter EPS 
was $0.86 up more 
than 10% for the quarter and more than 15% for the year. For the quarter, 

benefits from the adoption of revenue recognition standards was generally 
offset by a highe
r effective tax rate and foreign exchange pressures.
 
Consolidated Revenue came in at $48 billion, up 15%, thanks mostly to the 
acquisition of Time Warner. Gains in Mobility and WarnerMedia were offset 
by declines in legacy services, the impact of the trans
ition in our video 
business and foreign exchange pressure from Latin America. On a 
comparable basis, fourth quarter wireless equipment revenue was down by 
$500 million year
-
over
-
year due to fewer smartphone sales.
 
When you look on a comparative pro 
forma basis revenues were down year
-
over
-
year due entirely to lower wireless equipment revenue and foreign 
exchange pressure. In fact, without those impacts revenues were positive.
 
Operating income showed solid growth and adjusted consolidated operating 
ma
rgins continued to expand up [450] [ph] basis points with strong growth 
in Mobility and WarnerMedia margins.
 
For the full year adjusted operating income margins grew by 220 basis 
points. That growth comes even with margin pressure from the customer 
transit
ion in our video business.
 
One housekeeping item related to the Mobility preferred equity interest we 
contributed to our pension plan back in 2013, that preferred return about 
$140 million in the fourth quarter is now reflected in non
-
controlling interest 
on the income statement with an offset in other income.
 
Earnings and margins showed strong growth, but perhaps the best measure 
of our financial success is our cash flows where we turned in record results. 
Let's look at that on Slide 8.
 
Both our cash from 
operations and free cash flow hit record levels for the full 
year. This is really important. For a company that depends on strong cash 
flows to meet our business goals we need strong cash like we had this past 
year to invest in our business, to meet our co
mmitments to delever and to 
continue our long and proud history of returning value to shareholders.
 
Free cash flow is a record $22.4 billion in 2018, that's up 36% with $7.9 
billion of that coming in the fourth quarter. This does include a $1.3 billion 
rec
eipt from our FirstNet contract and reflects our results in managing 
vendor payables, accounts receivable and a variety of other working capital 
efforts. It also includes the impact of a nearly $500 million of voluntary 
contributions to our benefit plans t
hat we made in the fourth quarter.
 
That dropped our full year dividend payout ratio to 60% in 2018. The strong 
free cash flow comes with near record capital investment. Year in year out, 
we're a leader in capital investment in the US. 2018 was no different
, as we 
invested nearly $23 billion if you include the FirstNet capital for which we 
were reimbursed.
 
Equally important to us is our ability to pay a strong dividend. Investors 
expect one from us, a strong free cash flows has allowed us to pay a solid 
divi
dend since we became a standalone company in 1983 and we have 
consistently raised that dividend for 35 years. Our ability to generate strong 
cash flow is also a critical part of our commitment to improve our leverage 
position.
 
Let me give you an update on 
that on Slide 9. You know our leverage 
commitments we made, our goal was to get to the 2.9 range by the end of 

Time Warner deal. Our next goal is to drop that even lower to the 2.5 r
ange 
by the end of this year.
 
Our strong free cash flow in 2018 gives us confidence we'll achieve our 2019 
free cash flows and be able to significantly delever. We expect about $12 

at 
to pay down debt. That alone will get us to the 2.6 range by the end of the 
year. We've also been very thoughtful in deliver it and finding ways to 
monetize our large asset portfolio.
 
We've made several moves in recent years. Most recently closing the $
1.1 
billion sale of our data centers and we've identified billions of dollars of other 
monetizeable assets.
 
We have a large amount of office buildings and raw land that we've 
identified for potential sale. Our Hulu investment is another opportunity with 
mo
re than $500 billion in total assets we'll continue to look for ways to 
monetize our asset portfolio and keep you updated on our progress.
 
Our merger synergies will also contribute. They remain on target, $1.5 
billion in cost, and $1 billion in revenue for
 
a $2.5 billion run rate by the end 
of 2021. And bottom line, our financial strength allows to achieve our 
leverage targets, continue to invest in our business and continue to return 
solid dividends to our shareholders.
 
Let's now talk results starting with
 
our communication segment. That 
information is on Slide 10. Communications segment which consists of our 
Mobility, entertainment and business wireline units. Together this segment 
grew EBITDA and expanded EBITDA margins by a 120 basis points, driven 
by gr
eat performance in Mobility. Obviously we were sharply focused on 
profitability last quarter and our Mobility results point to our success.
 
Service revenues grew by $400 million or nearly 3% in the quarter. EBITDA 
was up more than 13% or more than $800 mil
lion. And we had our highest 
ever fourth quarter EBITDA service margin of 48.6. That's up 450 basis 
points over last year and was driven by service revenue growth, disciplined 
promotions, lower volumes and continued cost improvement.
 
We were strategic with
 
promotions able to turn them on and off quickly to 
effectively compete. We won't hesitate to be where we see an opportunity, 
especially for high value customers. But even with a strong performance we 
had 134,000 postpaid phone net adds in the quarter with
 
467,000 branded 
smartphones added to our base.
 
You also saw our cost discipline in our prepaid business. That includes 
holding the line against uneconomical equipment promotions by our 
competitors. Even with our spending discipline, prepaid phones grew in
 
the 
quarter, thanks to the strength of cricket where we added about 240,000 
subscribers which more than offset a loss from AT&T prepaid.
 
Prepaid revenue growth was solid and earlier this month cricket passed the 
10 million subscriber mark, doubling our su
bscriber base since we acquired 
the company in 2014 and momentum continues to be strong. Please note 
about 60% of our cricket net ads have characteristics that generate value 
similar to what we see from many of our postpaid customers.
 
We also made signific
ant strides in our network of evolution in the fourth 
quarter. Randall told you about our network leadership in 5G introduction. 
With the additional spectrum we're adding, carrier aggregation and other 
network improvements, 5G evolution is producing better
 
speeds for our 
customers today when compared to standard LTE. Our first net deployment 
is reaching critical mass and providing a tailwind for our results.
 
Now let's look at our Entertainment Group results and the steps we're taking 
to bring EBITDA stabili
ty. Our year
-
over
-
year decline slowed by nearly $300 
million and EBITDA growth rates showed a sequential improvement even in 
a seasonally pressured fourth quarter. This was driven primarily by a 
reduction in customers on a two year promotions in the fourth
 
quarter, as 
well as improvement in DTV NOW profitability.
 
We expect revenue performance to continue throughout the year helping 
stabilize EBITDA in 2019. We are confident we will stabilize EBITDA this year 
and expect to see real improvement in year
-
over
-
y
ear EBITDA results 
starting in the first quarter.
 
A more tailored data driven approach with promotions is making an impact. 
Six months ago we had half a million customers on highly discounted 
DIRECTV NOW offers, it generally offers that require the custome
r pay $10 a 
month for the service. At the end of the year essentially none of these 
customers remained on those officers.
 
Eliminating these promotions for low value, high churn customers clearly 
elevated subscriber losses of the quarter, but it had a posit
ive impact on 
streaming ARPUs and lowered content costs. In fact DTV NOW ARPU was up 
about $10 sequentially from the third quarter.
 
Our fiber footprint continues to grow. We now passed more than 1 million 
customer locations with fiber and are on our way to
 
hit the 40 million 
locations later this year. This will extend our fiber network to 22 million 
locations when include business. Subscribers on our fiber network increased 
by more than 1 million last year, driving the number of total broadband 
customers in
 
our fiber footprint to substantially more than 3 million, and the 
longer we have fiber in the market the higher our penetration rates go.
 
This performance is helping drive broadband revenue growth, another key 
focus in our drive to EBITDA stability, and a
s always, we're laser focused on 
costs, all costs including content. That too will play a big role in stabilizing 
EBITDA.
 
Cost efficiencies of the story of business wireline, strategic business services 
continue to grow and at the 12 billion plus annualize
d business that helps 
offset the continuing legacy revenue declines. Our focus on cost initiatives 
allows us to deliver margins even with the legacy revenue declines.
 

on Slide 11. 
WarnerMedia revenues grew nearly 6% with double
-
digit 
operating income in all three business units. Warner Brothers are in the 
spotlight this quarter, it had a great cash generation year and saw growth 
across both its theatrical and television business.
 
We had a great theatrical fourth quarter on the back of a strong slate of 
movies, including Aquaman or Star is Born, Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of 
Grindelwald, and The Mule. Aquaman past the 1 billion mark in global box 
office receipts to date and the cr
itically acclaimed film a Star is Born has 
racked up eight Oscar nominations. This helped propel Warner Brothers to 
its best quarterly and full year operating income ever.
 
Turner saw solid gains in subscription revenues. Subscription revenues 
continue to g

foreign exchange pressure at Turner's International Networks. Total Turner 
advertising rates continue to be solid even while ratings decline. Domestic 
ad revenues declined 6% due to lowered de
livery across various Turner 
networks, primarily for kids and young adult. International ad revenues were 
essentially flat when adjusting for the foreign exchange pressure.
 
However Turner's operating income was up nearly 21%, reflecting solid 
expense contr
ol from solid management of programming and marketing 
expenses in the quarter.
 
HBO results were impacted by a carriage dispute, but still saw a double
-
digit 
operating income in the quarter. Subscription revenues down 3%, primarily 
due to dispute, without t
hat dispute subscription revenues would have been 
up slightly. Content and other revenues rose 17% due to higher 
internationalizing revenues.
 

control and lower programming and distribution c
osts. Even with the ongoing 
carriage dispute, we expect HBO to grow revenues in 2019.
 
As a final note, WarnerMedia companies continue to be recognized for their 
excellence in producing high quality entertainment. WarnerMedia received 
11 Academy Award nomin
ations, including A for a Star is Born. This comes 
on top of four Golden Globe Awards earlier this month.
 
Now let's look at Xandr and Latin America results are on slide 12. Xandr, our 
new advertising and analytics business continues to execute at a high le
vel. 
Total revenues were up 49% or 26% excluding AppNexus. Much of that 
growth can be attributed to a strong political ad season. But even without 
that revenues continue to grow significantly.
 
EBITDA grew 17% and EBITDA margins continue to be very strong. 
The 
integration of AppNexus is on track. AppNexus heads best
-
in
-
class 
technology and data capabilities that strengthen our premium advertising 
marketplace. We're moving quickly to integrate the Xandr marketplace 
across AT&T.
 

nding is moving to the Xandr platform, 
driving efficiencies on how we activate campaigns. At the same time, our 
digital inventories enabled on our platform and with our data driving better 
yield and higher demand. We started making digital data available f
or 

advanced advertising marketplace is built to power the industry with rich 
data, technology and talent.
 
Our success across AT&T gives distributors, publishers and buyers 
confidenc
e to work with us. Already Altice and Frontier onboard and working 
-
 
and we're working to add more. We power 2 billion of advertising spend 
through our digital platform, most of which is from third parties.
 
Moving to the international side of the business.
 
Our Latin America 
operations had a strong subscriber growth quarter, but we continue to deal 
with foreign exchange pressures. Total Latin America revenues and EBITDA 
were down year
-
over
-
year, primarily due to foreign exchange. Without that 
foreign exchang
e impact and excluding Venezuela revenues would have 
grown 2% on a comparable basis.
 
In Mexico we had a million new subscribers and more than 3.2 million for the 
full year. We now have more than 18 million customers in total. Service 
revenues in Mexico wer
e down largely due to the decision we made to shut 
down a wholesale business that we inherited from Nextel, as well as some 
FX pressure. Without those impacts service revenues were up year
-
over
-
 
year.
 
EBITDA was impacted by operation 
-
 
higher operational e
xpense including a 
significant amount of non
-
recurring items. In Pay TV, fourth quarter 
subscriber net ads were 198,000 with gains largely in the South Region. 
Total subscribers at the end of the quarter were 13.8 million. While FX did 
impact our Latin Ame
rica satellite operations, the business continued to be 
profitable and generate cash.
 
Now let's look at our 2019 guidance on Slide 13. Our guidance remains 
unchanged from what we said in our November analyst meeting. Free cash 
flow will be our most importa
nt financial metric. We expect free cash flow to 
$26 billion range in 2019 and we'll keep our dividend payout ratio solid in 
high 50% range.
 
As we discussed earlier, we are tightly focused on achieving 2.5 times net 
debt to adjusted EBITDA range by the end
 
of the year. We will also continue 
to expect to invest at high levels in our business with growth capital 
investment in the $23 million dollar range. That's before reducing that 
investment by the $1 billion of FirstNet spending, which we expect to be 
reim
bursed for.
 
While we expect the year
-
over
-
year impact of the new revenue recognition 
standard to be a headwind to earnings, we still expect adjusted EPS growth 
in the low single digits for 2019. We expect our effective tax rate in 2019 to 
be approximately 
23% excluding any one
-
time item.

Michael Viola
 
Okay. We're ready for the questions and so Lea, if you can open up the lines 
and get started.
 
Question
-
and
-
Answer Sessi
on
 
Operator
 
Certainly. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from line of John 
Hodulik with UBS. Please go ahead.
 
John Hodulik
 
Great. Thanks, guys. Can we talk a little bit about sub trends both in the 
entertainment space and the wireless space. Ma
ybe just to feed off your 
comments on entertainment, it sounds like with the majority of those 
customers coming off promotions and now losses should 
-
 
should really start 
to slow. But at the same time you've got some price ups on the satellite 
side. So is 
it fair to say that that those losses could increase in some color 
there. Also on the broadband side with the fiber buildout, what do you 

 
And then maybe on wireless, just wondering if in your view, y
ou saw some 
nice postpaid handset growth despite the fact you've pulled back on 
advertising and promotions. And do you think that you can maintain this 
level of growth with this low level of spending. And are you starting to see 
any growth from the first r
esponder community? Thanks.
 
Randall Stephenson
 
So, John, this is Randall, I'll start and John Stephens can interrupt or append 
as we go through this. But look we told everybody back in November that 
we were going to be laser focused on driving down debt an
d driving cash 
flow and we pulled all the levers you would expect.
 
And if you start with the TV business, we had come over the last couple of 
years getting the DIRECTV NOW the streaming product into the marketplace 
and we had multiple offers out in the mar
ketplace. And you know, it's been a 
year, year and a half of learning what the market demand was going to be 
and what the market engaged, and the customer engagement with the 
product was going to be.
 
And as we matured the product and as we came out of 
mid
-
year you know, 
we just looked at the customer segment. There was a customer segment at 
the low end, very promotional pricing who are not engaging on the product. 
We didn't 
-
 
we don't yet have the Xandr platform stood up to really monetize 
meaningfully 
on the digital side, the streaming side and advertising revenue. 
And we said until we get all those pieces in place let's pull that promotional 
aspect out.
 
And so we told you in November there were 500,000 of those customers on 
the promotional pricing. And
 
we started allowing those customers to a trade 
out that obviously has a significant impact on dilution. You know, the 
product has been dilutive in 2018.
 
This is one of the main drivers of the dilution and this is also one of the 
primary triggers as we mov
e into 2019 to getting us to EBITDA stability, as 
we begin to get the promotional subscribers out and now we have a 
customer base that's left on the streaming that's growing, remaining 
customer base is growing and is a highly engaged customer base and has 
good churn characteristics.
 
And so we actually like where we are in terms of how we're positioning the 
streaming product. And as I said, it's a major driver to how we get to 
EBITDA stability next year.
 
On the traditional linear side, these trends are in li
ne with what you should 
expect as we go forward. We're not going to be horridly promotional to try 
to drive growth in this except where we have a good strong broadband 
footprint, particularly a fiber footprint and where we bundle this product with 
fiber we
 
have really good characteristics, we have good churn 
characteristics. The lifetime value of that customer segment is really, really 
high. We tend to over index on wireless penetration where we have the TV 
product with our fiber and our broadband product. 
So you know we're going 
to continue down the path that you saw in the fourth quarter.
 

-
year. We'll be at 14 million locations passed with our fiber footprint. You're 
seeing now the i
mpact as we move our customers into the fiber footprint. 
You're not seeing the overall broadband subscribers grow, but as people 
migrate to fiber you're seeing a significant lift in ARPU. And literally we had 
6% broadband growth in the fourth quarter with 
no overall subscriber 
growth. We added what John 250,000 fiber customers roughly?
 
John Stephens
 
Yes.
 
Randall Stephenson
 
In the quarter, we think those trends can continue. In fact, we think those 
trends are very achievable. And so this is one of those area
s as we deploy 
fiber. We've been doing this long enough now.
 
The penetrations that you achieve are 
-
 
there a little bit mechanical, you 
know very, very much what to expect, what penetration rates to expect, 
what periods of time and what ARPU lifts to get. 
So this is another one of the 
key elements on how you get the Entertainment Group to stable EBITDA, 
you continue growing this fiber revenue stream and moving ARPUs up as 
people move to fiber.
 
And then on the wireless side, yeah, we feel that we can sustain
 
wireless 
where we are without having to step up significantly on promotional costs or 
advertising. But this is the approach we've taken to wireless, particularly in 
the situation we are or moving aggressively to drive cash flow and pay down 
debt is we wil
l surge promotions as necessary in the marketplace and that's 
what we did in the fourth quarter and then we will make sure we keep our 
high quality customer base in check and we will do what we need to, to keep 
the customer base in check.
 
But I like how th
e team is executing here. They've really rationalized their 
targeted marketing. They're doing a really good job in terms of focusing on 
the customer bases we want to retain. I love what happens 
-
 
what's 
happening in the prepaid based on cricket. Cricket co
ntinues to have really 
strong momentum. We did I think 240,000 cricket subscriber adds in the 
quarter.
 
What we saw offsetting that is our AT&T branded prepaid which we sell in 
our AT&T stores, we saw some loss there and it appears that we may be 
losing som
e of that prepaid customer base to other companies postpaid 
customers.
 
And so we're seeing a little bit of migration, so we'll play with that and 
ensure that up. But that's one of those where the market got incredibly 
promotional on the prepaid side during
 
4Q. And we remain disciplined in 
terms of the amount of promotion we put into handset costs, gave our 
customers a good value proposition and cricket volumes I think showed it. 

 
John Stephens
 
So DTV, I think one thing to point out, I me
an, we had the two year price 
lock, we came off that starting in April. We migrated a bunch of that 
-
 
a 
bunch those customers up to market based pricing which has caused some 
churn and that's what you're seeing in the quarter. We got about 2 million of 
tho
se customers left. It's really important that we get those up to market 
pricing. But as we do that, that'll cause some churn, some pressure on net 
additions. So that's why we're expecting what we're expecting with regard to 
getting through that. But once a
gain that's a key piece to the profitability.
 
Specifically on the on the AT&T prepaid that we announced, well let me just 
give you one example, we have a phone that was being offered by our 
competitors for a $100 that we know the cost was 250, so 150 subsi
dy just 
on the equipment for a prepaid customer, we decided not to do that. We 
knew it. We were aware of it. That caused the pressure and that was one of 
the reasons but a good example [indiscernible] some of the pressure in the 
AT&T prepaid.
 
By the same t
oken, our cricket brand continues to do really well both on 
churn you know, and we're growing revenues in the prepaid space in total, 
so we feel really good about that. And your FirstNet question, the build
-

going great, we're at 40% at the end of las

ahead of schedule. We're seeing great quality for all our customers, as well 
as our new first responder customers.
 
We're seeing the effects of 5G evolution be real and in customers hands 
today which is making a difference. W
e do have about 450,000 FirstNet 
qualified customers from about 5000 organizations or departments that have 
signed up for it. A significant amount of those early adopters were 
migrations, so maybe close to two thirds or 60% or so, but we are now 
getting a 
lot of new ads. And as this build out gets passed the existing 40% 
in the 50%, 60% and 70% so to speak as we continue make that progress, I 
think you'll see us begin to grow that new customer share and numbers 
significantly.
 
So we really do view that as a 
tailwind for the whole business as it improves 
existing customers quality, speed, throughput, but it also gives us visibility 
which we've been successful at, our teams had a good job with gaining new 
customers.
 
Randall Stephenson
 
We did an interesting expe
riment or demonstration is probably the right 
word on New Year's Eve at Times Square with our FirstNet network. We 
invited the first responder community to come to Times Square middle of 
the night when the crowds were massive at Times Square and used the F
irst 
responder network and see what kind of speeds they would get on a fully 
loaded network. And I will tell you the first responder community that saw it 
was quite impressed and we have some high expectations on where FirstNet 
goes this year and next year
.
 
John Hodulik
 
Okay. Thanks, guys.
 
Randall Stephenson
 
We will take the next question, thanks.
 
Operator
 
That's the line of Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
 
Simon Flannery
 
All right. Thanks very much. Good morning. Just 
continuing on FirstNet, 

pretty much done with that and related to that build out I think you said at 
CES that you plan to have standards
-
based nationwide mobile 5G in 2020. 
Can you ju
st talk a little bit more about those plans and that put you in a 
pretty strong position then, how should we expect your ability to monetize 
that? Thank you.
 
John Stephens
 
Okay. So we have standards
-
based mobile 5G today with regard to 12 
markets at the en
d of the year and I think by the end of the first quarter or 

announced, Mike, make sure I'm correct on that.
 
So we're working that, we're that first with that mobile
-
standards 5G. 
If you 
will it works hand in glove with the FirstNet build. So as we said before as 
we go to a site now and put the antenna up, put the radios up, retune it for 
the 700 we're also doing the physical work necessary to make it ready for 
5G and from a softwar
e upgrade perspective.
 
And so you're connecting the FirstNet with the 5G and stay on the 5G 
Evolution is really spot on, Simon. As I said we're at 40% at the end of the 

last year. F
or most of this year, I won't suggest you, I won't give you a 
specific number. I will tell you there will be some 
-
 
they did a phenomenal 
job at over performing last year. So I'm not going to hold them up to those 
standards, but we are clearly on track to 
get this thing done well before the 
five year and to get the fast 
-
 
you know, get the majority of the country 
covered by 2020 when that mobile standards based mobile 5G network is 
available.
 
With regard to that too, we're selling that service providing tha
t service 
today with regard to a hotspot or a PoC. We expect the phone to be 
available 
-
 
couple of phones available this year. And one of those phones to 
be worked both backwards and forwards with regard to the standard LTE 
existing low band, low band, as 
well as the millimeter wave. So yes, we do 
believe that provides us a significant advantage.
 
The importance for me though is, is that as this FirstNet build goes, this 
spectrum goes up as carrier aggregation to 256 QAM and all the other 
technological impro
vements go into place our existing customer base is 
going to get a better sense all that in their service, we think that'll be great 
for attracting customers, allowing us to compete on a rational basis, as well 
as key to retaining customers.
 
So I hope I an
swered your question there, but it is a evolution, it is real, it 
affects our customers as we roll it out just about our service and it does give 
us that lead for 2020 as phones come out to make this widely available in 
the coming year.
 
Simon Flannery
 
So a
re you dedicating a portion of your WCS or AWS to the standards
-
based 
5G. How that's 
-
 
how is that going to work?
 
John Stephens
 
I'll let the technology guys get that in depth, but I wouldn't say that we're 
going to dedicate it. I'd say that we're going to 
make it available, but I will 
leave my network technology guys to make sure I don't mislead in that 
answer.
 
Simon Flannery
 
Great. Thanks, John.
 
John Stephens
 
Thank you, Simon.
 
Michael Viola
 
We take the next question please?
 
Operator
 
And that's the line of 
Brett Feldman with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
 
Brett Feldman
 
Thanks for taking the question. You know, you noted earlier the success that 
you have when you're able to sell a video product and a broadband product 
in the same footprint. You're doing a gr
eat job with fiber but even when 
you're done with the fiber bill that's only going to be a little over 10% of 
homes in the country that you can serve with fiber.
 
But you are building a nationwide 5G network and we've seen at least one of 
your competitors a
lready leverage their early phase of 5G to launch a 
residential 5G product. I was hoping you could give us some updated 
thoughts around whether you think that's a large addressable opportunity 
for AT&T to be a residential fixed wireless 5G provider. And do
 
you think you 
have the resources you need to do that or would you have to acquire more 
spectrum or more fiber or something along those lines? Thank you.
 
Randall Stephenson
 
Yeah. Hi, Brett. This Randall. I will say over time three to five year time 
horizon
 
unequivocally 5G will serve as a broadband, a fixed broadband 
replacement product. I am very convicted that that will be the case. We are 
obviously on a standards
-
based path. We want a standards
-
based path that 
is mobile first, but just like every other p
roduct evolution and mobility this 
will play out the same.
 
You know, we back in the 90s everybody was saying wireless would never 
serve as a substitute for fixed line voice because there wasn't sufficient 
capacity. Well it is a substitute for boys. We said
 
the same thing on 
broadband in terms of 
-
 
with the wireless device serve as a broadband 
replacement broadly in the iPhone and LTE really began to make that a 
reality and then as we look at 5G will you have enough capacity to have a 
good broadband product 
that serves as a streaming service for all of your 
DIRECTV NOW, your Netflix, et cetera? I absolutely am convinced that we 
will have that capacity, particularly as we turn up millimeter wave spectrum. 
That's where the capacity and the performance comes fro
m and that's where 
you'll begin to see a broad 
-
 
a true replacement opportunity for fixed line 
broadband. So I have little doubt that in the three to five year time horizon 
you'll start to see substitution of wireless for fixed line broadband.
 
John 
Stephens
 

10 million Cricket customers, the total cost of 15 million prepaid customers. 
And quite frankly I think many of them may be using their phone and our 
broadband connection
s or mobile broadband connections for their service 
today.
 
So I say that is that 
-
 
no that's not exactly on point with your question, but 
it's a reality today. It's a matter of how this migrates and it goes back to 
why all the spectrum we're putting up is 
increasing our spectral capacity by 
50% to FirstNet efforts by building it with an expectation to software load 5G 
on it.
 
All of that is so important because we'll be the ones best positioned to take 
advantage of those opportunities as they play out, which
 
we think will be 
you know over the next few years, as Randall said, three to five year 
timeframe.
 
Randall Stephenson
 
Ironically one of the top use cases, early use cases for 5G are businesses 
wanting to deploy 5G as effectively their land environment. And
 
so think 
about a wireless plug and play environment. So that is truly a wireless 
replacing fixed line as a 
-
 
is a high speed internet solution. So yeah, this will 
play itself out that way Brett.
 
Brett Feldman
 
Thanks.
 
Michael Viola
 
Thanks, Brett. Lea, next
 
question please?
 
Operator
 
That's the line of Philip Cusick with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
 
Philip Cusick
 
Hi, guys. Thanks. First following up on video, Randall can you confirm that 
the regular price DIRECTV NOW base is growing? And are those positive 
EBIT
DA at this point?
 
And then second, as you think about advertising this year, can you help us 
think about how you expect that, should we 

 
given your advertising x 
efforts, can we expect this to grow substantially faster than the industry 
overall?
 
Randall S
tephenson
 
Yeah. So on the DIRECTV NOW video, if you pulled a promotional customers 

 
John Stephens
 
And Phil, the simplest way to think about that is you take 500,000 out of our 
numbers and you know whi
ch is they're all gone or they stepped up to the 
full service, full price plan. So yes, you know our full price customers grew.
 
Randall Stephenson
 
And the ARPU, you heard John say, ARPU in the quarter sequentially is up 
$10, over $10 per line. And so I don
't know that I can represent we're 

 
John Stephens
 
But we haven't disclosed any of that information, but those 
-
 
but we are up 
$11 sequentially, $10 year
-
over
-
year, but we're up sequentially in ARPU.
 
Randall Stephenson
 
And on advertising
, Xandr, do I expect we will outperform the market? 
Absolutely. I would be sorely disappointed if we did not outperform the 
market. If you look at fourth quarter a streaming TV advertising business 
grew 26%. I mean, it is radically outperforming the market
 
now.
 
And so I have little concern that we won't be able to outgrow the market. 
That's one of Brian Lesser's key objectives is to make sure that we're 
building an advertising business for video that will grow faster than the 
market. And we're gaining more 
and more conviction around this the further 
we get into it.
 
John Stephens
 

from Xandr and the information that data insights and provide it to Turner 
and allow that to be used 
as a kind of a merger, kind of a synergistic way to 
improve that advertising over there to give the turn a team that opportunity 
to have that information to better sell theirs is just as exciting for me as the 
advertising insights are for DTV NOW.
 
Philip Cusick
 
We've talked in the past about the advertising inflection point really not 
coming until 2020 when all the pieces were in place. Randall do you think 
that that's happening more quickly or is this still a year of development?
 
Randall 
Stephenson
 
It's a year of development Phil, you'll see a strong friend on Xandr 

get to the 

 
the really big opportunity which is what John Stephens has 
articulated here and that i
s beginning to leverage our customer insights into 
the Turner ad inventory, that's going to be more 2020 where you start to 
see those results really play out.
 
And also as more and more people want to participate in the marketplace, 
the more success we have
, the more we're seeing people come to us and 
want to bring their inventory to bear in the marketplace and use the 
customer insights as well.
 
John Stephens
 
And so the 2020 year for me too is a very optimistic year because there will 
be another political ye
ar and those political years are good for our 
advertising business too. So just to stay that, so yeah, getting all this done 
and getting it all ready for that timeframe and having it up and running 
could be very beneficial for us.
 
Philip Cusick
 
Got it.
 
Mic
hael Viola
 
Okay. Thanks, Phil. Ready for the next question, Lea.
 
Operator
 
That's the line of David Barden with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
 
David Barden
 
Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the questions, appreciate it. I think I want to 
ask the analog to Joh
n's question on subs which is on ARPU, could we kind 
of talk a little bit about on the wireless ARPU what were the drivers of the 
sequential step down. I think we heard from Verizon that storm credits were 
an issue, also potentially FirstNet migrations mig
ht have been a contributor. 

 
And then second on the linear video ARPU, up $7 sequentially, that's typical 
to see it up with the SUNDAY TICKET. But we know that there's a 
promotional pric
e component to that. So if you could kind of disaggregate 
those two forces so we can kind of guesstimate where we could see the 
ARPU kind of land in 2019?
 
And then the last one if I could, on the broadband ARPU, it's up 6% year
-
over
-
year, but sequentially 
not growing. And I was trying to understand kind 
of which of those is the more informative, the sequential trend or the year
-
over
-
year trend in growth? Thank you so much.
 
John Stephens
 
So let me let me let me start with the DTV. You're right one, there is 
an 
impact on the SUNDAY TICKET. Two, there is an impact from discounts, but 
three, there's an impact from the fact that we've been doing this to your 
pricing initiative since the second quarter, late second quarter such that that 
is going into effect. So a
ll three of those things are going in, as well as when 
you become less promotional, generally speaking the promotions are 
revenue based.
 
So David, what I am really saying is we have four different moving parts, 
but in essence we feel very good about where 
that process is going. It is 
causing some challenges on customer accounts on both DIRECTV and 
DIRECTV Now, but we're comfortable with where that's going and it's 
necessary part of that EBITDA stabilization process.
 
With regard to mobility on the postpaid A
RPU side, I would suggest to you 
that the changes are 
-
 
if you will from a prior year basis are pretty 
significant, very good. I feel good about that. And we've seen what the 
market reaction it seems to be accepting that, that has to do with buying up 
into
 
bigger plans and the premium to get AT&T Watch, but also some of our 
cost structures past this have gone on.
 
With regard to the sequential piece of that, there is some impacts from prior 
years and credit and so forth. I view those is not significant chang
e, I think 
on a year
-
over
-
year basis our postpaid ARPU is up probably a buck and a 
half. And I think there's about a $0.10 difference sequentially. So I feel good 
about where we're going as we continue to add customers.
 
So I'm not as concerned 
-
 
I don't th
ink of that as an inflection point at all, I 
think of it as a continued very good performance on a year
-
over
-
year basis 
and a good stepping off point.
 
I'm not sure if I if I've missed anything. Okay, we'll see on the broadband 
base, we'll continue. The key
 
is to first get them on the fiber products 
because there's lower churn, higher retention. Secondly, you get them 
higher
-
speed, so they buy up. When you get to 6% year
-
over
-
year increase 
and you get to the point where you start to lap that, which we will d
o in the 
second half of next 

 
of 2019, I wouldn't expect to have those same times of 
ARPU growth. It just doesn't work that way, but we are seeing improvement 
in that and you see it in the total revenue piece which is where we're really 
focused on.
 
We had
 
mentioned earlier, we're continuing to see, you know, after 18 
months we're getting over a third close to 40% penetration in those build 
base and after three years we're getting over 50% penetration in that fiber 
build space. So we've got a lot of opportu
nity left.
 
I think we mentioned we only have a 
-
 
we have over 3 million customers, 
but we've built into a 11 million. So there's a lot of growth left, not only 
converting, but also growing total customer. So feel good about all those. 
I'm hopefully I'm ans

 
Randall Stephenson
 
The other element that kind of factors into John's commentary on 
broadband, we expect good growth on broadband next year. But part of it is 
the legacy low speed broadband base is pretty much traded do
wn to very 
low number, so a lot of that attrition ought to fall off next year as well. So 
we think broadband setup for another pretty good year next year.
 
David Barden
 
Great. Thank you, guys.
 
Michael Viola
 
Thanks, David. Our next question please?
 
Operator
 
The line of Michael Rollins with Citi. Please go ahead.
 
Michael Rollins
 
Hi, thanks. Two if I could. First, when you target bending the cost curve for 
video content in the DIRECTV business is the growth to just slow the growth 
of programming costs 
or are you targeting actual drop in total programming 
costs over the next few years and maybe within that context how do you 
look at exclusive agreements like the one that you have with the NFL 
SUNDAY TICKET?
 
And then just backing up to a higher level, whe
n you look at that target of 
$26 billion of free cash flow for 2019 as you've exited, 2018 are there any 
changes in the contributors with respect to operations, financing costs, taxes 
or even what you may contribute to benefit plans? Thanks.
 
Randall Stephe
nson
 

you about the cash flow composition and decompose that for you little bit. 
But the answer to your question on the content cost curve is the objective as 
content deals co
me up is to move the needle and it's not on size fits all. 
There are some pieces of content that we look at the value of the content to 
the customer versus the price we pay and we say that content has to come 
down in terms of cost.
 
There's some you know wh
ere the customer engagement is high and so you 
know it might be hard to take the content cost down, but the objective is to 
keep the equation in balance. And you cannot have a business model where 
subscribers are declining and you continue to increase cost
s by 7% and 8%. 
And so far the content deals that we've been through, we've had some very 
good success to getting rationalization for those content costs.
 
And so this is a not inconsequential part of the equation to getting to EBITDA 
stable as well in 2019
. And so far early indications are we think this is an 
equation we can balance and it should be a healthy contributor to it.
 
What we have to do is the customer is just not willing to pay more for the 
content as the content costs have been increasing over t
he last few years. 
And so we got to get the content cost growth in line with what the customer 
is willing to pay and the customer is willing to pay virtually no additional 
money right now. So the content costs have to reflect that. So we'll be very 
asserti
ve as we go through the course of this year and try to control the 
spend on content cost.
 
And then there's another element to it. And John Donovan and his team are 
being very smart about this and particularly on the over the top pieces. But 
what content ha
s to be included in packages, you know, you can control 
your margins and your content costs by getting the packages more right size 
to the customers. And so can you bring content costs down to keep margins 
in check by rightsizing the packages for the custo
mer. So there's a lot of 
really smart analytical work being done there to how can we help our 
customers by getting the packages right sized as well. John, you won't talk 
about cash flow.
 
John Stephens
 
So thinking about cash flow, Mike, let me try it this w
ay. If you start off with 
2018 as kind of a base, a couple of things, one, we won't have the merger 

Secondly, we'll have a full year of Time Warner, so add that back in. And 
Time Warne
r for six months this year was about $2 billion of free cash flow 
and the deal cost in total and all the interest everything else was about $2 
billion for the first half of the year.
 
Secondly, you'll have 
-
 
or next, you'll have 
-
 
we'll begin to see some me
rger 
integration synergy benefits. We'll have some costs to putting those into 
place. So I don't want to overplay that, but it will be the path generator. 
That's kind of the midpoint from the deal.
 
On interest expense and total of course, we'll see some in
terest expense 
from the field costs for the full year. I take that into account when I talk 
about WarnerMedia generation. What you'll see though from us is a pay 
down of debt, reducing interest expense, offset by some of the spectrum 
that we've been capita
lizing interest on is now being put into service very 
quickly by our FirstNet network team. And so as we put that in the service 
we'll have more that go to expense, so those two will act to offset each other 
in some way.
 
We expect to have some higher cash 
taxes this year. As you know this past 
year because of tax reform and the impacts that were retroactive, we had 
very low if any tax payments this year, and so we'll see that go up. And then 
quite frankly as we were this year and as we were last year, the b
enefit plan 
funding is 
-
 
we've got no requirements for any benefit plan funding, pension 
or otherwise, we're very healthy in those, I think you can see that on our 
balance sheet. But we'll be strategic, we'll be targeted like we were at the 
end of this yea
r to take advantage of our strong cash position and to provide 
some messaging not only to our employees about how important it is and 
how we're going to stand by it, but also efficiency from a tax perspective and 
getting some tax actions and so forth.
 
So h
opefully I answered your question. I think you're probably focused on 

so a higher interest expense from that, lower interest expense as we pay 
down debt.
 
Taxes will be up from a 
low level this year. Full year Time Warner, no deal 
cost expected or something 
-
 
nothing of significance and then merger 
integration benefits offsetting are hoping to offset merger integration project 

ives you a way to build 
to 
-
 
that makes it easy to see the $26 billion is within our achievability 
range.
 
Michael Rollins
 
Thanks very much.
 
Michael Viola
 
Thanks, Mike. Next question Lea?
 
Operator
 
Is the line of Amy Yong with Macquarie. Please go ahead.
 
Amy Yong
 
Thanks and good morning. I just want on Warner. It seems like a lot of us 
look at the streaming landscape and it looks like it's getting a lot more 
competitive. You have NBC launching in 2020. How are you positioning 
Warner and the streaming servi
ces. And is the focus going to be on sub 
growth or ad advertising? I guess hand
-
in
-
hand with this question, how are 
you thinking about your content allocation decisions. How do you balance 
licensing revenue to someone like Netflix versus holding it back fo
r your own 
use? Thanks.
 
Randall Stephenson
 
Hi, Amy. This is Randall. We have really high expectations for our streaming 
service. We don't think there is going to be a proliferation of these that will 
succeed over time, but those who have very, very strong 
IP, deep libraries 
of IP are the ones that we think are going to succeed over time.
 
And so that's what we are focused on. We are strong believers and what 
John Stankey likes to call two sided business models, subscription 
commercial free elements, you know
, like HBO and like Netflix. You know, 
there's a demand and the customers have become accustomed to 
advertising free subscription services. And we think HBO and a lot of the 
Warner Brothers content that's really premium content will fit into that mold.
 
But
 
there are other elements where advertising supported models they are 
going to be important to keep prices down, to keep costs for the consumer 
down and actually fund additional content acquisition and purchasing. Xandr 
is a big part of making that model w
ork. So our model will be a two sided 
model, with a heavy subscription service, with some ad supported elements 
to it as well.
 
In terms of the decision making on what to do with premium content is, as 
content deals come up, there's not going to be a cookie
 
cutter approach to 
this Amy. I don't think all content is equal in that decision making process. 
You saw the some of the elements of Friends when the Friends rights came 
up from Netflix late last year, there was a situation where you ask yourself a 
questi
on, how important is it to have that content on an exclusive basis 
versus allowing others to license and using it?
 
And the decision on that is one that Kevin Tsujihara and John Stankey do a 
lot of analytics and thinking about. But that was one we said excl
usivity is 
probably not that critical on that type of content, but it's critical to have on 
our platform. So we did license it to Netflix as you saw, but on a non
-
exclusive basis. And so each of these decisions on significant content like 
that are going to
 
be evaluated in terms of how critical is it to our platform to 
have it as exclusive versus you know the economics of licensing it to others.
 
So more to come, but we actually do believe that having a 100 or call it a 90 
year inventory of incredible IP is a
 
really important thing and when you look 
out at the landscape in terms of what is being consumed on a lot of the 
other aggregators on streaming products, you would be surprised how much 
of that is Warner Brothers intellectual property. And so we're going 
to be 
making some decisions over the coming two, three years on which of that 
property be brought in and which to be sold on a not
-
exclusive basis.
 
Amy Yong
 

 
Michael Viola
 
Okay. Thanks for your question Amy. We will take one last question.
 
Operator
 
Ve

 
Walter Piecyk
 
Great. Thank you. You guys are putting in a lot of spectrum in the network 
which obviously is an improved performance. Last couple quarters your 
churn is been up a little bit, 
Verizon, obviously had decent gross ads. When 
do you think the impact of that additional spectrum will show up in some 
subscriber growth either in terms of gross adds or maybe lower churn?
 
Randall Stephenson
 
I think Walter you're going to see that as we ge
t into second and third 
quarter this year, as the broad base of our customers begin to experience 
and realize the effects of the spectrum being put in. And it's really going to 
be scaling as we get into second and third quarter of this year and it is going
 
to be a discernible difference from a customer experience standpoint as we 
turn it up and it's going to be a discernible difference for the customer 
without the customer having to change handsets. The lion share of our 
customers will just experienced this
 
as we turn it up.
 
And so as John Randall Stephenson just pointed out, we're deploying 
FirstNet across the country, as we deploy FirstNet we turn all this spectrum 
up so that FirstNet becomes a driver for our overall customer base 
experiencing this benefit
.
 
And so we have a lot of conviction that this is going to be a step change 
improvement. Our customers will experience it and it's going to be a 
significant help in terms of driving churn down. Add to that, as the FirstNet 
deployment happens, as we're gett
ing this kind of performance, we have 
some fairly strong expectations on customer adds from FirstNet.
 
So the gross ad engine if you will, the customer ad engine we think FirstNet 
is going to be a significant driver of customer additions as we move into 
sec
ond third and fourth quarter of this year. So we have some high 
expectations of what we're doing on the network that this is 
-
 
this is 
important, it's unique, it's differentiated and it's going to drive serious 
customer impacts as we get into the year.
 
Wal
ter Piecyk
 
Thanks for that color on timing. Also just a second question, I want to go 
back to the Investor Day, on the Entertainment Group, you had that nice 
slide that showed you 
-
 
showed how you're going to stabilize EBITDA 10 
billion, one of the things 
at the bottom with the video services going to 

-
 


$10 billion target and because giving kind of a sub 
losses this quarter and 
kind of what you're talking about as far as the impact of promotions it seems 
like that might be challenging to hit. So is it really necessary to hit $25 
million subs in order to generate $10 billion of EBITDA on the Entertainment 
G
roup?
 
Randall Stephenson
 
Yes. If I could bring some clarity to that Walter and that is a big part of that 
$25 million was WatchTV, which is our very low
-
end content offering for our 
mobile subscribers and that's a very low ARPU product, but it's a profitab
le 
product and it's one that we expect there will be a lot of those added during 
the course of the year.
 
There are 500,000 of those accounts established right now. We're not yet 
calling them subscribers till we see behaviorally how they engage with the 
pro
duct and what kind of profitability we have. But that is a significant part 
of the $25 million. We do expect some continued obviously losses on the 
linear video. We talked about that. And we will achieve EBITDA stability even 
with the continued attrition o
f our traditional linear video subscribers. Does 
that help?
 
Walter Piecyk
 
It does. Thank you very much.
 
Randall Stephenson
 

was a solid year. It was basically doing what we told you we were going to 
do at the analyst conference. And as I mentioned at the outset, I feel like we 
can check the box, we are d
oing exactly what we said. We feel very good 
about getting to 2019 and stabilizing enterprise Entertainment Group 
EBITDA margins. We feel really good about the wireless business. It's a year 
of execution, delivering on cash flow and delivering on debt pay 
down and 
delivering returns of capital to our shareholders. So we thank you for joining 
us and look forward to speaking with you later. Thanks a lot.

-
answer session, 
instructions will be given at that time (Operator 
Instructions).And I would now like to turn the conference call over to our

Please go ahead sir.
 
Michael Viola
 
Thank you, Lorry a
nd good afternoon everyone. Welcome to our fourth 



f Executive Officer 
and John Stephens, Chief Financial Officer. Randall will provide some 
opening comments then close with 2015 guidance, John will cover our 

 
Let me remind you our earnings material is availabl
e on the Investor 
Relations page of the AT&T website. Please call your attention to our Safe 
Harbor statement before we begin which says that some of our comments 
today maybe forward
-
looking. As such they are subject to risks and 
uncertainties, actual resu
lts may differ materially. And additional information 
is available on our Forms 8
-
K, other SEC filings and on the investor relations 

quite period for FCC Spectrum Auction 97 or the 
AWS
-
3 Auction so we 
cannot address any questions about Spectrum today. So with that overview, 
I will now turn the call over to AT&Ts Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, 
Randall Stephenson. Randall?
 
Randall Stephenson
 
Hey Mike. Thanks and good afternoon. 
Fighting cold around here Lorry may 
end up having to handle this call for us. But before John takes you through 
the results I want to take just take a couple of minutes and frame where we 
are. 2012 to 2014 was a really period of unprecedented investment fo
r AT&T 
and for the industry for that matter. And during this period we built our LTE 
network to cover more than 300 million people, we expanded our U
-
verse 
broadband footprint to 57 million customer locations and we deployed fiber 
to 725,000 business locat
ions. And at the same time we reengineered our 
mobile network and we now deliver the strongest LTE signal in the U.S.
 
Now at the same time we've been aggressively repositioning our wireless 
customer base. We're giving our customers now a choice of moving a
way 
from heavy handset subsidies in exchange for lower monthly prices. And as 
a result our customer satisfaction continues to climb and defections continue 
to fall and you can see that by our record low annual postpaid churn rate. 
And we also delivered our
 
best ever full year adjusted EBITDA service 
margins. We've also made a significant investment to migrate our wireline 
customer bases to the new platforms. At the end of 2014 76% of our 
broadband customers were on our fastest IP based platforms and our 
str
ategic IP based business services now represent a $10 billion annualized 
revenue stream and it's growing 14% when you adjust it for the Kinetica 
sale.
 
And that brings us to 2015, because with these foundational investments 
largely behind us and several str
ategic investments announced to
-
date the 
ground work's now being laid for 2015 and beyond. And today our 
customers are expecting us to deliver video across all of our platforms 
whether it's traditional linear video or over the top on U
-
verse broadband or 
v
ideo to the mobile device. So we've been assembling the pieces that we 
need to do exactly that. DIRECTV quickly and significantly shores up the 
economics of our U
-
verse video product and it brings us the best content 
relationships in the industry.
 
Our fixe
d broadband footprint will quickly begin expanding to 70 million 
customer locations in the U.S. when we complete the DIRECTV transaction. 

strengthen our spectrum portfolio which is a 
prerequisite for in the mobile 
video delivery business. We also laid the ground word for expanding these 
capabilities outside the U.S. We've always believed the demand for the 
mobile internet and economic benefit experienced in the U.S. would be 
repeated t
hroughout the world. And so with that we have been looking for 
opportunities to gain a wireless foothold in key market for the regulatory in 
the investment climate is right.
 

ch
anges in the Mexican legal and regulatory framework make it attractive for 
a new entrant to invest and we close on use of sale and then once we 
complete Next sale we will have a very deep spectrum portfolio and this is 
the first element needed for a robust
 
mobile internet offering.
 
We will now have the ability to expand our U.S. network directly into Mexico 
building one seamless network that's spanning 400 million people. And 

AT&T 
or Mexican consumers we will be the only company with mobile 

brings the premier video business in Latin America.
 
So the bi
-
product of this is represented on Slide 5, you go 12 months no
w 

diversified. The way we integrate our products and services will be different. 
And when in 2015 post DIRECTV our revenues will come from four areas, 
our largest will be business solutio
ns, that includes both fixed and wireless 
services and is growing nicely in fact in the fourth quarter that area is 
growing nearly 6%. The next area will be our consumer TV and broadband 
business, then third will be our consumer mobility business, then obv
iously 
our Latin American businesses where satellite TV and then the Mexican 
mobility businesses will be our fastest growing area. And we like this mix a 
lot, and by the end of the year we are going to be uniquely positioned in a 
world of high
-
speed connec
tivity dominated by video and is going to be a 
very different business.
 
So, with that I am going to turn it over to you John to go through 2014.
 
John Stephens
 
Thank you Ran and hello everyone. Let me start with our consolidated 
financial summary which is o
n Slide 6. We finished the year strong with solid 
revenue and EPS growth in the fourth quarter. Consolidated revenues grew 
to more than $34 billion up 4.5% when you adjust for the sale of our sale of 
our Connecticut properties. This was driven by strong wi
reless growth as we 
continue to reposition our business model and adjusted revenue growth in 
wireline, thanks to gains in the Strategic Business Services and U
-
verse.
 
For the full year we saw adjusted consolidated revenue grow by more than 
3%. This helped 
drive strong EPS growth. Reported EPS for the quarter was 
a loss of $0.77 however when you exclude the significant items we disclosed 

year
-
ago. And if you consider that last year i
ncluded about $0.02 of equity 
income from our divested America Movil interest, that percentage would be 
closer to 8%. Adjusted EPS was up slightly for the year even after a $0.06 
impact from the sale of our America Movil investment.
 
These adjustments inclu
de $0.94 of non
-
cash pressure from the year
-
end 
mark
-
to
-
market charge for our benefit plans. This was almost a reverse of 
last year when we had a strong mark
-
to
-
market gain. The actuarial loss was 
largely driven by a decrease in the discount rate but was p
artially offset by 
strong performance of our benefit plan investments. We also had a $0.25 
non
-
cash pressure from the write
-
off of certain network assets which we told 
you about earlier this month. And we had $0.13 of cost associated with 
wireless integrat
ion, DIRECTV transaction cost and the loss on the sale of 
the Connecticut properties.
 


and see h

been almost a year since we first introduced our Mobile Share Value plans 
and began to accelerate the move of our smartphone base off the subsidy 
model to AT&T Next.
 
Since that time the resul
ts have been dramatic. First, we've had nearly 3.3 
million postpaid net adds, thanks to strong growth of phones and tablets. 

700,000 postpaid phone net adds during the year. These po
stpaid gains 
along with an end of year surge of connected device subscribers, thanks 
mainly to the connected car, helped to drive 5.6 million total net adds. Our 
strongest growth in three years. Just as impressive, we added nearly 5 
million new smartphone 
subscribers during the year. These high value high 
quality customers have an ARPU of about twice that of non
-
smartphone 
subscribers.
 

remarkable achievement anytime, but even more so 
when you consider the 
intense competitive environment we face during the year.
 
We also had our best ever full year adjusted EBITDA service margins. We 
achieved that even with record full year smartphone sales. This is the impact 
of AT&T Next. Already more 
than a quarter of our postpaid smartphone base 
are on equipment installment plans and more than half of our smartphone 
base has moved off the subsidy model pricing. These are the long
-
term 
results we have talked with you about throughout 2014. A reposition
ing of 
the smartphone base is working with nearly 70% of our postpaid base now 
on mobile share plans.
 

net adds where we had another strong quarter. We added nearly 2 million 
tot
al subscribers led by postpaid and connected devices. We added more 
than 850,000 postpaid subscribers thanks to strong growth of tablets. These 
tablet gains more than offset a slight decline of feature phone subscribers, 
but we also grew high quality postp
aid smartphone base by another million 

in our net add number. Connected devices also continued their strong 
growth as the Internet things begins to evolve. Nearly 1.3 million conn
ected 
devices were added in the quarter including 800,000 connected cars.
 
Prepaid showed a loss in the fourth quarter however the Cricket brand is 
showing momentum with positive net adds after losing customers in the pre
-
acquisition a year
-
ago fourth quart
er. The Cricket integration is going 

three quarters of the customer base has transitioned to the AT&T network. 

that 
in our results. We had record smartphone postpaid gross adds and 
upgrades, with more than 10 million smartphones sold in the quarter. That 
includes record total upgrades, those customers choosing to stay with AT&T 
and commit to new device plans. Our u
pgrade rate exceeded 11% in the 
quarter. Smartphones were 94% of all postpaid phone sales, another record 
for us in the quarter.
 
As expected, postpaid churn was up in the quarter. The fourth quarter 
traditionally sees increased levels of churn for all carr
iers. And when you add 

churn at these levels. But even with all this noise in the market, postpaid 
churn levels were comparable to two years ago, the last time a fully 
refreshed iP
hone hit the market. And this was the first time that all major 
carriers were able to sell that phone during the busy fourth quarter.
 

nearly 8% as the revenue mix shift we have seen t
hroughout the year 
continue to play out in the fourth quarter. Equipment revenue growth tapped 
70% with strong AT&T Next sales. Service revenues were pressured as 
customers continue to sign up for Mobile Share Value plans and move away 
from the traditional
 
subsidy model.
 
We now have more than 18 million smart Mobile Share accounts covering 
nearly 70% of our postpaid subscribers and about 58% of our postpaid 
smartphone base is on no subsidy pricing. Mobile Share customers continue 
to buy up to larger buckets
 
of data. Half of our accounts are on the plans of 

a move to even bigger larger data plans, nearly 20% are on plans of 15 gigs 

helped drive an 18% 
increase in data billings.
 
The take rate for AT&T Next increased to 58% in the fourth quarter or about 
5.9 million new Next customers. This impacted cash flows, but we consider 
this an investment in a great customer base that we are mor
e than willing to 
make. We also had about 400,000 customers who bring their own devices 
onto our network.
 
The next take rate was a step
-
up from prior quarters, while we continue to 
see strong customer response at our company owned stores and agents with 
a Next take rate of about 90% of upgrades, the take rate for Next to our 
other retailers was much less. The 
strong holiday sales played a role here. 
We typically have a higher percentage of our sales with other retailers in the 
fourth quarter. These stores are still becoming familiar with Next plans and 
our sales show that, plus with a rush of the holiday season
, sales personnel 

to close the Next transaction. We will continue to work with these stores and 
expect the take rate at those locations to pick up in the future.
 
As expected the st
rong Next take rate helped drive the second consecutive 
quarter of sequential ARPU growth when you factor in Next billings. When 
you add in Next billings you get a more accurate idea of what an average 
customer pays us every month. Our average monthly Next
 
billings were up 
about $28 per month even with the introduction of the Next 24
-
month plan. 
As the Next pace grows so does the impact of billings nearly 27% of our 
smartphone base is now on AT&T Next.
 
Now let`s move to our wireline operations on slide 10. 
The transformation of 
our wireline networks IP technology has helped drive year
-
over
-
year wireline 
revenue growth. We say it again has helped drive year
-
over
-
year wireline 
revenue growth when you adjust for the sale of our Kinetica operations. 
We're really
 
seeing the overall revenue impact of the strategic business 
services and the U
-
verse.
 
Total adjusted U
-
verse revenues increased by more than 20% and are now 
about two
-
thirds of consumer revenues. And strategic business service 
revenues grew by more than 1
4% and are now 30% of total wireline 
business revenues. Growth looks even stronger when you adjust out the 
impact of foreign exchange. Overall adjusted wireline consumer revenue 
increased 2.4%, adjusted wireline business revenues were down 1.8%. 
However if
 
you adjust for the effect of discontinued Global Hubbing 
businesses and foreign exchange that decline would have been just about a 
0.5%.
 
We're still dealing with the impacts of an uneven economy. But enterprise 
revenues were up slightly. However the lack 
of new business formations 
continue to pressure small businesses. Wholesale also saw pressure in the 
quarter in part due to our focus on profitable sales. These results helped 
drive a sequential improvement in wireline margins which were up 120 basis 
point
s over the third quarter of 2014. That's a reversal of trends in recent 
years when we had seen sequential declines between the third and fourth 
quarter.
 
U
-
verse subscribers also grew in the quarter. We added more than 400,000 
high speed broadband subscribe
rs and now added 2.1 million for the full 
year. We finished the year with 12.2 million high speed broadband 
subscribers or more than three quarters of our broadband base. The 
transformation to IP broadband is a remarkable accomplishment for entire 
wireline
 
team. U
-
verse CD subscriber net adds came in at 73,000. Net adds 
were impacted by a strategic move to improve the profitability of our 
wireline consumer business. With our high content costs we targeted 
profitable, long
-
term value subscribers with lower c
hurn rates while still 
taking market share.
 
Now let's take a look at margins on slide 11. We will start with our wireless 
margins. Wireless margins were pressured by strong smartphone gross adds 
and upgrades, investment related expenses and wireless integr
ation costs. 
We mentioned earlier that we had our best ever full year adjusted service 
margins even with record sales thanks to AT&T Next. We also see the impact 
of Next on our quarterly results. Our wireless EBITDA service margin was 
down slightly when co
mpared to a year ago. The fourth quarter of 2014 saw 
2.6 million more smartphone sales than in the previous year. And if you 
compare the results to two years ago when smartphone sales were 
comparable service margins improved over 700 basis points.
 
Wireline
 
margins improved from a year ago. Wireline margins usually are flat 
or down between the third and fourth quarter but that trend changed last 
quarter. There was pressure from investment expenses and content cost but 
this was offset by growth in wireline re
venues and solid execution on cost 
initiatives. For the quarter our adjusted consolidated margins were 14.2% 
compared to 15.5% a year ago quarter and just under 13% two years ago. 
Strong smartphone sales also pressured consolidated margins but our 
continue
d efforts for cost efficiency helped offset some of that pressure.
 
Now let's move to cash flow [indiscernible] on slide 12. For 2014 cash from 
operations totaled $31.3 billion and $5.7 billion for the quarter. Capital 
expenditures were $21.4 billion and $4
.4 billion for the quarter and free cash 
flow before dividends was $9.9 billion and $1.3 billion for the quarter. Free 
cash flow was impacted by the nearly 6 million AT&T Next sales in the fourth 
quarter. We pay upfront for those devices while our customer
s pay us back 
overtime. The record upgrades and strong iPhone sales with a higher sales 
price mix made an impact as well.
 
This speaks to our willingness to invest in our premium smartphone 
customer base. We aren't going to turn away good business to manage
 
to a 
cash flow number. We have the financial strength to finance devices for our 
best customers, we have the lowest churn and higher ARPU and that is our 
focus.
 
At the same time our Next receivables significantly increased while our bad 
debt ratios stayed
 
at traditionally low levels. These are high quality 
receivables we did monetize 1.2 billion of the Next receivables in the quarter 
as there continues to be great interest for financial institutions and we do 
expect future sales of those receivables.
 
Also 
in the fourth quarter we sold our Connecticut wireline operations to 
Frontier for $2 billion. Our asset sales strengthened our balance sheet and 
cash position. In fact we had more than $10 billion in cash and short
-
term 
investments on hand at the end of 20
14. We had more than 3 billion in 
combined free cash flow and asset sales during the fourth quarter with $18 
billion for the full year.
 
In terms of usage of cash dividends sold of 9.6 billion for the year and we 
continue to have one of the strongest yields
 
around. We also announced the 
dividend increase last month. This is the 31st consecutive year that we have 
increased the dividend that puts us on a small and select group of 
companies. That should give you a good idea of how we look at our 
dividend, sayin
g that dividend is important to us is another statement we 
consider the very important aspect of our shareholder return and are 
committed to it.
 
At the same time we maintain the best credit ratings in the industry. Net 
debt to adjusted
-
EBITDA was at 1.75. 
And as we told you at the end of the 
last year the company will continue to focus on maintaining a strong balance 
sheet, but I suspect that with pending investments in the near
-
term we may 
go over our 1.8 times net debt to EBITDA target. Also as we told yo
u earlier, 
after we closed the DIRECTV transaction our focus with free cash flow after 

2014 I would now like to turn it back to Randall to talk about our 2015 
outlook.
 
Randall St
ephenson
 
Okay, thanks John. We are going to provide more definitive 2015 guidance 
after we closed the DIRECTV transaction and we do expect that to happen in 
the first half of this year. Let me frame for you what you can expect from us 
this year, and I am g
oing to start by talking about AT&T on a standalone 
basis, that is before our Mexico and DIRECTV acquisitions. What we expect 
to deliver is continued consolidated revenue growth, our adjusted
-
EPS 
growth will be in the low single
-
digit range. We will have e
xpanding margins, 
consolidated wireless and wireline margins. We will also have improving free 
cash flow and improving dividend coverage.
 
I think capital expenditures will be in the $18 billion range, the same as we 

mpletion of a lot of the Project VIP 
initiatives. Now if we include Mexico and DIRECTV, the first thing I would 
want to note is that, we now expect to achieve ever higher multiyear 
synergies than we had communicated and anticipated we announced the 
DIRECTV
 
deal. And so when you add Mexico and DIRECTV we anticipate no 
delusion to our adjusted
-
EPS, meaning our adjusted
-
EPS growth including 
Mexico and DIRECTV will be in the low single
-
digit range. We would like to 
2015 a very different company. We'll be a comp
any with the ability to 
deliver video to any device. We'll have a unique capability to integrate 
solutions across the diversified base of customers, geographies and 
technology platforms that are mobile, fast and highly secure and we will 
have a path to pro
fitable TV growth. And we'll have a nice set of growing 
Latin American businesses positioned well in video and the mobile internet.
 

about the opportunities that are ahead here for us. 
And so with that Lorrie I 
think we are ready to take questions.

[Operator Instructions]. Our first question from John Hodulik with UBS. 
Please go ahead.
 
John Hodulik
 
Couple of strategic questions for Randall if I could.
 

able to put together a Mexican strategy at a very reasonable cost. Is that 
how we should expect in terms of Mexico given the expectation that AMX is 
going to spitting off a large piece of their business over the next year or so. 
And then if you could expand that you also have a large footprint now in 
South America, especially Brazil, what are your thoughts on that market? 
And then maybe the same for Canada, you talked in a recent release about a 
North American calling market. If y
ou could comment on your view on the 
attractiveness of those markets, that would be great.
 
Randall Stephenson
 
Sure John, thanks. I will start with your question on Mexico. And the 
American Movil asset sale has been one of those things floating out there, 
n

wanted to move into Mexico there were a couple of really unique 
opportunities in front of us. And just to try to flush out what was going to be 
required by American Movil to sell their
 
assets seemed like an uncertain 
process. So we pursued use to sell and then with the Nextel Mexico assets 
what we have here is a set of assets, a spectrum portfolio that is really a 
robust spectrum portfolio, a nice cell site grid that will be a very nice
 
place 
to start in a nice customer base. And so we have the makings for what we 
need for a very viable and strong Mexico strategy, where our America Movil 

would get us into Mexi
co and get us a platform that would sustain itself. And 
we like these assets. We think these assets are more than sufficient to 
compete in Mexico and to go and compete aggressively and take share, so 

 
On South America a

there is the best pay

done a very nice job of assembling some nice spectru
m in various Latin 

broadband, so there are number of markets where they have line of sight 
and the ability to bundle broadband with the TV product and their brand is 
strong enough that
 
where they do that they have really

really good success. 



xcited about getting it.
 
On Canada, I think right now we have about as much as we as a company 


approved and t

to get busy on and then obviously building out Mexico is going to be a full

date.
 
Operator
 
We got to Mike McCormack with Jefferies. Please go ahead.
 
Mike McCormack
 
Randall, I guess just following on, you started off the conversation with the 
discussion around 
revenue diversification. What is your thought, just as you 
look at the US wireless landscape into 2015, with respect to how bad can it 
get from here, with respect to pricing and promotion. From AT&T's 
standpoint, is share loss okay? Are you willing to acce
pt sort of lower
-
end 
share loss? And then maybe one for John, just thinking about free cash flow 
into 2015, if we ex
-
out DTV and the acquisitions, just if you could frame out 
the moving parts there to give us a little more comfort on the dividend 
payout. A
nd also maybe just a comment on whether or not you have talked 
to ratings agencies about the appetite for how high leverage could go?
 
Randall Stephenson
 

some aggressive pricing in t
he marketplace, but John I thought did a nice 
job of giving a good basis of compare to 2012. And so fourth quarter 2012, 
there were three competitors with an iPhone in the marketplace that was the 
last time there was a major iPhone launch. And our churn ra
te this quarter 
was very comparable to what it was in 2012 and this quarter there were 
everybody in the market had an iPhone and so the churn rates in the fourth 
quarter relative to what we've seen in the past were fairly consistent. When 
you look at the c
hurn rates for the year in light of what I think was a very 
robust pricing environment we had our lowest churn rates ever.
 


our customer 
base with smartphones. We added a million in the fourth quarter by itself. 


our segmentation 
--
 
o
f what our business segments will look like as we move 

segment with our wireless products and bundling that with VPN solutions or 
security solutions. And as I mentioned in the openin
g, that when you put 


growing 5.8% in the fourth quarter. That business segment 
--
 
that segment 
of custo
mers churns lower than any other segment in the marketplace. It is 

product sets, if you have a very
-
very nice business that grows very nicely 


focused on the high end customer base.
 

feature phones. We churn feature phones much higher than our traditional 

et serves the purpose to do is to 
help us address that into the market with a very robust and aggressive 

getting to the transition and it is now growing our prepaid base is growing 
that 


to with Cricket and as you noticed in the last week we've announced that 
pre
-
unlimited calling from the U.S t
o Mexico and you will see more and more 
of those offers materialize going the other way as we build out the Mexican 
footprint and the Mexican network.
 
John Stephens
 
So, Mike this is John and with regard to free cash flow let me frame it up this 
way. As you
 
know we've announced 
--
 
we're committed to do about an $18 
billion range for CapEx that's about a $3.5 billion reduction in the CapEx or 
improvement in free cash flow, that's step one.
 
Step two is with all our free cash flow 
--
 
with all our CapEx spending
 
and 
investment there comes some trailing expense. With a reduction in our 
CapEx we'll see a reduction to that trailing expense that will not only help us 
with margins but will also help us with free cash flow. So those are two 
major steps.
 
The third one i
s we have invested significantly in our customer base with 
regard to Next. High quality receivables, the banks continue to be interested 
in them but we have a portfolio of those that we will be able securitize this 
year and we will see some turnaround and 
payback of cash for those that we 
haven't securitized, so we're optimistic about that.
 
That will be pressured, those things will be pressured by the continued 
success of Next, so we may reinvest some of those Next dollars that we 
[indiscernible] this year,
 
we may reinvest in our customer base, we will 
make those judgments as we go. And then we will see some increase in 
taxes but not significant but we will likely see some increases in taxes. With 
all of that being said we're very comfortable about the incre
asing free cash 
flow and improving dividend coverage guidance that Randall mentioned.
 
We carefully talked to the credit rating agencies, work with them on our 
plans and try to be transparent with what we have going on. I would expect 
we will see some 
--
 
th
ey have made some announcements on their own and 
I am sure they will make their decisions as we kind of go through the rest of 
this year and the final VTV integration plans that we have they will come out 
and make their viewpoint shown. But those 
--
 
and I 
would tell you those 
conversations have been productive and constructive but they are well 
understanding our strategies and our approach.
 
Mike McCormack
 
John, I guess without the crystal ball, but thinking about the phone on the 
ARPU level, is there a leve
l of penetration of the value plans inside your base 
where we should start to see that more stable? I know in the past, you 
talked about maybe stability as we get into 2015 on various moving parts. 
But I guess just isolating phone
-
only ARPU, getting a sens
e for when that 
might be more stable?
 
John Stephens
 
Yes, so Mike as you know on the phone
-
only ARPU when I think about that I 
think a phone
-
only ARPU plus our Next billings and if you look at that then 
sequentially they grew. And the difference between the
 
historical service 
ARPUs and the service ARPUs plus Next billings that gap has been closing. 
You guys can figure out the math but quite correctly when you sell almost 6 
million phones in the fourth quarter on Next and you start billing those for 
the entir
e first quarter and throughout next year on a $28 or $30 a month 
basis you can understand our optimism about improving ARPU's as we define 
those and remember we are fine that way because that's what the customer 
is paying in cash every month.
 
So we feel re
al good about where we're going and the where the process is, 
we're not predicting or giving a guidance with regard to when ARPU plus 
Next billings will be greater than they were in the prior year quarter. But we 
look forward to getting through this year a
nd continuing the progress 
especially after having a fourth quarter where the sales team did an 
outstanding job of adding almost 6 million customers to the Next program.
 
Operator
 
Next we will go to Phil Cusick with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
 
Phil Cusick
 
I 
guess the couple of things I want to hit 
--
 
one, if you could just clarify 
guidance. Is guidance to revenue and EPS growth, really just if we pull 
Connecticut out 2014, and, if so, what are the base revenue and EPS 
numbers?
 
John Stephens
 
Yes. Maybe 
--
 
we'l
l pull out Connecticut as you said we're not giving detailed 
analysis of the product line or sub products but your assumption Phil that it 
is without Connecticut is correct that is the base line.
 
Phil Cusick
 
Okay. Thanks, John. And then second, if you coul
d talk about Next, 58% in 
the fourth quarter. What's going on in distribution? Are you going to expand 
that further? And do you expect a working capital drag in 2015 to be larger 
or smaller than 2014?
 
John Stephens
 
Yes. So the Next sales go like this, in o
ur company owned stores, in 
authorizations great performance more than 80% nearly 90% as we 
mentioned, great take rate in a busy fourth quarter. Quite frankly on the 
large national retailers and the manufacturer owns retail stores the take 
rates were small
er but in the fourth quarter they had a lot of activity for us, 
they sell a lot of our phones, a higher proportion of fourth quarter because 
of the holiday season than any other quarter. And so we're optimistic about 
Next take rates increasing overall thro
ugh the year and we're also optimistic 
about working with the national retailers and the other retailers to provide 
them additional support on how to sell Next and how it works.
 
So we're still real positive about Next and believe that we will get the 
number of customers on the non
-
subsidy plans in line with the number of 
customers on Next plus bring our own device. So we are really moving 

-
term and short
-
term. With regard to the 
--
 
if free c
ash flow impacts will have the flexibility 
to monetize, we expect to have the flexibility to continue to monetize large 
blocks in these securitizations, it's worked very well. The banks continue to 
have very much interest. And as we stated before we want t
o continue a 
regular pattern of doing this so that we build the history for this out the 
--
 
that will keep us with flexibility and financing going forward. I would suggest 
you that the activities we have going on now are not intended to be looked 
at to gen
erate cash flow in out of them in, in out of the sales to pump up 

management process throughout the year, we'll have flexibility to push 
forward or pull back to depending upon continued
 
interest rates, continued 
attractiveness from the banks, and so forth, but so far the process has gone 
extremely well. We have been very pleased with not only the demand but 
also the financial terms.
 
Randall Stephenson
 
We'll continue to be confident this 
Next take rate [indiscernible] as John said 

learning how to sell this and the mechanics and the process for doing a 
handset financing program. We then moved it into our agent channe
l which 
is a very extensive agent channel. In the beginning it was not very 
impressive and the agent channel is now beginning to perform at levels that 
look like our retail channel. And so then you move into the big box retailers, 
it will follow a similar 
curve. And we come to the holiday season and John 
mentioned it then they are pushing volumes and this takes a little bit more 

just going to be a learning curve, and we are going t
o stay patient but we 
actually feel very good that the numbers continue to move in the positive 
direction.
 
Operator
 
Thanks we go to Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
 
Simon Flannery
 
Randall, you talked a little bit about DIRECTV. Could yo
u just give us a little 
bit more insight into the deal process? The 180
-
day clock expires in March. I 
think you referred to a first
-
half close, so how that's going? And any updates 
on the synergies? I think you talked about higher numbers. Is that content 
synergies? Is that more bundling synergies? Is that something that's going 
to come in early on, versus later? And I think you also talked about video to 
any device. I know Verizon has talked about an over
-
the
-
top rollout in mid
-
year. So is this something t
hat you are going to have a similar type offering 
this year? And is that contingent on the DIRECTV close? Thanks.
 
Randall Stephenson
 
First of all deal process, you nailed when the 180 day clock is running again, 
but obviously there is a legal challenge goi
ng on between the content 

right now. We are hopeful that the two parties the FCC and content folks can 

d
o here soon that will help to determine the pace in which that progresses. 
But even with that Simon, we are still fairly confident this thing gets done 

issue. And so this issu
e would be the only issue that will cause a delay of the 
180 day clock to our knowledge right now.
 
As it relates to the synergies, it's a fairly predictable formula with us and we 
do these large scale deals and when we are doing the deals we tend to be 
fai
rly conservative. And we have obviously have begun with the DIRECTV 
management team some forward discussions and getting to a level of detail 

we are starting to see details on th
e channels and then channel costs and so 
forth. And as a result as you start drilling down through it, it's fairly much 
across the board we are seeing better opportunities and what we baked into 

 
pretty 
confident that we will exceed the merger synergies that we announced at 
the time that we did the deal.
 
And across the board there are looking good. There are even revenue 
synergies, when you have 20 million DIRECTV customers that are very, very

end customers and see what the wireless penetration rate that we have 
in that customer base it looks really good. The opportunity to be able to sell 
mobility into those channels and so forth. So across the Board cost 
synergies, a few revenue synergies, i

anticipated when we announced the deal.
 
And then in terms of video to any device, this is one of the key opportunities 
that we were pursuing. When we did this deal our customers are demanding 
video to be delivered acro
ss any device. And so one of the primary 
objectives we will have coming out of the close of the deal is taking 
advantage of the [content] [ph] relationships that DIRECTV has and our 
wireless customer base, we envision customers being able to walk out of ou
r 
stores with content available to them on devices that they have purchased in 
our store. You are familiar with the order deal that we have done with the 
Chernin Group, where we are developing over the top content with them and 
taking advantage of ways of 
delivering that to our customers as well, so it's 
going to be a multi
-
faceted approach in terms of how we bring video to our 

-
ups that 

 
both tablet as well 
as handsets as well as our broadband customer base 16 million broadband 

priority for us is getting the content delivered to the mobile handsets and 
tablets.

on questions, if I could. John, if there was an attractive 
opportunity in Latin America, maybe something sizable like America Movil is 
expected to be,
 
given your funding requirements over the next few years, do 
you think a transaction like that 
--
 
you could do a transaction like that and 
stay within a comfortable leverage range? Or should we expect some equity 
component for a sizable transaction? And th
en, Randall, part of the strategy 
of allowing the base to move to new pricing, with the help on the churn side, 
and while we saw the benefits of that over the prior two quarters, we did see 
churn return to a level similar to two years ago, as you pointed o
ut. Are you 
comfortable with the current pricing strategy in place right now? And do you 
think this fourth quarter was more of a one
-
time
-
ish in nature, or should we 
expect churn to remain at elevated levels as we move throughout 2015?

Maybe first one, just Randall, obviously your vie
ws have been expressed on 
this Title II as a way to get to the net neutrality issue. But I guess from the 
investment community standpoint, are you of the view that there is going to 
be really anything different about the business, in terms of the business 
you 
do, or how you do it? Or are the investments you are making kind of on a 
middle
-
 
to long
-
term basis? If you could kind of talk us through the 
investment side of that equation. And then, John, just a question on the 
write
-
down of the copper plant. Could
 
you talk a little bit about what that 
was, where it was, and what kind of expectations we have for that going 
forward? Thanks.
 
John Donovan
 

We went through a study and in our b
usiness there is active payers that are 
copper payers that are connected to customers and serving customers. 

working condition and available to be used if needed. And then there are 
what we would consider dead payers or payers that need significant repair 
work that are not connected to any customers, they need significant repair 
work and investment to make functional.
 
We did a detailed study across our network by our network engineers
 
in 
conjunction with that, identified marked and made the decision to abandon 
those ineffective payers or what we would 
--
 
what the [indiscernible] dead 
payers. We have plenty of capacity to serve our customers with our active 
payers and spare payers, so w

how we went through the process it was a very extensive process that was a 

-
offs 
like this we're not aware of any and we just felt it was ap
propriate to 
recognize this fact anybody has found our business has seen the change in 
our access line customer base over the last five or six years could 
understand that we would have peers that would be inactive and in this case 
ones that were not econom
ical to activate not to mention the fact there is 
not demand for us to make that [indiscernible]. So that's the background on 
just across our traditional wireline footprint.
 
Randall Stephenson
 
A favorite topic title 2.
 
David Barden
 
Sorry Randall.
 
Randall Stephenson
 
Look I will address it from a couple of perspectives. First net neutrality, what 
this debate started out as to be pursuing was how do we protect net 
neutrality, a neutral internet. And I would tell you I am not 
--
 
I don't know if 
anybody
 
in the industry who really argues that we shouldn't have net 
neutrality and indeed the President laid out four principals for what that 
meant. And we look at those four principals and said we're okay with those.
 
Those four principals is what resulted from
 
all of this was the FCC were given 
authority to enforce those four principals, it has no bearing or impact on our 
investment decisions none whatsoever. What causes us pause is if the way 
you effect those four principals is by categorizing the internet and
 
wireless 
services as title 2 communication services that's a different deal, alright and 
that's something we have to say what does that mean and whether the 
implications of categorizing these services as title 2 services to our industry.
 
And the example I
 
give is we're right now trying to obsolete our old legacy 
telephone services moving to IP or to all wireless and there is a very specific 
process one has to go through to obsolete those services and replace them 
with the new advanced services. And we're w
orking through that with the 
FCC, it's a very collaborative process it works but it takes a lot of time to 
make that happen. And we think that we might be able to get to a point 
where we can obsolete these services or begin replacing them with the new 
serv
ices by 2020 that's an aggressive time line.
 
The idea of beginning to put our wireless services and our broadband 
products under those categories and subjecting ourselves to that kind of 
regulatory oversight is what causes us pause and when we say we are 
p
ausing investment till we understand where this is going, that's what we're 
referring to.
 
Now Chairman Wheeler can find some creative solution, categorizing these 
as title 2 but doesn't cause the industry to slowdown, doesn't cause 
investment cycles to slo
wdown, does not cause innovation cycles to 
slowdown. It will give us some confidence and relief to continue investing at 
the same pace we have. But till we have kind of have clarity we're saying 
we're just on any new investments we're in a bit of a pause m
ode but it's 
really up in the air right now.
 
There are a lot of ways of getting what the President has articulated he 
wanted to accomplish. One of them is the Congress is working on it and that 
is that the Congress would pass legislation that would give th
e SEC the 
authority to enforce the four principals that the President articulated were 
important. That works to us, that puts us very similar to where we are today 
and probably doesn't change our investment thesis for anything we're trying 
to do.
 
But these
 
really strident heavy handed regulations on wireless and 
broadband if we go down that path that's what causes everybody some 
apprehension and uncertainty and begins to change investment thesis and 
so forth. So it's up in the air, right now we're just anxi
ous to see when the 
SEC comes out, so we now begin to formulate our plans.

And we will go to Amir Rozwadowski with Barclays. Please go ahead.
 
Amir Rozwadowski
 
I was wondering if we could chat briefly about your commentary that post 
the completion 
of some of your pending acquisitions, and some other 
initiatives that seem to be on the table, your debt coverage ratio may go 
over that sort of 1.8 times level. Could you perhaps give us a sense on 
where that could go? And, perhaps, what is your priority 
maintaining your 
near
-
term credit rating? It sounds like discussions with credit rating agencies 
have been constructive. But I was hoping to get some clarification, if 
possible.
 
John Stephens
 
I will take that if you look at the Direct TV transaction based 
on some of the 
most recent published financials you will know that there is a cash fees in 
that transaction that would approximate about 15 billion and I think if you 
go back to the last financial statement their gross debt level could be at $18 
billion to
 
$20 billion level that would be the debt we would be adding on as 
well as any impacts from closing Nextel and [indiscernible] as compared to 
our first quarter.
 
And then we've got some other 
--
 
as we mentioned we can't talk about the 
special options and so
 
we won't do that, but will have other impacts from 
matters ongoing that will impact our debt range.
 
With regard to that it is very conceivable that our net debt to EBITDA ratio 
would go above two, I think that's assumed and possibly in somewhere in 
betwee

where we feel comfort right now stating in. Those are the kinds of levels of 
debt that we would expect that could occur once we close all the 
transactions. What we would then focus on doing 
is because we will have 
accretive free cash flow after the DTV transaction as we said before we 
would take the excess cash flows after dividend and use that to commit that 
to paying down debt as quickly as possible.
 
We suggested over the course of the thre
e year cycle that ought to get us 

-
debt
-
to
-
EBITDA. And if you look at our current cost of borrowings, some of our 
recent transactions but quite frankly our entire portfolio today, we hav
e after 
tax cost of debt well below 3%, so its producing interest expense at a very 
acceptable level at 1.8, where just a few years ago our expense rates were 
higher.
 
You might have gotten a comparable answer with the 1.5 or 1.6 net
-
debt
-
to
-
EBITDA. So that

with it as they see fit, but we are comfortable with where we are going and 
we understand the implications.
 
The last thing I would tell you here is as we announced last week we set up 
a facility
 
with a collection of banks in 18 month, three year, five year terms 
for over $11 billion, the net after tax cost of that debt averages less than 
1%. And we have been very transparent with our plans and activities, such 
that reasonable people at the banks 
are in this process are still very 
interested in providing a significant funding at very attractive rates within 
ability for us to prepay without penalty and ability just to live the if you will 
facility open until such time as we needed.
 
So we feel really
 
good about where we stand in the crowded market. We will 
continue to work on it but we will continue to feel good about where we are 
at.
 
Amir Rozwadowski
 
Thank you very much, John. And just one additional follow
-
up, if I may. In 
addition to your significa
nt acquisition activity, you folks have also been 
successful at monetizing some non
-
core assets over the last 12 to 24 
months. I was wondering if we should consider this element of your 
strategy, and how it may fit into your priorities for 2015.
 
John Steph
ens
 

items. I think we started talking about monetization assets back three years
-
ago. I think that was the first major transaction we had done was a Yellow 
Pages transaction. So if 
you think back from that timeframe to today, you 
understand that 
--
 
I mean you clearly understand the multibillion, tens of 
billions of dollars we generate, I will say this we have a $300 billion of assets 
on our balance sheet and we have a history of bein
g Fortune 100 type 
publically traded companies, we are done yet. We have an opportunity to do 
more. We will continue to evaluate and as management we have an 
obligation to maximize returns on our assets. So getting to high utilization 
and high results that

it. Though the balance sheet as large as ours it would be inappropriate to 
collecting the things are complete. There is always opportunities.

So, earlier, Randall was talking about lessons learned as you move up the 
curve with Next. One of your competitors, T
-
Mobile, has learned that they 
can change the way they provide credit to their customers. The
y are placing 
a higher priority now on payment history than some of the traditional credit 
metrics. Have you learned the same thing? And is there any change in the 
way you are extending credit to your customers as they adopt Next? Thanks.
 
Randall Stephenso
n
 

industry know that you know your customers better than anybody else does. 
And customers that have been with you for a period of time regardless of 
what their credit scores 
are you tend to treat differently. And we have for 
many years done that whether it be on the fixed line side or broadband, U
-
Verse customers who pay us well that may have lower credit scores, we 
have actually gone ahead and extended them services like U
-
ve
rse which 
requires significant upfront investments and so forth. You are doing on the 
business side of the house too, you know your customers well. And so you 
are willing to invest in your customers that you know who may have credit 
scores that are weaker 
than what a new customer you will be willing to do 
with the new customer coming with a low credit score.
 
So there are not any new games in this business, we have all been playing 

we 
know our customers well, we know when we tweak credit policy, what to 

gotten fairly mechanical and arithmetic to be quite honest with you. So I 

ence out here on this.
 
Brett Feldman
 
And are you finding that the banks that you are working with are recognizing 
those lessons that you have learned in the way they finance your 
receivables?
 
John Stephens
 

f the reasons why we 
have high demand in a securitization process and we are able to get the 
pricing levels that we are able to get. So they recognized that and quite 
frankly all of you know, most of you go to our financial statements and our 
provision for
 
bad debts and understand with a company that has over $130 
billion worth of revenues, you can clearly see just how effective we are at 
managing 
--
 
particularly in a difficult economy how effective we are in 
managing our receivables. The team has done a ve
ry good job across the 
board business consumer through processes just like Randall described.
 
Randall Stephenson
 
You bet. Thank you Brett. Thank everybody for joining us and taking the 
time to listen in on the call. As we articulated at the beginning, we f
eel very 

going to be talking about a very different business and a very different 

over the course of this year
. So thanks again for joining us.

Amir Rozwadowski
 
Thank you and good morning everyone. Welcome to our second quarter 

 

Executive 
Officer, and John Stephens, our Chief Financial Officer. John will provide 
opening comments followed by John Stephens covering second quarter 
results and our liquidity and capital position. After that, John Stankey will 
come back with a business 
transformation update and discuss the HBO Max 

 
Before we begin, I need to call your attention to our Safe Harbor statement, 
which says that some of our comments today may be forward

looking. As 
such, they are subject 
to risks and uncertainties. Results may differ 
materially. Additional information is available on the Investor Relations 
website.
 
As always, our earnings materials are also available on the Investor 
Relations page of the AT&T website.
 
I also want to remind
 
you that we are in the quiet period for the NCC 
spectrum auction 105, so we cannot address any questions about that 
today.

with the impacts of COVID

19, which I expect are going to be with us for 

significant 
accommodations for COVID will be the business norm well into 
next year.
 
The unfortunate reality simply sharpens our focus and strengthens our 


t me walk you through our 
priorities moving forward.
 
As a company, our purpose is to create connection. We create connection 
with each other, with what people and businesses need to thrive every day, 
and with stories and experiences that matter. That purpo
se leads us to our 
market focus.
 
First, as a broadband provider, our high speed fiber and wireless broadband 
networks connect the people and businesses that form the foundation for 
how we live and work. Second, as a software
-
based entertainment provider, 
w
e deliver compelling entertainment experiences through HBO Max and ATT 
TV, giving us the opportunity to establish meaningful relationships with the 
majority of U.S. households. Third, the fantastic stories we tell and share on 
our platforms drive direct cu
stomer engagement and insights and create 
emotional attachments that can drive long lasting customer loyalty across 
our product set.
 

along with better value and service to drive more
 
customer engagement 
across all of AT&T. Our goal is to give our customers a reason to actively 
engage with us every day, in fact multiple times a day. Every touch point 
represents a chance to learn more about what they want, and bringing 
connectivity and 
engagement together will allow for the crucial insights to 
guide future investment and open new opportunities for subscription and 
advertising supported products.
 

-

going forward. To g
row, we know we have to be more effective and efficient 
in our execution. As part of our transformation initiative, we have more than 
50 different work streams underway that will enhance not only how we work 
together but how we deliver improved service lev
els and greater value for 
our customers, including competitive pricing that drives market momentum 
and targeted investment to achieve growth in those key products I 
mentioned. Our success relies on AT&T becoming a more agile and efficient 


quickly evolving markets.
 
Our transformation began with the new operating model we put in place at 
WarnerMedia last year to organize our teams around entertainment 
networks, live programming, conten
t production, and affiliate and 
advertising sales. That allowed us to work together across WarnerMedia and 
all of AT&T to successfully launch HBO Max.
 
A few months ago, we took the next step and moved Xandr to WarnerMedia 
so we could accelerate our progres
s in building software
-
based 
entertainment platforms supported by both subscription and advertising, like 
the AVOD version of HBO Max we plan to launch next year.
 

Communications to impr
ove our focus on customer service, simplify and 
rationalize our product portfolio around our growth areas, and operate with 
more speed and efficiency. I fully expect that the AT&T that emerges from 
this transformation work will look different than what we 
know today.
 

deliberate capital allocation plan. We have strong cash flows that allow us to

Max.
 

consecutive years. We finished the quarter with a dividend payout ratio of 
about 50%. We expect to end the year with our payout 
ratio in the 60s, 
likely at the low end of that range.
 
We continue to reduce our near term debt obligations and maintain high 
quality debt metrics. Finally, we remain committed to an ongoing disciplined 
review of our portfolio of businesses and assets to i
dentify those we can 

 
Now let me offer my perspective on the quarter before I turn it over to John 
Stephens to walk you through the details.
 
Our core subscription businesses proved to be resilient in 
the face of the 
economic downturn. Our mobility and business wire line segments 
performed well, and we grew EBITDA margins in both areas. We continued 
to add new fiber customers though COVID limited our ability to go into some 

. Our software
-
based entertainment businesses 
performed well. ATT TV subscriber growth in its first full quarter was better 

satisfaction, double the level of our legacy TV services. 
HBO Max had a 

already seeing how HBO Max can increase our broadband adds and increase 
wireless ARPU.
 
Obviously COVID had a significant impact on our WarnerMedia segment with 
ad

talk more about that a little later in the presentation, but I cannot imagine 
being at this moment absent the moves we made last year to reconfigure 
our WarnerMedia operations and re
focus the business on the growing and 
important direct
-
to
-
consumer opportunity.
 

 
John Stephens
 
Thanks John, and good morning everyone. Our financial summary for the 
quarter begins on Slide 5.
 
Adjusted EPS was $0.83 a 
share. That included COVID impacts from 
incremental costs related to compassion pay and production delays and lost 
revenues from foregone international roaming and delayed theatrical 
releases. Combined, COVID had a $0.09 a share impact to second quarter 
EP
S.
 
Adjustments for the quarter include an overall accrual for severance and a 
non
-
cash write
-
down of real goodwill based on the overall economic 
conditions in Latin America, foreign exchange rates, and COVID impacts. The 
severance accrual reflects the work

of our cost reduction and transformation plans. Cash impacts from these 
severances will occur over the next several quarters.
 
Revenues were down from a year ago, including an estimated $2.8 billion of 
lost or deferred
 
revenues impact from COVID. This was mostly due to the 
absence of theatrical and television releases and lower advertising from 
delayed sports programming and a slow economy. Lower international 
roaming revenues impacted mobility.
 
In our reported results,
 
foreign exchange had an impact of about $500 
million in lower revenues, primarily in our Latin America segment. 
Corresponding expense reductions offset most of the impact on operating 
income. In fact, adjusted operating income margins were essentially fla
t but 
were up when excluding COVID impacts.
 
Cash flow was impressive even during the pandemic. Cash from operations 
came in at more than $12 billion and free cash flow came in at $7.6 billion. A 
variety of items supported cash, including solid accounts rec
eivable 
collections and some benefits from the CARES Act, and we continue to invest 
in our growth areas. Capex was $4.5 billion with gross capital investment at 
around $5 billion, a difference primarily attributable to the timing of vendor 
payments, plus w
e invested an additional $1 billion in new 5G spectrum in 
the quarter and we invested nearly $4 million in HBO Max, in line with our 
full year estimate of $2 billion.
 
We were active in the debt markets during the quarter, managing our towers 
for financial 
flexibility and allowing us to take advantage of historically low 

 

communications segment on Slide 6.
 
Our subscription business led by mob
ility, broadband and business wire line, 
remained resilient. Mobility had another good quarter, even with the impact 
of COVID. Equipment revenue helped to offset declines in service revenues, 
which were down due to a decline in international roaming revenu
e and 
waived overage and late fees. Without those COVID impacts, we estimate 
service revenue would have grown more than 2%. Even with many of our 
stores being closed during much of the quarter, mobility equipment 
revenues grew with growth in digital sales 
and a strong rebound as stores 
reopened late in the quarter.
 
Mobility EBITDA continues to be a solid story. EBITDA of $7.8 billion was up 
year
-
over
-
year with both EBITDA margins and service margins expanding, 

 
Our tota
l reported phone growth was essentially flat. We had more than 
135,000 prepaid phone net adds that helped offset a decline in postpaid 
phone. Our quarterly subscriber counts for the postpaid wireless, video and 
broadband reflect an estimate for customers w
ho will likely disconnect 

treating these subscribers as disconnects in the second quarter. While this 
impacts net adds, churn and service revenues, we believe this is the most 
transparent
 
and accurate way to account for this.
 
About 340,000 of our postpaid phone subscribers were counted as 
disconnects, even though they were still on our network. If you add those 
back to our results, we would have had about 190,000 postpaid phone net 
adds an
d much lower churn.
 
Postpaid phone churn was down 2 basis points even with the Keep America 
Connected accrual. We also had a record low prepaid churn of under 3%. 
The popularity of our unlimited plans also increased thanks in part to our 
elite package that
 
includes HBO Max.
 
In our entertainment group, we had lower video and advertising revenues. 
This includes an estimated $300 million impact on both revenue and EBITDA 
from COVID from lower advertising demand and lower commercial volumes. 
AT&T TV gains helpe
d offset premium video losses and at the same time had 
about a 90% attach rate with our broadband services. Premium video losses 
remained about the same as the first quarter.
 
Broadband customers continue to look for faster speeds. We added more 
than 220,00
0 AT&T Fiber subscribers and the number of customers opting 
for gigabit speeds increased by more than 750,000 in the quarter. We now 
have 4.3 million AT&T Fiber customers with nearly 2 million of them on one 
gigabit speeds. I should point out our total bro
adband numbers do not 
include 159,000 subscribers who are counted as disconnects even though 
they remained active on our network through the Keep America Connected 
program.
 
We continue to drive ARPU growth in both video and IP broadband. In fact, 
premium v
ideo ARPU was up more than 6% as we continue to focus on long
-
term value customers. Business wire line performance was solid as 
enterprise customers trusted the reliability and flexibility of our network.
 
EBITDA was essentially stable year
-
over
-
year and ma
rgins expanded by 90 
basis points. Revenues were consistent with recent trends as slower declines 
in legacy products were partially offset by growth in strategic and managed 
services. This EBITDA strength was even more impressive when you 
consider that a y
ear ago, we had an IP sale which helped both revenue and 
EBITDA results. If you back that out, revenue would have been down just 
1.7% and EBITDA would have grown.
 

 
As John mentioned,
 
the COVID impact is most evident in our WarnerMedia 
results. Altogether, COVID had about a $1.5 billion revenue impact on the 
quarter. Lower expenses resulted in a favorable impact on EBITDA. The 
biggest news in the quarter from WarnerMedia was the succes
sful launch of 
HBO Max, which John will cover in more detail in just a minute.
 
Turning to our Latin America operations, foreign exchange was a major 
factor as were slow economies and the onset of COVID. Mexico was 
impacted by lower equipment sales from COV
ID
-
related store closures. This 

this, Mexico EBITDA improved year over year. Rio also continues to work 
against economic and foreign exchange headwinds which have become even 
stiffe
r with COVID, but even in this challenging economic environment, Rio 
continues to generate positive EBITDA and cash flow on a constant currency 
basis.
 
We closed our Venezuela operations in the quarter to comply with sanctions 
of U.S. laws. This had minimal
 

reduce its subscriber base.
 

 
We exited the quarter with a very strong financial position. Cash flows were 
strong, our capital allocation remained focused,
 
and we made large strides in 
effectively managing our debt portfolio. Our strong free cash flow in the 

-
year goal of a 
total dividend payout ratio in the 60% range, likely at the low end of t
hat 
range.
 
We also continue to invest. We now expect gross capital investment to come 
in at the $20 billion range for the full year, consistent with our original 2020 
guidance. The FirstNet build continues to run ahead of plan. We expect 
additional network
 
benefits as our 5G build is expected to reach nationwide 
coverage today. The network and the entire FirstNet team has done a great 
job in building out our 5G network.
 

and we used this
 
opportunity to issue about $17 billion in long term debt at 
rates significantly below our average cost of debt. This allowed us to 
materially reduce our near term debt towers, making our debt obligations for 
the next few years very manageable.
 

nue to be disciplined with debt management. Ongoing liability 
management strategies are actively being considered to maintain and 
improve flexibility and reduce risk. We have several other levers we can pull 
to optimize our capital structure. We expect to 
close about $2 billion in 
pending sales from CME, real estate, and tower monetizations this year. We 
also expect to close our Puerto Rico wireless sale soon, with those funds 
used to redeem some preferred interest. You should expect us to continue 
explorin
g other opportunities.
 
 
I now would like to turn it back to John for an update on our business 
transformation and HBO Max. John?
 
John Stankey
 
Thanks John. Let me give you more detail about our business transformation 
on Slide 9.
 
If anything, COVID has

couple of years.
 
Our workforce realignment and reduction of labor costs is underway. We 
restructured some of our benefit plans earlier in the year and we made 
several moves to streamline operations. Within the communications

during COVID gave us the unique opportunity to review our retail and third

[Operator instructions]
 
Your first question comes from the line of John Hudlick from UBS. Please go 
ahead.
 
John Hudlick
 
Thanks 
guys. Maybe if you could drill down into the entertainment segment 
a little bit. John Stephens, I think you mentioned some
--
about the non
-
cash 
piece that may have affected EBITDA on a year
-
over
-
year basis, maybe give 
a bit more color that, and then anythin
g you guys can tell us on volume 

half, but the video losses got a little bit better, even with the KAC pulled out. 
But just how you see video and broadband trends as we look out
 
into the 
second half of the year would be great, thanks.
 
John Stephens
 
Thanks John, thanks for your question. Let me give you a couple of thoughts 
and have John join in.
 
One point is, we did get a little bit better on the customer trends, and that 
did 
include, I think it was 91,000, if you will, accrued disconnects, customers 

--
there was a 


l with how we address the situation.
 
Secondly, we were real pleased with the AT&T TV rollout. It has been 
successful and it comes
--

pandemic, some of the home installs and some of that activity has been 
limited, 

 
Third, to specifically reference, we amortize installment costs like the whole 
industry does, and because of AT&T TV, those installment costs from a cash 
basis are going down, but the amortization of pri
or year installment costs 

so those costs are up year
-
over
-
year. When you adjust for that, we actually 
had cash EBITDA actually grow when you make that adjustment, but for 
COVID
 
we would have seen an increase.
 

generate a lot of cash out of it, but the important piece is this utilization of 
AT&T TV now and taking into that overall strategy of software
-
ba
sed 
entertainment programs.
 
John, you want to add anything to that?
 
John Stankey
 


with the Keep America Co
nnected adjustment in there, and so the base 
dynamic is actually getting better and the team is doing a nice job of 
keeping the right customers and servicing them in the right way. But the 
gross pressures are pretty significant and I would say to the exten
t that 
reason comes back for people to engage in pay TV, such as sports returning 


year.
 
 
Now, what I r
eally like about what I see about our opportunity if we start 
seeing that gross recover is, as we shared with you, the ATT TV response 


 
us to attack more of the 
market, given the lower SAC costs that John described, and the broadband 
attachment has been far superior to where we were with the previous 

improvement in 
fiber as we move forward here.
 
So I think that dynamic is going to be good for us as we move through the 
year, but I really need to see some reason for a customer to want to get into 

 
on 
the sports portfolio.
 
John Hudlick
 
Got it, thanks guys.
 
John Stephens
 
Thanks John.

Your next question comes from the line of Phil Cusick from JP Morgan. 
Please go ahead.
 
Phil Cusick
 

response from 
those customers in July as you ask them for payment, and can you quantify 

second quarter?
 
John Stephens
 
Yes, let me give you the cheat sheet way of doing it. I think abo
ut it as
--
I 

postpaid customer, and you guys have the ARPU numbers so you can 


provided, we provided a reconciliation of 

there and I think that revenue for the quarter was $450 million inclusive of 
international roaming and these kinds of payments. So what I wou
ld suggest 

 



peful of retaining many of these 

--
our processes, 
our transparency processes would tell us just to treat these as disconnects. I 
know some others in the industry have different views on it, they ma
y push 
this off to the third quarter or later in the year, or may make base 

upfront and laying it out for you, not only on wireless but on video and on 
broadband, and I point this ou
t because the video and the broadband 
numbers are measurable also 
-
 
91,000 video and almost 160,000 on 
broadband.
 
Hopefully that explains
--
I mean, if you think about that postpaid number, 

ion of 

 
Phil Cusick
 


kind of hit rate or what they look like in term
s of responding with some 
ability to pay?
 
John Stephens

there is this [indiscernib
le] that we would win some of 

early. We still have a significant number out there, and quite frankly, I want 
to point out we refer to this as the Keep America Connected progr
am or 
pledge. There is a number of them out there. There is not only at the federal 
FCC level, but there is a number of them out there at the state by state 
level, so this is something that will be with us through the whole quarter.
 
Phil Cusick
 
Okay, one o
ther if I can

John Stephens
 

three segments, we are working really hard to retain those customers.
 
Phil Cusick
 

good. One other, if I 
can. Can you quantify at all the sports cost amortization that will probably 

great margins from Turner this quarter. I just want to make sure I 
understand where 
we should be ready for that to go in the third quarter.
 
John Stephens
 
Yes, I think if you look at what we spelled out in the
--
the best indication of 
that is going to be what we spelled out in the COVID schedules, where we 

re right, Phil 
-
 
we will have a sports cost 

back, and as we expressed to you, those just two pieces of direct costs 
generally leave a pressure on the business, and we got relief of t
hat 

that accounting in the third quarter here, so we will see that. I think you see 
the biggest piece to that really showing up in the COVID schedules that we 
disclosed.

Your next question comes from the line of David Barden from Bank of 
America. Please go ahead.
 
David Barden
 
Hey 
guys, thanks so much for taking the questions. This one might be for 
either one of the two Johns. Could you guys address the timing and/or 
criteria and some of the political considerations about restarting the buyback 

that that buyback program comes 

 
Then the second question is related to the wireless business. Maybe this one 
is for John Stephens. The two forces are the pressure from overage and 
roaming at the revenue line offset a little bit by the e
quipment on the
--
the 
lower equipment velocities, and then also you had this hazard pay for the 
union forces. Can you talk about which of these forces is going to be 

the equipment
 

does the roaming come back? If we could get some color on those moving 
forces, it would be helpful. Thank you.
 
John Stephens
 
David, thanks for the question. Let me take the second one first.
 
With
 
regard to mobility, think about it this way. John just mentioned that we 
felt good about our retail space. If you look at the equipment revenue in the 
second quarter, it actually grew and that was from a rebound in our retail 
stores, our equipment sales d



 
Secondly, I would say that on the overall mobility, we grew EBITDA even 
with those costs of the pa
ndemic, even with the pressure from international 
roaming, the pressure from waiving late fees or overage charges, and 

shape with those things, to work through those even currently, 
but going 

allow for us to grow that. Even with those additional costs from COVID, as 
you say, the battle pay, so to speak, we were able to keep costs in line and 
grow EBITDA, so
 

 
As we work through the Connect America
--
Keep America Connected groups, 
as we get to a more stable environment, we feel very good about where the 

 
cash generator, so feel 
good about that.
 
John Stankey
 
On the question, Dave, regarding where we are on stock buybacks, I would 

annual planning cycle in September and, broadl


visibility remain, clearly as I indicated in my opening remarks, with COVID 


expect as we get into the latter part of the third quarter, maybe we have a 
little bit better visibility of what 2021 looks like and what the circumstances 

with the board in September talking about that 
broadly and looking at the investment opportunities that are in front of us 
and how we want to deploy capital and the best way to give the right returns 

other on that at this 
point.
 
John Stephens
 

and managing the cost of our debt. We did about $17 billion in issuances in 
the last month and using that to retire previously issued debt
 
at better 
interest rates with better timing and spreads, much more manageable

that debt side, and I think the markets have responded well to that.

ur next question comes from the line of Michael Rollins from Citi. Please 
go ahead.
 
Michael Rollins
 
Hi, thanks, and good morning. I was hoping to return to some of the 
priorities, John, that you discussed at the beginning of the call. Just two 
questions on
 
that. First, you described being a broadband provider is the 
first priority. What does that mean for the pace at which you want to expand 
fiber to the home or gigabit access to the home if you can use other 
technologies, such as 5G?
 
The second question wa
s on your second priority, which is the focus on 
being a software
-
based entertainment provider, and you mentioned AT&T TV 
as part of that opportunity. To be successful with AT&T TV, does AT&T need 
to own the DirectTV satellite video business? Thanks.
 
John 
Stankey
 
Hi Mike, thanks for the questions. On the broadband side, I have an appetite 


relative to households
. I have an appetite to build fiber that serves a 
combination of our needs in the consumer space, what we need to do to 
deploy 5G, and what can help our business segment. Really, the unique 

l those areas, 
and that should give us leverage in fiber deployment that I think others that 
are either only a fixed line provider and reselling wireless services, or those 
that are only wireless providers and trying to deploy more fiber

intensive 5G 
netwo

 
My investment thesis and my point of view on our company is that if we do 
our engineering correctly and we think about our planning properly, we 
should be getting yields off of very lineal foot of fiber we put in that nobody 
else can achie


segments, not just the homes that we pass, although the net effect of that 
will be there will be communities that we

 
I personally do not believe that 5G is a replacement in the near term for 
suburban residential single family living units. As an optimal strategy, I think 

-
capable 
fixed line net
works in place, so I think there is clearly going to be stuff on 

term that 5G is the right fixed line replacement strategy in what I would call 
the typical single family home infrastru
cture.
 
Look, if it ultimately moves that way and we start to see the technology 


not of the mindset right no

market.
 
On the software
-



 
and pay TV platforms 

this point in time, but there is no reason we should think that over the long 
haul that once customers are aggregated on one platform or the other, that 
live s
tays separate from on
-

going to see these products ultimately come together.
 
So when I talk about software
-
based entertainment, I think about the fact 
that we want a platform with a lot of customers on it that is 
capable of either 
delivering general entertainment content under an SBAUD construct or 
whatever is that appropriate mix of live linear moving forward, and I think 

 
Do I think that 
satellite is necessary to respond in that area? You can go 
back and look at comments I made, I think very early on, you know, post 

we loved satellite as a technology to deliver premi
um entertainment
-
based 
video content. We liked the customer base, and it was an opportunity to 
move that customer base into the right technology platforms moving 

now, which is buildin
g those software platforms that can deliver either live or 
on
-
demand entertainment
-
based content and have that relationship with the 
customer, using data and analytics we pulled from that and hopefully bridge 
off other services that those platforms can ult


that happen.

ease and windowing 
schedule, and in particular whether you think HBO Max could be a much 
more important launch point for your films going forward? Thank you.
 
John Stankey
 
Sure, Brett. Look, I think I said last quarter that I fully expected that coming 
out 

some adjustment in the theatrical construct. I also made the point that, 
look, I think theatrical still has an absolute important role moving forward. 

s going to be more enjoyable and better to 
see in theaters than in the living room, and we fully believe that and we 
want to work with our theatrical partners and our exhibitors to ensure that 
we work with them and try to get through this very difficult pe
riod.

longer this goes on, there is
 
going to be some content on the margin that

I think we indicated in some of the comments we are 
alre
ady seeing the dynamic of the attach rate of the better unlimited and the 
higher ARPU unlimited plans increasing, and I made that point deliberately 

giving customers a reason to go up i
n the more robust unlimited plans, and 

October that that was an important driver through a combination of the 
incentives we would give people on the 5G network to buy into the upper 
end 
unlimited plans, as well as how Max complements those, and we are 
seeing that success with Max, so check the box on the front end of that. 
Once we have the right kind of equipment showing up on the 5G side, I 
think we will see that momentum continue and ca

in our enterprise business and we are skewed heavier to the mid in that

through its challenges, our customer base is going to move thro

ght the team did a great job on the launch of HBO

in th


to do on the cost and efficiency side to get our business positioned to do 

rly the uncertainty in the environment 
moving forward makes that more important to us.
 

continue to lean on that and use those cash flows to invest wisely moving 
forward. As you heard J
ohn talk about, the fact we remain committed to 
putting our capital against the areas where we think there is an opportunity 
to grow this business moving forward and come out of the backside of this 

to continue to 
do that and move forward.

Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the 2016 
AT&T's three quarter earnings call. At this time, all participants are in a 
listen
-
only mode. Later we will conduct a question
-
and
-
answer session, and 
instructions will be given at that time.
 
I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Michael Viola, 
Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
 
Michael J. Viola

AT&T, Inc.
 
Thank you, Roxanne. Good morning, everyone, and welc
ome.
 
As you know, on Saturday we announced an agreement for AT&T to acquire 
Time Warner. And the purpose of today's call is to provide additional 
background and perspective. AT&T also announced its third quarter results 
on Saturday, and we'll briefly go ov
er those highlights as well. With me on 
the call today are Randall Stephenson, AT&T's Chairman and CEO; Jeff 
Bewkes, Chairman and CEO of Time Warner; John Stephens, AT&T's Chief 
Financial Officer. And also on the call is David McAtee, AT&T's Chief Counsel,
 
who will take part in the Q&A portion of this call.
 
Before we begin, I need to call your attention to the Safe Harbor statement. 
It says some of our comments today may be forward
-
looking, and as such 
they're subject to risks and uncertainties. Results may
 
differ materially, and 
additional information is available on AT&T and Time Warner's SEC filings 
and on the Investor Relations page of AT&T and Time Warner's websites.
 
As you know, we are in the quiet period for the FCC spectrum auction, so we 
cannot addr
ess any questions about spectrum today. I also need to 

 
want 
to direct your attention to page 4, as that has information regarding SEC 
filings and now I'd like to turn the call over to AT&T Chairman and CEO, 
Randall Stephenson.
 
Randall L. Stephenson

AT&
T, Inc.
 
Okay. Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everybody. What we're going to do 
is Jeff and I are going to provide some color on the business combination, 
and then we'll spend our time addressing whatever questions you might 
have.
 
Look, we're convinced thi
s combination, Time Warner and AT&T, is a perfect 
match for our two companies. Vertically integrated, we'll be able to bring a 
fresh approach to how the media and communication industry works for 
customers, for content creators, for distributors, as well a
s advertisers.
 
We'll be uniquely positioned to lead and even accelerate the next wave of 
innovation in terms of how people enjoy video entertainment. Time Warner 
is the global leader in media and entertainment with terrific brands and their 
brands we all k
now and love, from Game of Thrones to CNN and Superman, 
just to name a few. It is a vast content library and we believe it's the best on 
the planet, and hands down, Time Warner has the best creative talent and 
journalists in the industry.
 
When you combine 
Time Warner's content with our scale and distribution, 
we have 100 million plus TV, mobile, and broadband subscribers. You put 
that with our customer insights and the addressable advertising 
opportunities that flow from that, we think we build something he
re that's 
really special and it creates significant strategic as well as financial benefits.
 
With content distribution and customer insights, we'll be able to deliver new 
subscription, as well as adverting models and new content formats that 
traditional pr
ogrammers have been hesitant to adopt, particularly for 
content, this design for mobile consumption and sharing on social media. 
Only content will help us innovate on new advertising options, which 
combined with subscriptions will help pay for the cost of 
content creation.
 
And this two
-
sided business model, advertising and subscription
-
based, 
helps pay for creators to develop more great content and gives customers 
more choices in terms of how they get their content. And only AT&T will 
have the world's best 
premium content with the networks to deliver on every 
screen. We expect to close this transaction by the end of 2017, and I've 
been asked a lot why now. It comes at a time when the media and 
communication industries are converging, and Jeff and I sat down 
back in 
August to talk about where we saw the industry headed and how a 
combination between our companies would really remove a lot of the friction 
in the industry and help accelerate innovation in terms of content that's 
mobile, customized, and social.
 
Th
e next wave of innovation in this business takes vertical integration of 
premium content and distribution, and I suspect the rest of the industry is 
going to innovate right with us. And by the time our Time Warner deal closes 
at the end of next year, we'll
 
be nearly two and a half years into integrating 
DIRECTV and that work is going to be essentially behind us.
 
Our Time Warner deal is more of a bolt
-
on acquisition. It's not a normal full
-
blown integration like you've seen in past deals. The big part of the
 
value of 
this transaction is Time Warner's outstanding leadership team and the 
amazing creative talent, the journalists that they put together. That's why 
we plan to run Time Warner the same way that it's run today.
 
If you would turn to slide 6 in the dec
k and let's talk about the capabilities 
this business is going to have. First, we'll be the leader in premium content. 
Time Warner has an amazing portfolio of content creation and aggregation 
and some iconic brands across programming and TV and film produc
tion. 
HBO is the number one global leader in premium content subscriptions, 
producing hit shows like Game of Thrones, Silicon Valley and Veep for its 
HBO and Cinemax networks. Warner Brothers is the largest film and studio 
in the world, hit franchises like
 
Harry Potter, Superman and The Voice, and 
box office hits like American Sniper, and it has the best and biggest 
entertainment library on the planet.
 
Turner has top
-
rated basic cable network, TNT, TBS and Cartoon Network, 
Adult Swim, and Tuner's premium sp
orts rights, including the NBA, March 
Madness, Major League Baseball. And that combined with our rights of the 
NFL SUNDAY TICKET is going to create a very strong sports programming 
portfolio. And Turner has great digital assets like Bleacher Report, CNN.co
m.
 
If you look at slide 7, we'll have unmatched scale in distribution and 
customer relationships. 144 million mobile subscribers in the U.S. and 
Mexico, 45 million subscribers in the U.S. and throughout Latin America, 
make us the world's largest pay
-
TV pro
vider. We have about 16 million U.S. 
broadband subscribers, and we have a growing OTT business with HBO NOW 
and soon DIRECTV Now. And also our joint venture with The Chernin Group, 
Otter Media has 1.2 million subscribers on its various SVOD services. And w
e 
have more than 88,000 retail points
-
of
-
sale across North America.
 
And third, all that will give us some robust viewership insights, and we'll use 
those insights from our TV, mobile and broadband subscribers to inform 
what content we create. We'll develop
 
content that's better tailored to what 
specific audience segments want to watch, when, where, and on which 
device. And we'll use the insights to expand the market for addressable 
advertising. And addressable advertising is far more effective and more 
valu
able both to the advertisers and to our customer. Owning content will 
help us innovate on new advertising options, which combined with 
subscriptions will allow us to grow two
-
sided business models, help pay for 
the cost of content creation. And this two
-
si
ded business model, advertising 
and subscription
-
based, helps to pay for creators to develop more great 
content and gives customers more choices on how they get their content.
 
If you move to slide 8, I want to walk you through the highlights of the 
transac
tion. Then later John Stephens is going to dive a little deeper into 
this. So we're paying $107.50 per share. It's half stock and half cash, and 
the stock portion is subject to a collar. And we believe this is the optimal 
capital structure for a deal of th
is size. The financial benefits are 
straightforward and we think they're significant.
 
In the first year after closing it's accretive to margins and adjusted EPS and 
free cash flow on a per share basis. It improves our dividend coverage. It 
enhances and div
ersifies our revenue and earnings growth profile. And the 
structure of the deal allows us to maintain a strong balance sheet and strong 
investment
-
grade credit metric. The approvals are fairly straightforward. 
Time Warner shareholders will vote on it. And 
then we'll have regulatory 
reviews in the U.S., the EU, and a few other countries.
 
And so that's the structure of the deal. What I'd like to do now is hand it 
over to Jeff Bewkes, the Chairman and CEO of Time Warner, and let him 
take you through his slides
.
 
Jeff L. Bewkes

Time Warner, Inc.
 
Thanks, Randall. Good morning, everyone.
 
I'm really pleased with this transaction and with Time Warner's future as 
part of AT&T. Joining forces will accelerate the evolution of both our 
companies, as we go where consume
rs are going in the converging worlds of 
media and communications. And that will drive more growth and more value 
for shareholders.
 
This combination creates both immediate and long
-
term value. For Time 
Warner shareholders, the price represents about a 36% 
premium to our 
closing price of $79.24 on October 19, and it also has a very attractive 
consideration mix of 50% cash and 50% AT&T stock for each Time Warner 
share. That gives our shareholder base roughly a 15% pro forma ownership 
in the world's leading in
tegrated media and communications company, with 
a strong financial profile, as Randall just said, and a combined track record 
of success and innovation in both companies.
 
We believe the pro forma company is very well positioned to drive 
attractive 
growth for years to come. We expect innovation to be an important driver of 
that growth, since we see AT&T's distribution capabilities as an enormous 
opportunity for us. As I said, we need to go where the consumers are going, 
and that's increasi
ngly mobile, increasingly multi
-
platform, and it's 
increasingly on
-
demand through new services via direct consumer 
relationships over broadband, and this aligns us with all of that.
 
Additionally, there is the huge opportunity Randall mentioned to utilize 
c
onsumer insights to inform content creation. And that allows us to continue 
to create not just the biggest hits, but also content and programming that 
really engages with targeted passionate niche in the audience. We'll be able 
to do that more efficiently 
while also innovating very important new 
subscription and advertising models to increase consumer choice. So we see 
the opportunity to create tremendous long
-
term value in this combination, 
and that's what's driving this transaction.
 
As I said at the outse
t, AT&T's distribution capabilities significantly advance 
our direct
-
to
-
consumer efforts and our ability to develop new offerings for all 
the leading content that we already create and distribute today. And 
together with AT&T, we'll develop new innovative 
business models and forms 
of content that consumers will be demanding tomorrow in this ubiquitous, 
multi
-
platform, on
-
demand, and increasingly mobile environment.
 
So now I'll turn it over to John Stephens.
 
John J. Stephens 
-
 
AT&T, Inc.
 
Thank you, Jeff, and
 
good morning, everyone.
 
Let me provide the financial expectations that we have for this transaction 
and refer to slide 10. To recap, the purchase price values Time Warner 
equity at about $85 billion, plus approximately $21 billion of net debt from 
Time Wa
rner. That brings the total transaction value to right at $106 billion. 
Time Warner shareholders will receive a 50:50 mix of cash and AT&T stock 
for their equity. The cash portion is already fully funded, with a $40 billion 
bridge loan and additional AT&T 
liquidity.
 
We remain strongly committed to maintaining a sound balance sheet and 
solid investment
-
grade credit metric. And we see significant opportunity for 
rapid deleveraging potential, given the attractive free cash flow of the 
combined companies. In fa
ct, we expect pro forma net debt
-
to
-
EBITDA to be 
in the 2.5 times range by the end of the first year after the close of the 
transaction and approaching the 1.8 times range by the end of year four.
 
We see solid synergy potential in the $1 billion run rate b
y the end of year 
three. As you would expect, this is substantially cost
-
driven corporate and 
procurement type expenses, the kind we know how to get. But we believe 
there are also significant opportunities from the vertical integration of 
content and distr
ibution. And the vast amount of data available from the 
combined company will allow not only a greater value proposition to offer 
advertisers, but will allow more informed and efficient content development. 
This transaction also diversifies and enhances ou
r revenue mix. Strong cash 
flow and the lower capital intensity gives us flexibility as we grow these 
businesses.
 
As mentioned earlier, we expect adjusted EPS to be accretive in the first 
year, and free cash flow and free cash flow per share to be accretiv
e within 
that same timeframe. The deal also improves our strong free cash flow 
dividend coverage. And as you saw, we just announced our 33rd consecutive 
dividend increase. We're shooting 100% raising the dividend with every 
chance we've had over the last 3
3 years. We are extremely proud of that 
track record.
 
Now I'd like to spend the last few minutes of this presentation giving you a 
high
-
level view of our very good third quarter results that we released on 
Saturday, starting with our financial summary on s
lide 12. Our teams 
continued to execute at a high level in the quarter. Third quarter 
consolidated revenues grew nearly 5% to $40.9 billion, in large part due to 
our acquisition of DIRECTV.
 
On a comparable basis, revenues were down slightly, as growth in v
ideo and 
IP
-
based services mostly offset pressure from declines in wireless legacy 
services and the second quarter 2016 transition of certain hosting 
operations. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, comparable revenues 
were essentially flat. We grew n
et income in the quarter. After adjustments, 
third quarter EPS was $0.74, the same as last year's third quarter and up 
almost 4% year to date. This comes even with about $0.02 of earnings 
pressure from our Mexico wireless operations. Margins also continue 
to be 
solid, even with the pressure from our investment cycle in Mexico. Thanks to 
the team's focus on profitability and our best
-
ever wireless service margins.
 
All this continues to drive strong cash flows. We had our second highest ever 
operating cash fl
ows of $11 billion, with free cash flow reaching $5.2 billion. 
That's more than $13 billion in year
-
to
-
date free cash flow. Year to date, our 
dividend payout ratio is 67%, ahead of our full
-
year guidance. Capital 
investment is on plan, coming in at $5.9 bi
llion for the quarter and just over 
$16 billion year to date. We also continue to focus on our net debt to 
adjusted EBITDA ratio, which came in at 2.24 times.
 
Let's now take a look at our operations. Those details are on slide 13. In a 
competitive wireless
 
market, we continue to effectively manage our 
business. This has helped us add subscribers, lower postpaid churn, and 
improve profitability. We turned in record wireless service EBITDA margins 
of 50.1%. This comes even as promotions eat it up at the end o
f the 
quarter.
 
We took a smart, strategic approach with our marketing moves. You see the 
impact in our postpaid churn. With all the noise in the marketplace, we had 
our second best third quarter postpaid churn ever. Postpaid churn of 1.05% 
was an 11 basis 
point improvement over the year ago third quarter, and this 
includes about 2 basis points of pressure from our 2G network migration.
 
Postpaid phone churn was even lower at 0.90%. That's a 14 basis point 
improvement over a year ago. We turned in another str
ong quarter of 
subscriber growth. We had 1.5 million domestic net adds. And when you 
include our Mexico operations, we grew our North American subscriber base 
by 2.3 million. The growth of our prepaid business continues to be 
exceptional. We added more tha
n 300,000 prepaid phones in the quarter 
and prepaid revenues were up more than 20% year
-
over
-
year. This drove 
branded phone growth and helped increase our branded smartphone base by 
another 700,000 subscribers.
 
Turning to our Entertainment Group, on a comp
arative basis, revenues grew 
as IP and video revenue outpaced legacy declines. Margins also continued to 
expand at a healthy clip. Our reported margins were up 130 basis points 
year
-
over
-
year, driven by merger synergies and a full quarter of DIRECTV in 
thi
s year's results. Overall, TV and broadband subscribers were relatively 
stable in the quarter. We added more than 300,000 DIRECTV subscribers 
and have added 1.2 million DIRECTV subscribers since we acquired DIRECTV 
in July of last year.
 
Our business soluti
ons team also performed well in a challenging economy. 
Our flow share is good and we continue to see the benefits of an integrated 
wireless and wireline approach. Thanks to wireless, we grew business 
revenues in the quarter and we grew revenues in all our 
retail segments, 
enterprise, small business, and the public sector. Strategic business services 
also grew at a solid clip, up $240 million year
-
over
-
year. That's up 9.1% and 
when you adjust for APEX, growth was closer to 10%.
 
Let me close with a summary of
 
the quarter on slide 14. We're proud of what 
we've accomplished in this quarter. Earnings continue to grow and 
consolidated margins are stable, even with the pressure from our Mexico 
investment. Year
-
to
-
date adjusted EPS is up nearly 4% and we had the 
sec
ond highest cash from operations ever. We answered competitive 
headwinds in wireless with our best wireless service margins ever and our 
second best ever third quarter postpaid churn. We added 1.5 million U.S. 
subscribers at positive phone net adds and gre
w our smartphone base by 
700,000. The integration of DIRECTV continues to generate the cost savings 
and sales opportunities we thought it would.
 
We're on track to launch DIRECTV Now this quarter and are excited about 
what this brings. And Mexico continues 
to be a growth story, just a 
tremendous job by our team. They're ahead of plan with their 4G LTE 
deployment, with their rebranding efforts, and with customer growth. Our 
guidance for the year remains on track, double
-
digit revenue growth, mid
-
single
-
digit 
adjusted earnings growth with stable margins. And free cash 
flow growth has been strong with dividend coverage year
-
to
-
date at 67%.
 
As we enter the home stretch of the year, we feel very good about our 
results and we look forward to finishing the year stro
ng. With that, I believe 
we're ready for Q&A and I'll turn it over to Roxanne.

wants to add anything. So, you hit the big driver that we're envision
ing, and 
that's the DIRECTV Now product that we'll be launching next month. And I'll 
tell you the more we iterate and work on DIRECTV and launch it in 
November, the more excited we get about what we will be putting in the 
marketplace, but I would tell you 
the more excited we get about what else 
we'll be able to do on this platform. And there are lot of things we really 
aspire to do with this platform, as you think about incorporating social into 
the platform. And as you begin to think about how you share co
ntent on this 
platform, clipping content that you're watching and sharing it with your 
friends via messaging or being social media. We think that 

 
we don't think 

 
we know our customers are really demanding that.
 
Now, what I would tell you is, 
trying to develop those type of capabilities 
with the current content providers is proving difficult. It's arm's length 
negotiation and people are, obviously, very protective of their content, and 
so it's just really, really hard to get these type of itera
tions and innovations 
on content done. So the thing that Jeff and I get most excited about, when 
we talk about this transaction is, now, in these over
-
the
-
top environments 
and platforms, we can begin to innovate our content much quicker.
 
We're under the sa
me umbrella, the same ownership structure, and we can 
get past a lot of these content rights and so forth and move fast. And I will 
tell you, we are both convinced that as we innovate in this way and as we 
accelerate the pace of this innovation, it's going
 
to attract others to want to 
do the same on this platform. So, those are kind of 

 
a snippet of some of 
the things we're thinking about. Jeff, would you add anything to that?
 
Jeff L. Bewkes 
-
 
Time Warner, Inc.
 
I'd like to add same idea. We've been trying,
 
at Time Warner, to get more 
Video on Demand on not just our networks, but have it become a universal 
thing for every American. You go to your set
-
top, your television and that 
whole dial of networks, hundreds of channels, they should all be VOD, just 
like
 
HBO or Netflix is. And we announced that and we made it available to all 
our distributors for all the Time Warner networks to turn on HBO more than 
five years ago, no payment extra. The condition was, we'll give you full VOD 
on your television platforms, 
on your broadband platforms, provided that it 
goes to every consumer with no extra charge. Everybody has got to get the 
same offer and we could just do it for our networks. We announced it first 
with Comcast years ago.
 
What we saw, to Randall's point, is t
hat the various cable and other kinds of 
distributors took a long time to create that offering across every other kind 
of network. And often the reason was they're waiting for various 
negotiations of this cable company versus that network group, and you ju
st 
didn't see a universal offering. It's what consumers were demanding. And 
so, we think with this, with the AT&T and DIRECTV our largest affiliate 
distributor on television, they're the largest and best at mobile delivery. And 
so when we want to bring mor
e packages, more choice for consumers at 
different price points at every kind of level, upper, lower, more channels, 
fewer channels, more mobility, more innovation of the kinds of 
programming. And then with the advertising capabilities, we can make the 
adv
ertising more interesting for your house versus somebody next door, the 
products you're interested, not the ones you don't need to see. And that 
means that more of the consumers get a better experience viewing. They 
get less interruptions. And it means tha
t more of the cost of the 
programming, which is 

 
there's an investment in programming, but more of 
the cost can then be borne by advertisers and consumers get a break. So 
the benefit for this, for consumers is pretty good, very good, and the benefit 
for a
dvertisers is terrific, because if you look at what's happening in that 
world, advertisers need more competition. And this will give another outlet, 
not just the Google and Facebook one that's gaining all of the 

 
has been 
gaining all the traction, but now
 
you have yet another advertising choice 
that's equally efficient.
 
Randall L. Stephenson

AT&T, Inc.
 
And if we're right about this, and I think we're both really convicted that we 
can drive the industry and innovate in the industry this way and do it far 
more quickly. If we're right, as we begin to stimulate even more and more 
demand of video over
-
the
-
top on our mobile networks, the desire and the 
incentive to go faster on 5G deployment is heightened. And we get more and 
more enthusiastic about the world o
f 5G. The more we get into this and see 
what kind of services will be consumed over
-
the
-
top on our mobile network. 
So, it's just a real synergistic effect across everything from infrastructure 
investment back through the distribution platforms and content 
creation and 
advertising model, this just has a lot of opportunities for us.

Okay, great. Thanks. Maybe a question for Randall. We've heard the wireless 
market continues to see increasing competitive pressure. Does this 
transaction help you in that arena at all? Do
es it help you differentiate the 
product or just provide you some sort of business diversification away from 
the wireless market?
 
Randall L. Stephenson 
-
 
AT&T, Inc.
 
It accomplishes both actually. As we iterate quickly on these platforms and 
think about DIR
ECTV Now, DIRECTV Now is a mobile
-
centric product. And if 
this product is as good as we believe that it is and our customers really 
begin to enjoy it, there should be advantages of using DIRECTV Now on 
AT&T's network, and there will be. But at the same tok
en, if we're iterating 
quickly into DIRECTV Now with the Time Warner content, then we begin to 
differentiate the DIRECTV Now platform as well.
 
And hopefully, as Jeff articulated and expressed, as we begin to iterate and 
innovate with the Time Warner conten
t, I am actually convinced that if we're 
successive with this, it will incentivize other content creators to do the same 
and want to innovate on top of this platform as well. So, I think it gives us 
great diversification. 15% of our revenues after this dea
l is closed will be 
Time Warner, and which is media and entertainment. So the diversification is 
great. But I think it also gives us an opportunity to differentiate our 
platform.
 
John J. Stephens 
-
 
AT&T, Inc.
 
John, if I could add just one thing. I mean, it
 
is a competitive environment in 
the mobile arena. But look at the results, record 50% wireless service 
margins, churn our second best third quarter ever, and even lower when you 
take into account the 2G migration. Look at the postpaid phone churn and 
you 
see that it's down at 0.9%. So, it is a competitive environment and 
there are a lot of promotional activities going on. But our mobility engine, 
our mobility team is performing quite well. And the capabilities that we get 
through this transaction only ensu
re that that part of our business can 
continue to operate very effectively, efficiently, and profitably.

Our next question comes from the 
line of Amir Rozwadowski, Barclays 
Capital. Please go head.
 
Amir Rozwadowski 
-
 
Barclays Capital, Inc.
 
Thank you very much for taking the questions. While some of the major 
trends that the combination seems to address are not lost on many, I 
wonder if we co
uld dig in a bit more. Randall. to your comments on why now 
is the right time. Clearly, you have a lot on your plate at the moment. The 
integration with DIRECTV seems to just be getting started. You're on the 
verge of some new business models that you have
 
mentioned on the OTT 
side. And arguably the revenue synergies have just begun with respect to 
DIRECTV. Does this signal confidence in your ability to execute on the 
integrated service provider model that is in place now or is this sort of timing 
with resp
ect to availability of making this move with respect to the 
availability of the asset? Thanks.
 
Randall L. Stephenson 
-
 
AT&T, Inc.
 
Hi, Amir. Good questions. In terms of where we stand on the DIRECTV 
integration, Amir, as you recall, the biggest benefit fina
ncially from the 
integration were the cost synergies. And we set an objective of getting $2.5 
billion per year of cost out of the business, $1.5 billion of that being this 
year. We're way ahead of schedule on achieving those costs synergies. And 
as you thi
nk about this transaction that we've put together here, closing end 
of 2017 timeframe, we're going to be way down the path of the integration 
activities and achieving those cost synergies and so forth.
 
The other element that was really critical in 
terms of achieving synergies 
from this was getting all of those content rights to distribute over our mobile 
platform. And so the DIRECTV Now, that required a lot of heavy lifting to go 
around all the content creators and get these new rights to distribute
 
this 
content over
-
the
-
top to our mobile providers. Those are largely done. We're 
a little over one year into this, and all those content agreements are 
basically in place. That was a lot of heavy lifting. There's been an 
unbelievable amount of work and ef
fort going into that. And now we're really 
early into deploying these new platforms. And I would tell you the more we 
get into the DIRECTV Now over
-
the
-
top platform, the more excited we get 
about the opportunity. And then as we think about the ability to b
ring Time 
Warner content into that, just the enthusiasm level just continues to go up 
and go up.
 
So I would tell you, I think the timing of the Time Warner deal as it relates 
to the integration of DIRECTV is actually a very good fit. I think the timing is 
very good bringing it in end of 2017, and we're going to be at a place where 
all of our installation crews for DIRECTV are integrated. We're doing one 
truck roll to the house. Our call center operations will be integrated at that 
point in time. And so a lo
t of what I'd call the key logistical difficult things to 
do in terms of integration, we'll have the lion's share of those done by end of 
2017. We still have some what I'll call big IT type things, information 
technology development that won't be completed
. But those aren't big rocks 
that are going to get in the way of trying to integrate Time Warner at this 
time.
 
Then lastly, I would tell you a deal like this, when Jeff and I met and we 
both gained conviction in terms of what was in the art of the possible
 
here 
as we put these two companies together, and we both became convinced 
and convicted that it was the deal that ought to happen. These kinds of 
deals you don't sit around and wait for the perfect timing. Once you have a 
deal and you have a deal structur
e, given the potential for leaks and so 
forth, the objective is to push them through and get them done. And that's 
exactly what we did here.
 
And so there's never a perfect time for a deal like this. But actually, I think 
this fits very well with our own in
tegration plans, and I also think it fits well 
in terms of how fast this industry is moving. The convergence in terms of 
media and distribution is moving fast. We want to be at the front of it. We 
don't want to be chasing it. And doing this deal now allows
 
us to lead in this 
type of convergence activity and bring stuff to our customers that they want 
before other people bring it to their customers. So I think the timing actually 
works out quite well.
 
Amir Rozwadowski

Barclays Capital, Inc.
 
And if I may, o
ne quick follow
-
up. What gives you comfort on the regulatory 
approval process?
 
Randall L. Stephenson 
-
 
AT&T, Inc.
 
So I'll lead in on this. I have David McAtee, who is our General Counsel at 
AT&T. And so I'm not a lawyer, but once Time Warner closes, I'll p
lay one on 
TV, okay? But I'll give you my layman's assessment of why I got comfortable 
with this, and then I'll let David clean up after me.
 
But when we looked at this, it's very clear that this qualifies, in every 
definition of the word, as a vertical mer
ger. It's a vertical integration. And 
most of the deals, in fact all of the deals that have gotten in trouble lately 
over the last few years have been horizontal mergers, where a competitor 
has been taken out of the marketplace or the regulators were conce
rned 
that a competitor would be removed from the marketplace. This is vertical. 
Jeff's company is a supplier to AT&T and it is a pure technical vertical 
integration. Vertical integrations, where regulators have concerns with 
those, are remedied or addresse
d 

 
those concerns are addressed through 
conditions.
 
And so we anticipate that the regulators may have some issues that they 
want to deal with on this. There may be conditions, but we're convinced that 
these type of issues can be handled with conditions, a
nd it's rare. In fact, 
I'm not sure we know of a situation where vertical integration has been 
blocked by the government in our two sectors. David, would you have 
anything to add to that?
 
David R. McAtee II 
-
 
AT&T, Inc.
 
Randall, that's right. What you've h
eard here today, Amir, is that in the 
mobile age, the legacy separation between content and distribution is really 
getting in the way of what consumers want. And it's only benefiting those 
entrenched incumbents who have little interest to change. And so as
 
a 
result, we are looking forward to the regulatory process, which is going to be 
guided by facts and guided by the law.
 
And Randall is right. When you look at the modern history of media and the 
Internet, the U.S. government has always approved vertical m
ergers like 
this, and they do so for good reason. They put downward pressure on 
consumer prices. They increase competition and consumer choice. And in 
our case, they spur the sort of innovation and investment that Randall and 
Jeff have talked about. So we 
enter this process confident. We don't 
prejudge the outcome. We stand ready to talk to the regulators and to 
address any concerns they have.

Please go ahead.
 
Simon Flannery

Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
 
Great, thank you very much. I am joined by Ben Swinburne here, who also 
has a question. Randall, you moved into content with Otter Media and the 
partnership approach, and you've been pursuing that road, and 
there are 
obviously some benefits to that approach. What was it that made you feel 
comfortable that you could move from a partnership so quickly to full control 
of a content company of the size of Time Warner? And then, Ben?
 
Benjamin Daniel Swinburne

Mor
gan Stanley & Co. LLC
 
Jeff, good morning. I just was curious. If you look at over the course of your 
leadership time at Time Warner, you had a lot of success creating value 
spinning off and distributing assets, most notably Time Warner Cable in 
2009. At th
at point, it seemed that the company had a strong view that 
content and distribution together was not synergistic. So I'm curious over 
the last seven years, what's changed in your mind to suggest now that 
combination is in fact attractive for your sharehol
ders?
 
Jeff L. Bewkes 
-
 
Time Warner, Inc.
 
Randall, do you want me to go first?
 
Randall L. Stephenson 
-
 
AT&T, Inc.
 
Jeff, you start off.
 
Jeff L. Bewkes 
-
 
Time Warner, Inc.
 
So two things. One is that the Time Warner Cable company and footprint 
was small. It 
was a regional cable company with the limitations that cable 
had at that time, about 12% of the country. And we weren't 

 
that's the first 
part. And it needed to get consolidated to get more efficiency in the scale of 
what it did. And we didn't think that 
would be as well accomplished for a 
number of reasons, financial structure, regulatory approval, as part of a 
media company that we had at that time.
 
The second thing, which I think is more important, is the world is much 
different now. You now have net ne
utrality in place. You've got broadband 
distribution. You have mobile as an ever
-
bigger part of the distribution 
package, and you have a lot of incoming new distributor or competition 
coming from Facebook, Netflix, Google, Amazon. And so as the distributio
n 
world changes, having distribution capabilities to innovate on mobile sets, 
across broadband, and with the ability to speak directly to consumers, offer 
customized subscription packages and more effective targeted advertising, 
it's both more competition 
on both sides, and it allows us to have our 
networks be more attractively offered to consumers. And what I mean by 
that is VOD with better interfaces. And I think that the distribution industry 

 
not AT&T and not Comcast, so far they've been good at this. 
But a lot of the 
distribution companies, particularly the cable companies have been slow to 
provide these innovations for consumers, and we think this will help spur 
that across the industry.
 
Randall L. Stephenson 
-
 
AT&T, Inc.
 
Furthering on Jeff's point an
d addressing, Simon, your question, the reason 
we believe that owning the content is so critical. When you're talking about 
doing really tight integration, ownership is always best. If you have to 
iterate and innovate quickly, it's really difficult to do i
n a partnering arm's 
length negotiated
-
type transaction. Our history is long in terms of examples 
of this; not the least of which was we had been, what I'd call, a tightly 
integrated reseller of DIRECTV for a long time. And it was an important part 
of our 
package. But you never could get the tight integration of the 
customer experience. We closed DIRECTV and we get the customer 
experience integrated. And then within one year, we've added 1.2 million 
DIRECTV customers. We've never even begun to approach a nu
mber like 
that when we were just partnering and reselling their product. And then as 
you think about, for example, the DIRECTV Now launch, we have been 
working three or four years to bring to market a mobile
-
centric package of 
content to our customers.
 
And
 
we have been working aggressively to put this together and getting the 
content creators to agree to the rights to put this over our mobile platform 
was proving to be very, very difficult. We closed DIRECTV, and with those 
great content agreements that we 
now own at DIRECTV, within one year 
we've achieved all of those content rights, literally within a year, something 
we've been trying to do three years we achieved in one year after owning 
DIRECTV. I am convinced that as we try to bring unique capabilities 
of 
content to our customers and really integrate 

 
I'm talking about integrating 
deeply, social aspects and interaction of our customers with content and so 
forth. As we try to do that, doing it in an ownership structure rather than a 
partnering structure,
 
will happen faster. And I'll say it again, that I believe if 
we're successful at this, it will drive the whole industry to begin to innovate 
faster and everybody will want to innovate on these platforms in this same 
way.
 
So there's a long history, Simon, 
of where you try to partner, you can get 
there. It's slow, it's painful, just the contracting itself takes a lot of time, 
whereas when it's completely owned, you just move a lot faster.

Hey, guys. Thanks. Randall, can you update us on the pace of improvement 
an
d the competitive environment in Mexico? And can you talk about what 
the Time Warner deal does 

 
what Time Warner does in Mexico and the rest 
of Latin America and how AT&T can push that harder? Thanks.
 
Randall L. Stephenson 
-
 
AT&T, Inc.
 
You bet. Mexico is 
going great. I think something that's been lost in the 
Mexico story is, Mexico City is like the largest 

 
one of the largest cities in 
the world. It's a sprawling major metropolis. And we have stood up in the 
course of one year a full scale LTE network tha
t is performing beautifully. 
And the business in terms of subscription growth continues to grow. Our 
distribution is growing beautifully. We're adding distribution at a very, very 
impressive pace, and that is individual who is leading that operation is jus
t 
doing a terrific job. And I will tell you, we just continue to gain more and 
more conviction around Mexico.
 
And we have a long way to keep growing in this business and we're looking 
forward to now, as we scale our mobile subscriber base, as we scale the 
LTE 
platform and get really robust capacity and coverage, then you can begin to 
think about the things we're talking about here, distributing content to our 
customers in Mexico. And Jeff has probably one of the best lineups of 
content in Latin America that
 
I've got to tell you, we're really enthusiastic 
about not just for Mexico delivering over our mobile platform, but 
throughout Latin America, where we have coverage in just about every 

 
I 
think all but two countries in Latin America with our satellite pro
duct. And so 
Jeff, if you would, I'd let you talk a little bit about the capabilities you have 
in Latin America.
 
Jeff L. Bewkes 
-
 
Time Warner, Inc.
 
Thanks, Randall. Our biggest overseas network business and sales business 
in Latin America, from Mexico all 
the way to Argentina, that's where we have 

 
we're the number one non
-
local channel provider across all of Latin 
America. We've got it on satellite with you at DIRECTV. We've got it in pretty 
much most of the cable and telcos. There is not yet as much broa
dband or 
mobile as there will be, but there is a real growth in that market.
 
We also have a 

 
we don't just have the U.S.
-
based networks like Cartoon, 
CNN, TBS, TNT, HBO that you all know. We also have a number of Latin 
American
-
based channels that strengt
hens our offering. So I think the match 
between the two of us in being able to help upgrade distribution and lead a 
real continuing buoyancy, just a secular take
-
up in Latin American countries 
of television services. It's a bit like where the U.S. was 20 y
ears ago. Now, it 
varies from country
-
to
-
country, but potentially all that growth of the golden 
era of more channels and more TV is coming now across Latin America.

invigorated, both the business execs, the creative and journalism 
executives, and I too will be staying. So as any normal evolution over the 
years af
ter that 

 
years we're talking about 

 
our next generation will be 
ready. And you've got some terrific execs at AT&T and in DIRECTV that can 
be part of this next wave of management. But that's the next generation and 
when it's ready, we'll hand over to the
m.
 
Randall L. Stephenson

AT&T, Inc.
 
And as Jeff and I were constructing this deal, there was not a single 
conversation we had, where I didn't talk to Jeff about talent. And keeping 
the talent in place was a critical piece of putting this deal together. A
nd Jeff 
has an employment structure that is really comforting to me in terms of how 
he has his people compensated and so forth. David 

 
and I know this will 
probably come as somewhat of a surprise to you, but I've never run a movie 
studio before.
 
And so ke
eping the talents and retaining the talent is really, really important 
to us. And I would tell you I feel like we have some good plans in place to 
ensure that we can keep the talent in place. The way we will organize the 
business, David, is Time Warner wil
l be a wholly
-
owned subsidiary of AT&T, 
and it will stand on its own and will continue to operate at very similar to 
how it's operated today. We'll have to figure out the management art of how 
we affect the data beginning to influence content and how we al
low the data 
and the customer insights that we have on our mobile platform and our TV 
platform to influence advertising that's delivered into the Time Warner 
advertising avails and how we begin to take advantage of that. And so there 
is a lot of integratio
n work that's done at that level, but Time Warner will be 
operated largely independent and as an independent subsidiary of AT&T. 
John, you want to talk about the rating agencies?
 
John J. Stephens 
-
 
AT&T, Inc.
 
Sure, thanks, a couple things. Rating agencies,
 
we've had conversations with 
them. They're still considering in the push and pulls of the situation. One is 
the amount of debt is large and we're all aware of that. On the other side, 
the ability to generate $60 billion of EBITDA and $45 billion, so to sp
eak, of 
annual cash from operations provides a great opportunity to service that 
debt.
 
Third, I think the agencies are evaluating the change, if you will, the 
diversification opportunities that this provides and the growth, the enhanced 
growth opportunity 
that provides. If you look at the transaction from a 
starting point on date of close, if you assume end of year kind of in the 2.7 
times range net debt
-
to
-
EBITDA and getting down to close to our traditional 
target of 1.8 times after four years, that abilit
y to lay that out gives us 
comfort that we certainly will remain investment
-
grade and would argue 
very strongly to keep our current ratings with those agencies. I would expect 
they'll come out with some interim announcements that will 

 
as they work 
throug
h the analysis, this is normal in this case. So that's really how we view 
it. From a rate perspective, I think the one thing I need to point out is over 
90% 
--
 
or about 90% of our debt is locked into rates with about a 14
-
year 
average life. We don't have m
uch floating debt at this time.
 
So first point I make to you is, this transaction really doesn't have 

 
has 
very minimal effect on our current interest expense cost for the legacy 
AT&T. When you layer on the towers of debt of Time Warner, they fit very 
nic
ely on top of the towers of AT&T, and give a very manageable, very easily 
managed process for refinancing or paying down debt, so we feel very 
comfortable with that. Our assumptions were very conservative. We took a 
step up from a 30
-
year bond rate that we
 
see today. We took a step up from 
that in our models in our traditional normal conservative approach. So we 
feel good about having the right level of interest expense for the 
incremental. And as I said, the basis is locked up for a long period of time. 
Th
anks, David.

er & Co., Inc. (Broker)
 
Thanks a lot. John, just two questions following
-
up on that. So in today's 
current rate environment, if you use more short
-
term debt, what type of 
rates do you think you can get? And secondly, just on the 

 
can you give us 
maybe som
e color on the cash tax rate going forward? And just a quick 
follow
-
up for Randall. Thank, John.
 
John J. Stephens 
-
 
AT&T, Inc.
 
Yeah, a couple of things. One, if you look at our overall average debt cost 
today, it's about 2.5% after tax. So pretty low, and 
that's with the longer 
term life, that's with the kind of 14
-
year average life. I think, Tim, you can 
see, it can certainly come below a 4.5% or 5% rate. You can certainly get 
down to the 3% on some of the short
-
term 

 
shorter term debt and even 
lower, dep
ending if you 

 
how you want to go to floating.
 
We're going to work out the syndication of the bridge loan in the coming 
days and weeks, and we'll finalize that, but I want to make sure we are 
viewing this as a longer
-
term step. So we're not looking and th
e deal is not 
based on getting short
-
term rates for the next few years, but there is 
opportunity there compared to our assumption.
 
Timothy Horan 
-
 
Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)
 
And the cash tax rate, John?
 
John J. Stephens 
-
 
AT&T, Inc.
 
Yeah. I think on the cash tax rate, if you see the 

 
the cash tax rate is going 
to stay very low through the bonus depreciation years. And if you look at 
Time Warner, their cash tax rate 

 
their effective tax rate is lower than ours. 
Their cash rate is sli
ghtly higher than ours. So over time we would continue 
to expect the cash tax rate to be below the book effective rate. And on a 
post
-
merger basis, the book effective rate will be lower than AT&T's is today.
 
Timothy Horan

Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)
 
Great. Randall, just quick question. It seems like zero rating is key part of 
the strategy here. Do you think that regulators are going to be okay with 
that strategy?
 
Randall L. Stephenson 
-
 
AT&T, Inc.
 
Regulators will be able to what, Tim?
 
Timothy Horan 
-
 
Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)
 
Zero rating, not charging for data usage of your own content. Will the 
regulators be okay with that do you think? That seems to be maybe the only 
real stumbling block on the transaction.
 
Randall L. Stephenson 
-
 
AT&T, Inc.
 
Tim, just I can't prejudge any of this. I just 

 
I really don't know. We're just 
going to have to get into the process and put the data out for the regulators, 
and then begin that effort and the sausage will come out the way the 
sausage comes out, right?

Our next question comes from the line of Frank Louthan, Raymond James. 
Please go ahead.
 
Frank Garreth Louthan

Raymond J
ames & Associates, Inc.
 
I guess just a follow
-
up with that, if the FCC does decide to look at things 
like rate regulation for broadband, how does that impact your view on the 
deal and the optionality that it gives you?
 
Randall L. Stephenson 
-
 
AT&T, Inc.
 
Fr
ank, the FCC has already started rate regulation reviews on broadband 
business, broadband services. And so look, that was always we felt the risk 
of Title II being implemented on top of this industry. I don't think it has any 
bearing, as you think about th
is deal. I mean, just rate regulation in general 
is just always the 

 
I think is one of the great contributors to uncertainty in 
an industry like this when it's so capital intensive. So we're hopeful. The 
Chairman of the FCC as well as the President, when 
Title II was discussed, 
both said that they had no intention to regulate prices of broadband. And so 
hopefully that will be the case as we move forward with this transaction.
 
Frank Garreth Louthan 
-
 
Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
 
All right, I guess a fol
low
-
up. Looking at the opportunities you have here, 
how does this impact your network plans with 5G and so forth? Are there 
additional opportunities here that could accelerate some of those plans after 
you close the deal?
 
Randall L. Stephenson 
-
 
AT&T, Inc.
 
I would say you should anticipate 

 
expect that to the extent that we can 
get the standards bodies moving and that we can get the vendor community 
moving that we would probably have a desire to move faster on 5G, 
certainly not slower. Our expectation is, 
as we begin to innovate with 
content, delivering content over these mobile networks, it's going to give us 
a lot more enthusiasm to go faster with 5G and not slower. And so we'll 
obviously do everything we can to try to accelerate all the efforts that are 
required to make this happen, but a lot of it is a logistical issue, standards 
bodies being set, getting equipment manufactured and so forth, but we're 
excited about it.
 
John J. Stephens 
-
 
AT&T, Inc.
 
Frank, this is John. One thing I'd point out, with 
the diversification of the 
revenue stream and the reduction in the capital intensity that Time Warner 
brings to us, it brings us a lot more financial flexibility. And as we believe 
this ability to curate video to generate advertising, to be more efficient 
in 
production with all the data and insights we'll have, that should bring us 
profitability or revenue enhancements growth that will allow those decisions 
to fund the 5G on a very efficient basis while we continue to really manage 
the health of the balance
 
sheet.
 
Randall L. Stephenson

AT&T, Inc.
 
It was a very elegant the way my CFO said yeah, he's preparing to invest.

Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Niknam, Deutsche Bank.
 
Please go ahead.
 
Matthew Niknam

Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
 
Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Just first on your core distribution 
business, with the decision to move into content on a larger scale, has 
anything changed with how you view the
 
economics of your distribution 
business?
 
And then secondly for John on synergies, maybe if you can, give us some 
more color on the timing of the synergy ramp post deal close. Thanks.
 
John J. Stephens 
-
 
AT&T, Inc.
 
So why don't I start off with the synergie
s? First I want to focus that these 
synergies are supply chain. They are vendor costs. They're corporate 
focused. We continue to expect the business units, specifically the three 
business units that we operate, and then really these are not personnel 
focus
ed. I just want to make sure that's clear.
 
When you think about our synergies, on a combined basis we'll be a 
company that spends close to $6 billion a year on advertising. And as we've 
proven, as our leadership and our corporate communications group has 
p
roven over the last year, we can mine savings out of combining two 
companies' advertising, corporate communications, because they've been 
very successful with that. We learned that from DTV.
 
If you look, quite frankly, at our telecom spend or Time Warner's
 
telecom 
spend, they're not an AT&T shop extensively today. We've got a real 
opportunity to provide really highest quality services, and really from an 
investment base that we already have. That goes for both wireless and 
wireline. So that's a very direct 
one.
 
If you think about the platforms, we've been moving very quickly and very 
effectively at building a platform for DTV Now to distribute video over all 
kinds of screens. With that, we now have that ability to share that platform 
and that distribution de
vice with HBO, with the Turner Networks, with the 
Warner Studios. We have a real opportunity to do that, and that's going to 
provide efficiency savings; and then frankly get into the things like what I 
call shared services, but efficiencies of payroll, eff
iciencies of accounts 
payable, efficiencies of cash management, all those kinds of things.
 
So we've done very detailed analysis of these cost
-
focused synergies. That's 
what gets us to the viewpoint that at the end of year three, we'll be on a run 
rate for 
$1 billion of cost savings and cash flow generation, and we feel very 
good about that. And once again, it's really focused on really the supply 
chain, and then of course the corporate structure, but we feel very good 
about achieving that.
 
Matthew Niknam 
-
 
Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
 
Got it. And on just the core distribution business and whether anything 
changed that spurred the push more aggressively into content?
 
Randall L. Stephenson 
-
 
AT&T, Inc.
 
No, the only thing that changed was our conviction about
 
the opportunity to 
bring into DIRECTV and the DIRECTV Now development our conviction that 
unique content could really, really provide a meaningful benefit to our 
customers and the ability to iterate and innovate on that on top of the OTT 
model. We're just
 
regaining a lot of conviction that this is going to be a 
really significant opportunity for our customers.
 
There is a huge customer base out there that we are convinced, while they 
don't subscribe to a bundle of premium content today at the right price 
po
int, over
-
the
-
top they will. And if you can bring a compelling price point 
and a compelling content package and some innovation with it, we are 
absolutely convinced that this is going to be very, very attractive for large 
group of customers who really aren
't even in the market today.

And that last question
 
comes from the line of Mike McCormack, Jefferies. 
Please go ahead.
 
Mike L. McCormack 
-
 
Jefferies LLC
 
Hey, guys. Thanks. David, maybe just a quick comment on the regulatory 
process. Could this be a DOJ
-
only process? And if so, how do you think they 
would look at it in the context of the Comcast
-
NBC deal? I guess one for 
Randall on just your view on the U.S. wireless market generally. Obviously, 
we're seeing a lot of diversification on AT&T's part. What do you think is the 
longer
-
term prognosis is in 
U.S. wireless given the competitive landscape? 
And I'll sneak one more in if I can on John Stephens just with respect to the 
handset adds. If it weren't for 2G losses this quarter, postpaid handsets 
would have been positive, I believe. As you step into 4Q,
 
you'll see some 
more pressure. But looking into 2017, is there a return to handset growth at 
some point?
 
David R. McAtee II 
-
 
AT&T, Inc.
 
Okay, Mike. David here. I'll start. You basically asked how will the regulators 
look at this deal. I think it's a wise
 
question. Let me focus on what I think is 
the most critical issue. The regulators will focus on what the market 
structure looks like today and then what the market structure looks like 
post
-
transaction. This is a very important point.
 
Point number one is 
the structure of this industry will not change. There's no 
loss of competition. There's no loss of competitors. From a horizontal 
standpoint, the structure remains very much similar as it was today. And 
that's exactly what Randall and Jeff have been talkin
g about in terms of the 
verticalness of this transaction. Point number two, the distribution model 
doesn't change. Time Warner has built an incredibly successful business 
distributing its content as widely as possible, and that won't change either.
 
So that
 
leads to the question of what will change, and that's what's so 
exciting about this transaction. When you bring together wireless and 
content for the first time, you create a unique company that can work within 
that industry structure to innovate in very 
important ways that benefit 
consumers. Number one, you're able to take that wide distribution of Time 
Warner content and you're able to broaden that distribution, especially in the 
mobile world. And number two, you've heard it discussed here today. You're 
able to, with that combined company, innovate new platforms, new video 
experiences, things that can't be done by arm's length contract alone. You 
can't innovate through arm's length contract arrangement.
 
And so by doing so what the regulators will be inter
ested in, first and 
foremost, is talk about what happens immediately after the transaction, and 
then talk about what happens thereafter. And so once regulators, we are 
convinced, understand the facts around what I've just described, they'll see 
a positive 
story when it comes to market structure and they'll see a positive 
story as it comes to innovation. And then ultimately we get to the point that 
Randall talked about earlier, is this innovation spurs more innovation, and it 
generates demand for video appli
cations over mobile networks that is 5G; 
that's Sprint. And so when you put all together, it's a very compelling case 
that we look forward to discussing with regulators.
 
You asked about whether it'd be a DOJ
-
only process or whether the FCC 
would be involve
d. We know at this point, of course, that DOJ will be 
reviewing the transaction. At this point, we are determining which FCC 
licenses of Time Warner, if any, would transfer to the new company. And 
obviously, if there are licenses to be transferred, the FCC
 
would review 
those.
 
Randall L. Stephenson 
-
 
AT&T, Inc.
 
Mike, as it relates just the U.S. wireless market, I think it's important to 
constantly remember in this industry how we cycle through times. We say, 
wow, it really is mature and it's just getting hyp
er competitive. And I can't 
help but reflect on 

 
I think it was 2005, shortly after we bought AT&T 
Wireless and we launched the Razr, the Motorola Razr. And I will never 
forget how many people would ask me, what are you going to do after 
everybody has a R
azr? This industry is mature, right? And, lo and behold, we 
invest in mobile broadband and smartphones come along. And smartphones 
take off and they become a catalyst for growth in this business for the last 
10 years, literally.
 
And while all this has been
 
going on in the smartphone, we have been 
accumulating rather aggressively, since 2012, a really big portfolio of 
wireless spectrum licenses. And we're sitting here today with 40 megahertz 
of fallow spectrum; fallow, waiting to be built into and deployed f
or video. 
Because now with these tablets and these smartphones everywhere, they're 
not just Internet access devices, they are video consuming devices. And so 
we have positioned ourselves to begin investing aggressively in ensuring 
that our customers can en
joy video. And now video and content that is 
uniquely curetted and developed for these kind of devices. And now we 
haven't even begun to talk about 5G. And as you think about 5G, video is a 
huge driver of it, but it goes so far beyond video, as we think ab
out where it 
goes in a world of 5G, 1
-
gig type networks.
 
Now virtual reality can truly become reality. Augmented reality now begins 
to manifest itself. We're talking about autonomous cars. I mean, I am 
convicted. We are going to have autonomous cars traver
sing our major 
metropolitan areas in the next five years in a really significant way, 
depending on who you talk to in the autonomous car business, the 
developers and the inventors. They believe that the bandwidth requirement 
of an autonomous car is 1
-
gigab
yte per car per mile, just huge bandwidth 
requirements; IoT, Internet of Things, healthcare.
 
I just think one of those moments where, yes, everybody has a smartphone, 
that smartphone is now becoming the launching point for what is next and 
we think what is
 
next is really significant. And we now have the largest 
connected car portfolio in the United States. We have most major 
automobile manufacturers contracted with AT&T. And so we just think 
there's a lot of opportunity left, Mike.

AT&T, Inc.
 
Hey, Mike, with regard to your last question, let me make one point first. On 
our branded phones, we had net adds this quarter. I want to make sure 
everybody knows that. Secondly, the 2G migration and
 
the decision to shut 
down that network on or about January 1 is impacting that and we had 
pressure in the quarter, particularly to our postpaid phone base because of 
that and that will alleviate next year, that's correct.
 
Third, we're seeing tremendous de
velopment for us in the prepaid space 
with the Cricket brand and adding significant customers there, a space that's 
still relatively new to us. We've been in it about two new years now in a 
significant way. It's what's helping drive margins. I'd say that h
as really 
improved the revenue growth, the profitability, and the customer accounts. 
And as we've talked about many times before, the cost of adding a prepaid 
subscriber is very, very low; no billing, no credit checks, no subsidies, and 
the ARPUs that we'r
e getting out of it is very good. So all that's happening 
and that's what's adding to these great margins, that's what's building these 
great margins.
 
The one thing I would point to you though, that we're more excited about 
than just pure count is the fact
 
that we added 700,000 smartphones during 
the quarter. So the devices that 

 
so that while our 

 
while our total net 
adds, our branded phone adds were certainly less than that 700,000, we are 
trading up to much higher quality customer, who has much more 
fu
nctionality with his phone, particularly in light of this transaction, much 
higher quality, capability to watch video and utilize the content that Time 
Warner brings, we feel very good in that position.
 
On a going forward basis, after we get through the 2G
, certainly we should 
see some of the 2G 

 
we will see the 2G pressures alleviate. But the focus 
for growth is what Randall really talked about in the sense of these platforms 
we've built, whether they'd be the connected cars, whether they'd be the 
Interne
t of Things, whether they'd be the various different capabilities we 
provide business and consumers in this Internet of Things environment, as 
well as the prepaid market, as we continue to take share and grow in that. 
So that's where we think this real opp
ortunity is.
 
Certainly, we'll continue to grow our smartphone base. I don't mean to imply 
we own it all, but it is a more mature market. It's the opportunity to 

 
if you 
will ship those feature phones to smartphones, and if that opportunity to 
play into a 
prepaid space and value customer space that hadn't been our 
focus for 

 
our lead focus for years now has become a very strong focus for 
us, and then the Internet of Things, the connected devices, which provide a 
dramatic opportunity for us, both from a bus
iness and a consumer customer.
 
Randall L. Stephenson 
-
 
AT&T, Inc.
 
So with that, we'll close. And I just 

 
I want to reiterate. I think Jeff and I, 
we both have to say, we couldn't be more excited about what we're putting 
together here. We think this is rea
lly, really going to be a unique 
opportunity. We believe that premium content always wins. And we've said 
this that it always won in the theater, it now wins in the home, and it is now 
winning in the mobile device. People want to consume premium content an
d 
we have now partnered and are working to combine forces with, we believe, 
the top premium content developer, aggregator, and distributor in the world. 
And so we're really looking forward to putting these two companies together, 
defining the future of med
ia and communications as they converge. We want 
to set the pace for this to happen. So thanks everybody for joining us and I 
appreciate your participation.

Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the 2016 
AT&T's Second Quarter Earnings Call. At this time all lines are in a listen
-
only mode. Later there will be an opportunity for your questions and 
instructions will be 
given at that time. . I'll now turn the call over to your 
host, Michael Viola, Senior Vice President Investor Relations. Please go 
ahead, sir.

Investor Relations
 
Thank you, Kathy, and good afternoon, everyone. Welco
me to the second 
quarter conference call. It's great to have you with us today. Joining me on 
the call today is John Stephens, AT&T's Chief Financial Officer.
 
We're going open with a summary of our results and then we're going to 
spend a little bit of time
 
providing a strategic update of our business. We 
thought this would be a great time to just take a step back and look at how 
we've repositioned our company the last few years. Let me remind you, our 
earnings material is available on the Investor Relations
 
page of the AT&T 
website. You can find the material at www.att.com/Investor Relations.
 
Now beforehand I hand the call off to John, I need to call your attention to 
one more matter. That's the safe harbor statement which is on slide three. It 
says that som
e of our comments today may be forward
-
looking, they're 
subject to risks and uncertainties, results may differ materially, and 
additional information is available on the Investor Relations page of the 
AT&T website. I also need to remind you that we're in a
 
quiet period for the 
FCC spectrum auctions and thus we cannot address any questions about 
spectrum today. And so with that, I'll now turn the call over to AT&T's CFO, 
John Stephens.

Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP
 
Thanks, 
Mike, and hello everyone. And thanks for being on the call today. 
It's been one year since we closed on our deal to acquire DIRECTV and it's 
been a heck of a year. We are hitting the mark with their synergy targets. 
Our cost synergies are ahead of plan and
 
we're about ready to take the 
wraps off some exciting new streaming opportunities that will expand our 
customer base and extend our video position. We've added nearly 1million 
U.S. satellite subscribers since we closed the deal. We were excited a year 
ago
 
when DTV first came on board, and that enthusiasm has only grown.
 
We'll talk more about that in just a few minutes. But now let me begin by 
discussing our second quarter results, starting with our financial summary 
on slide five. Second quarter consolidat
ed revenues grew to $40.5 billion, 
largely due to our acquisition of DIRECTV. But we also saw a growth in 
satellite video, advertising, and IP services on a comparable basis. This 
offset pressure from lower year
-
over
-
year wireless equipment sales and 
forei
gn exchange.
 
Adjusted earnings growth continued. After adjustments, second quarter EPS 
was $0.72 a share, up year
-
over
-
year and up about 7% year
-
to
-
date. This 
quarter's growth comes even with about $0.03 of earnings pressure from 
our Mexico wireless operat
ions. And, we had more than $0.01 of pressure 
from compensation
-
related programs tied to our stock price. Most of this is 
from a success
-
based compensation plan we have for our bargain floor 
(3:37) employees. We're please for our employees, all our employe
es, in 
that they have an opportunity to share in the success that they have helped 
create for our shareholders.
 
Margins also continue to be a solid story, thanks to our focus on profitability 
and our best ever wireless EBITDA margins. We once again saw adj
usted 
margin expansion on a consolidated basis and in every domestic business 
segment.
 
This solid performance helped drive strong cash flows. Operating cash flow 
was $10.3 billion, with free cash flow reaching $4.8 billion, up 8.4% year
-
over
-
year. Our divi
dend payout ratio for the quarter was 61% and year to 
date, it's 73%. Capital investment came in at $5.6 billion for the quarter and 
$10.3 billion year to date. We also continue to find ample demand and great 
rates in the securitization market to help us m
anage our Next receivable. We 
received about $1.1 billion in the second quarter, or about the same as last 
year's second quarter.
 
Let's now take a look at our operations, starting with business solutions; 
those details are on slide six. Total business solu
tion revenues were down 
slightly, due to the sale of certain hosting operations and foreign
-
exchange 
pressure. Solid wireless and strategic business service revenue gains helped 
offset lower wireless equipment sales and declines in legacy services. 
Busines
s wireless revenues were up 2%, with service revenue growth 
outpacing equipment declines. Margins also continued to expand, thanks to 
business efficiencies and wireless revenue growth offsetting lower wireline 
revenues.
 
Looking at the customer segments, Sm
all Business Operations continued to 
grow thanks to gains in wireless. Enterprise revenues were flat. However, if 
you adjust for the sale of our divested business and FX, that segment also 
continued to grow in the quarter. Strategic Business Services conti
nues to 
grow at a healthy clip, up more than $200 million year
-
over
-
year. That's up 
8.4% on a reported basis, and when you adjust for FX, growth was 9%. 
Strategic Business Services are now 36% of business wireline revenues. The 
growth of Strategic Business
 
Services and Mobility is changing the revenue 
mix in Business Solutions. Those two areas now make up more than 70% of 
Business Solutions revenues, and if you look at total data and wireless, 
that's more than 80% of business revenues. So our transformation
 
to next
-
generation products and services is well on its way in our business segment.
 
Now let's move to our Entertainment group results on slide seven. On a 
comparative basis, we grew revenues in our Entertainment group thanks to 
gains and satellite subscr
ibers, broadband revenue, and advertising. This 
more than offset losses in legacy services while also overcoming the 
pressure from the record
-
breaking Mayweather/Pacquiao pay
-
per
-
view event 
in the year
-
ago second quarter.
 
We continued to see solid gains in
 
broadband and advertising revenues. 
Broadband revenue was up nearly 7% in the quarter, with IEP broadband 
revenues up 15%. Advertising sales also continued its strong growth, up 
double digits year to date, and it's now more than a $1.4 billion annualized 
revenue stream. We're well positioned in this space and we're looking to 
play a leading role in taking our ad offerings across all screens. At the same 
time, we again saw continued margin expansion, which points directly to the 
benefits of the DIRECTV acqu
isition. Our margins on a comparable basis 
were up 90 basis points, and were up even more if you adjusted for the prior 
year pay
-
per
-
view event.
 
Our second quarter customer video metrics were impacted by the usual 
seasonal pressures but improved nicely ove
r last year. Our satellite net ads 
continued to be robust as we added 342,000 satellite subscribers in the 
quarter. More than 80% of our domestic video business is now on DIRECTV 
platform.
 
Broadband net subscriber results also were impacted by seasonality 
as we 
added 54,000 IP broadband subscribers in the quarter. When you include 
business subscribers, the company added 74,000 IP broadband subscribers. 
As we expected, this growth was below recent quarters with second quarter 
seasonality, but we expect IP br
oadband net adds to bounce back in the 
second half of the year.
 
Now, let's move to our U.S. Mobility results on slide eight. As a reminder, 
AT&T's domestic Mobility operations are divided between the Business 
Solutions and Consumer Wireless segments. For c
omparison purposes, the 
company is providing supplemental information for its total U.S. wireless 
operations.
 
Increasing profitability and a growing subscriber base continues to be the 
story in our wireless operations. For the second straight quarter, we t
urned 
in a record EBITDA margin of 41.4%. Service margins were also a record, 
reaching nearly 50% in the quarter. Both were up 130 basis points year
-
over
-
year. A sharp focus on cost efficiencies and fewer upgrades drove the 
margin expansion.
 
Equipment reve
nues were down due to a year
-
over
-
year increase in BYOD 
subs and a lower upgrade rate. Service revenues increased sequentially but 
were down year
-
over
-
year. At the same time, phone
-
only ARPU plus Next 
billing was up 2.5%, with average monthly billings grow
ing to $70. This 
growth comes even as we see an increasing number of subscribers holding 
on to their devices longer after completing their scheduled Next payments.
 
About half of our smartphone base is now on AT&T Next, but 75% of 
postpaid smartphone subscr
ibers are on a no
-
device subsidy plan. Postpaid 
churn came in strong, with its second lowest ever quarter at 0.97%. 
Postpaid phone
-
only churn was even lower, and smartphone churn was still 
lower. And even with the pressures from reseller, our total churn w
as very 
low at 1.35%.
 
Branded phone adds increased in the quarter. Branded domestic phone net 
adds, both postpaid and prepaid, were up 185,000, thanks to strength in our 
Cricket brand. We also continued to expand our valuable smartphone base, 
adding nearly
 
800,000 domestic
-
branded smartphones in the quarter. And if 
you look at the chart on the lower left
-
hand corner of the slide, you can see 
that our overall phone base has more subscribers today than we did a year 
ago, thanks to strength in postpaid and pre
paid smartphones. And our 
postpaid smartphone base by itself is up 1 million in the same time, as 
feature phones transitioned to smartphones.
 
We had another solid quarter in adding subscribers. Including our Mexico 
operations, we added 2.1 million new subs
cribers. That includes 1.4 million 
domestic wireless subs with connected devices, branded phones and tablets 
overcoming losses in reseller largely due to disconnects from our 2G 
network.
 
Prepaid net adds in the quarter were impacted by two events. First, w
e 
aligned our churn policy across our prepaid platform. This favorable impact 
was generally offset by the negative impact resulting from a network outage 
caused by a vendor's equipment.
 
As noted in our reseller numbers, we're starting to see some churn pre
ssure 
associated with the planned shutdown of our 2G network at the end of this 
year. That will increase as we move closer to the shutdown. We'll manage 
through the process and the cost savings from one less network to support 
will be meaningful; so will t
he additional spectrum available to redeploy.
 
Now, let's look at our international operations. That information is on slide 
nine. Let's start with Mexico. We continue to make significant progress in 
building our customer base and deploying our 4G LTE netwo
rk. We added 
742,000 wireless subscribers in the second quarter as we near the 10 million 
subscriber mark in the country.
 
Our LTE deployment also was on track. We now serve 65 million people in 
Mexico with our most advanced network, and expect to reach 75 
million by 
the end of this year. That brings our total North American LTE deployment to 
380 million POPs. Our rebranding to AT&T also continues to make progress. 
We now reach 61 cities with the AT&T brand, including our largest market, 
Mexico City.
 
Second
-
quarter revenue was up 13% sequentially, driven by equipment 
sales and wholesale revenues. Revenue growth was impacted by lower 
ARPUs, as the competitive environment has intensified. In Latin America, our 
DIRECTV operations continue to show revenue 
growth, up 8% sequentially. 
Revenues are being hampered by challenging economics, however, we did 
see subscriber growth, adding 87,000 video customers in the quarter, in part 
due to the Copa America Soccer Tournament. But as you might expect, the 
earthquak
e in Ecuador did pressure our overall subscriber growth in Latin 
America. But even with these economic conditions, we continued to be 
profitable and generate positive cash flow from these operations for the 
quarter.
 
Now that we're midway through the year, 
let's take a look at how we are 
doing relative to the guidance we set out in January. That's on slide 10. 
We're on track to meet or exceed each of the metrics we have laid out for 
you. Consolidated revenues are growing at a double
-
digit pace, thanks to 
our
 
acquisition of DIRECTV. This comes even with pressure from lower 
equipment sales and foreign exchange.
 
Adjusted EPS is up about 7% year
-
to
-
date, above guidance, but in line with 
where we expected to be at this time. Consolidated margins are stable, as 
mar
gin expansion in our domestic operations is offsetting investment 
pressure from Mexico. We are focused on growing our valuable subscriber 
base across our business, including Mexico, where growth has been strong. 
We are willing to make additional investment
s to gain quality customers.
 
Capital investment is trending to the low end of our guidance at its current 
pace, and we are ahead of plans with free cash flow. Dividend coverage for 
the first half of the year was 73%. We continue to feel confident that we w
ill 
meet or beat our free cash flow guidance for the year.
 
Now, I'd like to spend the remainder of our time providing a strategic update 
on our business. That begins on slide 12. As Mike mentioned, we have often 
updated you on our company strategy and dire
ction. But today, we'd like to 
take a longer look at how we have uniquely positioned AT&T to lead in the 
rapidly evolving world of communications and video entertainment. Our goal 
is to be the world's premier integrated communications company, for both 
con
sumers and businesses, and we plan to do this in the most cost
-
efficient 
way possible.
 
This strategy did not happen overnight. It has been part of every business 
decision we've made for many years. No one else has our portfolio of assets. 
No one else has o
ur cost structure opportunity. And no one else can offer the 
integrated solutions that we can.
 
Behind all this is a solid financial foundation that gives us the strength and 
flexibility to invest in our business while returning value to shareholders. 
This 
includes our strong liquidity position, our market
-
based compensation 
and benefit plans, and thoughtful debt management.
 
For example, we successfully negotiated workforce contracts that are 
market
-
based but also encourage employees to keep our owners' inte
rest in 
mind while rewarding them when we succeed for shareholders. We also have 
a world
-
class board of directors, who provide great insight while at the same 
time, challenge us. This makes us stronger and helps us navigate through 
these transformative tim
es. We are uniquely positioned in this industry. All 
of this will be critical as mobile broadband, high
-
speed connectivity and 
entertainment come together.
 
Let's first talk about the connectivity building blocks that we have assembled 
on slide 13. Since th
e introduction of the first smartphone, we've seen 
unprecedented growth in mobile data traffic. Even more incredibly, we 
expect that to continue to grow at a very strong pace. To meet this demand, 
we undertook several strategic initiatives to improve the c
apacity of our 
network for today and the years to come.
 
Here is what we've accomplished. First, we ratcheted up our investment 
cycle with Project VIP. This was crucial in getting the high quality, high 
capacity network we have today. Our 4G LTE network dep
loyment was 
accelerated 

 
fiber backhauled, deployed, and cell sites built. We now have 
almost 70,000 cell sites, thousands more than our largest competitor and 
our move into the Mexico wireless market further expands our LTE reach. 
We also drove fiber dee
per in our wireline network. We added more than one 
1 million business locations to our fiber network and we expanded our IP 
broadband footprint to more than 60 million customer locations.
 
The next phase of driving fiber into our network is our GigaPower 
d
eployment. Over the next few years, we expect to reach at least 12.5 
million customer locations with our gigabit broadband service. We now have 
more than 2.2 million fiber
-
to
-
the
-
home customer locations and we expect 
to reach 2.6 million or more by the end
 
of the year. Our already dense 
wireless network and expanding fiber footprint puts us in an excellent 
position as we move to more small cells and 5G. We've already filed patents. 
Trials are already underway, and testing is ongoing. When 5G is ready to 
rol
l, we will be ready as well.
 
At the same time we launched VIP, we moved to expand our spectrum 
portfolio. We have about 150 MHz of spectrum in our portfolio today, 
including 40 MHz of relatively untapped AWS and WCS spectrum. We have 
the best, most balance
d spectrum portfolio in the industry. Adding spectrum 
is the most effective way to add capacity. This year, we expect to add 
35,000 LTE carriers compared to the 18,000 deployed last year. We also 
continue to make smaller spectrum deals to round out our cov
erage and 
redeploy spectrum once dedicated to 2G and 3G.
 
Last week's move by the FCC to make high
-
frequency radio spectrum 
available for 5G wireless service is another step forward, providing us more 
spectrum. And while we are not going to elaborate, AT&T 
has applied to be a 
participant in the broadcast spectrum auction and has also submitted a bid 
in the FirstNet process that is currently underway.
 
Our network transformation is now pivoting to software
-
defined networking 
or SDN. With SDN, we are virtualizi
ng network functions that used to require 
dedicated fixed equipment and software. SDN gives us flexible, dynamic and 
smart network capabilities. We ended last year with about 5% of our 
network functions virtualized and expect to reach 30% by the end of thi
s 
year. We are on path to achieve 75% network virtualization by 2020. SDN 
also provides cost savings, which supports our drive to an industry
-
leading 
cost structure. Let's discuss that on slide 14.
 
Having an industry leading cost structure helps us expand 
margins and grow 
free cash flow. We now have a line of sight to continue margin improvement 
as well as reaching our goal of $20 billion in free cash flow. This is what we 
need to do to reach those goals. Step one, is achieving the cost synergies 
from our D
IRECTV acquisition. We are on track to achieve $1.5 billion
-
plus 
run rate synergies with DTV by the end of this year. That puts us well on our 
way to hit our projected $2.5 billion
-
plus run rate savings by the end of 
2018.
 
Step two is our work to drive eff
iciencies with Project Agile. This work 
includes our efforts to serve customers digitally, automating service delivery, 
streamlining operations, and other cost efficiency initiatives. Our goal is to 
generate a $3 billion run rate in cost savings and we are
 
moving past the 
midway point of making that happen. We also have not been shy about 
exiting non
-
strategic businesses that don't fit our margin expansion profile. 
That includes global hubbing, and more recently, certain hosting operations. 
Obviously, that 
reduces revenue but increases overall profitability.
 
Finally, we must continue to lead the industry in our move to software
-
defined networking. We are virtualizing functions that previously required 
dedicated solutions, dedicated hardware, dedicated softwa
re, dedicated 
teams. This virtualization manifests itself into real sustained cost
-
savings 
throughout the network and the business. That's savings in both our capital 
expenditures and our cash operating expenses. It also gives customers 
greater control of 
their network services, more agility and simplicity in the 
way they do business with us, as well as better value on ours and our 
customers' hardware investments.
 
Now, let's look at something that really separates us from the rest of the 
industry 

 
our inte
grated solutions approach. That's on slide 15. While it 
starts with connectivity, and cannot be sustained without an effective cost 
structure, you must have assets to create products customers want, 
delivered where and how they want them to be successful.
 
We've talked about these assets, but let's bring this point home. We are in 
every major market in the U.S. with reach around the world. We have a 4G 
LTE footprint that covers 380 million people in North America. We have more 
fiber connecting more buildings
 
and more business customer locations than 
anyone else 

 
that's in footprint and out 

 
which helps us compete today but 
also positions us very were for 5G. And we're also the biggest TV provider in 
the world, and we're about to introduce an over
-
the
-
top pr
oduct that we 
believe will be a game changer. DIRECTV now is scheduled to launch later 
this year, and we expect the millions of people who don't now subscribe to a 
video service and prefer a streaming option will be impressed.
 
At the same time, no one can 
match what we offer business customers. We 
have the ability to serve all business customers, from Fortune 1000 
companies to the local ice cream shop on the corner. And no matter how big 
or how small the business is, almost every conversation with business 
customers begins with mobility and security, and that is where we excel. 
When you take our extensive fiber network, then layer on SDN, security and 
mobility, and new software
-
enabled services, you have the premier 
integrated business services company.
 
We b
elieve we have a significant competitive advantage to use our 
connectivity and cost structure to offer integrated solutions to our 
customers. Whether you are in the C
-
suite of a major company to the 
master suite of your own home, and anywhere between, AT&T
 
delivers. We 
have a robust, dynamic, and attractive set of products architected on a 
network that is flexible and able to quickly adapt to the future. That's table 
stakes if you want to be the world's premier integrated communications 
company, and that is
 
exactly what we expect to be.
 
Now before we get your questions, allow me to quickly summarize, and 
that's on slide 16. We are very confident in our unique strategy. We have 
the assets we need and we are executing on our plan. Our DIRECTV cost 
synergies ar
e hitting the targets. Project Agile is on track. And we are ahead 
in the move to software
-
defined networks. All this drives us towards an 
industry
-
leading cost structure.
 
But we're most excited about what lies ahead. We have a dedicated and 
skilled group 
of people working for us. From the crews staffing our work 
centers to leaders in the boardroom, we have a team of professionals 
focused on making AT&T the world's premier integrated communications 
company. Our differentiated position opens the door for som
e game
-
changing opportunities, and we're ready to walk through it. We're confident 
we can execute on our strategy and continue to build value for our 
shareholders. With that, let's go to your questions.

Thank you. Our f
irst question will come from David Barden with Bank of 
America. Go ahead, please.

Bank of America Merrill Lynch International 
Ltd.
 
Hey, guys. Thanks so much for taking the questions. John, it looks like, in 
terms of the guidance as y
ou kind of walk through it on slide 10, you're kind 
of tracking ahead of where you thought you'd be at this point in the year. As 
we look to the second half, could you talk about the major variables that 
would kind of maybe swing you back down towards more
 
the base case 
expectation for the year versus the 

 
or better part of the guidance that you 
were discussing?
 
And then second, I was wondering if we could just touch on this issue of kind 
of the economics of postpaid sub losses versus prepaid sub gains. I guess 
you had about 319,000 prepaid gains versus 180,000 postpaid losses. Could 
you talk about the relative ec
onomics of those two things? And are we 
looking at a net economic positive or negative trade
-
off when we look at 
that? Thanks.
 
John J. Stephens 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP
 
Thanks. Thanks, David. Let me take the second question first. On
 
the 
economics, so forth, the postpaid subs were losing a lot of feature phones. 
They're averaging about somewhere around $35, maybe a little bit less, than 
ARPU, and have costs associated 

 
the postpaid do 

 
with retaining them. 
On the prepaid side, we're
 
probably closer to a $41, $42, depending upon 
the specifics, average ARPU, and much less 

 
they're very, very small 
subscriber acquisition costs, upfront costs, maintenance costs by the very 
nature of being prepaid.
 
So from that standpoint, the economics 
are better, and it is being shown in 
our margins. When you look at our margins 

 
total EBITDA margins or 
service margins 

 
you can see that growth, and you can see the level. That's 
a part of what's driving it. So the economics are 

 
and we're running the 
business on a branded basis 

 
we think of branded customers and try not to 
make distinctions on classification. Really makes distinctions on economics, 
and I think it's showing up in our profitability.
 
With regard to the variables in the second half, there
's a lot of things that 
happen in the second half. There's some seasonality in the fourth quarter in 
our wireless business. In our video business, we'll have the NFL Ticket come 
out and we'll have the launching of the DTV Now, and some of the over the 
top 
offers. So we'll have a whole host of things going on. I would just 
suggest to you we're very confident where we're at. We continue to do well. 
And I wouldn't suggest to you that there's anything necessarily unique or 
different about the second half of the
 
year. It's just we're careful with our 
guidance and want to make sure we meet or exceed it; so we feel very good 
about we're at through six months.

Our next question will come from Phil Cusick with JPMorgan. Go ahead, 
please. Mr. Cusick, is your phone on mute?
 
Philip A. Cusick

Can you hear me, guys?
 
Jo
hn J. Stephens

We can, Phil.
 
Philip A. Cusick 
-
 
JPMorgan Securities LLC
 
Thanks very much. So, a little bit along the lines of David's second question, 
when would you expect we'd see more integrated promotions
 
for video and 
mobile services? And you've talked in the past about having some excess 
margin to give up to drive faster sub growth. Do you feel like you've been 
doing that already or is that still pending? Thanks.
 
John J. Stephens 
-
 
Chief Financial Office
r & Senior Executive VP
 
Thanks, Phil. So first of all, we have been doing some promotion, some 
offers, some marketplace adjustments based on how we look at the 
marketplace. So, some of that is already impacting our results, and we're 
still doing quite, qui
te well in margins with that. Secondly, our first 
integrated product, I'd refer you to is the 5 million customers who have 
already signed up who have a bundle of our in
-
home video product, whether 
it be U
-
verse or satellite 

 
DIRECTV satellite 

 
and our wi
reless. It's been 
successful. We've seen very positive results from our customers, so it is 
going well. You will see us continue to push that offering as well as others.
 
And then, I would suggest to you you'll see more things come out as we roll 
out our ov
er
-
the
-
top offerings and other aspects. But right now, we are 
seeing some improvement in our attach rate of IP broadband with our video 
sales. And that is improving as we see the trends for the last four or five 
months. And we would expect to see some cont
inued positive bundling, if 
you will, of wireless and video, as we've already seen 5 million people sign 
up for it.
 
Philip A. Cusick 
-
 
JPMorgan Securities LLC
 
John, you mentioned DIRECTV Now. What's the long pole for getting that out 
at this point?
 
John J.
 
Stephens 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP
 
I think there is a whole host of activities going on. I would suggest to you 
it's this way. While I believe that everything is moving well and all on our 
timeline that we've targeted, the biggest gu
idance piece on it is going to be, 
we're going to want to make sure it comes out with high quality and high 
performance. And so, as we develop this and test it, that will determine its 
timeframe. We'll want to make sure when it comes out, it's the high
-
qua
lity 
product.
 
If you think about the technology development, that's on track. If you think 
about the assets we need to provide that, those have been acquired; those 
are on track. If you think about the contracts we need to get the stacking 
rights and digit
al rights, those are going well. It's just a matter of getting all 
of those things coordinated together and then make sure it's the highest 
quality product you can have at launch. But we are confident in that process, 
and feel good about targeting the end 
of this year to get that out.
 
Philip A. Cusick

JPMorgan Securities LLC
 
Do you have a widespread beta product of that yet, even without all the 
content?
 
John J. Stephens 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP
 
Yeah, we are going through 
various levels of testing of everything, but we're 
not going through a detailed public discussion of that. But as you can 
imagine, we're going through a variety of levels of testing of that. But this is 
something we've been working on for a while 

 
feel re
al good about.

Thank you. Our next question comes from John Hodulik with UBS. Please go 
ahead.
 
John Christopher Hodulik
 
-
 
UBS Securities LLC
 
Great, thanks. John, maybe pointing to the build
-
up of the $20 billion free 
cash flow number on slide 14, it looks like you're at about a $16 billion base 
in 2016 here. You've got another $1.0 billion in synergies and another $1.5 
bil
lion in Project Agile. Is the rest 

 
come from virtualization over that 
period? If you could give us a little more detail on that, and I would imagine 
you'll be paying some more taxes over time as well. So, how does it all fit 
together to sort of bridge us
 
to that $20 billion number?
 
And then, as you talked about in the 

 
some previous slides, you're a little 
bit 

 
you've underspent the $22 billion bogey on CapEx a little bit here in the 
first half. Does that mean there's 

 
we have a sort of downward bias t
o 
CapEx at this point? Thanks.
 
John J. Stephens 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP
 
Thanks, John. A couple of things. One, if you think about the free cash flow 
and you think about the $15.9 billion that we started with last year, and you 
add i
n the kind of the $2.5 billion dollar opportunity with DIRECTV. You add 
in the 

 
with the remainder of the $3 billion opportunity from Agile. And then 
you add in maybe a 1%, I'll say is an illustrative, reduction in capital 
intensity and some costs 

 
some 
cash operating expense savings 

 
you can 
see that those three items there can get you well over $5 billion.
 
In addition, we expect to grow our EBITDA and grow our profitability of the 
business. And so, when you put those things together, it looks to be an 
achievable, real, realistic path from last year's $15.9 billion to a $20 billion 
number as a goal in the near future. And so, that's what we are looking at. 
That's how we build it up. We're not giving a prediction date on that, but we 
feel good about the o
pportunities to significantly grow free cash flow.
 
With regard to our CapEx, just want to be very straightforward in the sense 
that we are at $10.3 billion, and on an annualized basis, that would come 
below the $22 billion. We will continue, as I've said b
efore, to invest as 
appropriate, not towards a targeted $22 billion number, but rather towards 
a, what business cases make sense, and when it makes sense for us to be in 
the market investing. Sometimes that causes quarters to be much heavier in 
CapEx, like
 
we had in the fourth quarter last year. And other times, like in 
the first six months this year, we spend at a lower rate. We're just being 
very careful with every dollar. But right now, the performance we've had for 
the first six months is a trend to 

 
o
n the low end of our guidance.

Thank you. We now have a question from Mike McCormack with Jefferies. Go 
ahead
, please.
 
Mike L. McCormack 
-
 
Jefferies LLC
 
Hey, thanks. Hey, John, just maybe a couple of things. First, going back a 
little bit on the postpaid handset side. It looks like 

 
obviously, feature 
phones have come down dramatically over the past eight quarte
rs or so. As 
that sort of approaches a lower level, does that provide a tailwind to get 
postpaid phone additions back to a positive territory? And obviously, you've 
got DTV cross
-
selling, DTV Now products rolling out, or over
-
the
-
top 
products rolling out. 
I presume that could also help. And then, just secondly 
on the video adds for the year, the anticipation there, is it that DIRECTV 
continues to ramp? You've been doing a great job, but is it that or is it U
-
verse becoming less of a headwind in the back hal
f of the year to get to a 
positive video number?
 
John J. Stephens 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP
 
Thanks, Mike. First of all, on the postpaid handset side 

 
or on the handset 
side 

 
we do think the 2G losses, as we go through the year, we'l
l see those. 
But getting past this year, you'll see the opportunity to have a more positive 
impact because we're through that process. Secondly, our feature phones, 
which include some 2G devices, but our feature phones are going down and 
as they go down an
d that, if you will, legacy product, so to speak, impact on 
our results is lessened, certainly we have a brighter opportunity 

 
a better 
opportunity to grow out of those customer base.
 
And then third, on the bundling, as we really get into the second half 
of the 
year and are able to do single
-
truck install, which may be bundling of video 
and satellite and broadband, but also, that whole activity of bundling, the 
more time our teams get to do it, the better we'll get at it. And so from that 
perspective, we d
o think that'll provide us an opportunity to grow more 
wireless.
 
So all three of those things will help, and yes, we're optimistic about it. But I 
will tell you also, it's really about the branded net adds and the economic net 
adds. It's not about any one 
category of net adds. It's getting those 
customers that are the most profitable, the highest quality.
 
With regard to the video side, on a seasonality basis, we usually do see less. 
We see more pressure in the second quarter than the first half from the U
-
v
erse side. And from, and quite frankly, so has DTV in the past. So going 
forward, I would hope that we would see 

 
we'd expect to see 

 
some 
improvement on both sides. When you think about DIRECTV, things like the 
NFL Ticket Sunday, and some of the other o
ffers, as we see these trends of 
bundling improving an attachment rates improving, we feel really good 
about the opportunity to improve our trends and get to our goal of positive 
video net adds for the year.

Thank you. We have a question from Amir Rozwadowski with Barclays. 
Please go ahead.

Barclays Capital, Inc.
 
Thank you very much and good after
noon, John and Mike.
 
John J. Stephens

Hi, Amir. How are you?
 
Michael J. Viola 
-
 
Senior Vice President
-
Investor Relations
 
Hey, Amir.
 
Amir Rozwadowski 
-
 
Barclays Capital, Inc.
 
Good. John, so if we can touch upo
n that bundling question a bit more. If we 
go back to last year at the analyst update, post the close of the DIRECTV 
deal, you had highlighted some potential areas for revenue synergies driven 
by some level of cross
-
pollination of your respective customer 
bases. And I 
was wondering, where are you folks along that line? You had highlighted like 
there were, I believe, 15 million DIRECTV homes that don't have AT&T 
wireless, for example. Other opportunities seemed to be broadband plus 
video offering. Are you st
ill at the early stages of that deployment? I'm just 
trying to assess, sort of, what kind of runway you do expect from a bundling 
opportunity perspective?
 
John J. Stephens 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP
 
Yeah, Amir, I would suggest we're at
 
the early stages when you think about 
getting the workforce trained in all aspects of being able to cross
-
sell and do 
the bundling in the cross 

 
and do single
-
truck roll installs and so forth 

 
it 
takes a while. We have that completed; we have that proce
ss. But even as 
they all have been trained and they've all started to do it, it still takes some 
time 

 
even with the great workforce like we have 

 
to get really proficient 
at it. And we'd expect to start seeing that, as we've said all along, show 
some be
nefits in the second half of this year.
 
But once again, I would suggest to you, the team's done a really good job of 
doing the bundling between wireless and the video products alone. And 
getting 5 million of these customers to sign up for this bundled appr
oach 
with regard to video and wireless, is just the best proof I can offer you that 
we've already done, they've already accomplished, that this works and that 
we have a real opportunity to exceed our merger integration synergies 
because we'll have an oppor
tunity to add revenues to those. Well, most of 
those synergies were really focused on costs.
 
Amir Rozwadowski 
-
 
Barclays Capital, Inc.
 
That's very helpful. And a follow
-
up, if I may. If we look at the current U.S. 
mobile competitive environment, one of you
r competitors notably instituted 
a price increase, which can somewhat imply a belief that the competitive 
landscape is not as pronounced as it once was. If we look at your service 
revenue trajectory in mobile, we still see some impact from stable declines 
in ARPU. Is there potential opportunity for adjusting pricing, particularly 
around bundled offerings or anything along those lines that could provide 
some relief to the trajectory of service revenue there?
 
John J. Stephens 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer & Senio
r Executive VP
 
Well, Amir, once again, let me point you to kind of a complete picture of 
that. As we mentioned in the prepared remarks, the ARPU's right at $70 on 
a per
-
customer basis when you take into account the total billings. Those are 
really impressi
ve levels, very good for us historically from any measurement 

 
our straight ARPU prior to the equipment installment days, or in the most 
recent years, with the equipment installment. So, on a monthly basis from 
our customers, we're doing very, very well w
ith the revenue base.
 
Secondly, it is a competitive environment, and it will 

 
and it has been for 
years 

 
and it will remain that. We believe that we are doing well with that, 
and we think it's proven out in our margins, in our profitability, and in our 
c
ash flows.
 
I will tell you just one side item that we mentioned in the prepared remarks. 
We had about 500,000 BYOD devices. We had customers walk in with 
500,000 phones and said, can we connect them to your network? Those are 
all net adds. They don't show 
up in equipment revenue. And depending upon 
what package they show up, they'll show up in service revenues. But they 
are really profitable. They're low cost. We love them. That doesn't 
necessarily show up in your immediate look at the financials, but it is
 
clearly 
showing up in our profitability and our margins. So, I would ask you to focus 
on those items as well as our service revenues.
 
Specifically with regard to our service revenues, you've seen our additional 
piece of our customer base shift to Mobile S
hare Value. I think we went from 
about 64% up to 75%. We did have some additional customers shift off of 
the 

 
shift to the no
-
subsidy plans 

 
which impacted service revenues. And 
we continue to do normal promotions through some of the incentives, 
credits,
 
free services 

 
normal promotion activity. All of those things are 
impacting service revenues as expected.
 
With regard to recent activities in the marketplace, we'll see how those play 
out. We're just focused on getting the best quality customers and prov
iding 
really great service. Some of the changes we've seen give us reason for 
optimism. Many of the changes we've seen give us reasons to be real careful 
and watch how the market develops, and be ready to prepare and lead, 
quite frankly, in a market with t
he performance that we've got.

Thank you. And we'll go now to Jeff Kvaal with 
Nomura. Please go ahead.
 
Jeffrey Kvaal 
-
 
Nomura Securities International, Inc.
 
Yes. Thanks very much. I'd also like to add a competitive question to the 
mix. Typically, of course, the second half, the fourth quarter, a little bit more 
competitive. Do you f
eel like you are going to be as competitive as you've 
been last year? Is the goal to increase the number or the mix of net adds 
that you retain relative to where you've been over the past couple years? 
Just in general, how you feel about your subscriber ba
se and your mix of net 
adds would be great.
 
And then, secondarily, if there's anything then you can share on where in 
your CapEx budget you have been able to do better, whether it's labor or 
equipment or what have you, that would be super helpful. Thank yo
u.
 
John J. Stephens 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP
 
Okay. Well, the second one first. On the CapEx budget, we've done well, 
kind of in all aspects of it. A couple of things. One, we've been able to 

 
because of our software
-
defined network 

 
we're starting to see a little bit of 
those savings. If you think about our buying capacity and the overall 
economic conditions, we've been able to get some volume pricing and some 
purchasing power benefits. Certainly, we're getting more efficient with w
hat 
we do.
 
I will tell you, though, that one of the things I think people miss out on is 
that because of the spectrum that we've invested in over the last, say, five 
years or so, we've got a lot of effective capital deployment that doesn't 
involve a lot of
 
dollars. It involves deploying spectrum, and that's a really 
efficient way to deploy capacity. And so, on a per
-
unit of capacity, our 
dollars can be really efficient because of the spectrum portfolio that we have 
that we're putting in use. I think that's 
a real big benefit.
 
From a customer base perspective, we're very pleased with the subscriber 
base we have, whether it's the business subscriber base that we have, what 
we saw in the small business side and the growth there, whether we see it in 
the enterpr
ise side. When you look at the consumer side, the prepaid 
business is growing well, and quite frankly, the margin improvement from 
Cricket is helping drive the margin improvement in the overall business of 
wireless. So, that's great. And then of course, so
me of the premier 
customers in the video space are using our U
-
verse and our DTV services.
 
So, we feel great about our customer base. With regard to that, we're willing 
to invest dollars to retain and attract additional quality customers, whether 
here in t
he United States or in Mexico and Latin America. We'll be focused on 
that but we'll be careful with it. I would suggest to you the characteristics 

 
the titles we give those prepaid, postpaid, over the top versus monthly 
subscription 

 
are less important a
s the economics of the profitability of 
those offers. And that's what we'll be focused on.
 
Jeffrey Kvaal 
-
 
Nomura Securities International, Inc.
 
Okay, John. So that sounds like you are perhaps expanding the range of 
subscribers that you might defend or tar
get than you might have 

 
than 
relative to last year. If that makes sense.
 
John J. Stephens 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP
 
Well, I'll say it this way. When your margins expand as much as ours have 

 
about 130 basis points in both EBITDA se
rvice and, for example, in wireless, 
or in total margins 

 
you have more room and more customers fall within 
that profitability level that are appropriate.
 
Jeffrey Kvaal 
-
 
Nomura Securities International, Inc.
 
That's well said. Thank you.
 
John J. Stephens 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP
 
Yeah. That's really what's going on. The team's done such a great job 
expanding margins, they've created more room to be competitive. It's the 
team's credit.

Thank you. Our next question will come fr
om Brett Feldman with Goldman

Brett Feldman

Goldman Sachs & Co.
 
Thanks. John, you noted that you're on track to deploy fiber to 12.5 million 
customer locations. You have 12.6 million IP broadband customers today, 
but there are 60 
million homes in your wireline region that could get a 
broadband line. So I'm curious, as you're doing the fiber deployment, how 
are you deciding which are the right homes to upgrade in terms of whether 
you should simply upgrading existing customers or how
 
do you determine 
whether it's a business case to go to some of those homes that you don't 
serve and deploy fiber there?
 
John J. Stephens 
-

There's two things that 

 
I mean, the first thing I'd tell you, Brett 

 
is that 
the ability to build the fiber to the home is a larger footprint than just the 60 
million. So we can take the economics of going into some appropriate 
customer basis, whether it's an opportunity for real 

 
better economics, 
better profitability. 
So, we have that kind of business
-
case process to it.
 
Secondly, I would tell you that with regard to the FCC agreement, there's 
particulars within the agreement that allow us to build 

 
count so many 
greenfield builds, count so many more upgrades in the ex
isting IP broadband 
footprint 

 
to utilize in some cases multiple dwelling units, and then in many 
cases require some level, or a significant level I should say, of new builds. 
So, we have to coordinate all of that, take all of that into consideration. 
Whe
n you're done with that, you may still have some profitable builds that 
are at or above the 12.5 million commitment and you may go ahead and 
build those. We'll see where that goes over time and we'll see where that 
leads us.
 
But the ability or the schedule
 
to build is an economics activity, a business
-
case activity with, of course, the opportunity to over
-
build in some areas 
being probably more timely and less expensive. But that might be capped by 
some of the regulatory agreements that we have in place, an
d we're going 
to certainly be respectful of those. But overall, it's kind of a normal business
-
case process and where we can serve our customers the best and get the 
best returns for them and us.
 
Brett Feldman

Goldman Sachs & Co.
 
Got it. And just as a fo
llow
-
up to make sure I heard that right, I think you 
said that you are considering taking fiber outside of your traditional wireline 
region if the business case makes sense. Is that 

 
did I hear that correctly?
 
John J. Stephens 
-
 
Chief Financial 
Officer & Senior Executive VP
 
We've already done it. We've already done that in many cities. So, I don't 
want to suggest to you that we haven't.
 
Brett Feldman 
-
 
Goldman Sachs & Co.
 
How do you pick those markets? Are these places where maybe you've 
already 
done a lot of fiber for your LT networks so it's a natural extension or 
are there other characteristics that tend to be appealing?
 
John J. Stephens 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP
 
Just customer characteristics, competitive situation, access
 
to other facilities 
we might have, a whole collection of considerations, whether it's a 
technology corridor like Raleigh
-
Durham or other such considerations. But 
that's a normal business
-
case process for us.

Okay, got i
t. Thanks for taking the question.
 
John J. Stephens

Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP
 
Sure.
 
Operator
 
Okay. Thank you. Our next question is from Simon Flannery with Morgan 
Stanley. Go ahead, please.

Th
anks a lot. Good evening, John. So, going back to the presentation a year 
ago, one of the things that you said you were working on was a home media 
gateway. And I know there's a bit of product development in that, but 
perhaps you could just update us on ho
w that's looking, when we might 
start to see that getting deployed?
 
And then there's a lot going on in Washington and obviously you can't talk 
about the auction, but maybe you could just give us some of your 
perspective on some of the agenda items at the F
CC around special access, 
set
-
top boxes, privacy, et cetera, and any exposure you see there? Thanks.
 
John J. Stephens 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP
 
Yeah. So set
-
top boxes, we have commented on that 

 
the industry's 
commented 

 
and there's
 
been significant support, I think, from Congress on 
that. So, I think that we would expect, we would hope 

 
we've seen the 
people coalesce and we'll see some changes into what the initial FCC 
guidance was on that.
 
On the special access piece, we think the
re's competition across the 
marketplace today. We see it and we would think that any kind of additional 
regulation of products that are already competitive will stifle investment and 
won't be good for consumers or businesses or the overall economy; so we 
t
hink that's, if you will, headed in the wrong direction. We'll continue to 
present our case on that.
 
On Title II, we always expected the final resolution to be in the hands of the 
Supreme Court and we'll work through the process and follow the Supreme 
Cour
t process closely, and then make our decisions going from then on. I 
would suggest to you those are really, kind of my comments on all of those 
matters.
 
With regard to assignment of the home media gateway, I'd suggest to you 
this aspect, that we continue 

 
and I'm not going to be able to give you a 
detailed answer, I'm not going to try to, on a home media gateway. But 
what I will tell you is that we continue to believe that as we go through the 
process we can get cost synergies in DTV by standardizing the i
nterfaces, 
whether they get the video over the satellite, whether they get it over the 
broadband or whether they get it over the IP television. And we continue to 
work on those activities, to standardize the graphic use interface, the set
-
top 
boxes and wha
t you, what many would consider a gateway or a home 
gateway, for media. Those activities continue to be on and we'll continue to 
work for that. It's a natural efficiency and it's also a really good quality 
service for the customers.

Morgan
 
Stanley & Co. LLC
 
Okay. It sounds like that's a sort of, still a medium
-
term item?
 
John J. Stephens 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP
 
Yes. I would not suggest it's a near term item. I'd have to be honest. And I 
will go back with my team and 
follow
-
up on that, but right now I would 
suggest it's a medium
-
term.

Hey, Kathy, we'll take one more question.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. 
Then the final question will come from Tim Horan with 
Oppenheimer. Go ahead, please.
 
Timothy Horan

Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)
 
Thanks, guys. Two quick ones, if you don't mind. John, can you give us a 
sense of what your services
-
only ARPU is, or if I
 
bring my own device, what 
that is? Because I know my own children, they've been blowing through 
their data usage since they got out of school and that's a lot of new 
applications out there. Can you maybe talk about how much the current data 
volume growth 
can drive ARPU growth, in your opinion, over the next few 
years? And then I just had a quick clarification.
 
John J. Stephens 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP
 
Yeah. So Tim, certainly we are seeing buckets get bigger for our customers. 
We are 
seeing their demand so we're optimistic about that opportunity. 
We're careful about it because of the competitive environment and 
responding to, or at least understanding how competitors may respond to 
what we've done. So certainly, the data growth, as we 
spelled out in our 
slides, the data growth continues, and for us, as an integrated carrier with 
the backhaul and the fiber and the extensive number of towers and 
spectrum, we feel really good about our competitive position.
 
The question of how quickly we c
an get our data growth, or at what 
percentage that will be, will be a function of both the efficiencies we're 
putting into our data delivery as well as customer demand and competitor 
pricing. But, yes, there is absolutely a lot of growth in demand and usag
e, 
and we hope to capture that in additional revenues as we go forward.
 
Timothy Horan

Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)
 
Great, and I think John Hodulik said you were halfway through your DTV 
synergies and Project Agile. Is that correct?
 
John J. Stephens 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP
 
We're on track to get to the $1.5 billion 

 
we say $1.5 billion
-
plus 

 
run rate 
by December this year. So I don't want to suggest to you that that's the 
number for the year. It's the run rate at that level.
 
We
'll get to it in December, and so we feel really good about where we're 
going for next year and the year after. And getting to the $2.5 billion run 
rate in 2018 is our guidance, so that's that piece of it. We are on track to get 
about half of those Project
 
Agile savings today. That is correct, and we said 
that in the prepared 

 
that'll be in the script. That's in the prepared remarks.

Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)

Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP
 
With that, I want to thank everybody for being on the call today, and let me 
just give you a few closing comments before we go. It's been one year after 
our acquisition of DI
RECTV and we are very pleased with where we stand. 
The integration of DIRECTV is on track. Cost synergies are ahead of target, 
and we've added nearly one million satellite customer since the merger. And 
our new streaming services are scheduled to come onli
ne later this year.
 
We believe our unique assets, our leading cost structure and our ability to 
offer integrated solutions positions us like no one else. We think this is just 
the beginning. We are positioned as a unique competitor and the first scaled 
com
munications and video provider to offer fully integrated nationwide 
products, and we fully expect to increase our momentum as we go forward.
 
As always, on your way home tonight, remember: When it comes to texting 
and driving, it can wait. Thanks again for 
being on the call, and as always, 
thank you for your interest in AT&T and have a good evening. Good night.

Ladies and gentlemen thank you standing by. And welcome to the AT&T 
Third Quarter Earnings Release 2014 Conference Call. At this time all 
participants are in a listen
-
only, later we will conduct a question
-
and
-
answer 
session and 
instructions will be given at that time (Operator 
Instructions).And at this time I will turn the conference call over to your 
host, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations for AT&T Mr. Michael Viola. 
Please go ahead sir.
 
Michael Viola
 
Thank you, Tony a
nd good afternoon everyone. Welcome to our third 

Head of Investor Relations for AT&T. Joining me on the call today is John 

ovide an update with 

 
Let me remind you our earnings material is available on the Investor 

www.att.com/investor.relations. I first ne
ed to draw your attention to our 
Safe Harbor statement before we begin which says that some of our 
comments today maybe forward
-
looking. As such they are subject to risks 
and uncertainties, results may differ materially. And additional information is 
avail

remind you that we are in the quite period for FCC Spectrum Auction 97 and 
AWS
-
3 Auction so we cannot address any questions about Spectrum today. 
So with that overview, I now turn the ca
ll over to AT&Ts Chief Financial 
Officer, John Stephens, John?
 
John Stephens
 
Thank you, Mike. And hello everyone. Thank you for joining us today and we 
always appreciate your interest in AT&T. Before we report out on our 

te you on Project VIP in the longer term 
view of our business transformation.
 

providing mobile connectivity to any device, anywhere our customers 
needed. I am pleased to say we have made
 

two years since we first announced our VIP initiatives and our plans to 
transition to IP networks. Basically, we are doing everything we said we are 
going to do and more.
 
We reached our 4G LTE build target in the third qua
rter four months ahead 

300 million people. We continue to improve our self identity and add 
capacity to help keep our network best
-
in
-
class. We are also on pace with 
our wireline netw
ork goals. Our high
-
speed IT broadband network now 
reaches 57 million customer locations. About two thirds of our U
-
verse video 
footprint now has access to 45 megabit per second speeds.
 
We also continue to make progress on expanding our U
-
verse video footp
rint 
and we committed to deploy ultra fast AT&T GigaPower service in 17 
markets. Our fiber to the business expansion also is going strong. We now 
pass more than 600,000 new business customer locations with fiber, well on 
our way to our one million goal.
 
Th
e transformation of our customer base also continued in the quarter. Two 
years ago when we first introduced Project VIP less than half of our 
broadband customers had high speed IP broadband. Now a significant part 
of that transition is complete with nearly
 
three quarters of our base on high 
speed U
-
verse broadband. And our strategic business services are on track 
to be nearly 30% total wireline business revenues by the end of this year.
 
The transition in wireless is just as dramatic. There has been a steady
 
shift 
of our subscribers to usage based plans; more than 80% of our smartphone 
base is now on usage
-
based plans. At the same time, mobile share value has 
helped move customers off the traditional subsidy model. We also have 
launched new business opportuni
ties that will leverage our investment in a 
high speed networks.
 
The connected car is ready to take off. In the third quarter alone we added 
more than 500,000 connected cars as the 2015 model start to roll off the 
assembly lines. Digital Life, the first al
l
-
digital all
-
IP home security and 
automation platform has launched in 82 markets and has about a 140,000 
subscribers. And AT&T has completed a Network On Demand trial in Austin 
that will enable companies to easily order, add or change services on their 
ow
n in mere real time. A commercial roll out of Network On Demand enabled 
Ethernet services is expected in Austin by the end of this year.
 
Our financial strength allows us to invest while still returning substantial 
value to shareholders; in fact since 2012 
we have returned more than $50 
billion to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks. Cash flows are 
strong and we have been aggressive in monetizing non
-
strategic assets. 
Including the sale of our Connecticut wireline property we have generated 
abo
ut 16 billion in cash proceeds from asset sales.
 
This has helped us average nearly $20 billion a year in free cash flow and 
asset sales over the last two years and we expect to do the same this year 

in order by funding 
a pension plan, making significant working capital improvements and taking 
advantage of historically low interest rates.
 

always notice in the quarterly numbers. W
e are just managing for the short 

take a look at third quarter results starting with our financial summary on 
slide four.
 
Consolidated revenue grew to $33 billion up $800 million o
r 2.5% year
-
over
-
year. This was driven by continued wireless growth as we repositioned our 
business model, solid consumer wireline growth, once again led by U
-
verse 
and continued growth in strategic business services.
 
Reported EPS for the quarter was $0.58
. In the quarter we had $0.03 of cost 
associated with merger and integration related expenses. We also redeemed 
some debt early in the quarter to take advantage of low interest rates; both 
reductions in cost had a $0.02 impact on the quarter. When you excl
ude 
these items earnings per share were $0.63 compared to an adjusted $0.66 a 
year earlier.
 
Cash from operations continued at a strong rate and we also continue to find 
ways to monetize assets. Together, that has generated $32 billion in cash 
year
-
to
-
date.
 
With year
-
to
-
date capital spending of $17 billion and about $7 
billion paid in dividends so far this year. With all of that our cash position 
remains strong even as we continue to return substantial value to 
shareholders.
 

 
highlights on Slide five. The third quarter 
was another solid step forward in the transformation of our business. This 
includes strong subscriber metrics in both wireless and wireline and 
continued growth in strategic business services. In wireless, we sa
w good in 
fact great trends in a challenging environment including more than 2 million 
net adds that included adding twice as many postpaid subscribers as we did 
in the year ago third quarter. Record low third quarter post paid churn, solid 
wireless revenu
e growth and improving adjusted service margins even with 
record third quarter smartphone gross adds and upgrades.
 
We also saw the continued transition of our customer base to AT&T Next and 
Mobile Share Value plans while also realizing sequential ARPU phon
e growth. 
In wireline, U
-
verse hit some important subscriber milestones. We now have 
more than 12 million high speed broadband subscribers. The transition 
phase of moving our broadband base to IP is nearing completion with about 
75% of our total broadband 
base on our higher speed service. And we also 
reached more than 6 million U
-
verse video subs that helped drive strong U
-
verse revenue growth and continued wire line consumer gains.
 
U
-
verse is now a $15 billion annualized revenue stream growing at nearly 
24
%. In wireline business, strategic services growth continued at a strong 


operating results starting with wir
eless.
 

throughout the year. Overall we added more than 2 million total subscribers 
led by postpaid and connected devices. We added nearly 800,000 new 

 
as the year ago quarter, about 
450,000 of those were tablets and computing devices with the remaining net 
adds, phone and some digital life.
 
And year
-
to
-


er key point with our postpaid net 
adds is that we are adding these customers while maintaining high credit 
standards. These are rock solid high quality, new subscribers. These net 
adds exclude any migrations from our prepaid segment.
 
Connected devices als
o had a strong quarter as we started to see significant 
impact of the connected car with nearly 1.3 million connected devices were 
added in the quarter including more than half a million cars.
 
Churn turned in another strong quarter, in fact it was our best
 
ever third 
quarter postpaid churn that follows our best ever churn in the second 
quarter and churn from Mobile Share Value and AT&T Next customers is 
even lower.
 
Total Churn for the quarter was up slightly to 1.3%, 1.36% reflecting a 
larger prepaid base w
ith the March acquisition of Cricket. These are solid 
results in a challenging environment. We saw our competitive intensity 
pickup in an iPhone launch quarter with all major carriers now offering the 
iPhone and we expect that to continue as we move into t
he holiday sales 
period in the fourth quarter.
 
But we believe strongly in the quality of our network, our award winning 
customer service and the value proposition we offer customers. Our results 
so far this year show we are on the right track and we are lo
oking to finish 
the year strong.
 

shift in wireless revenues as customers sign up for Mobile Share Value plans 
and away from the traditional subsidy model. Total wireless revenues for the 
quarter were up nearly 5%, ser
vice revenues were stable year
-
over
-
year 
and equivalent revenues were up more than 40%. A take rate for AT&T Next 
was about the same as last quarter, about half of gross adds and upgrades. 
We also saw an increasing number of subscribers bringing their own 
device 
to our network, about 460,000 or 7% of smartphone gross adds were bring 

year ago third quarter and more than 1 million BYODs customers year
-
to
-
date.
 
We continue to have a large 
base of customers on discounted Mobile Share 
Value plans who have yet to migrate to Next. About 20% of our smartphone 
base is on Next, but about 52% of smartphone subscribers are on the non 
subsidy pricing. This means that there are about 20 million potent
ial Next 

second quarter.
 
Next take rates continue to be strong in company
-
owned stores nearly all 
are more than 90% of our Mobile Share Value customers with pre Next 
pricing or cho
osing AT&T Next when they upgrade in company owned stores. 
They all come without a customer choice, customers can choose the plan 

are choosing to go off the subsidy mile when they 
upgrade or add a new 
line.
 

and more interested in device insurance. This is helping drive revenue. Now 

quarte
r are happening as more customers take AT&T Next. Phone
-
only 
service ARPU is down year
-
over
-
year but up sequentially. When you add a 
Next doings you get a better view of what an average customer pays us 
each month.
 
Phone
-
only ARPU with Next billings improv
ed sequentially by 2%. The 
average monthly Next billings were about $29 per month driving our ARPU 
with Next higher. As the Next base grows, so does the impact on billings. We 
also continue to see strong growth in data billings, those details are on slide 
eight.
 
Wireless data billings increased by nearly 24% in the quarter. This was due 
to the increasing number of devices on the network and customers choosing 
10 gigabit plans or larger. More than half of all Mobile Share accounts are on 
these plans. During 
the quarter, we added more than 2 million Mobile Share 

had a year ago. And we averaged about three connections per Mobile Share 
accounts or nearly 47 million connections in total. T

overall postpaid base.
 
Smartphone sales continue to be strong; in fact, we had 6.9 million 

would have been even higher without inventory constraints.
 
We adde
d $1.2 million subscribers to our smartphone base including about 
including 500,000 smartphone net adds. Most our sales continue to be 
smartphones, about 91% of the flow share.
 
About two
-
thirds of our postpaid smartphone base use LTE phones. As you 
know, L
TE devices provide the best customer experience, while also being 
the most efficient on our networks.
 

U
-
verse hit two subscriber milestones in a quarter. First, we now have more 
than 12 million high
-
speed broadband subscribers, after adding more than 
600,000 in the quarter.
 
U
-
verse broadband is now 73% of our total broadband base and 75% in the 

to drive tota
l postpaid 

 
that help drive total positive broadband net adds in 
the quarter.
 
We also continue to deploy our ultra high
-
speed GigaPower service. We now 
offer 1 gigabit speeds in Austin and have turned up the service in Dallas and 

mmitted to deploy GigaPower in 14 additional 
markets including Houston, Miami and Atlanta.
 
We also passed the 6 million mark with U
-
verse TV subscribers and in 
216,000 in the quarter, and bundles continue to play a big role in our 
growth. More than 97% or 
virtually all of our video customers have some 
kind of bundle with us, most often broadband and video. And nearly two
-
thirds of U
-
verse TV subscribers take three or four services with us.
 
ARPU for U
-
verse triple play customers continues to be more than $17
9 that 
helps drive revenue growth while reducing churn. In fact triple
-
play bundled 
customers have significantly lower churn than standalone customers. All this 
help drive 3% revenue growth in consumer, total U
-
verse revenues are now 
more than $15 billion 
annualized revenue stream and our continued growth 
at nearly 25% year
-
over
-
year. U
-
verse now represents 64% or nearly two
-
thirds of our consumer revenues. That compares to 54% just the year ago.
 
Now let me take you to our wireline business results on slide
 
10. We also 
reached another significant milestone in the wireline business. Strategic 
business services, those are growth services such as VPN, Ethernet, hosting 
and other advanced IP services are nearly a $10 billion annualized revenue 
stream for us now.
 
The services backup more than 28% of business wireline revenue and grew 
by more than 14% in the third quarter. At our current growth rate strategic 
business services should be about 39% of business wireline revenues by the 
end of the year. Overall busines
s revenues decline by 2% in the quarter. 
Service revenues were also down 2% year
-
over
-
year.
 
The shift to IP data and away from legacy services, as well as the economy 
is the story in wireline business. But within the business there are some 
differences. Ou
r retail service revenues actually grew year
-
over
-
year.
 
Those are service revenues from an enterprise and small business. 

the six consecutive quarter of service revenue growth.
 
Small
 
business trends also improve as even with a lack of new business 
formations. On the other hand, wholesale is again challenged by network 
grooming issue. We also make a strategic decision to refocus the wholesale 
business.
 
That reduce wholesale revenue is 
about $50 million in the quarter and we 
expect that amount to increase in the fourth and thereafter. The positive 
trends in retail service revenues are encouraging, and as is the transition IP 
services from legacy product.
 
But the economy and fewer busines
s starts continue to make for a 
challenging environment and clearly call for the government to move toward 

on slide 11. For the quarter, our adjusted consolidated margin was 17.2%
 
compared to 18.5% a year ago quarter. Wireless margins were pressured by 
strong adoption of mobile share value plans, solid customer growth, 
promotional activities and the leap acquisition.
 
However, when compared to the year ago third quarter, adjusted wi
reless 
EBITDA service margins actually expanded to 4 to 3.1. As the solid 
performance given our strong postpaid and smartphones that adds, as well 
as record third quarter gross adds and upgrade.
 
Wireline margins were pressured by increasing content costs a
nd 
transformation expenses, lower legacy revenues also contributed to the 
pressure. But this pressure was partially offset by growth in consumer 
revenues, gains and strategic business services and solid execution or in 
cost initiatives.
 

ash flow, our summaries on slide 12. In the first nine 
months of the year cash from operation totaled $25.6 billion and $8.7 for 
the quarter. Capital expenditures were 17 billion and $5.2 for the quarter.
 
And free cash flow before dividends is $8.6 billion
 
and $3.5 billion for the 
quarter. We did monetize about $500 million of Next receivables in the 
quarter as there continues to be great interest from financial institutions and 
additional tranches in the future are possible.
 
Net dept to adjusted EBITDA was
 
1.7 and our credit rating continues to be 
among the best in the industry. In terms of uses of the cash, dividend 
payments year
-
to
-
date totaled $7.2 billion and we continue to be 
opportunistic with our share buyback program.
 
Our asset sales strengthened ou
r balance sheet and cash position, when you 
will include the $1.9 billion in short term investments, we had $4.3 billion of 
cash at the end of the third quarter. We also to expect to close the sale of 
our wireline asset in Connecticut and the Frontier this
 
Friday, which will 
enhance our cash position with $2 billion in proceeds.
 
Let me close with the quick summary of the quarter on slide 13. We continue 
to make progress with our business transformation in this quarter 
throughout this year. That includes the
 
repositioning of our postpaid base of 
the subsidy model.
 
Total share counts continue to grow and of our 57% of our gross adds and 
upgrades to the quarter were either AT&T next or BYOD. At the same time 
we continue to see strong total and postpaid net 
adds with low postpaid 
churn in a very challenging environment.
 
We also continue to rationalize our business portfolio. This includes 
completing the sales of the América Móvil equity interest, closing 
Connecticut wirelines property transactions two months 
earlier than we had 
expected, and exiting select low margin wireline wholesale businesses.
 
This rationalization as well the impact of more BYOD devices than we had 
expected and fewer net AT&T net gross adds and upgrades will impact 
revenues. The company no
w expects full year consolidated revenue growth 
in the 3% to 4% range.
 
Even with this change we expect that Next rates will increase for the rest of 
the year and continued strong BYOD will help with margins even with 
traditional fourth quarter holiday pres
sure.
 
So overall we continue to have confidence in our strategy and our ability to 
compete in this challenging environment.

Thank you very much. (Operator Instruction

McCormack with Jefferies. Please go ahead.
 
Mike McCormack

Hey, guys. Thanks. John, you have made a lot of protective moves this year, 

-
only ARPU stabilizing, but EBITDA has 
gone 
ex
-
growth. I guess just trying to think into 4Q, I'm assuming that the 
expectation clearly without subsidies is to see a decent number in year
-
over
-
year growth and EBITDA.
 

there w
ith respect to recent data points from the iPhone with respect to 
sticker shock on this whole issue of people being concerned about layering 
EIP payments on top of the existing plan? Thanks.
 
John Stephens
 
Thanks Mike, I appreciate your question. Now first 
of all on the sticker shock 
issue itself, quite frankly with 90% plus of the people come into our stores, 


 

seeing any strong number at all of sticker shock, and the reality of it is fo
r a 

$240 plus whatever taxes they have to pay. And if they stay on the Next 
model, they not only get the cheaper service on a monthly basis but the 
upfront costs are really only ab
out $50.
 

come up with that down payment for the subsidized phone. So we 

 
and 



improvement in margins, EBITDA service margins in the fourth quarter 
compared to prior years and we are still working towards achieving what we 
said in the past and that is all four quarters this year to b
e 40% EBITDA 
service margins or better.
 
Mike McCormack

Okay. Thanks John.

Thank you. Our next question in queue will come from John Hodulik with 
UBS. Please go ahead.
 
John Hodulik 

 
UBS
 
Okay. Thanks. Good after
noon, guys.
 
John Stephens
 
Hey, John.
 
John Hodulik 

 
UBS
 
Hey. So my question is on the improvement on the ARPU side. John, could 
you just talk a little bit about what the drivers are of the sequential 
improvement we saw in phone ARPU and the improvement we 
saw in the 
postpaid ARPU?
 
And then, as it relates to the pre
-
Next program, it looks like you went from 
17 to 20 in the quarter to real slowdown. Have you guys repositioned the 
basis as much as you think is necessary or are we going to see that 
reaccelerate
 
in the fourth quarter? Thanks.
 
John Stephens
 
Great. So, on the ARPU story, I think the biggest issue with the 
improvement is really the people buying the bigger buckets and buying 

 

base 
at the 10
-
gig or bigger plans. We believe that that is really helping on the 
ARPU side. We still have 

 
we still expect more customers to migrate to the 
Mobile Share Value plans, so we may still see some more pressure from the 
existing customers on th
at ARPU side, but buying the bigger bucket is 
definitely helping.
 
Secondly, on the Next take rates, the two uniqueness of the quarter 
--
 
two 
items that are unique this quarter, were one, the significant BYOD and while 
those 400,000 plus BYOD devices really
 

the revenue and caused an adjustment in our thoughts on revenue they 

get them. That seemed to have an impact on the Next take rate.
 
The other issu
e is where inventory was available in the launch month, which 
was September where customers have a much higher experience, better 
experience going to Next in a company owned stores. But in the launch cycle 
sometimes inventory was constrained, so people wou
ld go into different 

in some of the new channels like some of the big
-
box stores or some of the 

time

longer time than we had expected.
 
John Hodulik

All right. Thanks

Thanks for taking my question. John, I just wanted to clarify the postpaid 
net add estimate did not include internal migrations from prepaid. And then, 
to what extent did you see prepaid migrat
ions to postpaid may be coming 
from your peers and have you made any changes to your credit standards?
 
John Stephens
 

any way shape or performance that will be significant or any ch
ange, that 
would change any traffic. Secondly, we do not count any migrations from for 
example our Cricket product into our AT&T product. Those will be excluded 

counted that information.
 

regard to any change in the migration from the customers that are porting 
into us whether they were previously prepaid or postpaid customer of the

Thank a lot. Good evening. John, are you still committed to the $21 billion 
capital spending guidance? [You imply just] [ph] a $4 billi
on number for the 
fourth quarter. And how are we thinking about that for 
--
 
is $21 billion still a 
good number for 2015 under VIP? And then on wireline margins, you talked 
about some of the content costs, some of the transformation costs. When do 
we see th
ose margins start to stabilize? Thanks.
 
John Stephens
 
Simon, we are still committed to the $21 billion [range] [ph] for 2014 which 


ld suggest is a range, but 

down to capital spending in the fourth quarter that was planned. If people 
are wondering how that might accomplished, I will tell you that if you look at 
w
hat the network team has accomplished with regard to getting 300 million 
POPs with LTE coverage and getting 600 million business locations passed 
with fiber, getting 57 million customer locations passed with IP broadband 
capabilities. We are ahead of the g
ame so to speak in what we laid out and 


build.
 

ance. I will specifically 
give 
-
 

like we normally do. I will suggest you this though, we still expect tax 
extenders to get passed in the post
-
election session of Congress and those 
to g
et signed.
 

companies, will have to take into account that change in their ability to 

flow statement. And that wo
uld be for us it would definitely be taken into 
account and what we decide on our investments next year.
 
But quite frankly, I think many companies it would have an immediate 

payment
s for this year and that might add a little more immediate impact on 
capital spending by other parties.
 
My point here is I think tax reforms, specifically tax extenders, needs to be 
completed. With regard to wireless margins, two pieces to that story and 
t

opportunity to make improvements on that.
 
But secondly on our transformation piece, as you heard in our presentation, 
75% of our DSL customers have converted to high
-
speed broadban
d 

smartphones, all of this conversion going on.
 
In the wireline space that conversions had a lot of costs. Those costs are 
getting behind us now. When you have 75% of the base on 
high
-
speed, 

margins going forward.
 

serve our customers. How we take orders. How we provision and 

 
how we 
v
alidate those orders. How we provision them. How we activate service.
 
We are actively working on mechanizing that ordering process, mechanizing 
that validation, that provisioning planning process. Those network is not yet 

at traction, but that will certainly 
continue on into next year. And once we have that complete those two 
pieces of our transition cost will be behind us and that will give us the

Our next question in queue will come from Brett Feldman with Goldman 
Sachs. Please go ahead.
 
Brett Feldman 
-
 
Goldman Sachs
 
. Thanks a lot. Just a follow
-
up here. You talk abo
ut an expectation that your 
Next take rate is likely to increase into the fourth quarter, after kind of 
stabilizing in 3Q. I just want to clarify, is that because you are putting more 

driving it? And then just in terms of other sort of margin drivers into the 
fourth quarter, can you give us some thoughts on where you think we're 
going to see the upgrade rate come out?
 
John Stephens
 
Yes. Brett, let me give you the simplest answer I can w
ith regard to the Next 
rate improving. Our stores in September had some shortages on inventory 
where customers went 
--
 
our customers went and bought inventory from 
channels. Our stores our company
-
owned stores have the highest 
performance of Next take rate
.
 



we rolled up in Next prog
ram in the manufacturer stores and in the national 

we go through the learning curve the Next take rate of those operation has 
been improving. Those are the two reasons why we thin
k that the overall 
take rate can improve.
 
Any time we have a launch of a new device in a month, it challenges a lot of 
pieces of your operations. In this case it challenged our Next take rates. 

--
 
w
e continue to 
have the focus on expense management across the enterprise, but I think 


be any differences one 
way or the other they need to have in a fourth 
quarter holiday season with a new product launch out there.

Sure.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question will come from Phil Cu
sick with JPMorgan. 
Please go ahead.
 
Phil Cusick 

 
JPMorgan
 
Hey, guys, thanks. I guess a couple of housekeeping things. One, can you 
reiterate or not the $11 billion in free cash flow and your EPS guidance that 
you'd given earlier in the year?
 
And then, se
cond, just following up on Brett's question on the Next mix, 
given the 
--
 
what I think is a tougher credit requirement and the limits on 
distribution, how big of a mix on gross adds could this be, do you think? Is 
there an upper limit around 75 or 80 that 
this doesn't go above? Thanks
 
John Stephens
 



 
I think what I said before is 
the low end of the mid single
-
digit EPS range. The onl
y caveat I give to that 

not going to turn down the opportunity of 2 million postpaid customers or 

to tu
rn that down just to make a goal that the finance guys may have set. 

before.
 
With regard to the Next take rates, I think you hit on the right point in the 
sense of there is alway
s going to be credit scoring impact on the availability 
or the qualification of our customers. So there always be some customers 
who would be better suited of our other arrangements or another products.
 

likely to go with the 
Next program for them. Secondly and I think as importantly is customers 
just want to have choice and so we will look to make sure that they have a 

opportunity for
 
them.
 
With that being said, we certainly expect that with this Mobile Share Value 
pricing going to two
-
thirds of our base by the end of the year that there is 
significantly step up in the number of Next customers compared to what we 
have today.
 
Whether that all occurs in the fourth quarter or some of that occurs in 2015, 

-
term 
investment for us and we believe a good long
-
term situation for our 
customers.

Thank you for taking the question. John, I just wanted to explore the 
SMB. 
You realized some significant bucking of what I would think would be a 
different trend, just because all our checks show that the cable guys have 
been nothing short of aggressive. Can you talk a little bit of what you are 
seeing or what you're doing d
ifferently there to 
--
 
or is it just macro? Are 
you leading on wireless, et cetera?
 
John Stephens
 
Kind of all the above Jennifer, I am glad to the call. A couple of things, one, 

-
verse fiber
 
and then U
-
verse fiber where many people think is consumer also can be 

locations.
 
We are finding that that fiber is enabling us to really go in and not only 
reinforce our customer po
sition with existing customers but be very 
competitive in offering services to new customers.
 
Talking about your strategic services piece in the small business is growing 

customer
 
seems to like those services and are willing to take them.
 


perspective. It works for small business as wel
l large business, but the 

wireless or more important the ability to combine wired and wireless 
services for you customers through one organization has proven to be really 
powerful 
even in small business.
 


we need to keep it up and keep it moving forward, we are not making any 
declarat
ions now but we do have a better feel for the situation than we did 
few quarters ago.

Thank you. Our next question will come from David Barden with Bank of 
America. Please go ahead.
 
David Barden

Bank of America
 
Hey thanks guys. I appreciate letting me ask some questions. So the first 
question would be on the enterprise side. Your biggest competitor talked 
about what sounded like were some structural things going on in the 
industry on private line
 
pricing, core connectivity pricing, and it doesn't seem 
to have been an issue for you guys in the quarter. So I was wondering if you 
guys could give us a sense as to your comfort level on the enterprise 
positive trajectory.
 
Then the second was obviously t
he payoff from the forward pricing initiative 
has been the lower churn that you have been posting up. Are you 
comfortable letting people look at kind of a 10 to 15 basis point year
-
over
-
year churn improvement be the new run rate baseline expectation on a g
o
-
forward basis? Thanks
 
John Stephens
 
Well thanks, David. A couple of things, one, I go to tell you the performance 
enterprise has to do with our people, has to do with our enterprise sales 
team, both on a wire and the wireless side and the performance are
 
now 
what provides our largest customers. I have the opportunity of meeting with 
about ten of our largest customers a few weeks ago in New York and I can 
tell you that they are satisfied with the kind of service, the quality, the 
security offerings those s
trategic services.
 

have decided that it is a tough environment 
--
 
very hard to continue in and 
our advantage is our wired network and capabilities as well as the ability to 
bind with wir
eless.
 

we are not ready to establish a standard for that mainly to get through a full 
year because of this process before we even start formulating those 
numbers, but if you will 
two quarters in a row of best ever churn and year
-
to
-
date best ever churn. And those churn numbers of the postpaid side all 
below all the two digit range, range is very encouraging, but we got to be 
careful to continue to work hard and move this company fo



out the predictions on rates.

Hi Amir, how are you?

Doing well, 
John. Seems to be some interesting buzz among the supplier 
community around the supplier Domain 2.0 initiative. Wanted to see if there 
was any updates from you folks on this front in terms of developments. And 
also, timing to some of your earlier commentar
y on CapEx trajectory. In 
other words, what you have seen so far, does that solidify some of your 
thoughts on the ability to drive down CapEx intensity in terms of your 
expenditures in some of the out years, John?
 
John Stephens
 
We continue to be optimistic
 
on our software directed networks or network

on
-
demand trial in Austin, just this last few months has grown positive or 
excited about the opportunity to get a launch in Austin of a product on an 
Ethernet basis that is what we call network
-
on
-
demand. So th
ose things are 
real. It may take time to implement and to do right and the team is striving 
to do it right, but we remain optimistic.
 
With regard to the software
-
directed networks and the ability to use that to 
manage and harnessing our capital cost. We co
ntinue to remain positive. We 
take that into account in our spending projections in our assets. I would 
suggest you though it is a not a short road, but a long road when you have a 
company that has $100 billion of net, property, equipment that you are 
mana

take some time, but we remain positive and optimistic and yes, we are 
receiving savings or achieving value from those software directed networks 
and we hope to increase those amounts 
overtime.

Jonathan Chaplin

New Street Research
 
Good
 
afternoon guys. Thanks for taking the question. John, two quick ones, 
if I may. So the bring your own device trend seems very positive. I'm just 
wondering, how do you deal with bring your own device customers coming 
over from CDMA? Do you give them a new 
handset or are all those coming 
from just T
-
Mobile?
 
Then, secondly, I didn't quite understand your comment on the impact of 
bring your own device customers on the Next take rate. I would have 
assumed all of those customers would take Next 
--
 
would take the
 
Next 
pricing. That would be what would be most attractive to them. If that's not 
the case, then I'm not sure why it would have impacted your revenue 
growth for the year. Thanks.
 
John Stephens
 
Okay, quickly speaking on the BYOD device, these devices are co
ming not 
only from competitors who operate similar networks or whose devices will 
operate on their network which maybe more than one competitor whose 
devices may actually work in our networks. But they also come from devices 
that are previously one end of 
the door and we are less at home and then 
these are handed down either to family or friends, neighbors or whatever 
the case maybe, people they buy them over eBay and bring them and have 
already paid from.
 
So they come from a variety of sources, they could 
be reusing devices that 

second case is if those phones would have been sold by us, we would have 
had a 

 
we are depending upon what the device cost a $500 of revenues and 
$500 of cost. 

provided any contribution but it would have provided revenue.
 
So we still are getting our customer adds and we are getting a efficiency 
with the re
-

t of them 
and that is quite frankly a big piece when we are talking about over a million 
devices so far and choose your number on how much revenue we will get 
out of each one of those devices. You can understand the impact it could 
have even on a company o

We would have assumed that those kinds of devices people would have 
come in and gotten Next. Secondly, I would tell you we are making a 

alue 
plans and generally speaking, they are getting the lower price service 
because they are bringing the device. They just are not getting Next because

Okay, thank you sir. And that will come from Michael Rollinswtih with Citi. 
Please go ahead.
 
Mike Rollins

Citi Investment and 
Research
 
Thanks for taking the questions. Two, if I could. First, as we think about 
your move to consumption
-
based pricing and we also think about some of 
the changes in the sizes of the buckets for data, can you give us a sense of 
what's happening as you 
increase the data buckets, you try to encourage 
customers to spend more on data? Are you getting more in data revenue 
relative to those that might have started at a higher plan and can use the 
same amount, but moved to a cheaper bucket?
 
Then the second que
stion is if you just had an update on the regulatory 
process with the DIRECTV deal. I think the FCC put out an update on their 
clock today, and I am just curious if you could talk about the implications of 
that and any update from your perspective. Thanks
 
John Stephens
 
Sure on the data bucket I am referring back to the slide that we showed 
with regard to data billings and that they were up, of about 3.4% year
-
over
-

particularly wit
h the Mobile Shave Value plan or try to get the 10 meg 
buckets so there are 10 gig buckets excuse me with buying up anyway. And 
then you got to have some impact in some cases on average rates and so 
forth, but quite frankly about the customer experience co
mes out of having 

anything, when they buy those data buckets they are adding things. They 
are going to add tablets, they are going to add variables, they are going to 
add other device
s. Soon we have no adding connected cars and so what we 

 
add other family phones or other members of the family tablets.
 
And so what you see is they buy up these buckets and then they start using, 
I mean getting more functionality and then they are more t
ied to us. If you 
look at our Mobile Share Value accounts, I think we have about 16.5 million 
almost 17 million and we have about 47 or 48 million devices or connections 

pretty sti

 
The data billings increased almost over 20% is clearly what we point to you 


ision has nothing 

FCC is automated clear that there was concern about the confidentiality of 
the information that sometimes when companies provide the FCC and they 
are trying to 
deal with those issues.
 
We are confident in the FCC rigorous procedures for keeping the information 

requested from us. While the FCC is stopping the clock on merger review is 
fairl

able to get the deal approved and closed by the first half, in the first half of 
2015.
 

about the transaction
. The stopping of the clock is not an uncommon or rare 
experience and it has something to do with other issues than the benefit of 

and look forward to getting the transaction clos
ed within that originally 
announced one year kind of time frame.

Before we close, I want to thank all of you for being with us this afternoon. 
As you can tell we have continued to make si
gnificant progress in 
transforming our business not only in the third quarter but all year long that 

also did that while having strong net adds, strong postpaid gains and record 
l
evels of churn. We also had a strong performance in wireline with continued 
strong performance in new version strategic business services and our ability 
to combine our wired and wireless services for our customers benefit. We 
look to continue that solid m
omentum into the fourth quarter and finish the 
year strong.
 
Once again thank you for being on the call. As always we thank you for your 
interest in AT&T and have a great evening. Take care.

Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to AT&T's Third 
Quarter 2018 Earnings Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen
-
only 
mode. Later we will conduct a question
-
and
-
answer session. Instructions will 
be given at 
that time.
 
I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Mr. Michael Viola, 
Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
 
Michael J. Viola

Okay. Thanks, John. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Third 
Quar
ter Conference Call. As John had mentioned, I'm Mike Viola. I'm Head of 
Investor Relations here at AT&T. Joining me on the call today is, first, 
Randall Stephenson, AT&T's Chairman and CEO; John Stephens, AT&T's 
Chief Financial Officer; John Donovan, Chief
 
Executive Officer of AT&T 
Communications; and John Stankey, the CEO of WarnerMedia.
 
Randall is going to provide some opening comments, turn it over to John 
Stephens, who is going to cover the consolidated segment results. Also he'll 
provide an update on o
ur deleveraging plans. J.D. will give a business 
update for the Communications segment, including comments on FirstNet 
and 5G. And John Stankey is going to join us for the Q&A part of the call.
 
I'd also like to just update quickly on our upcoming analyst e
vent. We now 
plan to do a video webcast, a single sell
-
side, buy
-
side meeting. It's going to 
be here in New York in the late afternoon of November 29. And so more 
details to that will come in the next few days.
 
Finally, I want to call your attention to our
 
Safe Harbor statement before we 
begin. It says that some of the comments today may be forward
-
looking. As 
such, they're subject to risk and uncertainty. Results may differ materially. 
And additional information is available on the Investor Relations websi
te.
 
I also want to remind you that we're in the quiet period for the FCC 
spectrum auctions, 101 and 102, and so we can't address any questions 
about that today.
 
And as always, our earnings materials are available on the Investor 
Relations page of the AT&T 
website, and that includes our news release, 8
-
K, 
investor briefings, and associated schedules.
 
And so now I'd like to turn the call over to AT&T's Chairman and CEO, 
Randall Stephenson.

Thanks, Mike, and good morning, eve
ryone. Appreciate everybody joining us 
this morning. I'm going to be very brief before I hand it over to John 
Stephens.
 
But this year's results, everybody knows, has had a lot of noise in them. 
We've had a significant amount of M&A. We've had a number of a
ccounting 
rule changes imposed on us. And the third quarter was obviously particularly 
impacted by it being the first full quarter with WarnerMedia results in it.
 
And just to cut through the clutter, what I typically would like to do is just 
go straight to
 
the cash flows. And if you look at the cash flows for the 
quarter, I feel really good about the results. Our cash flow from operations 
was $12.3 billion for the quarter. That's up 14% year over year. And when 
you look at free cash flow, which is the cash 
available to pay dividends or 
pay down debt, that was a very healthy $6.5 billion, which is up 17% year 
over year.
 
And if you get beneath that, there's just a couple of areas that I think are 
worthy of pointing out. First is Mobility, and Mobility is growi
ng. And that's 
significant because it's obviously our largest contributor to earnings and cash 
flow. And what I'd really point out is that growth is being heavily driven by 
our Prepaid business, which is running red
-
hot. And I think we're seeing 
Cricket tr
uly begin to distinguish itself in the marketplace.
 
Then also when you look at WarnerMedia, all three divisions are growing. 
And WarnerMedia was immediately accretive in its first full quarter to the 
tune of $0.05 per share.
 
These strong cash flows have pu
t us on track to hit our deleveraging 
objectives, getting to 2.5 times debt
-
to
-
EBITDA by year
-
end 2019.
 
And John Stephens is going to go into this in more detail. But what you're 
going to see is that we're going to exit this year with our debt maturities 
o
ver four years old that are going to be at a very comfortable level as we 
exit this year.
 
And then last, we made a number of pricing moves on video. And we're 
getting near the end of our fiber build project, which is basically laying the 
foundation for sta
bilizing our broadband and TV business profits in 2019.
 
So across the business we 

 
obviously we have a lot of work to do, a lot of 
integration efforts going on with WarnerMedia. But I like the momentum. I 
feel confident that we're on track to deliver the 
plans that we've laid out. 
And as Mike pointed out, we're going to just go through the quarter today. 
But when we get together on November 29, we're going to give you a full 
blown look at our plans as we move into 2019 and beyond.
 
So with that, that's my h
igh
-
level view on the quarter. And I'm going to turn 
it over now to John Stephens.

Thanks, Randall, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for being on the call 
with us this morning. Let me begin with our financial summary, which 
is on 
slide 3.
 
As we've done in previous quarters, we'll be referring to comparable results 
for most of our segments on the next few slides. AT&T adopted new 
accounting standards this year that deal with revenue recognition, certain 
pension costs, and cert
ain cash receipts on installment receivables. These 
changes impact our income statements and cash flows on a reported basis. 
So at the same time the company made a policy decision to record universal 
service fees and other regulatory fees on a net basis.
 
S
o getting to it. Adjusted EPS was $0.90 per share, which was up more than 
20% for the quarter and up 18% year to date. Tax reform continues to have 
a positive impact on EPS, as does adoption of revenue recognition standards 
as well as the full quarter impa
ct of WarnerMedia.
 
Earnings were pressured by strong smartphone volumes with the launch of 
the iPhone XS as well as some foreign exchange pressure, especially in our 
VRIO and WarnerMedia operations. We continue to expect adjusted earnings 
per share growth 
at the upper end of the $3.50 range. The fourth quarter 
has traditional seasonal Wireless pressure. But our strong third quarter 
iPhone volumes and WarnerMedia will ease that impact.
 
Consolidated revenues came in at $45.7 billion, up 15%, thanks mostly to 
the Time Warner acquisition. When you look on a comparative basis and 
without Time Warner, revenues were essentially flat year over year. Gains in 
Wireless and Xandr, our new advertising segment, were offset by declines in 
legacy services, the impact of tr
ansition in our video business, and foreign 
exchange pressure.
 
Adjusted consolidated operating margins in the quarter were up year over 
year as reported and on a comparable basis. The addition of WarnerMedia 
provides margin support, but solid 
smartphone sales did drive some 
pressure. The biggest margin pressure continues to be because we're 
transitioning from linear to over
-
the
-
top video.
 
Our cash from operations and free cash flow continue to be strong as 
Randall pointed out. Free cash flow wa
s $6.5 billion in the quarter and $14.4 
billion year to date. This is even more impressive when you consider capital 
spending of $5.9 billion with no reimbursement of FirstNet costs in the 
quarter.
 
We continue to expect our capital spending in the $22 bill
ion range this year. 
But we don't expect as much vendor financing in the fourth quarter as 
before. So now we expect to be in the $24 billion range in gross capital 
investment for the year.
 
We're feeling really good about our free cash flow position heading
 
into the 
fourth quarter. We expect $1.3 billion of FirstNet reimbursements in the 
fourth quarter, since we've received the FirstNet authority's approval for the 
latest contract milestone achievement.
 
We also have another full quarter of free cash flow fro
m WarnerMedia. And 
when you consider last fourth quarter's free cash flow of $4.5 billion, 
remember it included $1 billion of employee
-
related payments, including 
employee tax reform bonuses and some benefit funding plans.
 
When you take this all together, 
you can see how this gives us growing 
confidence in our cash position as we move forward. Our ability to generate 
strong free cash flow is a critical part of our strategy and gives us the 
financial strength to both invest in the business and improve our le
verage 
position.
 
Let's now talk segment results, starting with our Communications segment, 
which consists of Mobility, Entertainment Group, and Business Wireline units. 
That information is on slide 4.
 
The tide definitely turned in Wireless. Postpaid phone 
growth continues. 
Prepaid had its second best phone net add quarter in more than 10 years, 
and service revenues grew by more than 2%. Total Wireless revenues were 
up more than 5%, thanks in part to higher equipment revenues.
 
Postpaid phone net adds continu
ed its year
-
over
-
year improvement, adding 
69,000 subscribers. That's the tenth consecutive quarter of year
-
over
-
year 
improvement.
 
Prepaid added another 570,000 subscribers with 481,000 of those being 
prepaid phones. Strong sales did pressure margins, where
 
we sold 700,000 
more postpaid iPhones this year than last. But we grew EBITDA, and our 
service margin was still solid, coming in at about 50%.
 
Moving over to our Entertainment Group, we continue to see the impact of 
the video transition on our revenues an
d margins. We told you last quarter 
that we expect revenue EBITDA pressure to continue the rest of the year. 
And recently Randall talked about stabilizing the business next year. 
Revenues did improve sequentially in the quarter, but some of the margin 
pres
sure continued.
 
Third quarter EBITDA comparisons were also pressured by an additional 
week of NFL SUNDAY TICKET games, which we'll get back with one less 
week in the fourth quarter, and last year's Mayweather/McGregor event, 
which was a record
-
setting even
t. Without those pressures, EBITDA was 
down about 14% year over year, an improvement from the second quarter 
decline.
 
We still have a lot of work to do, but we are committed to stabilizing EBITDA 
in 2019. John Donovan will provide more details on how we'll
 
get to 
Entertainment Group EBITDA stability next year. But you can see the impact 
of some of the first steps we are taking in our third quarter results.
 
DIRECTV NOW net adds were 49,000. We've been very successful in building 
our over
-
the
-
top subscriber b
ase. Now we're focusing on improving 
profitability; scaled back our promotions and special offers. We also moved 
toward market pricing in the quarter. We expected net adds to be impacted 
by these actions, and they were. But subscriber growth in the quarter
 
exceeded our expectations.
 
Traditional TV subs continue to decline but at a slower rate than last year. U
-
verse improved, but we continue to see declines in DIRECTV subscribers. 
DTV subscribers were impacted by a 32,000 customer loss due to the 
eliminatio
n of our prepaid video product in Puerto Rico.
 
In Business Wireline, we continue to improve margins through cost 
efficiencies. Margins were up on a comparable basis, as these cost 
efficiencies offset legacy revenue declines. Part of the margin improvement 
and the revenue lift was from the realization of some intangible revenues in 
the quarter. But even without those revenues, margins were still up year 
over year.
 
Now let's look at WarnerMedia's third quarter results. Those are on slide 5. 
WarnerMedia had st
rong revenue growth with gains in all three business 
units. Higher subscription revenues at HBO and Turner and increased TV 
licensing revenues at Warner Bros. helped drive most of those gains.
 
Total WarnerMedia operating expenses were up year over year, pr
imarily 
due to higher television production costs at Warner Bros., which were 
partially offset by expense declines at Turner and HBO.
 
In August, during our accounting call we estimated the amortization for Time 
Warner pre
-
acquisition, pre
-
release content w
as $600 million and would be 
included in segment EBITDA. Since then, we've done a lot more work, 
specifically on our purchase
-
price accounting efforts. And the amount 
amortized this quarter increased by about $200 million over what we 
expected to reach nea
rly $800 million in the quarter. But even with this 
additional $200 million charge, WarnerMedia EBITDA still grew.
 
Turner saw solid gains in subscription and content level revenues. 
Subscription revenues continue to grow, thanks to higher domestic rates an
d 
growth of Turner's international networks, even with some foreign exchange 
pressure.
 
Turner's advertising revenues declined 4%, or 3% excluding foreign 
exchange. Domestic ad revenues declined low single digits due to lower 
delivery across various Turner 
networks, primarily for kids and young adults. 
International ad revenues declined in the low double digits, reflecting 
pressure from foreign exchange rates.
 
Turner's operating income was up 13% reflecting revenue growth and a 
decline in operating expenses.
 
HBO also delivered solid subscription revenue growth in the quarter. 
Subscription revenues were up 7%, primarily due to higher domestic rates 
and subscriber gains in our national markets. Content and other revenues 
were down due to lower home entertainmen
t and international licensing 
revenues.
 
HBO's operating income was up nearly 11% due to higher revenues and a 
decline in expenses.
 
Warner Bros. revenues grew nearly 8% in the quarter driven by higher 
television licensing revenues. Television revenues incre
ased primarily due to 
higher licensing and initial telecast revenues, driven in part by the number of 
Warner Bros.
-
produced TV series. The actual revenues were mostly flat, 
which was quite an accomplishment considering the tough comparison to the 
year
-
ago 
third quarter.
 
Television licensing and films and a strong box office slate with hit releases 
such as Crazy Rich Asians, The Meg, and The Nun mostly offset the 
challenging theatrical slate and home entertainment release comps from a 
year ago.
 
Warner Bros. 
operating income was essentially stable, as higher revenues 
were offset by higher costs, primarily due to the higher TV productions.
 
WarnerMedia companies also continue to be recognized for their excellence 
in producing high
-
quality entertainment content. 
HBO, Turner, and Warner 
Bros. scored another impressive performance at the Emmys with 
WarnerMedia coming away with 37 primetime Emmy wins. And Turner and 
HBO added another 12 news and documentary Emmy Awards as well. CNN 
got six of those. I think that was 
a record for them.
 
Now let's look at our Latin America and Xandr results on slide 6. Total Latin 
America revenues and EBITDA were down year over year, primarily due to 
foreign exchange. Without the foreign exchange impact, revenues would 
have grown 5% on 
a comparable basis.
 
Subscriber growth continues to be strong in Mexico. We added more than 
900,000 new subscribers and more than 3.5 million in the past year. We 
now have more than 17 million subscribers in total.
 
Service revenue in Mexico was down largely
 
due to the decision we made in 
the first quarter to shut down the wholesale business that we inherited from 
Nextel as well as some FX pressure. Without those impact, service revenues 
would have been up year over year. While FX did impact our Latin America
 
satellite operations, the business continues to be profitable and generate 
cash.
 
During the quarter, we launched Xandr, our new advertising and analytics 
business. And you can understand our enthusiasm for this business when 
you look at the results. Reven
ues were up more than 30% this year, partly 
due to our acquisition of AppNexus in the quarter. But even when you take 
AppNexus out, revenues were up 22% with EBITDA growing by more than 
15%.
 
We believe we're just scratching the surface here. You can see wh
at a 
difference targeted advertising makes when you look at the difference in the 
growth rates between AdWorks and Turner.
 
We're excited about the opportunity to apply our advertising technology to 
the Turner inventory. All together we have about $7 billio
n of consolidated 
annual ad revenues with a portion of that being addressable, highly targeted 
advertising.
 
AppNexus adds to our analytical capabilities even more and is a critical step 
in building our digital advertising marketplace. We'll talk more about
 
this 
during our analyst meeting next month.
 
And now I'd like to turn the call over to John Donovan, who will provide an 
update on our Communications business. John?
 
John M. Donovan 
-
 
AT&T, Inc.
 
Thanks, John. Now before we get to your questions, I'd like t
o take a 
moment to provide an update 

 
oh, sorry. Thanks, John. I'd like to spend 
the next few minutes updating you on our priorities as we close this year 
and head into 2019. That includes building on our momentum in Wireless, 
expanding our fiber footprin
t, managing our video transition, and executing 
on our FirstNet deployment, and lastly, building on our lead in 5G.
 
Let me begin with our Mobility business. As John told you, the Mobility 
business delivered strong results in the third quarter. After four y
ears of 
industry transformation, we've turned a corner with service revenue growth. 
I'm confident in our momentum as we finish off the year.
 
We continue to focus on quality phone net adds, both prepaid and postpaid, 
and saw year
-
over
-
year success with both
 
in the third quarter. As John 
mentioned, this is our tenth consecutive quarter of year
-
over
-
year 
improvement in postpaid phone net adds. And we had the second highest 
prepaid phone net add quarter in more than 10 years.
 
We continue to be impressed with ou
r prepaid customer base. Our prepaid 
business has very strong margins with a revenue stream that's growing at 
almost 7% year over year. From a pure value perspective, they look very 
similar to some of our postpaid base. In fact, through the first three qua
rters 
of the year, about 60% of our Cricket net adds have characteristics that 
would generate similar value that we see out of some of our postpaid 
customers.
 
Moving to the video business. We continue to navigate industry pressure. 
We have plans to bring E
BITDA stability back to our Entertainment Group. 
Allow me to elaborate on that.
 
First, we're refining our four video products, tailoring them to customer 
needs. Our mobility
-
focused WatchTV is gaining traction. DIRECTV NOW is 
being updated to increase its 
simplicity and further differentiate the service. 
And our premium DIRECTV and U
-
verse services focus on the traditional 
linear TV viewers.
 
We've also begun beta testing our proprietary thin client streaming service 
and plan to roll out trials in the first 
half of next year. This will be a more 
measured roll out. And like our introduction of WatchTV, we expect this 
service to be EBITDA positive. And over time, it should lower our acquisition 
cost of our premium video service. And both of these use the common
 
platform we introduced with DIRECTV NOW.
 
Second, we made the strategic decision to rationalize our promotions and 
special offers for DIRECTV NOW. We're taking a more tailored, data driven 
approach. Specifically, we focused on reducing promotions for low v
alue, 
high churn customers.
 
Since launching DIRECTV NOW, we've learned a lot from our nearly 2 million 
subscribers about price elasticity and customer behavior with the virtual 
MVPD services. For example, we see customer behavior evolving somewhat 
like Wir
eless, with some customers seasonally shopping for shows.
 
We know our customer base now. And with our data, we'll continue to tweak 
our approach to optimize profitability and see our value proposition stabilize. 
This puts us in a more stable position as we
 
set up a product realignment in 
2019.
 
Thirdly, we're evaluating our program lineup. Content is the largest and 
fastest
-
growing cost of any video offering. We're evaluating our channel 
lineups and taking a fresh look at how we can align content cost with t
he 
price. It's also about what customers want. And many want smaller, value
-
based video packages.
 
And fourth, the two
-
year price lock promotion for DIRECTV and U
-
verse is 
being lapped. This gives us additional ARPU growth going forward and 
significant marg
in relief through 2019.
 
Another way we're working to improve Entertainment Group EBITDA is by 
driving broadband growth in our fiber footprint. We now cover more than 10 
million customer locations today and plan to add 4 million more locations in 
the next y
ear. We already have substantially more than 3 million broadband 
customers in our fiber footprint. And the longer we have fiber in the market, 
the higher our penetration.
 
In fact, we expect our fiber broadband base to increase by more than 1 
million subscr
ibers this year. This shift to fiber is beginning to drive IP 
broadband ARPU growth. The strategic pivot we're making with video, 
combined with our execution with fiber gives us the confidence that we will 
stabilize Entertainment Group EBITDA next year.
 
Fi
nally, we're keeping a laser focus on costs in all of our businesses and 
maintaining our margins in Business Wireline.
 
Let's now move to an update on our FirstNet deployment, which is on slide 
9. Our FirstNet team continues to execute extremely well. So fa
r, we 
launched a nationwide FirstNet dedicated and physically separate network 
core with FirstNet traffic moving on it. We have priority and pre
-
emption in 
place, allowing continuous service during times of heavy traffic.
 
FirstNet devices are ready and ava
ilable. These devices support all AT&T 
commercial LTE bands as well as the FirstNet Band 14 and meet the band 
priority selection technical requirements. And we're six months ahead of 
schedule with our network deployment already covering about one
-
third of 
the expected FirstNet area.
 
We're seeing in real time how we are performing in times of emergency with 
Hurricane Michael being the latest example. We began preparing for this 
storm before it arrived and our work continues even to today.
 
Because of these ef
forts, we were able to keep our customers, including first 
responders, connected during and after the storm in many areas. In fact, 
our network operated at 90%, and usually better, of normal performance in 
the areas affected by Hurricane Michael. And throu
gh our tight coordination 
with public safety, we rolled out network assets to impacted areas to keep 
first responders connected.
 
We also worked with local authorities to identify public safety agencies that 
were without service from their wireless 
provider and delivered hundreds of 
FirstNet
-
enabled devices to help these first responders carry out their 
important mission of keeping the public safe.
 
One first responder went as far to say, when everything else was down, 
FirstNet was working. That's hig
h praise, and we're humbled that we can 
play a part in helping a community recover from such a devastating storm. 
That's what FirstNet is all about.
 
We continue to push our deployment. We're climbing towers and adding 700 
megahertz, AWS, and WCS spectrum a
ll at once. We're also adding new 
radio capability, which will enable us to upgrade the tower to 5G, without 
another tower climb.
 
The first responder community is a great sales opportunity for us. It's an 
area where we've been under
-
penetrated in the past.
 
But with our dedicated 
network core and outstanding performance when it matters most to the first 
responders, we're making headway.
 
We now have more than 250,000 subscribers on FirstNet with more than 
3,600 agencies represented. With a sales team dedicate
d to building this 
base, we believe there's a lot of opportunity waiting for us.
 
Now I'd like to talk about our leadership in 5G, which is on slide 10. AT&T is 
on track to be the first wireless carrier to introduce mobile 5G services in the 
United States i
n the next few weeks. This will be standards
-
based 5G. We 
plan to introduce 5G in parts of 12 cities by the end of the year. And we've 
announced additional 5G cities for next year, as we drive toward nationwide 
coverage of our 5G network.
 
Second, our 5G fo
undation is in place. We've completed 5G trials in several 
cities in the last three years. Fiber is the backbone of 5G, and we have one 
of the nation's largest fiber networks. Including businesses, we pass about 
18 million customer locations today and are 
expanding that to more than 22 
million locations by next year.
 
We plan for our 5G Evolution to be in more than 400 markets by the end of 
this year with nationwide coverage by mid
-
2019. Customers are seeing a 
dramatic lift in speeds with theoretical peak sp
eeds reaching 400 megabits 
per second.
 
We also plan to launch LTE Licensed Assisted Access, or LTE
-
LAA, in parts of 
24 cities by the end of the year. These are the building blocks towards the 
transition to 5G and can deliver speeds substantially faster tha
n traditional 
LTE.
 
We're also the leader in software defined networking and are on track with 
our virtualization goals. This virtualization is bringing baseband units to the 
edge of the cloud or core and is going to be key for ultra
-
low latency that's 
in 5
G.
 
Thanks in part to our FirstNet build, our fallow spectrum is being put into 
service at a rapid rate. We're on track to increase the amount of spectrum 
deployed by nearly 50%.
 
This is having a dramatic positive impact on our network, and others are 
notic
ing. We've been named the nation's best network by a September GWS 
OneScore study, which is the largest and most comprehensive network study 
of its kind. Our network already is a recognized leader, and we're taking 
steps to make it even better.
 
With that, 
I'll turn it back over to you, John.
 
John J. Stephens 
-
 
AT&T, Inc.
 
Thanks, John. Now before we get to your questions, I'd like to take a 
moment to provide an update on our deleveraging plans. Those are on slide 
12.
 
You know the commitments we've made. We p
lan to get to the 2.9 times 
range by the end of this year, drop that even lower by the end of next year 
to the 2.5 times range, and then return to historical levels by year
-
end 
2022.
 
One big way we plan to accomplish that is through free cash flow growth. 
Our strong third quarter cash from operations and free cash flow results 
points to our ability to do just that.
 
We also continue to look for ways to monetize our large asset portfolio. We 
made several such moves in recent years, most recently the sale of o
ur data 
centers and our under
-
utilized spectrum, combined generating over a couple 
billion dollars of proceeds. And we've identified billions of dollars of other 
assets where we can do more. So this is an ongoing process.
 
Our merger synergies will also hel
p contribute, and they remain on target, 
$1.5 billion in cost synergies and $1 billion in revenue related synergies on a 
run rate basis by the end of 2021.
 
In addition, capital market options will be under consideration 

 
or quite 
frankly, are under consid
eration. All options will be evaluated. We're going 
into diverse markets and looking at diverse investor bases. We'll consider 
make whole calls, tenders, as well as any other efficient capital alternatives. 
We've got that work going on now.
 
You can see how
 
we are at managing our debt maturities by looking at what 
we've accomplished just since the merger closed. Since we've closed the 
deal, we've managed to spread maturity towers very effectively and expect 
to retire or refinance $28 billion of near
-
 
to inte
rmediate
-
term maturities by 
the end of the year.
 
As you can see from our schedule, we've done most of that already. We've 
done this with cash on hand at the time of the close and utilizing diverse 
capital markets over the last four months. Our debt towers 
will look much 
different, resulting in very manageable annual debt payments.
 
We also have been able to lock in a portion of our debt into historically low 
interest rates. About 90% of our market debt is fixed rate, protecting us 
from rising interest rates.
 
And when rates do rise, as they have in recent 
months, we have a natural hedge with our pension and benefit plans.
 
Simply put, a 1% increase in the discount rate today will decrease our 
pension plan liabilities by about $5 billion, so a very effective eco
nomic 
hedge.
 
Bottom line, our financial strength allows us to achieve our leverage targets 
and continue to invest in our business and return value to shareholders.
 
With that, I think we're ready to take your questions.

Question
-
and
-
Answer Session
 
Operator
 
Thank you. And first, we'll go to the line of Simon Flannery with Morgan 
Stanley. Please go ahead.
 
Simon Flannery 
-
 
Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
 
Thank you very much. Good morning. So, Randall, I think 
recently you 
talked about the free cash flow as part of the deleveraging, getting to a $25 
billion floor, the value exiting 2018. I wonder if you could just elaborate on 
what's driving that? And how you see that evolving over the course of 2019? 
Thanks.
 
Ra
ndall L. Stephenson 
-
 
AT&T, Inc.
 
Sure. Hi, Simon. Thanks.
 
Simon Flannery 
-
 
Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
 
Morning.
 
Randall L. Stephenson 
-
 
AT&T, Inc.
 
Yeah, what I said through I think it was last month was that we had told The 
Street, we had told everybody we wo
uld do $21 billion
-
plus this year in free 
cash flow. And that includes $2 billion of merger costs associated with the 
Time Warner deal.
 
And so the $21 billion, plus the $2 billion, which doesn't recur next year, 
puts you at $23 billion. And that all 

 
the 
$21 billion also only included a 
couple billion, $2 billion of Time Warner cash flow. So you put Time Warner 
in for a full year, you get to $25 billion exiting this year as a run rate.
 
Now if you just kind of want to test that number, if you look at the fi
rst 
quarter we just posted here, in terms of what our free cash flow was for this 
quarter at $6.5 billion, annualize that, and you're at a $26 billion
-
plus kind 
of run rate number.
 
And so just to kind of help you simplistically understand how you get to a 
$25 billion number, that's kind of the path that we're on right now. And that 
assumes no growth in our Mobility business. It assumes no growth in 
WarnerMedia.
 
We assume that we keep the Mobility business growing. We assume that we 
get the Entertainment Gro
up, our broadband and TV business to stable next 
year, whereas right now it's declining on an EBITDA basis double digits. And 
then you get Mexico from an EBITDA dilution standpoint this year to we 
think we can get this thing to break even or positive next 
year.
 
So you put all that together, we get good EBITDA growth, which should drive 
cash flow growth. And so $25 billion is just a comfortable number that I put 
out there. And we're actually on a run rate that looks better than that now.
 
John J. Stephens 
-
 
A
T&T, Inc.
 
Yeah, Randall, just if I can (36:23) add to that, we're really far along on our 
12.5 million [customer locations] fiber
-
to
-
the
-
prem commitment out of the 
DTV transaction. That'll be done some time around the middle of the year, 
has to be. So we h
ave a support there for a capital management, capital 
spend management.
 
Secondly, we've essentially completed the Mexico 100 million LTE build. 
We're just about right there on the edge. So once again, that'll give us an 
opportunity to hedge that.
 
Third, th
e FirstNet team and the network team working with them have been 
remarkable. They're well ahead of the targeted builds. We spent money to 
do that, close to a $0.5 billion, a little bit over $0.5 billion this quarter that 
we weren't reimbursed for.
 
And so t
hat bodes well for us as we have had our milestones approved and 
expect to receive $1.3 billion in proceeds, reimbursements for that contract 
this quarter. So all of those things are what are building this momentum 
about strong cash flows.
 
Randall L. Steph
enson 
-
 
AT&T, Inc.
 
I think it's important too to take what John said and I said about where we 
exit the year in terms of free cash flow. And then pair that with that last 
schedule John Stephens walked you through on our debt maturities.
 
We will exit this y
ear with average annual debt maturities for the next four 
years of $12 billion, well within the free cash flow less dividend range. And 
so we feel like we've got it stacked up where the debt is very manageable. 
We can get to these deleveraging targets that
 
John spoke of. And I think it's 
stacked up well right now.
 
Simon Flannery 
-
 
Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
 
Great. Thanks for the color.
 
Randall L. Stephenson 
-
 
AT&T, Inc.
 
Thank you.
 
John J. Stephens 
-
 
AT&T, Inc.
 
Thanks, Simon.
 
Michael J. Viola 
-
 
AT&T, Inc.
 
Take the next question.
 
Operator
 
And we'll go to John Hodulik with UBS. Please go ahead.
 
John C. Hodulik 
-
 
UBS Securities LLC
 
Okay. Thanks. Maybe for Randall, a broader question. You guys have voiced 
a lot of confidence in the financial performance, which 
we just heard, and 
the strategic vision of the company. But the market's clearly not giving you 
credit for a lot of these things.
 
As you talk to investors, what do you think it is that the market's missing? Is 
it what you just went over there, the cash flo
w profile of the company versus 
the debt? Or if you could just sort of 

 
what do you think is missing from the 
equation, given the performance of the stock?
 
Randall L. Stephenson 
-
 
AT&T, Inc.
 
I think in terms of missing from the equation, I feel like we're
 
tracking on 
plan right now, John.
 
As I pointed out earlier, the debt is very manageable. I'm very comfortable 
with the debt, the deleveraging, and getting down to 2.5 times by end of 
year next year. I think the cash flow characteristics of the business to
day 
already have us there. And that assumes that we have no further growth in 
2019 in terms of our cash and our EBITDA. Cash flow is growing at a 14% 
year
-
over
-
year pace.
 
And so I think what we're going to have to just demonstrate to the market is 
continue
d performance in the Mobility side of the business. I think we have 
very good momentum.
 
As I mentioned on the prepaid side, Cricket is just defining that category and 
doing incredibly well. And that's an incredibly profitable customer base that 
we're build
ing there and doing very well. The postpaid is doing well. ARPUs 
are growing in Mobility. And EBITDA looks really good.
 
And so if we can get this, the Entertainment Group, which is our broadband 
and our TV business, to stability, and we get Mexico to EBITD
A neutral, to 
even EBITDA growth next year, then you have an equation that looks like 
really good cash flow growth for the next three, four years.
 
And so I think what we have to do is continue executing and posting 
quarters. I actually am pleased with this
 
quarter. And we continue to do this, 
I think the markets will reflect that.
 
John C. Hodulik 
-
 
UBS Securities LLC
 
And is EBITDA growth a part of that story? I mean, just it declined about 
2.2% this quarter. Last quarter it was down about 5%, which is a nic
e 
trajectory to be on. Do you expect that trajectory to continue?
 
Randall L. Stephenson 
-
 
AT&T, Inc.
 
Yeah, look, I mean, the EBITDA is driven by our Mobility business. And so 
can we get the Mobility business to good solid EBITDA growth? And I'll let 
John D
onovan provide more color on that.
 
But I think we have a high degree of confidence that we can get Mobility to 
EBITDA growth. And so, yeah, to answer your question, we need to 
demonstrate sustained EBITDA growth on the company.
 
WarnerMedia, I mean you're s
eeing EBITDA growth today. Mobility, you're 
seeing us at EBITDA growth. Can we extend the Mobility EBITDA growth and 
get Entertainment Group to flat? Then there's your recipe for EBITDA 
growth. John, would you like to add any color on the Entertainment Gro
up?
 
John M. Donovan 
-
 
AT&T, Inc.
 
I'd love to. So if you look at the components of the Entertainment Group, 
what I think gets lost sometimes is it's a broadband
-
led world out there right 
now. If you look at the broadband portfolio, our fiber footprint build
 
has 
given us a lot of inventory to sell into.
 
If you look at the industry's rate of decline on linear video, you find that 
we're doing dramatically better than the industry where we have fiber 
footprint. We're doing dramatically better than the industry i
n churn and 
acquisition where we have 25 meg and greater.
 
Where our stress is is in the linear, in areas where we're priced with just the 
linear video. And we're going to have to take actions to continue to improve 
how we're doing there.
 
But with the fiber
 
inventory that we've got coming online back half of this 
year, first part of next year, we have a lot of footprint to sell into. And within 
the quarter, not only do we have broadband ARPU growth, each month of 
the quarter got stronger. So we feel very goo
d about where the broadband 
footprint is, in particular the fiber area. And that will help us with the video 
business, the linear video business.
 
Probably the most important thing to draw attention to is the transition of 
the video business within. And if 
I could take just a minute to talk through 
what we've done there.
 
We thought it important as a 25% market share player in linear video that 
we be prepared to own the customers in this transition. And so when we put 
together an OTT product, DIRECTV NOW, 
we wanted to catch our customers. 
And I mentioned to you on prior calls that a large portion of those customers 
were either coming from cable or were coming from cord
-
cutter categories.
 
So we now have enough experience there to know that that business is a
 
little bit like the prepaid Wireless business. We have seasonal shoppers who 
are shopping for shows. It's very promotionally intensive for roughly a third 
of that base.
 
And we're going to continue to curate that portfolio in a way that allows us 
to become
 
more profitable. So as you think about the profitability of the 
video portfolio, the full
-
service premium product is going to continue to be 
driven by footprint. We feel very good about how broadband assists us 
there.
 
We're going to take our learnings in 
DIRECTV NOW and be more 
discriminating about the content that's provided and the profitability of that 
content. And then for mobile
-
only, we've got WatchTV, which right out of the 
chute is a profitable product.
 
And so I would say that right now we're very 
well
-
positioned as we roll into 
2019 to be confident that we're going to get EBITDA stability in the video 
portfolio alone. That coupled with the strength of broadband will give us a 
really good EG performance overall as we roll into 2019.
 
John C. Hodulik

Okay. Thanks for the color, guys.
 
Michael J. Viola

AT&T, Inc.
 
Thanks. Just can we take the next question, please?
 
Operator
 
We'll go to Phil Cusick with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
 
Philip A. Cusick 
-
 
JPMorgan
 
Thanks, guys. John Donovan
, if I could follow
-
up on what you just said. Can 
you dig into more on the trends in linear and DIRECTV NOW this quarter? I 
think that we and other people were a little surprised by the numbers, given 
the commentary about resiliency in September in DIRECTV
 
NOW, but you 
said it was better than expected. Was the sequential slowdown a gross add 
or mostly a churn challenge? Thanks.
 
John M. Donovan 
-
 
AT&T, Inc.
 
Well, if you look within the portfolio of the base that we've got, a lot of you 
folks have done your a
nalytics, done surveying, and it's shown that DIRECTV 
NOW product, generally, we have tremendous engagement.
 
But within DIRECTV NOW, it's a tale of two cities. It's folks that are just 
jumping from promotion to promotion and really spinning in the industry
 
between us, Hulu Live, YouTube TV. And so what we're learning, where and 
who those customers are, what people are viewing.
 
And so we actually expected a far worse outcome than we had. Its resiliency 
we 

 
when we raised pricing and took promotions off 

 
we
 
were not at all 
promotional or very, very limited promotions of that product overall. And 
then we started to shift our mix.
 
So what we're after is customers that are highly engaged, that find the 
product compelling and use it a lot. That will lend itself 
towards being able to 
be supplemented by an ad model over time. And so what we wanted is to 
secure that base. And that's what we're going to focus on.
 
So going forward, our own team forecasts the growth of the OTT category 
lower than I think a lot of the a
nalyst community does. Because after a first 
big slug with the introduction of fulsome packages, we're starting to learn 
now the customer base that's using this.
 
And so if you look at linear TV, it's really going to be about broadband and 
how do we use bro
adband to lead ourselves into premium TV. And then get 
an OTT package that's well
-
suited to the people that are going to be the 
heavily engaged users.
 
That customer base that we burned off, if you will, in the third quarter, and 
that we may or may not goin
g forward chase in any given quarter, is always 
available. It's very promotionally
-
sensitive and price
-
sensitive, so you can 
always go get that business when you find the economics to do it so 

 
or 
advantageous as a result of, for instance, what you can do
 
on ad
-
supported 
models.
 
And so we learned a lot about it. We've streamlined the content packages. 
We've changed the mix of customers we're taking in with a bias towards 
getting people that are heavily engaged, that are buying on the higher end 
of those OT
T offers.

I was going to say, can I follow up once more on the question earlier? John, 
did you just say to expect stability in video EBITDA next year, as well as 
growth
 
in broadband? So are you guiding us now to growing Entertainment 
EBITDA?
 
John M. Donovan 
-
 
AT&T, Inc.
 
No. What we're saying is we expect to see stability in the Entertainment 
Group as total, fueled in part by our solid performance in broadband as we 
get t
he 14 million fiber
-
to
-
the
-
prem customers available to sell into.
 
So the broadband results, which we are optimistic about, will add to our 
ability to get to overall stability in the Entertainment Group.

We'll go to Amy Yong with Macquarie Research. Please go ahead.

Thank you and good morning. Maybe one on advertising. Can you talk a 
little bit more about Xandr? I think a lot of us have seen cable's JV (48:31) 
in the past. How are you thinking about this differently? What are you doing 
differently?
 
And I think you rec
ently signed up Frontier and Altice. What's been the 
receptiveness with those two in terms of the ad community?
 
And then maybe as the last part of the question, how does this then shape 
your view on Entertainment EBITDA? Thanks.
 
John M. Donovan 
-
 
AT&T, Inc
.
 
So this is John. Let me try to take a stab at it and ask Randall to jump in. 
First of all, when we looked at our opportunities with regard to the data 
analytics and the information that we had available, as well as the 
advertising opportunity, the first 
thing was to go out and get a collection of 
talent that has been established at Xandr that can really give us different 
insights, different capabilities, and we've done that. The second piece was 
then to get the 

 
and so and those included data analytics c
apabilities that 
are specifically talented towards or gifted towards the advertising space.
 
Secondly, you need to get the technology platform and the ability to 
continue to develop data driven products. AppNexus was key to that, not 
only with their supply 
side and demand side platforms, but quite frankly, 
with their core talent, which is their engineering group. That brings us 
engineers that have this capability and have dealt with this for a long time, a 
great experience there.
 
When you combine those asset
s then with the tremendous data we have 
from a 25 million customer base in the video space, when you combine that 
with a significant inventory of advertising slots, whether it's the Turner 
inventory slots, 14 minutes in an hour of TV, or the 2 minutes from
 
DIRECTV, you have both the data and the inventory capabilities. That's what 
this is about.
 
We have started that process with AdWorks, specifically from the legacy 
DIRECTV. And you've seen those results, double digit revenue growth. The 
quarter was 22% wit
hout AppNexus, tremendous performance. And we're 
proving that it works in that linear TV space.
 
I think we had announcements with regard to a couple of the other, if you 
will, distributors joining with us with regard to this, both Altice and Frontier. 
So w
e're starting to get traction with some of our other participants in the 
industry that view the team and the resources and the capability as being 
highly attractive. We'll continue to work on those efforts.
 
But longer term, if you can continue to grow this
 
and use this capability, it 
can provide so much flexibility on your 

 
from your customer base on linear 
TV, on the DIRECTV NOW, and the over
-
the
-
top. Quite frankly, then moving 
it on to Wireless and other areas.
 
The reaction I think from the business comm
unity has been positive. The 
reaction from our advertisers, I think it's been generally positive. I think we 
need to 

 
we will continue to focus on proving that we can do what we say 
we're going to do, which the team is certainly doing.
 
And the opportuniti
es are bright, particularly if we can move towards similar 
results across our total inventory of ads as well as attract other participants 
to join with us to increase the overall quality. Randall, anything you'd like to 
add?
 
Randall L. Stephenson 
-
 
AT&T, I
nc.
 
I think you covered it quite well. We just 

 
we could 

 
we have a lot of 
confidence as we build the mechanical tools and put in place a marketplace 
where people can design campaigns, measure campaigns, and do it without 
a lot of human intervention, whi
ch is what AppNexus does today in the 
digital world.
 
As we stand that up, can this 22% growth that we're experiencing on just 
our DIRECTV inventory 

 
and keep in mind, that 22% growth we saw on the 
DIRECTV inventory is on a subscriber base that's declining
 
3% year over 
year.
 
And so if the revenues are growing 22% on a declining subscriber base, does 
that translate into a more fulsome inventory over in Turner? And can you 
drive growth rates that look that attractive on the Turner side? We actually 
have a hig
h degree of confidence we can. This will take time to put these 
tools in place and develop the capability. But we have a high to 

 
we really 
have a high degree of confidence here. And we're very enthusiastic about 
this opportunity.
 
Michael J. Viola

AT&T,

Amy, I know you asked about the advertiser business. Did you have another 
question in there?
 
Amy Yong 
-
 
Macquarie Capital (
USA

No, I actually wanted to just follow up and see if Xandr at all 
shapes your 
view on Entertainment EBITDA group's 

 
and hitting stability? Thanks.
 
John M. Donovan 
-
 
AT&T, Inc.
 
Yeah. And I think as John earlier covered, we're focused on improving that 
EBITDA trends and we're looking towards stability coming in 2019. 
And 
that's going to be both from the video strategy that John laid out and 
marketplace actions as well as continued improvement in broadband from 
our fiber
-
based products.
 
Randall L. Stephenson 
-
 
AT&T, Inc.
 
I think the other thing, John, I would add is tha
t 

 
we mentioned it in the 
formal notes, is that two
-
year price locks that we have in place are rolling 
off. And the traditional linear video ARPU as a result of that can move to 
market pricing on most of the base. And us rolling past that is a really 
impo
rtant lever for us going forward.

AT&T, Inc.
 
Even if the content costs continue to escalate at 10%.

Operator
 
We'll go to David Barden with Bank of America Merrill
 
Lynch. Please go 
ahead.
 
David Barden

Bank of America Merrill Lynch
 
Hey, guys. Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. I guess the first 
one for John Stephens on deleveraging. So, John, could you 

 
two things I 
guess, two sub
-
parts.
 
Could you elab
orate more specifically on kind of what assets specifically are 
of a large enough magnitude to be relevant to the deleveraging 
conversation? And also does the deleveraging target have an asterisk next 
to it relevant to spectrum spending? And ignoring the m
illimeter wave, 
things like CBRS and C
-
Band. Or are you guys comfortable with where you 
are spectrum
-
wise and you can focus exclusively on the deleveraging?
 
And then just a housekeeping item, kind of following up on Amy's question 
on advertising. I think a
dvertising is kind of showing up in a lot of different 
places. It's being double counted in some other places. It's being eliminated 
in third places. So could you kind of just run through, John Stephens again, 
kind of where we're seeing advertising show up
? And what's being reported 
where? Thanks so much.
 
John J. Stephens 
-
 
AT&T, Inc.
 
Great. So let me take the last one first. Advertising is showing up at about a 
$400 million run rate. And just pure advertising in the AdWorks, the 
advertising segment, and th
at is from ads that are sold on the legacy TV, 
linear TV business, or in DIRECTV. So the revenue is showing up in 
advertising segment as well as about just under $6 a month on the customer 
base in the Entertainment Group. And then that is eliminated throug
h 
company eliminations at the corporate segment.
 
Secondly, there's about $40 (56:12) worth of revenue this quarter from 
AppNexus. That's reported in the advertising business segment and only 
there.
 
Third, there is about 

 
we run about $1 billion, or maybe 
it's a little bit less 
than that, this quarter in advertising in Turner, in WarnerMedia. That's 
reported there. That is not reported in the advertising segment because 
Turner manages that, WarnerMedia manages that internally.
 
And then what we do is we prov
ide a supplement to show you a full picture 
of the advertising capabilities or revenue streams for the total of AT&T. And 
that supplemental adds those two numbers together and that's included in 
our disclosure sheet. So that's just an effort to make sure w
e give you full 
transparency with regard to what our total advertising is.
 
So that's how it's recorded. That's how it's reported and it gives you 
comparable information for DIRECTV compared to other participants in the 
TV industry, gives you the informatio
n appropriate for advertising, gives you 
the information appropriate for WarnerMedia, and how they compare to 
others in the media industry. So it's just an effort to make sure we give 
comparable data that you can utilize as you look at other companies.
 
Dav
id Barden

Bank of America Merrill Lynch
 
Great.
 
John J. Stephens

AT&T, Inc.
 
With regard to asterisks, there are no asterisks. The 2.5 [times] range, 
which means if we come in at 2.51 [times] or 2.52 [times], we're going to 
say we met our mark. That's wh
at the range is about. It's not 

 
it's about 
2.51 [times], 2.52 [times] and we did our jobs. We're not that 

 
we don't 
want to come across as being that precise or that forward knowing that we 
can predict that. But there's no asterisk with regard to, if yo
u will, any asset 
purchases.
 
With regard to asset sales, I'd just say it this way. We go through the listing 
of real estate we have, and I know this sounds a little bit 

 
if we go, for 
example, the new opportunities on credit process that came through the 
Tax 
Reform Act (sic) [Tax Cuts and Jobs Act] (58:14). We have real estate all 
over the country that falls into those. We have a whole different category of 
real estate sales that may qualify or may be interested on that. If you think 
about our administrati
ve buildings and, quite frankly, across the total new 
AT&T, you've got a whole opportunity.
 
So I'm not going to get into any major transactions. Certainly, as you can 
imagine, that might not do anything to help the valuation process. But we're 
looking at e
verything. And needless to say, that total listed 

 
total dollar 
amount of assets is material even for us, and we'll continue to work it and 
focus on it.
 
We got a great plan. We have cash from ops, managing CapEx as we go 
forward with so many of our projec
ts getting completed. That generates 
great free cash flow and solid EBITDAs with merger synergies and 
improvement in our business, that we've got a great way to get there.
 
The asset sales are an additional way to make sure that we meet and exceed 
these goa
ls. But no list of assets on this call today.

Bank of America Merrill Lynch
 
Great. Thanks, John.
 
John J. Stephens 
-
 
AT&T, Inc.
 
Sure.
 
Michael J. Viola 
-
 
AT&T, Inc.
 
Okay. We'll take one more question.
 
Operator
 
And that will be from 
Matthew Niknam with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
 
Matthew Niknam 
-
 
Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
 
Great. Thanks for getting me in. I'll ask about Wireless. Can you help us 
think about the churn step
-
up in the quarter? Whether it was tied more to 
pricing 
actions or any sort of change in the competitive backdrop?
 
And then seasonally, I think there's been another step
-
up that you've 
typically seen in the fourth quarter. Do you anticipate another step
-
up off of 
the 0.93% that you saw this past quarter? Thanks
.
 
John M. Donovan 
-
 
AT&T, Inc.
 
Yeah, if we start with the revenue side of the formula, we feel pretty 
strongly that with the last four or five quarters of growth 

 
and that's just 
not year
-
over
-
year improvement. When we go to absolute growth, you start 
to 
have that kick into the base of your revenue.
 
We took price action, so we expect the churn to tick up as a result of those 
price actions. And a lot of that has subsided now because the price actions 
occurred in late first and through the second quarter. An
d so we feel very 
good about where we are right now in both customer acquisitions.
 
And by the way, by the data that we looked at, if you take the third quarter, 
we believe we were the least promotional of all the carriers out there. And 
yet provided some g
ood net growth on both the traditional postpaid business 
at Cricket, which you've heard a lot of excitement about today. So if you 
look at the total performance on phones, smartphones, we had a really good 
quarter. And we're starting to get growth out of C
ricket. We're getting 
growth in the core business.
 
And we're the least promotional of all the carriers, both from the standpoint 
of when you look at our share of voice in advertising and the financial 
promotions, incentives for customers. So we're executin
g with things like 
stores and close rates and traffic
-
driving and putting 

 
bundling up. That still 
continues to be a very effective acquisition tool.
 
So if you look at share of gross adds, and I'm sure you folks on the call here 
will run that, you start t
o look at how we've been doing. Our share, flow 
share in the business has improved dramatically year over year. And that's 
where the strength is coming from.
 
The last thing I'll say is that the iPhone launch is very different this year 
than last year. The 
sequencing of the more expensive device, the timing of 
availability of those, that difference does net into the results. So net of that, 
we feel that that business was a strong third quarter. And we're very 
confident in the momentum of that business going 
forward.
 
Randall L. Stephenson 
-
 
AT&T, Inc.
 
So with that, again, thanks, everybody, for joining the call. And just as a 
recap, first full quarter with WarnerMedia under our belts. And we have cash 
flow growing nicely. Operating cash flow 14%, free cash flo
w 17%.
 
Mobility is back to growth and executing well. We feel really well about 

 
really good about where it's headed into 2019. WarnerMedia executing very 
well, and the first full quarter is accretive to earnings by $0.05 a share.
 
And going to exit the ye
ar with our debt portfolio at a very reasonable place, 
deleveraging plans on track, getting to 2.5 times debt
-
to
-
EBITDA by the end 
of year next year.
 
So bottom line, we feel like we're stacking up well for 2019. And appreciate 
everybody joining us and look
 
forward to seeing everybody on November 29 
in New York. Thanks, again.

Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the AT&T 
Second Quarter 2018 Earnings Call. At this time, all of your participant 
phone lines are in a listen
-
only mode. Later, we will conduct a question
-
and
-
answer session. 
Instructions will be given at that time. [Operator 
Instructions]
 
I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Michael Viola, 
Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
 
Michael Viola
 
Okay. Thanks, Lori, and good afternoon, ever
yone. Welcome to the second 
quarter conference call. As Lori said, I'm Mike Viola, Head of Investor 
Relations here at AT&T. This is our first call 
-
 
first earnings call after we 
closed our acquisition of Time Warner, and we're broadcasting this call from 
W
arnerMedia headquarters in New York.
 
As we told you earlier, we're going to use this call not only to discuss the 
quarter, but we're also going to provide more details on our strategy. And to 
do that, we've brought together the CEO, CFO and four business l
eaders of 
our business units.
 
Today's agenda is going to begin with John Stephens, who will cover AT&T 
and Time Warner's second quarter financial results as well as update our 
outlook and guidance. Randall will provide a strategic perspective of the 
busine
ss. And then each of the business unit leaders will take 
--
 
will talk 
about their second quarter results and give a perspective of their businesses 
going forward. After that, the entire team will be available to participate in 
the Q&A session.
 
I'd like to 
mention one save the date item. We plan host a sell
-
side meeting 
on the evening of November 29 and followed by a buy
-
side meeting that 
next morning on the 30th. Both would be here in New York, and all the folks 
on this call will join us for those meetings.
 
So please mark your calendars, 
and more details to come.
 
Now before I turn the call over to John, I need to call your attention to our 
safe harbor statement. It says that some of the comments today will be 
forward looking and as such is subject to risks, 
uncertainties. Results may 
differ materially. In addition, information is available on the Investor 
Relations website.
 
I also need to remind you that we're in the quiet period from the FCC CAF
-
II 
auction, so we can't address any questions about that today.
 
As always, our 
earnings materials are available on the Investor Relations page of the AT&T 
website. That includes the news release, 8
-
K, investor briefing, other 
associated schedules, and available on our website are materials on Warner 
Media's full secon
d quarter. It includes trending schedule and other 
important documents.
 
And so now I'd like to turn the call over to AT&T's Chief Financial Officer, 
John Stephens.
 
John Stephens
 
Thanks, Mike, and hello, everyone, and thanks for being on the call today. 
Let
 
me begin with our financial summary, which is on Slide 5.
 
I think most of you know the FASB has been very, very busy this past year 
implementing a number of accounting standards, five of which have direct 
impact on AT&T. Those include standards that deal 
with revenue recognition, 
pension reporting, impacts on cash flow reporting.
 
These changes impact our income statements and cash flow. At the same 
time, the company made a policy decision to record universal service fees 
net as an offset to our regulatory 
fees.
 
We're working hard to help you understand these changes. So in addition to 
the GAAP financial information, we're providing comparable historical results 
to help you better understand the impact on the financials from revenue 
recognition and the polic
y decisions, as well as Time Warner's second 
quarter results on a historical basis. We will be referring to these historical 
results in our comparisons during the call.
 
Now let's start with EPS. We continue to show strong adjusted EPS growth, 
up more than 
15% for both the quarter and year
-
to
-
date. Tax reform 
continues to have a positive impact on EPS as does the adoption of revenue 
recognition.
 
We also had about $0.02 of help from the 16 days we own Time Warner, 
which we have renamed WarnerMedia. The Warner
Media earnings 
contribution was slightly more than what you might expect for such a short 
period. But as you know, financial results can be uneven, and we saw that in 
the second quarter.
 
Consolidated revenue came in at $39 billion, down slightly from a yea
r ago, 
but that includes about $900 million of pressure from how we are now 
accounting for USF fees on a net basis.
 
When you look on a comparable basis, revenues were up slightly, thanks 
mostly due to the two weeks of Time Warner revenue but also helped by
 
gains in wireless and AdWorks.
 
We continue to use our tax reform savings to invest in and grow our 
customer base. As John Donovan will discuss, these investments help drive 
post
-
paid phone growth and significant year
-
over
-
year improvement in 
prepaid phone
 
net adds, continued growth in consumer broadband 
customers even in a seasonally challenging quarter and solid subscriber 
growth in total video customers.
 
Adjusted consolidated operating margins in the quarter were up year
-
over
-
year on a reported basis but
 
down on a comparable one. Solid smartphone 
sales drove some of the pressure to margins, but the biggest factor 
continues to be customer transition to over
-
the
-
top video.
 
Let's now look at free cash flow. It was a strong $5.1 billion for the quarter, 
up su
bstantially both year
-
over
-
year and sequentially. Year
-
to
-
date, our 
cash from operations and free cash flow is up about $1.5 billion, which 
makes us very comfortable with our free cash flow guidance for the full year.
 
Our cash flows also reflect the timing
 
differences between spending for 
FirstNet and the reimbursements we received from the organization. This 
usually trail spending by several months. Year
-
to
-
date, that comes to more 
than $100 million of free cash flow pressure. Capital spending for the quar
ter 
was $5.1 billion or $5.4 billion before the $300 million of FirstNet 
reimbursements we did receive in the quarter.
 
Let's now cover financial results from operations beginning on Slide 6. 
AT&T's domestic mobility operations are divided between the Busin
ess 
Solutions and consumer wireless segments. For comparison purposes, we're 
providing supplemental information for our total U.S. wireless operations.
 
Our wireless business turned in very good results. Year
-
over
-
year service 
revenue turned positive. Margi
ns remained strong, and we had phone 
growth in both post
-
paid and pre
-
paid.
 
Total revenues were up year
-
over
-
year, thanks to gains in both service and 
equipment revenues. Also, service revenues were up almost 2% 
sequentially. Strong sales in BYOD supported
 
that growth.
 
Our upgrade rate was down year
-
over
-
year, but our equipment revenues 
were up, reflecting customers' purchasing habits and their choice of more 
expensive devices. But even with these strong sales, margins were very 
good with service margins co
ming in over 50% on a comparable basis. 
Looking ahead, we expect positive service revenue growth for the full year 
on a comparable basis.
 
Turning to our Entertainment Group. We continue to see the impact of the 
video transition in our revenues and our 
margins. This would take a while to 
work through, and we expect it to continue the rest of the year. But we are 
seeing some sequential stability in both revenues and margins.
 
We're making changes to drive revenues and effectively manage the 
transition. We'
re going to introduce some promotional pricing that impacted 
revenues in the past, and we now have new features on our next
-
generation 
platform that will drive additional revenue opportunities such as cloud DVR, 
a more robust VOD experience with new pay
-
pe
r
-
view options and an 
additional stream capability. John Donovan is going to walk you through 
those plans in a few minutes.
 
Also helping is AdWorks, which continues to grow at a double
-
digit rate and 
has now an annualized revenue stream of over $1.8 billio
n.
 
Moving to our Business Solutions group. Revenues were down as gains in 
wireless and strategic business services helped offset declines in legacy 
services. Business wireless with strong growth, up more than 4%. This is 
driven by both equipment and servic
e revenues.
 
Wireline revenues were down more than 4% year
-
over
-
year. We still expect 
tax reform to produce a lift in communication spend, but we just haven't 
seen it yet. Wireline EBITDA margins were up slightly on a comparable basis. 
Cost efficiencies con
tinue to offset pressure from legacy products and our 
investments in FirstNet.
 
In our International business, solid customer performance helped to offset 
currency pressures. Revenues were stable year
-
over
-
year, while margins 
were pressured by World Cup exp
enses as well as foreign exchange.
 
Now let's look at Time Warner's second quarter financials on Slide 7. Time 
Warner had strong growth at all operating conditions on a comparable basis. 
This includes strong subscription revenue growth on both Turner and HB
O. 
Turner also showed solid advertising revenue growth of 3%. Adjusted 
operating income was $1.8 billion, driven by increases at Warner and HBO.
 
Now for some housekeeping items. With recent FASB accounting rules, the 
Time Warner merger and purchase price a
ccounting rules, there's going to 
be a lot of new information included in our results. We're going to do our 
best to make that easy for you to understand.
 
First, we'll file pro formas with the SEC in August. Second, we have posted 
the full second quarter r
esults for Time Warner on our Investor Relations 
website. This includes the Time Warner historical results, trending schedules, 
all the information you're accustomed to seeing.
 
Finally, as you're updating your models, keep in mind the following: Results 
wi
ll continue to be reported at the divisional level, but there are certain 
things that will be eliminated in the Corporate and Other segment, including 
about $3 billion of annual inter
-
company content revenues and purchase 
accounting impacts on customer bas
e and deferred production costs.
 
We're very excited that Time Warner is part of the AT&T family and the 
WarnerMedia as part of the AT&T family, and John Stankey is going to 
provide more insights and highlights in a few minutes.
 
Now let's look at our 2018 o
utlook with Time Warner included. We're raising 
adjusted earnings per share growth to the upper end of the $3.50 range with 
WarnerMedia included.
 
Year
-
to
-
date, we're already seeing 15% growth. Impact of tax reform, 
improving wireless service and advertisin
g revenues as well as the addition 
of Time Warner support strong adjusted EPS growth even with the additional 
shares issued as part of the deal.
 
Looking at free cash flow. Our free cash flow guidance at the beginning of 
the year was standalone. We expect m
ost of the benefit of the Time Warner 
free cash flow for the last half of the year, about $2 billion, will be absorbed 
by integration and deal costs, including severance costs, retention 
incentives, legal fees, bankers' costs and interest expense prior to 
close.
 
When you consider those items and slightly lower cash capital spending, 
we're raising expected free cash flow to the upper end of the $21 billion 
range with dividend coverage in the low 60% range, and that's even with 
the additional shares and divid
end responsibility from the merger with Time 
Warner.
 
Now that we are halfway through the year, we also have a better view of 
CapEx. Capital investment is expected to be in the $25 billion range, but 
that will be $22 billion of CapEx on our cash flow statem
ents after you net 
out our FirstNet reimbursements and some of the vendor financing 
opportunities that our team has pursued.
 
A primary focus for us this year and the next few years is deleveraging the 
business. We have a strong business that generates a to
n of cash and 
EBITDA, and we are very confident in the deleveraging targets that we have 
given you. Let me recap them now.
 
Net debt to EBITDA is projected to be in the 2.9x range by the end of this 
year and a 2.5 range by the end of next year. To reach tha
t target, we 
expect EBITDA growth. We'll use excess cash to pay down debt, and as 
always, we'll continue to look for ways to monetize non
-
strategic assets.
 
You've seen that recently with the data center deal and our pending sale of 
broadcast 600 spectrum. 
We expect to return to historic debt levels in the 
1.8 times range by the end of 2022.
 
That's the financial summary. Now I'll turn it over to Randall. Randall?
 
Randall Stephenson
 
Okay. Thanks, John. And it was an exciting quarter. After 600 days of 
reviews
 
and litigation, we did finally complete the acquisition of Time 
Warner. And then just a few days later, we announced our agreement to 
acquire AppNexus. And if you're not familiar with AppNexus, it's one of the 
top ad technology companies around.
 
And as Jo
hn mentioned, we've renamed Time Warner to WarnerMedia, so 
we'll be referring to that as WarnerMedia from here forward. And as John 
Stankey will cover later, they had a really strong second quarter. We 
couldn't be pleased 
--
 
more pleased with the condition
 
Jeff left the company 
with us.
 
We've now assembled the key elements of a modern media company, and it 
all begins with owning a wide array of premium content because we are 
absolutely convinced that there is nothing that drives customer engagement 
like hig
h
-
quality premium content.
 
And whether it's Netflix, Amazon, Google, Disney or Comcast, everybody is 
now pursuing the same thing. How do you deliver great media and 
entertainment experiences to our customers? And I think the recent 
valuations of media comp
anies is reinforcing this point.
 
But we couldn't be any happier with the range and quality of brands that we 
now own. For life programming, it doesn't get any better than CNN for news. 
And for sports, we have the NBA, March Madness, NFL SUNDAY TICKET, 
Majo
r League Baseball and PGA. And for original premium subscription 
content, there is nobody better than HBO.
 
Our cable networks at Turner are among the best, and they're performing 
well. And for content creation, our production studio at Warner Bros. is the 
gold standard, and they possess one of the deepest IP libraries around.
 
And when you talk about digital content, we now own the cnn.com digital 
brands, and these are the most visited websites in the world. And add 
Bleacher Report and the Otter Media proper
ties, and we have what we think 
are a terrific set of digital assets. Bottom line, we absolutely love this 
portfolio.
 
But just owning great content is no longer sufficient. The modern media 
company must develop extensive 
direct
-
to
-
consumer relationships, and we 
think pure wholesale business models for media companies will be really 
tough to sustain over time. And when you look across our wireless, pay TV 
and our broadband businesses, we now have more than 170 million direc
t
-
to
-
consumer relationships.
 
And these relationships are critical as we begin developing new media 
experiences for all kinds of different audiences. And then the 170 million 
relationships provide invaluable insights for new advertising models, and 
that's e
xactly what's behind our investment in ad technology.
 
Today, we use our data insights. We deliver ads on DIRECTV. And when we 
do this, our advertising yields improve by 3 to 5x. As you're going to hear 
from Brian Lesser shortly, that business grew 16% in t
he second quarter.
 
Now Turner has an ad inventory that's 3 times the size of our DIRECTV 
inventory, and as we apply the same data to that inventory, we expect a 
significant lift. At AppNexus, that acquisition is all about improving our 
capabilities and red
ucing our time to market here.
 
So you take these three elements, premium content, 170 million direct
-
to
-
consumer relationships and great ad technology and then you combine those 
with our high
-
speed networks, and we think all of this is a game changer.
 
Brin
ging these four elements together has changed the way we think about 
our customer value proposition. We spend our time now thinking about how 
to combine these elements to create unique customer experiences. How do 
we combine the best content wherever you a
re and make it easy to find and 
consume?
 
What are the new products that combine content and connectivity? How do 
we create personalized content experiences, including personalized ads that 
you find useful? So hopefully, you begin to see why we're so excite
d about 
putting all of these capabilities together.
 
Now we knew the WarnerMedia deal was not going to be like any other we 
had done. It's a vertical bolt on with a media business. And the media 
business obviously has very distinct culture, talent and busin
ess models. So 
last fall, in anticipation of the merger, we reorganized the company into 4 
separate businesses, and you can see those on the next slide.
 
What we've done is pushed the core staff functions and the decision
-
making 
out into the business units,
 
and we left behind a very small staff at 
corporate. And this is all about increasing speed and efficiency at each of 
these businesses. But at the same time, we need to foster cross
-
platform 
coordination to generate the synergies that John Stankey will be 
touching on 
next.
 
Today, we're going to change the earnings call around a little bit as John 
Stephens pointed out. We're going to give you a chance to hear from each of 
these business unit leaders. And then when they finish, we're going to stay 
on the phon
e and answer any questions that you have. And then John 
Stankey is going to lead us off. John is the Head of WarnerMedia.
 
And then you're going to next hear from John Donovan, who heads up AT&T 
Communications; and then Brian Lesser, he's the Head of our Ad
vertising & 
Analytics business. And he's going to walk you through his plans. And then 
finally, you'll hear from Lori Lee, who heads up our Latin American 
businesses.
 
And she's going to take you through an update on, really, the great market 
momentum that 
we're experiencing in Mexico and also talk about the latest 
on our Latin American TV business.
 
So with that, I'm now going to hand it over to John Stankey. John?
 
John Stankey
 
Thanks, Randall. Good afternoon to all of you. I've been on the job now a 
little 
bit more than a month, but during the time, I've had the opportunity to 
meet with various leadership teams at WarnerMedia. And I don't think it's a 
surprise to any of you what I found is what I believe to be an unmatched 
dedication to producing unique and 
engaging content across film, television, 
sports and journalism.
 
Looking forward to my continued work with this team, and I think we have 
the great opportunities in front of us to further harness the exceptional 
content and capabilities at WarnerMedia.
 
Joh
n gave you the financial highlights of WarnerMedia's second quarter, but 
let me dig in deeper, and you'll see those results on Slide 13. Time Warner's 
last quarter as a stand
-
alone company had strong revenue gains in Turner, 
HBO and Warner Bros.
 
Turner saw
 
solid growth with gains in both subscription and advertising 
revenues. Subscription revenues benefited from higher domestic rates and 
growth at Turner's international networks.
 
Subscriber counts have been stable thanks to growth in virtual MVPDs with 3 
of
 
the top 5 ad
-
supported cable networks among adults 18 to 49 in 
primetime. The Turner Networks are proving popular in every video bundle 
as evidenced by their inclusion in every major live OTT provider. Turner 
Sports properties helped drive strong advertis
ing revenue growth in the 
second quarter led by the NBA on TNT broadcast.
 
HBO also delivered solid revenue growth in the quarter. Subscriber revenues 
were up 13% due to strong U.S. subscriber growth and gains in international 
markets. Higher television rev
enues helped drive strong revenue growth at 
Warner Bros., Warner Bros. TV looks to build on that success with more than 
75 TV series in production for the 2018, '19 season. That is the studio's 
largest number of TV series in production at one time ever.
 
He
re's another good indicator of what kind of quarter and year WarnerMedia 
has had. WarnerMedia companies, HBO, Turner, Warner Bros. received 166 
Emmy nominations, which include 22 nominations for HBO's Game of 
Thrones alone, followed by 21 nominations for W
estworld, which is produced 
for HBO by Warner Bros., a real trooper for us.
 
These nominations speak to the caliber of the talent and dedication to 
quality across the company. My congratulations go to the entire 
WarnerMedia team for their exceptional creati
ve achievements.
 
During the roughly six weeks since we closed the deal on June 14, we've 
been working strategically to integrate the two companies. That includes 
applying the data analytics from AT&T's distribution to the Turner ad 
inventory. As you know, 
this is one of the benefits of combining our two 
businesses.
 
You've seen the success of the AdWorks group using targeted advertising for 
DIRECTV and U
-
verse. Now we have 3x the ad inventory to work with. We 
believe we can get meaningful CPM improvement in 
what Turner sees today. 
Brian Lesser will explain in a few minutes. We expect this is only the 
beginning of our success.
 
We've also moved quickly to position WarnerMedia content on AT&T 
distribution platforms. We intend to push the WarnerMedia consumer bra
nds 
even further across all platforms. We've been busy with the basic blocking 
and tackling that comes with any merger, integrating corporate and staff 
functions, getting our infrastructure systems to work together and aligning 
corporate management.
 
We'll 
look to achieve synergies with our advertising spend and other 
procurement areas by getting better rates from vendors and suppliers. For 
example, AT&T was not the primary telecom supplier for Time Warner. Now 
we begin that transition for WarnerMedia. These
 
types of efforts will help us 
to deliver on the $2.5 billion in merger synergies we promised.
 
While all this has been going on, we've been very deliberate in shaping some 
long
-
term initiatives that we think will add even greater value. We developed 
though
tful plans on where we want to go next with WarnerMedia and have 
several goals that we want to accomplish.
 
First, we want to increase our investment in premium content. HBO's name 
is synonymous with quality entertainment. The creative talent at HBO is the 
best in the industry. My goal is to give the HBO team the resources to 
greenlight additional projects already in the development funnel.
 
We want to invest more in original content while still retaining the high 
quality and unique brand position of HBO. 
This will further strengthen the 
HBO brand, enhance the customer experience, improve churn and drive 
more engagement with some of our most valued customers.
 
Second, we plan to further develop and nurture our direct
-
to
-
consumer 
distribution, including HBO N
OW. That will include enhancing existing 
platforms as well as delivering premium content to the more than 170 
million direct
-
to
-
consumer relationships across AT&T's video, mobile and 
broadband platforms in the United States and Latin America. We also plan 
to 
add even greater value to these relationships by focusing, aggregating and 
incorporating more WarnerMedia intellectual property.
 
And third, we also are looking at our international markets and explore ways 
to maximize our content globally to create grea
ter value. We believe there's 
a lot of opportunity that remains in this area.
 
Obviously, we're very early in the game when it comes to implementing our 
plans, but we're off to a good start and look to quicken the pace as we move 
past close.
 
Now I'd like to
 
turn it over to John Donovan for details on AT&T's 
Communications second quarter results. John?
 
John Donovan
 
Thanks, John. I'm really excited about WarnerMedia coming into our 
portfolio because it strengthens our ability to innovate across our businesses 
like content and content 
--
 
I'm sorry, connectivity.
 
So if we discuss AT&T Communications operating results, we'll start on Slide 
16. Our wireless business turned in an impressive quarter. John Stephens 
told you about the service revenue growth and strong 
margins, but we also 
had strong subscriber gains and continued our low post
-
paid culture. For the 
quarter, we added 46,000 post
-
paid phones. That makes nine consecutive 
quarters of year
-
over
-
year improvement.
 
We had our best prepaid quarter in nine quarter
s with 453,000 prepaid net 
adds. This includes 356,000 phone net adds. We had a record connected 
device net add quarter as well, adding 3 million new devices.
 
Churn continues to run at near
-
record low levels. Post
-
paid phone churn was 
0.82%, just three bas
is points higher than last year's all
-
time record, and we 
have a record low prepaid churn, thanks to our multi
-
line plan penetration 
and auto bill pay.
 
These customer gains and low churn are showing up in our service revenue, 
where we turned positive both 
sequentially and year
-
over
-
year on a 
comparative basis.
 
With the unlimited launch well behind us and targeted promotional activity, 
we saw service revenue improve each month in the quarter, and we're on 
track to grow service revenue for the full year on a 
comparable basis. And 
we maintained comparable service margins above 50% again this quarter.
 
Moving over to our Entertainment Group. We continue to see total video 
subscriber gains as we move through the transition of our video business. 
We had 80,000 tota
l video net adds in the quarter with gains in DTV Now 
and U
-
verse more than offsetting losses in DIRECTV.
 
We also turned in solid broadband gains. Our Entertainment Group had 
76,000 IP broadband net adds with 23,000 total broadband net adds. That's 
their s
eventh consecutive quarter of broadband growth.
 
About 95% of our consumer broadband base is now on our IP broadband as 
our transition from DSL is drawing to a close. Our fiber build continues at a 
fast clip, now passing more than 9 million customer locatio
ns, and we expect 
that this time next year to reach 14 million locations.
 
This gives us a long runway for broadband growth. We're doing very well in 
our fiber markets, including a 246,000 net increase in subs on our fiber 
network in the second quarter.
 
Now
 
I'd like to update you on several key initiatives we have underway, so 
we'll turn to Slide 17. Evolving our video portfolio is top priority for us. We 
believe we're well positioned as our customers move toward a more 
personalized set of streaming products
.
 
Our new platform was launched in May as the DIRECTV NOW user interface, 
and it's now live on all supported device operating systems and has been 
well received with strong engagement by customers.
 
It offers a new cloud
-
based DVR and more robust video
-
on
-
d
emand 
experience with new pay
-
per
-
view options. Over time, it will bring additional 
advertising and data insight opportunities.
 
This new video platform gives us flexibility to adapt to the market with new 
offerings and products. Late in the quarter, we add
ed our third video offering 
called WatchTV, a small package of 30 live channels and 15,000 on
-
demand 
titles.
 
We include WatchTV in our unlimited, more wireless plans where you can 
purchase it for $15 a month, making it perfect for customers who want video 
but not at the cost of a large package.
 
This complements DIRECTV NOW where we continue to see success in 
attracting cord cutters and cord severs. And later this year, we will begin 
testing a premium product extension, which is a streaming product that will
 
give the full DIRECTV experience over any broadband, ours or competitors'.
 
It will have additional benefits of an improved search and discovery feature 
and an enhanced user interface. We're excited that this will complement our 
top
-
end product for those w
ho don't want or can't have a satellite dish.
 
Our open
-
video platform also dovetails nicely with our ongoing focus on 
driving the industry's leading cost structure. The new platform is low touch 
with lower acquisition costs as streaming services becomes a 
bigger part of 
our business.
 
Digital sales are a cost
-
efficient way of customer engagement, and we're 
seeing double
-
digit growth in our digital sales and service. We're also seeing 
operating expense savings from our move to a virtualized software
-
defined 
n
etwork.
 
More than 55% of our network functions were virtualized at the end of 2017, 
and we're well on our way to meet or exceed our goal of 75% virtualized by 
2020. These and other cost management initiatives have helped drive 13 
straight quarters of cost 
reductions in our technology and infrastructure 
group.
 
Finally, I'd like to give an update on our FirstNet build and other network 
investments. Our FirstNet network build is accelerating. We expect to have 
between 12,000 and 15,000 band 14 sites on air by 
the end of this year 
2018, and we're ahead of our contractual commitment.
 
And don't forget, when we're putting in equipment for FirstNet, we're also 
deploying our AWS and WCS spectrum, utilizing the one touch, one tower 
approach. This approach allows all c
ustomers access to our improved 
network.
 
FirstNet also gives us an opportunity to sell to first responders. So far, more 
than 1,500 public safety agencies across 52 states and territories have 
joined FirstNet, nearly doubling the network's adoption 
since April.
 
In addition to our efforts with FirstNet, 5G and 5G Evolution work continues 
its development in several different areas that will pave the way to the next 
generation of higher speeds for our customers.
 
We now have 5G Evolution in more than 140
 
markets, covering nearly 100 
million people with theoretical peak speeds of at least 400 megabits per 
second with plans to cover 400
-
plus markets by the end of this year.
 
Our millimeter wave mobile 5G trials are also going well, and we're on track 
to laun
ch service in parts of 12 markets by the end of this year.
 
With that, I now turn it over to Brian Lesser to discuss our Advertising & 
Analytics business. Brian?
 
Brian Lesser
 
Thank you, John, and good afternoon, everyone. As Randall mentioned, a 
critical co
mponent of the modern media company is a dynamic advertising 
business, one that can deliver on the promise of making advertising 
relevant, engaging and actually matter to consumers and make it work 
harder for advertisers and make it more valuable and optim
ized for 
publishers.
 
I think about this simply. The course of the ad industry has been set by a 
series of defining moments. The rise of broadcast networks, the proliferation 
of cable networks and the pay TV bundle, digital advertising and its ability to 
ta
rget audiences, we sit here again today at yet another point that will 
define advertising for years to come. The pain points are obvious.
 
Traditional advertising doesn't satisfy what both consumers and brands are 
looking for. Brands are frustrated with lac
k of access to data, lack of 
competence in targeting and measurement and non
-
transparent ad tech 
costs. The industry talked about video convergence, but no tangible 
examples yet have emerged to deliver a unified buy
-
side and sell
-
side 
platform.
 
So while th
e timing for disrupting the ad industry is right, you must have the 
assets to execute, and there is no doubt that AT&T is uniquely positioned to 
lead this disruption.
 
In our view, successful ad marketplaces must have two key assets: number 
one, its premium
 
content. Sports, news, original programming, we love our 
position with Turner content along with the scaled portfolio of ad inventory.
 
Number two is distribution. Customers dictate how and where they consume 
content. Likewise, a relevant ad marketplace mu
st be able to reach 
customers where they are, whether it's a 50
-
foot screen in a theater or a 3
-
inch screen in your pocket.
 
Number three is data. AT&T has access to expansive datasets on customer 
behavior and preferences. 170 million direct
-
to
-
consumer rel
ationships 
across its wireless video and broadband businesses, 40 million set
-
top 
boxes, 20 million connected cars, and that's just for starters. But data needs 
to be activated to have value. We're building targeting and measurement 
capabilities that will 
bring greater value to consumers, advertisers and 
publishers.
 
And number four is technology. Content distribution and data must be 
integrated on a best
-
in
-
class ad technology platform. That's the rationale for 
our recent announcement to acquire AppNexus.
 
T
his is a best
-
in
-
class independent advertising marketplace supported by the 
best talent in the industry. We cannot wait to combine our teams and 
partner to make advertising matter to consumers.
 
It is important to note we are not starting from a standstill.
 
Both AT&T 
Advertising & Analytics and Turner have executed fabulously by using data 
and technology to fuel growth.
 
AT&T Advertising & Analytics is consistently delivering double
-
digit revenue 
growth, including 16% growth in the second quarter. We will emp
loy the 
same momentum and scale to deliver on our vision.
 
So in closing, our plan is nothing short of leading the industry and creating a 
premium advertising marketplace across both TV and digital by quickly 
integrating AT&T assets, including AppNexus. It'
s this unique moment in 
time, coupled with this unique set of assets, that gives me confidence in our 
path forward.
 
With that, I will hand it over to Lori Lee to talk about our Latin American 
operation.
 
Lori Lee
 
Thank you, Brian. The advertising opportunit
ies that Brian laid out apply to 
Latin America as well. We have more than 30 million direct
-
to
-
consumer 
relationships, and we plan to run the same play with the LatAm business 
that we will be using in the United States. It won't happen overnight, but the 
o
pportunity is definitely there.
 
Let me discuss our second quarter results. Those details are on Slide 21. 
Starting with our Mexico Wireless operations, we turned in another strong 
subscriber quarter with more than 750,000 net adds. That totaled more than 
3
 
million new customers in the past 12 months, doubling our subscriber base 
to a 16.4 million since entering Mexico just 3 years ago.
 
During that time, we've built a world
-
class LTE network and developed a 
marketing presence reflecting the AT&T brand. Our n
etwork build is in the 
final stages as we close in on covering 100 million people.
 
We have rebranded 3,000 stores and have approximately 6,000 total retail 
locations, expanding our marketing presence and distribution. And we've 
upgraded and integrated our 
different billing systems. All this puts us in a 
great position to add customers and revenues at a lower cost.
 
We're also making a lot of progress in improving our financials. 
Operationally, we're pushing on all fronts to exit the year EBITDA positive. 
In 
our Vrio pay
-
TV business, currency devaluations have impacted our 
financial results, but the strength of our subscriber base and our profitability 
remains consistent.
 
That continued to be true in the second quarter. The World Cup drove strong 
subscriber gr
owth of 140,000 with particularly strong gains in prepaid. We 
finished the quarter with 13.7 million pay
-
TV subscribers, a number that has 
held fairly steady since we acquired the business. The World Cup did drive 
higher expenses in the quarter, but we con
tinue to drive profitability and 
positive free cash flow year
-
to
-
date.
 
Now I'll turn it back to Mike for Q&A.
 
Michael Viola
 
Okay. Thanks, Lori. Lori 
-
 
operator Lori, we are ready to take questions.
 
Question
-
and
-
Answer Session
 
Operator
 
[Operator 
Instructions] And our first question from John Hodulik with UBS.
 
John Hodulik
 
Thanks. And I think I'm going to bounce around a little bit. But maybe first 
for John Donovan, the wireless business, it looks like EBITDA was down 
about 0.7%, I think, on like
-
f
or
-
like basis. But obviously, you returned to 
growth in subscribers and some margin improvement. Should we be 
expecting that segment still your biggest [ph] to return to EBITDA growth as 
we look forward?
 
And then maybe one for Brian and then for John Stank
ey. Brian, we've 
heard a lot about addressable advertising, 3% growth this quarter on the 
advertising line. What are some of the milestones that we should expect and 
maybe the timing of when this addressable advertising opportunity starts to 
take hold with
in these numbers?
 
And then lastly, John Stankey, the 
-
 
you obviously got some press recently 
in terms of interview you did about the new WarnerMedia. Could you talk a 
little bit about the size of that HBO spend? I think the HBO spends about $2 
billion. You
're competing with companies that spend $8 billion a year, much 
bigger numbers. I mean, how should we think of that in terms of the overall 
financial profile of the company?
 
And maybe if you could elaborate on other D
-
to
-
C efforts you may have. 
We've heard
 
about DC 
--
 
DC Universe and the HBO NOW but if there's any 
other sort of initiatives we should be looking for? Thanks.
 
John Donovan
 
Hey, John, it's John Donovan. I'll start the question on wireless and EBITDA. 
We've had now three quarters in a row where o
ur year
-
over
-
year compares 
on subscriber growth was very good. We crossed over that all
-
important 
date, where we got a lot of the reseller stuff behind us.
 
We crossed over that date for the unlimited plans. And you've seen a lot of 
momentum in prepaid, whi
ch has really become a really nice business for us 
right now. We're in a really good rhythm there firing on all cylinders.
 
And so what we're seeing right now in this quarter, John mentioned in his 
opening remarks that we were stronger each month of the qua
rter within the 
quarter. We're starting to see us roll over some of those earlier events, and 
now we're beginning to get strength in them.
 
And so because we 
-
 
in the 
-
 
each month of this quarter strengthened from 
subscriber counts, we also have some pricin
g moves, calibration of pricing, if 
you will, that made us consistent with our value proposition in the 
marketplace. So we expect that we'll have growth for the year and the 
EBITDA margins to improve.
 
Brian Lesser
 
John, I'll take the next part of your ques
tion. This is Brian Lesser. So you 
asked about milestones in the advertising business. I think it's important to 
know that we have posted a $2 billion advertising business outside of what 
we just acquired in Turner, and that advertising business was growin
g 16% 
in the second quarter. So we're already showing the value of data and 
technology on our advertising business.
 
I think in terms of going forward, you should look for some things that we've 
already mentioned here in this call, number one, our ability t
o increase the 
yield on the inventory that we have now within Turner and WarnerMedia 
more broadly and also increase value to the firm but also value to 
publishers, advertisers and the consumers.
 
You'll see us continue to develop the ad platform. AppNexus, 
once we close 
that deal, is an important milestone for us, but you'll see us lean in and 
develop additional technologies around that platform.
 
And then third is our ability to partner with other media companies outside 
of AT&T. In some ways, our success wi
ll depend on our ability to attract 
additional sources of inventory to reach critical mass for advertisers.
 
John Stankey
 
So John, let me just amplify the last piece that Brian gave. Data that we 
have had within the AT&T company applying to AdWorks has alre
ady been 
moved over into the Turner team to begin applying into existing inventory 
that we have using the same techniques we piloted in selling the two 
minutes of advertising that the AT&T team has across the broader inventory 
of Turner.
 
So that's near ter
m. That's not a milestone issue. That's, today, we're 
starting to look at those business cases and how we would do that. Teams 
have already come up with a variety of different initiatives around that, 
including 
-
 
we found out that Brian had a great opportu
nity to do 
addressable advertising in the pharmaceutical space, and some of the 
pharmaceutical companies wanted 90
-
second avails. And he didn't have 90 
seconds of inventory.
 
So we're bridging Turner inventory with what used to be AT&T inventory so 
that we 
can have new addressable products to bring in. So that's 
-
 
there's 
benefit to that data that's occurring now even without the broad 
mechanization and intelligence and platform work that Brian brought to the 
table that's just discussed.
 
So on direct to cons
umer, what I will tell you is what we know about this 
space is it requires scale. And you mentioned that there's a number of 
different initiatives underway within the WarnerMedia companies, and 
they're all good within their own right. But they all generate
 
what I would 
consider to be relatively small scale audiences, company our size. We want 
to be generating audience. It's in the tens of millions, not in the single
-
digits 
millions.
 
And so the way I would think about our direct
-
to
-
consumer efforts over time
 
is it's better together. So a lot of very strong brands in the family that 
generate interest among groups of audiences and on a stand
-
alone basis, 
they're not as powerful as they are when they're brought together. And you 
can assemble the genre of content
 
and bring them together on one platform 
and one experience that aggregates and gets scale.
 
So over time, what you should think about how we're going to approach the 
discrete brands that we have is ultimately unify them in a more consistent 
and more focuse
d experience. It starts to bring some scale in.
 
Still very important properties, they still need to be developed. We've got to 
get the formula right for them, but over time, we want to strengthen them 
to come together. In terms of your reference to the new
 
cycles on HBO, it 
wasn't an interview.
 
I think it was an internal discussion that was right to act, but I would tell 
you, I don't believe in it effectively characterizing what we are about. What 
we are about, as I said, is we have a tremendous amount of g
reat projects 
already in the funnel that as the HBO team and Richard would describe it, 
they have not been in a position to say yes to because of constraints on 
certain resources.
 
What we're attempting to do is open up those constraints on very high, 
top
-
quality projects that we think will balance out the schedule so that we have 
a more engaging experience with HBO throughout the course of the year. 
That will improve the fact that we can see, especially on the digital 
platforms, you have customers jump
ing in and out based on scheduling. And 
if we can smooth that schedule, we can drive churn down or improve 
retention and power additional subscriber growth.
 
So I'm not going to give you the exact investment number, but the way I 
would think about it is we 
will make decisions to reinvest some of the 
efficiencies that we pick up from combining these companies together and 
running them at a little different fashion.
 
We may get back a margin point or so in the near term as we grow the 
subscriber base as we rein
vest in it. But it's going to be a very responsible 
investment and great projects we've already scoped out, we already have 
rights for, we want to get into the development funnel. And the team feels 
very, very comfortable that we can flex up on our develop
ment in a way that 
we think rounds out the schedule very nicely.
 
Randall Stephenson
 
John, this is Randall. It 
-
 
well, this merger is different in terms it's a vertical 
merger. There are certain aspects of the playbook that you just heard John 
describe that
 
they're going to be exactly the same in that it generates 
synergies and then reinvest significant portion of those synergies back in to 
your capabilities and your products.
 
Direct to consumer and deeper HBO content, it's just part and parcel to that. 
That
's no different to what we've done in the past, and you should probably 

take the next question.
 
Operator
 
And we go to Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
 
Simon
 
Flannery
 
Great. Thank you very much. For John Stephens, John, in the past, you'd 
given some guidance with DIRECTV on the medium term on EPS. Can you 
give us any color about the benefits of Time Warner or WarnerMedia in a full 
year '19? How should we be th
inking about that given the upside to 
guidance this year?
 
And then on the balance sheet, what are you assuming in terms of getting 
2.5 around additional divestitures and about things like spectrum 
acquisitions? Or is that just run rate with what you have r
ight now? Thanks.
 
John Stephens
 
A couple of things, Simon. Thanks for the questions. First of all, beginning to 
-
 
on the 2.5x by the end of next year, that's driven mainly by run rate with 
regard to cash flows, taking the cash flows above the dividend and 
paying 
down debt.
 
Secondly, it is important to achieve the synergies, particularly the EBITDA 
boosting synergies and the growth that we're seeing and some of the growth 
that we're seeing in wireless and customer additions so that we get a higher 
EBITDA num
ber.
 
Well, we have normally planned for asset sales and constantly look at 
underutilized assets for monetization, for example, the data centers, the 
broadcast spectrum 600, which is a couple of billion dollars right there, we 
have under contract and waitin
g for approvals today.
 
We'll continue to do that. If you want to give a scope to it, as of today, we 
have about $500 billion in total assets. And so finding a few more 
opportunities to monetize assets seems to be very reasonable on top of the 
things that w
e've kind of commonly done with regard to real estate and 
other underutilized business in spectrum. So that batch [ph], I'm not giving 
you any specific number on asset sales, but as we've proven this year, we're 
going to continue to do that.
 
And with regar
d to EPS guidance specifically around the acquisition, I'll say it 
this way. First and foremost, the point is, is that WarnerMedia 
--
 
Time 
Warner, WarnerMedia, immediately accretive. Revenues, free cash flow, 
EPS, we've seen it already. So that guidance th
at we've given, we'd expect 
we're standing by that and continue to expect that and have started to prove 
that out already.
 
Secondly, we're not going to give a specific guidance with regard to Time 
Warner's impacts, but I'd suggest it this way. If you think
 
about $3.50 EPS 
range, for us, that means $3.40 to $3.60. And we just said that we expect to 
be in the high end of that range. So that'll give you an indication of using 
your own estimates, other's estimates, where we were, what we expected to 
be for the 
rest of the year.
 
I will point out that the $0.02 we've got in the second quarter for two weeks 
was, as I said, uneven, and specifically because the NBA contract for 
playoffs, all that content was extended before we merged.
 
The Golden State Warriors won th
e championship in June 8, so that content 
expense was recognized before we got the deal. So we have some higher 
profitability in those 16 days you might otherwise expect.
 
But I'd expect profitability to continue no matter what. We'll give specific 
EPS guid
ance for '19 in the coming months. I would just suggest that we 
continue to expect this transaction to be accretive, revenue, free cash flow 
and EPS.
 
Randall Stephenson
 

 
Operator
 
We go to Phil Cusick, JPMorgan. Please proc
eed.
 
Phil Cusick
 
Hi, guys. Seems like we're going around in the same questions. But one for 
Brian. Can you talk about 
-
 
clearly, what has to be done here to realize the 
addressable ad vision? And what's the timing of this coming through to 
accelerate the n
umbers and start to be really material on the company?
 
Can this impact 2019 or are we really talking about 2020? And how do you 
see the potential to reduce the ad load while you raise CPMs? Thanks.
 
Brian Lesser
 
In terms of 
-
 
thanks for the 
question, Phil. In terms of timing, as John 
Stankey outlined, there are some things that we can do immediately and 
start to add value to Turner ad inventory, and that's already in motion. And 
so we think there's short
-
term value there in 2018.
 
I would say 
in terms of the overall addressable opportunity, that's a little bit 
further out. We have work to do in terms of building the technology 
platform, but the good news there is because of the amount of inventory 
that exists within DIRECTV, also within WarnerM
edia, we can prove out the 
value of AT&T data and the investments that we're making in technology 
plus the evolution of our direct
-
to
-
consumer relationship that John Donovan 
talked about.
 
So I think we still keep our losses [ph] to really start to extract 
value from 
inside AT&T using our inventory across DIRECTV and WarnerMedia in 2018. 
And then in 2019, we're going to start to partner very effectively across 
other sources of inventory to bring value.
 
John Stephens
 
Phil, John Stephens, if I could add to tha
t. I mean, want to point out Brian's 
humble here in that sense that he started getting 16% revenue growth on 
those ads, DIRECTV, U
-
verse footprint, possibility, those ads watched by the 
same people as the ones who watch the Turner ads. So we've got proof t
hen 
this works.
 
Secondly, when the AppNexus deal closes, we'll have the ability to take our 
internal activity and put it on that supply
-
side platform that will be within 
our control. So we are optimistic about the opportunities to get value out of 
the AppN
exus platform.
 
We've got DOJ approved forward. We're going to need to get [indiscernible] 
approved and hope to close it before the next time we speak certainly. But 
I'm optimistic about that, too, so probably a lot of things going and heading 
in the right 
direction.
 
Phil Cusick
 
And in terms of the ad load? Thank you.
 
Brian Lesser
 
In terms of the ad load, so our objective, Phil, is not just to improve 
advertising as it exists today but to also improve the experience for 
consumers. We're in a unique position 
to do that because of our vertical 
integration because we have content and we have that direct
-
to
-
consumer 
relationship over a traditional television, over a mobile phone, over other 
mobile devices.
 
We can start to do things in terms of innovating the ad e
xperience. As an 
example, you'll see us start to introduce products across the rest of this year 
and obviously, the next year, where the consumer watching television has a 
better experience that is less interruptive.
 
Imagine a DIRECTV customer watching the
 
big screen on their living room 
wall and instead of seeing a traditional ad break, they see an icon on a car in 
a movie that they're interested in or in a show that they're interested in.
 
And then we have the ability to create a seamless ad experience on 
their 
mobile device, which is on the coffee table or in their pocket, pause real
-
time content to interact with a better ad experience and therefore, deliver 
more relevant content to our customer and to the consumer more broadly.
 
That has the ability, numbe
r one, to be a better experience for our 
customers and consumers, a better business for us because those ad units 
will generate a higher CPM and a higher yield and a better experience for 
advertisers and the media company representing the content. So that'
s 
really our objective, is to start to innovate because of our access to data 
technology and the direct
-
to
-
customer relationship.
 
John Stankey
 
I would 
--
 
Phil, I would just comment that this notion of more innovative ad 
formats is critical. It's not just a
 
lighter ad load. Well, that's important, and 
we'd like to achieve it. I think what we all understand is that viewing habits 
are moving away, in many instances, from the linear fee, and so my a goal 
working with distributors such as my partner here at the 
table who is a large 
distributor of my product is just also start to take these better software
-
driven platforms that they have and lay out more on
-
demand content for 
them that allows for what used to be linear content to be available and 
stacked and other
 
formats and then attach to that the right kind of 
advertising that isn't loading that on
-
demand content with the same 
commercial loads but is also highly targeted and customized to the particular 
experience that the individual is going through.
 
We saw how
 
mobilizing and moving to TV Everywhere raised consumption of 
the traditional linear affair. I think we have another opportunity to take a 
fairly mature pay
-
TV product and extend the runway even further by being 
more aggressive in trying to incent the dist
ributors to carry more depth in a 
library.
 
Randall Stephenson
 

 
Operator
 
We go to John Janedis with Jefferies.
 
John Janedis
 
Thank you. One for John Stankey. Maybe a follow
-
up on HBO. As you know, 
domestic subs h
ave been in the 30 million to maybe 35 million or so range 
over the past few years.
 
And you talked about the content investment. But will there be a more 
aggressive direct
-
to
-
consumer push that perhaps would include maybe a 
Turner bundle or maybe a change 
to more wholesale deals with existing 
distributors?
 
And is there any consideration to reset the price, which has largely remained 
steady as many of your peers have been more promotional? Thank you.
 
John Stankey
 
So I would tell you that our 
wholesale distributors remain a really important 
part of our product, and we want to make the product better to improve its 
performance for their businesses as well as the HBO brand overall.
 
And as I indicated, we'd like to, for example, improve our term 
c
haracteristics by getting a more complete annual schedule that has people 
fully incented to stay in the product and not jump in and out of it as various 
content comes and goes through the course of the year. We think we've got 
some good steps that we can t
ake in that regard that will help our sub 
counts and continue to grow through our traditional distribution channel.
 
I do believe that as we invest in the platform itself, the direct
-
to
-
consumer 
platform and improve some of the technical capabilities associ
ated with it 
that our features that can be brought to bear in a typical OTT SVOD 
environment, that we can also increase the distribution of the digital 
versions of the product that go direct on retail.
 
And so we want to run that play as well. I will tell y
ou that I don't think 
that's a 
--
 
what I would call right now a step function change over the next 
couple of months, but we can incrementally get better on our current run 
rates by having some success in that regard.
 
In terms of what other content can be p
aired with HBO and maybe a more 
broad offer, I think we have a number of distributors out there that have 
some great ideas around how they might want to match HBO to their 
particular content offerings.
 
And as I said, I want to look at the depth of our Warn
erMedia offerings that 
we have and get better together and understand how we can bring some of 
our WarnerMedia brands and our other curated options into a more focused 
direct
-
to
-
consumer strategy that I think, as we start to get our strategy 
together on th
at, move forward on it, you could see that step function 
increase in more retail oriented customers.
 
John Janedis
 
Thanks, John.
 
Randall Stephenson
 
Take the next question operator.
 
Operator
 
And we go to Brett Feldman with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
 
Bre
tt Feldman
 
Thanks. One of the stronger trends we saw in this quarter was a nice 
improvement in postpaid phone ARPU, and actually, some of your peers, 
we've seen something similar so far this quarter.
 
Also, if we look at the market and we look at some of th
e pricing moves 
you've made and others have made, there's an introduction of higher price 
points. It's not really price increases, but it's really just if you pay more, 
you'll get more.
 
So I was hoping maybe you could just expand in terms of what your 
cust
omers are asking for, why you've identified a cohort that has shown a 
willingness to pay more for more. And how durable do you think this trend 
might be?
 
John Donovan
 
Yes. Brett, you've been obviously watching our commercials. That whole 
idea and more. And
 
so what we're trying to do is differentiate the product in 
ways that don't have to do with speeds, megabytes or rack rate pricing. And 
so what we're really focused on is product engagement. The value of any 
customer will be based on the combination of the
 
price and the value that 
they use for.
 
And that's why I would say, from a consumer perspective, our strength in 
consumer has been heavily in the bundling of video with wireless. So we see 
increased engagement. We're finding that people find a lot of value
 
for it, 
and then we're kind of spreading the offers to fit budgets and engagement. 
And so you've seen that in wireless.
 
And I would point out to you that, that pattern may look familiar in video, 
and we're trying to find various price points, engagements 
and content 
combinations that fit everybody's budget so that everybody views that 
they're getting value. And they do that not just by focusing on megabytes 
and pricing.
 
So I think that it's not an accidental trend that we stumbled onto. It's 
actually a str
ategy that's centered in the DIRECTV merger that we were 
pushing in, and that fits very well with this next step with WarnerMedia. And 
our sister over there provides us a lot of flexibility.
 
So I do think it's a trend. I do think that if we succeed 
-
 
when 
we succeed, 
others will be 
--
 
will follow and make some of the moves in their own. And I 
think that right now we see the most important thing, which was 
engagement and customer delight for the product improving.
 
And that, to us, translates to value, and we
're going to price the value. And 
so I think the industry will continue, hopefully, to take 
-
 
to look at that and 
we 
-
 
rationalism result to that. So we're going to continue down this path, 
more of it rather than less of it and expected to be successful.
 
B
rett Feldman
 
A quick follow
-
up if you don't mind. Obviously, the plans that include a lot of 
content tend to be the higher prices, and you clearly see that helps ARPU. 
Are you seeing that they are also helping churn?
 
John Donovan
 
Yes. If you look at the ch
urn, this year was again 3 bps up over. But I think 
that compared to the industry, we did really well. Compared to seasonality, 
we did really well, and the number that we're comparing to last year was our 
all
-
time low. So I do think that it's a strategy th
at's working for consumers 
and therefore, working for us.
 
And that is the currency that we're after there because you could start to 
trade some things that customers value higher than the ARPU differential. 
So we are carefully managing this portfolio, same
 
strategy in wireless and in 
video.
 
Brett Feldman
 
Thanks for taking the questions.
 
John Donovan
 
Sure.
 
Randall Stephenson
 

 
Operator
 
We'll go to David Barden with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
 
David Barden
 
Hi, guys thanks for taking the questions. Thanks for the expenses format on 
the call, I think it's super helpful. Randall, I guess, my first question would 
be the telco guy, the media industry is definitely not my wheelhouse yet. But 
if I'm watching what's
 
happening out there, we've got Fox deciding that 
they're not big enough to be a competitor in the media industry, so they're 
selling.
 
And we've got two large competitors in Comcast and Disney who feel, in 
order to be competitive with the Netflixes and the
 
Googles of the world, they 
need to get even bigger.
 
And so I guess, my question for you is kind of how do you 
-
 
how 
comfortable, do you feel, with the scale that you have now in the content 
business. And are you on the cusp of having a global strategy tha
t's going to 
kind of try to compete with those other larger content houses? That will be 
my first one if I could.
 
And then the second one, John, will be for you. We've been hearing a lot 
about the directionality of the deal about how we take the informatio
n from 
your side of the business, we bring it over to Brian and let him crunch 
through it and sell it into Turner.
 
But as you sit there and look at what WarnerMedia could mean to your 
business, the broadband business, the mobile business, even the business
, 
business, kind of what do you see as the opportunities? And if you could give 
us some examples, that would be super helpful? Thanks.
 
Randall Stephenson
 
David, this is Randall. I'll go first, and I'll hand it over to John Donovan. You 
said John. That's ju
st not just very descriptive. But I'll direct that to John 
Donovan when I finish. In terms of the 
-
 
what you're seeing happen in the 
landscape, the media landscape, it's fascinating to us.
 
We expected some time back this is exactly what you would see happe
n, 
that you'd begin to see media companies consolidate and people would see 
the importance of scale and changing models, changing distribution models 
and so forth. And so it's hard to imagine.
 
But it was back in 2016 when we actually did this deal, and so 
it was early in 
2016 where we were asking ourselves, if you believe that's going to happen, 
if you believe that your networks are going to be able to distribute 
seamlessly premium content, if you believe that your information and your 
distribution business
 
is really valuable and can drive different advertising 
models, then you probably ought to move fast and own media.
 
And as we look at a scan of what opportunities are out there, Time Warner 
jumped out. It's just the obvious choice. It was the one scale pla
yer that had 
a great scaled distribution platform, a great scale in terms of advertising 
inventory and cable networks.
 
It had the scale position in terms of content creation with Warner Bros. And 
it was just the obvious partner for us, and everything else 
was a distant 
second. And so from the 
--
 
to answer your question directly, we feel really 
good about what we have. And then you add to it the digital properties and 
CNN being an off
-
the
-
charts, great digital property.
 
You put all the CNN digital properties
 
together, they are the most accessed 
digital news sites in the world. And so putting all this capability, data, ad 
tech and so forth, together with the media company, we think is a really, 
really great combination, and we could not be happier that we move
d first.
 
I think moving first, you rarely forget 
--
 
you rarely regret it when you see an 
industry trend happen. So we saw this would happen. We went first, and we 
think we got the best business that was on the 
--
 
that was actually in the 
media space. So we
 
feel really good about it. JD, you want to talk about 
integration of content?
 
John Donovan
 
Sure. Thanks. So Dave, we had 600 days to think about this. And when you 
form your synergies, you deal with some of the straightforward things that 
John Stankey tal
ked about. But we 
--
 
over the last year or so, as we started 
to put wireless and video together and saw the trend I talked about earlier 
start to manifest, we are learning as an integrated carrier.
 
So I circle back and say, when we bought DIRECTV, remember
, we talked 
about bundling up and a lot of skepticism about the value of bundling up 
versus it being just a price discount.
 
And I got to tell you, you start to look at the economics of churn reduction 
and you start to learn how these currencies pass back a
nd forth, you see the 
same opportunities here. You see 
--
 
because the killer app right now on 
broadband and on wireless is video.
 
So as you start to look at what customers place value on and you move from 
buying and reselling or see us being completely out
 
of that market and you 
go to owner's economics, we really have always had a good sense as to what 
customers are using and doing on our network.
 
So to be able to value that into pricing and start to trade off these currencies 
that we learned over the last 
3 years of how do you trade off an acquisition 
dollar for a dollar of content, how do you trade off a customer install cost 
versus a churn reduction, we've built some solid muscle now to know how 
those economics move around.
 
So we are really 
thrilled about what the content business can mean for us in 
simple ways. Store traffic, our 
--
 
one of our wireless strengths is that our 
close rates in stores are up. We want more traffic in the store. If we have a 
tent
-
pole release from the studio and we 
can find a way to integrate in the 
stores and drive traffic, we found a synergy.
 
So basic things that video does, like drive traffic and hours of consumption, 
become assets for us to acquire value in ARPU and retain customers, and we 
really are getting our
 
strides to figure out how to move those currencies 
across franchises. So we're really thrilled about what this can do for 
broadband and for mobility.
 
John Stankey
 
David, let me suggest 
--
 
I would flip your first question around slightly. I 
don't worry abo
ut scale and content. I mentioned at the outset of this 
discussion, we're going to do 70 TV shows to the industry this year out of 
Warner Bros. Didn't even talk about what the incremental number of series 
will be coming out of HBO, which is very unique, hi
gh
-
valued, premium 
content that's targeted.
 
Our ability as a company to decide to produce content that scales, that 
matters is probably second to none in the industry, and that's at a rate that 
I'm not sure others operate at or are just coming close to tha
t.
 
I think the race is on for scaling customer bases, not scale on media content. 
We're on a good shape on our ability to scale media content. We have 
--
 
and 
we start with 170 million customer relationships in that race to have a scaled 
customer base to se
ll to. So I don't worry about that dynamic.
 
Randall Stephenson
 
And add to Stankey's comments, the 170 million, add to it what John has 
over at WarnerMedia, when we talk about cnn.com being the most 
frequented news site in the world, you put cnn.com, the Ot
ter Media, 
Bleacher Report together, there's another 
--
 
I think it was almost 200 million 
monthly users, unique monthly users on each of those sites.
 
And so this is already a big scale direct
-
to
-
consumer business. And so now 
what can you do with HBO and so
me of the Warner content in terms of 
taking it directly to the consumer as well that add owner's economics that 
John Donovan just spoke of and then the ability to have owner's economics 
going across these platforms, pretty exciting.
 
David Barden
 
Thanks for
 
taking the question. Thank you.
 
Operator
 
And we go to Mike McCormack, Guggenheim Securities.
 
Mike McCormack
 
Hi, guys. Thanks. John Donovan, just maybe some questions regarding 
entertainment margin, some puts and takes as we think about second half. 
Obviou
sly, you've got NFL costs that are going to uptick. But what should we 
be thinking about as sustainability in that sort of 24% type range?
 
And then secondly, I guess, a question, I guess, just for 
--
 
actually, maybe 
John Donovan and John Stankey. Just thin
king about the WatchTV product. I 
guess, firstly, any sort of early takeaways from that product, how successful 
it is?
 
And then also, can you use that as a model for more integration with the 
Time Warner or WarnerMedia assets? And how far can you take that
 
without 
risking legacy linear distribution revenue? Thanks.
 
John Donovan
 
Yes. Thanks, Mike, a lot of questions nested in there. I'll try to be brief and 
have you ask follow
-
ups if I missed anything. If you start with video 
margins, you see this at the beg
inning of the evolution of our products that 
we're trying to get them, as I mentioned earlier, into affordability slots 
where you get high engagement and therefore, high value for the money.
 
One of the things that is 
--
 
it's not well published as you think
 
about these 
ad stream count differentials, so you fit in the different viewing patterns. So 
WatchTV has a single stream product; the DIRECTV NOW having two with a 
pay up to three, obviously, the linear TV products, the satellite delivered and 
what we are 
going to be coming out with here in beta next quarter in the 
early stages, which is a broadband delivered version of it.
 
Now all of a sudden, you'd have a whole series of price points. And so you 
saw the beginning of what we're doing to reshape DIRECTV NOW
. DIRECTV 
NOW is a placeholder in the market until the deal was finished. A placeholder 
in the market, that product tried to do too much and too little. So we tried to 
stretch it down on price. We tried to stretch it up in value.
 
But over time, we think th
at there will need to be 
-
 
hit various price points 
and get the right package bundled in there so customers find value for it. So 
you saw the first moves that we added, vertical capabilities on top of it, a 
third stream. And when we got cloud DVR and enhan
ced the product, we put 
the price into the market rate for that price.
 
So we've seen DIRECTV NOW. We just had a very strong quarter of 
DIRECTV NOW ads. So a highlight for you that when you net all of this 
drama out for a minute on sub counts, if we start t
here, we were 25 million 
subscribers when we bought DIRECTV. We're at 25 million subscribers now.
 
Customers we lost in cord nevers and cord cutters, we replaced with 
products that fit their affordability range. We watched cannibalization 
closely. Roughly 1
5% to 17% on every given 
-
 
in any given month is the 
cannibalization rate, but 1/3 of those are listed in our linear TV product. It's 
very likely to churn because of their engagement and where the costs don't 
fit.
 
So we are watching that very closely. We'r
e slotting these products into 
affordability and an engagement range where we get the value of it. And I'll 
point out to you how we procure content on WatchTV. And there's a variable 
nature to its cost. It is profitable and reasonably comparable to the 
tra
ditional margins of the business on a percentage of revenue basis.
 
And so the real question that we're learning as we go, once we get out of 
linear TV and get into open video, which is software
-
based TV, how much 
does the category grow because we're gettin
g cord nevers, cord cutters, but 
also we're getting redundant accounts where it's becoming a personal video 
product, where a team with a more personalized approach can build a 
playlist and stack their favorites in a way that it becomes a one stream 
product
 
that is a playlist that behaves much like music.
 
So when you start to look at addressable markets, you look at the ARPU 
available, the margins and then you add the owner's economics, which is 
Brian Lesser getting higher CPMs and John Stankey having owner'
s 
economics on a portion of that video cost, now these margins start to blend 
up into much higher territory.
 
So we look very closely at the blended margin and the movement between 
these rungs, all while keeping an eye to make sure our subscriber counts 
kee
p us at that 25% to 30% share player in the marketplaces. So that's how 
we're thinking about the strategies in the margins.
 
And the last thing I'll point out is that on those lower
-
end products, on a 
revenue basis, I'll remind you that the 
acquisition cost is much lower 
because it's much more heavily a digitally acquired product and also, the 
stacked costs are lower. The cost to deploy, the cost to maintain is much 
lower. So over time, as we build those volumes up, those are products that 
wi
ll get scalable margins. I'll stop there and see if I missed anything.
 
John Stephens
 
This is John Stephens. JD, great job on that. I'll give it to you this way. First 
of all, Mike, we're not giving out specific guidance on margins on any of the 
specific bu
sinesses as I mentioned before, when I think Simon asked the 
question with regard to Time Warner's specific EPS impact.
 
What I will tell you is this. JD talked about the fact we'll be able to move 
DTV Now's deliverables, cloud DVR, streams, pay per view, f
uture data 
insights and other opportunities, it's going to provide revenue opportunities.
 
Secondly, the fact that we've got the four products that are going to cut 
down on subscriber acquisition costs moving from a satellite 
--
 
the only 
truck that shows up
 
now is now one of our trucks that hang a dish but 
maybe the UPS or the FedEx truck delivering that incline in the future.
 
All of those things give us the expectations that we can see the margins 
continue to improve. As our advertising team continues to le
arn more and 
get more effective, those advertising revenues will help out on that 
entertainment margins. So all of those things are giving us optimism as we 
go forward.
 
With that being said, we've got 
--
 
traditionally have tough compares with the 
NFL conte
nt so forth the rest of the year, so we're not giving specific 
guidance on margins for the third and fourth quarter. Well aware of the 
improvement in some of the stabilization of the operating contributions in 
the Entertainment Group, we're 
-
 
we noticed th
at.
 
We're aware of it. The team's working hard to achieve that, but we'll keep 
this process going to see overall improvement on a year
-
over
-
year basis 
coming in 2019, and that's when we expect to see it.
 
Randall Stephenson
 
Okay. Thanks, Mike. Lori, we will
 
take one more question.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. That's from Mike Rollins with Citi. Please go ahead.
 
Mike Rollins
 
Hi. Thanks for taking the questions. Two if I could. How do you view your 
sports rights between SUNDAY TICKET for DTV and the NBA for Turner as 
s
ustainable points of differentiation for your media strategy? And how 
important is it to take those content right and put them into your emerging, 
evolving direct
-
to
-
consumer strategy and platforms?
 
John Stankey
 
Well, let me all answer on behalf on the Tur
ner side of things in sports and 
John can certainly address the NFL relationship on DIRECTV. The 
--
 
look, I 
view the right sports rights as being critical to our strategy over time. And I 
view the right sports rights with leads that want to participate in 
a manner 
that is reflective of how platforms are evolving and how technology is 
evolving and how consumers are changing their consumption patterns as 
being the right partners to work with.
 
And I feel pretty good about the partners that we have at Turner an
d their 
flexibility to sit down and look at new models, new approaches to how they 
put their content in front of consumers, how they think about the importance 
of digital and their product and the speed at which they're willing to move 
around those things.
 
Our advertising business is a healthier business with sports in the mix. I 
think you saw that in the second quarter numbers. Those were largely 
powered by the great performance of the NBA and a wonderful product that 
they have, and they're great partners.
 
And so I think it'll be very important for us to continue to manage that 
portfolio and have the right mix of sports and general entertainment in our 
portfolio that's attractive to customers in the linear format, and we'll 
continue to do that going forward
. Now that mix may change a little bit.
 
Over time, different options may show up, but the asset test is going to be, I 
think, sports that are well received by customers, that are valued properly, 
that are flexible on how they work with distribution rights 
and technology 
and then working today's fast paced and dynamic society in terms of how 
they are consumed.
 
Randall Stephenson
 
I don't know 
--
 
this is Randall, Mike. I don't know if there's much to add as it 
relates to NFL. I think John Stankey just characte
rized what it is that we look 
for in terms of what's important when we think about sports programming.
 
And it's really critical when you think about our business, where everything 
is going, where John Stankey is going direct
-
to
-
consumer, where John 
Donovan
 
is building platforms, better streaming platforms, where Brian 
Lesser's monetization opportunities for advertising are tied to streaming 
capabilities, those are probably our best opportunities. So finding sports 
programming that fits within those directio
ns, where we as a company are 
going, are really, really important.
 
John Donovan
 
And I would also say, just as we get more targeted, just sort of one way to 
think about it is a sports lover in the future is not going to be the 
segmentation. It's going to be
 
a Red Sox fan, a Yankee fan who spends 
winters in Tampa.
 
So these things had been acquisition tools over time. They're much more 
retention and engagement tools now that fit in that profile I mentioned 
earlier. And so we're going to really be trying to inn
ovate on all of these 
things that are very segment specific, and I think you're going to see us 
really get creative in what we do going forward.
 
Randall Stephenson
 
Okay, very good. Listen, that wraps up what we wanted to cover with you 
this evening. I appr
eciate everybody joining us. What I would sum it up by 
saying is we've had a few months of distraction. And make no mistake about 
it. It's been a bit of a distraction for both businesses, the WarnerMedia as 
well as the AT&T side.
 
That is behind us, and 
we are executing. And I feel like we're executing very 
well on the communications business side, the momentum it's gaining as 
you're seeing service revenues are up. Subscriber metrics are improving, 
margins are improving. I feel really good about how that 
team is executing.
 
The WarnerMedia side, I couldn't be happier with the position that the 
company is in, the business is in, and it's going quite well. Our LatAm 
business, Mexico, it's going on all cylinders. It's been aggressive on pricing 
down there, but
 
we are staying the course. We're competing aggressively.
 
We're gaining a lot of momentum. It has a strong path and a good line of 
sight to profitability. And stay tuned on advertising. I could not be more 
excited about the opportunity here for advertising
, the ad tech acquisitions 
we've made. So thanks again for joining us and look forward to seeing and 
talking to everybody again.

Instructions]
 
At this time I would like to turn the conference over to our first speaker 
Senior Vice President, Investor Relations, Susan Johnson. Please go ahead.
 
Susan Johnson
 
Thank you, Nick. Good afternoon everyone. And welcome to our second 
quarter co

Johnson, Head of Investor Relations for AT&T. Joining me on the call today is 

President and CEO for Mobility. John wi
ll cover our consolidated and wireline 
results and Ralph will give us an update on our wireless business. And then 

 
Let me remind you our earnings material is available on the Investor 
Relations page of the AT&T website that

Of course I first need to draw your attention to our Safe Harbor statement 
before we begin which says that some of our comments today maybe

looking. As such they are subject to risks and uncertainties, results 
may
 
differ materially. And additional information is available in our and 


regarding SEC filings that is included o
n the slide.
 
Before I turn the call over to John, I would like to provide some additional 
context for the quarter on Slide 4. We talked with you the last few quarters 

saw a signific
ant progress, particularly with our repositioning of the wireless 
business model. First on the network front. Our Project VIP investment plan 
continues to deliver or transforming our network to a premier IP video
-
centric network and the results have been i
mpressive.
 
Our 4G LTE build now covers more than 290 million people and we expect to 
complete our deployment by the end of the summer. And our fiber build out 

500,000 business customer loca
tions since we first announced Project VIP. 
At the same time we are investing in our network, we are investing in our 
customers by repositioning the wireless value proposition.
 
Several years ago we successfully led the transition to usage base to data 
pric
ing and now more than 80% of our postpaid smartphone subscribers are 
on those plans. Now we are making another successful pivot away from the 
traditional device subsidy model with AT&T and our Mobile Share Value 
plans. Customers can now pay directly for th
eir devices and exchange for 


equation that works for us.
 
With this an important strategic shift away fr
om device subsidies which has 
historically netted out to be a multi
-
billion dollar cost each year. This move 

many of the expected changes in our financial results.
 
The shift in revenues 
from service to equipment and the moderation of 
quarterly margin trends as we achieved increased savings in device 
subsidies in the back
-
half of the year, which as you know historically is our 
strongest device sales season. But the key point is that we hav
e made a 
deliberate discussion to go down this path and with the results we are 
seeing, we believe the strategy is clearly working. We see it in our results 
and we hear from our customers.
 
With that, let me turn it over to John to discuss our second quarte
r results. 
John?
 
John Stephens
 
Thank you, Susan. And hello everyone, thanks for joining us today and as 
always thank you for your interest in AT&T. Let me begin with our 
consolidated financial summary which is on Slide 5. Consolidated revenue 
grew to $32.6
 
billion up $500 million or 1.6%. This was driven by continued 
wireless growth as we change our business model. Solid consumer wireline 
growth once again led by U
-
verse and growth and strategic business 
services.
 
Revenue this quarter was impacted by the sh
ift to no device subsidy plans 
and wireless. Reported EPS for the quarter was $0.68, as you know during 
the quarter we sold our equity position in América Móvil. After
-
tax we had a 
gain of about $0.08 on the sale. The gain was taxed at a higher effective t
ax 
rate due to accounting for deferred tax assets related to foreign tax credits.
 
While these accounting rules will acquire this high tax rate, we are confident 
we will be able to utilize existing capitalized carryforwards to maximize the 
after
-
tax cash pr
oceeds from the sale. When you normalize to the side, our 
consolidated effective tax rate is about 34% or about a 100 basis points 
higher than last year.
 
Also we had $0.02 of pressure from our Leap integration cost, including our 
non
-
cash items such as the
 
amortization of customer list. You may recall 
that we close that transition in March, so this is the first full quarter with 
these integration costs. When you exclude these items earnings per share 
was $0.62 compared to an adjusted $0.67 a year earlier.
 
C
onsolidated margins continue to be pressured by our investments both in 
Project VIP and Agile and our shift away from the subsidy model to wireless. 
These well for our investments are expected to drive stronger growth in the 
second half of the year. Cash f
rom operations continues to be strong. Cash 
from operating activities in the quarter totaled to $8.1 billion and capital 
spending was $ 6 billion with strong investments in Project VIP. Year
-
to
-
date 
our free cash flow is more than $5 billion and that after
 
are more than $1.5 
billion investment in our customers through AT&T Next.
 
Solid churn to our operational highlights on Slide 6. As you can see, we 
continue to execute a high level even as we transform our business. In 
wireless the growing popularity of AT
&T Next and the Mobile Share Value 
plan is having an impact on our results.
 
The customer transition to these plans is driving a major shift in the subsidy 
model and at the same time helping to reduce churn increased postpaid 
subscribers drive strong growth
 
of large voice data and improve our net 
promoter scores or our customer satisfaction results.
 
However, Ralph will give you the details in just a moment. But we are very 
pleased with what we are seeing from our wireless repositioning and 
confident in our s
trategy. In wireline U

verse continues its steady 
performance of subscriber gains and increasing revenue.
 

25% year

year. Strategic business services also continues to grow at 
mo
re than 13% and is an annualized $9 billion revenue stream. We also 
reached a milestone in the second quarter when our U
-
verse high
-
speed 
broadband reached 70% of our total broadband base. Clearly the transition 
is underway.
 
While we have made great progre
ss, we still have a lot of room for growth, 
as we expand our base through Project VIP and continue the bundle 
broadband with other valuable services. And of course in the second quarter, 
we announced our intention to acquire DIRECTV.
 
This will take our vid
eo and bundling strategies and our cost structure to a 

Service bundles are a proven winner for us, and we believe the ability to 
bundle services nationally will be a big plus. Overal
l, we are on track with 
full year guidance and look forward for trends to improve in the second half 
of the year.

for our wireless business with results coming in bett

The shift is in no

device
-
subsidy model is unmistakable, more and more 
customers are choosing the simplicity of Mobile Share Value pla
ns and AT&T 
Next. This model shift is driving impressive results. Postpaid churn was a 
record low 0.86%, the best ever for AT&T and likely and industry best this 
quarter.
 
This customer loyalty help drive our largest postpaid subscriber gain in 
nearly 
five years more than a million postpaid net adds in the quarter 
including very strong smartphone net adds. The shift in Mobile Share Value 
and Next has been dramatic in transitioning our smartphone customer base. 
Half of our smartphone sales in the second 
quarter were on AT&T Next and 
nearly half of our smartphone subscriber base has moved to Mobile Share 
Value plans since we first introduced value plans in February.
 
Even better when customers do switch to Mobile Share they are moving to 
larger and larger d
ata buckets. We now have more than 41 million 
connections across 15 million accounts on Mobile Share with half on plans of 
10 gigabytes or higher. And the number on larger data plan continues to 
grow. As more and more customers move to usage
-
based data pla
ns data 
use is increasing.
 

-
over
-
year data usage increase on 
smartphones and we continue to add more smartphones connected devices 

Digital Life is gai
ning momentum and had its best net gain quarter. 
Connected car growth is accelerating with new models entering the market 
such as the Audi A3 as well as 10 GM models that will grow to 30 by the end 
of the year. These are in addition to those are already in
 
the market such as 
Tesla, BMW and others. We feel these are incredibly good results in a time of 
transition. Let me give you more details starting with our strong postpaid 
net adds and churn on Slide 8.
 
The move to Mobile Share Value plan has really solid
ified our customer base 
and this is critically important, retaining our smartphone base is the basis for 
future growth. Postpaid churn was there an all time low and churn for Mobile 
Share and smartphone customers were even lower. That was even more 
remarka
ble in a noisy competitive environment.
 
This help to drive more than a million postpaid net adds with more than half 
of those being phone customers as significant improvement from the past 
several quarters. Overall, we had more than 600,000 total net adds 
and that 
includes prepaid declines due to the second quarter seasonal pressure and 
continued migration of session
-
based tablets to postpaid.
 
We also saw expected second quarter pressure from our Cricket integration. 
We expect this prepaid pressure will mod
erate in the third quarter and in 
fact we have already seen our prepaid trends improving. Branded tablet net 
adds for the quarter were 250,000 and that includes 366,000 postpaid tablet 
net adds in the quarter.
 
We also saw pressure in reseller and connected
 
devices, as we transition of 
the old 2G network, all this drove total return higher even with our record 
low postpaid churn. We continue to grow our smartphone base including 
migrations, we added nearly 1.6 million in the quarter. We had more than 
700,000
 
net adds in the quarter and more than 90% of our postpaid phone 
sales in the second quarter were smartphones.
 
Sales of LTE devices also continued at a strong clip which is great for both us 
and our subscribers. LTE devices provide the best customer experi
ence well 
also be the most network efficient, almost two
-
thirds of our postpaid 
smartphone base now have LTE phones. You see the dramatic impact Mobile 
Share Value plans on churn and postpaid net adds.
 
Now let me show you the impact on the subsidy model an
d revenues. Those 
details begin on Slide 9. Total wireless revenues for quarter were up nearly 
4% as revenues continue to shift to equipment from service. Equipment 
revenue growth was strong in the quarter up 45% but also we expect that 
service revenues we
re impacted. We also saw revenue pressure from 
promotional activity early in the quarter from a change in the recognition of 
revenue with the sales of phones through our agents due to the AT&T Next 
offering.
 
Together these two items are about a 200 basis p
oint impact on total 

customers who bring their own devices. This is a good thing for us, as it 
takes all the subsidy expense out of our model and brings on a profitable 
customer.
 

re continuing to see customers choosing Mobile Share Value plans in 
unprecedented numbers. In just five months about 24 million smartphones 
or about 44% of our postpaid smartphone base have moved up to subsidy 
model. That includes about 2 million subscribe
rs on a limited data plans who 
chose to move to Mobile Share plans.
 
We now have less than 10 million subscribers on a limited plans; our lowest 
level in years. At the same time, customers who are ready to upgrade are 
increasingly turning to AT&T Next. More
 
than half of our smartphone sales in 
the quarter are 3.1 million were on Next, as you can see on the pie chart on 
the left of the slide, we have about 7 million AT&T customers who are Next 
customers at the end of the quarter. But the total number of subsc
ribers on 
non
-
subsidy plans is about 24 million.
 
This gives us a large number of subscribers who will move to AT&T Next 
when they buy a new device. By the end of the year, we expect the 
percentage of Next sales to increase considerably as customers begin t
o 
upgrade their phones. And in fact we are already seeing customers do this, 
virtually all of our pre
-
Next customers are choosing AT&T Next when they 
upgrade in our company
-
owned stores.
 
And we expect sales to increase with our agents and in national retai
l where 

model is driving a shift in our wireless mix, but it is also driving higher value 
with improved churn and more sustainable margins.
 

 
those financial details on Slide 
10. John?
 
John Stephens
 
Thanks Ralph. Ralph talked about the great results we saw in wireless in the 
second quarter. Let me take just a minute dive deeper into the financial and 
customer value impacts. If you look at the o
verall customer value that shift 
away from the subsidy model is very positive. Churn plays a big role in this.
 
Take a look at the customer value illustration on the upper left of the Slide 
10. With the year
-
over
-
year 16 basis point improvement in postpaid 
churn, 
the average life of each of our customers is extended by 18 months. With 
Mobile Share Value pricing servers ARPU is to drop on a comparable basis. 

revenues actually increased a
nd example percentage that have increased 
$400 per customer when you are AT&T with over 50 million phone 

 

take into accou
nt the reduction in equipment subsidy. Going to AT&T Next 

look at service ARPUs anymore to get a comprehensive view of our business.
 
Phone
-
only service ARPU is down for the quart
er, but when you add in Next 
billings you get a more accurate idea of what an average customer pays us 
each month. The average monthly Next billings for the equipment are about 
$27 per month, driving our phone
-
only ARPU higher with Next.
 
When this $27 per 
month is spread over the entire base it adds about $2 in 
ARPU per customer in the quarter. As the Next base rose, so will this impact 

improved throughout the second quarter and for June wa
s more than $65, 
are almost $1 higher than the quarterly average as equipment purchases 
increased throughout the quarter.
 
Another benefit of moving off the subsidy model which is at the previous 
highs and lows of our margins become more stable. We did in t
his business 

holiday season and the introduction of new devices. In the past we usually 
have mixed feelings about those events was great for sales, with that 
subsidy cost pressured ma
rgins and financial results.
 
Now with about half of our smartphone subscribers already are in non
-

pretty good about the position we are in. If you look at our expectations for 
the rest 
of the year, we anticipate service margins to be more than 40%, 
while postpaid phone
-
only ARPU with Next billings will continue to increase 
as more customers upgrade their phones.
 

de
finitely working. The benefits are clear, lower overall churn, higher 
postpaid net adds, customers buying larger buckets of data and a shift away 
from the unlimited plans.
 
First of all, customers like it, they like the clear and simple pricing and we 
feel 

the second half of the year. Those are our wireless highlight; I would now 
like to discuss our wireline business starting with consumer on Slide 11.
 
U
-
verse has been a solid and consisten
t story for us; we continue to see 
solid subscriber and revenue growth. This help drive 3% revenue growth in 
consumer, total U
-
verse revenues are now approaching a $15 billion 
annualized revenue stream and they are growing at about 25% year
-
over
-
year.
 
U
-
ve
rse now represents 62% of consumer revenues. They had a 11.5 million 

more than 70% of our total broadband base that compares to just 40% two 
years ago. We also added a 190,000 TV subscr
ibers in the quarter, which 
gives us 5.9 million total U
-
verse TV customers.
 
The big factor in the success of U
-
verse is our ability to bundle. More than 
97% are virtually all of our video customers had some kind of bundle with 
us. And two
-
thirds of our U
-
verse TV subscribers take three or four services 
with us. ARPU for U
-
verse triple play customers continues to be more than a 
$170 a month.
 
Now to drive growth while reducing churn, in fact triple play bundle 
customers has significantly lower churn than 
standalone customers. We see 
continued opportunity here, our market penetration stands around 20% for 
U
-
verse broadband and TV. But that penetration increases the longer we are 
in a market, plus this Project VIP expands our customer reach, we believe 
we ca
n achieve much more.
 
We also continue to deploy GigaPower as part of our Project VIP build sales 
of our Ultra
-
fast broadband service have exceeded expectations at Austin 

 

to our business wireline results on Slide 12. Wireline 
business continues to be a story of the economy and the shift to IP data and 
away from legacy services. Strategic business services, services such as 
VPN, Ethernet, Hosting and other advanced IP servic
es grew by more than 
13% in the quarter and more than 14% year
-
to
-
date. And now represent 
more than $9 billion annualized revenue stream.
 
And that now make up more than 27% of business wireline revenue and for 
the first time strategic business service reve
nues are now more than half of 
our total wireline business data revenues.
 
Overall wireline business revenues were down to 0.9%, service revenues 

with recent trends and the slow econ
omy. When you look at each of the 

different stories and different trends. Enterprise service revenues were 
actually up about 1% year
-
over
-
year.
 
And this was its fifth consecutive quart
er of year
-
over
-
year growth rate 
improvement and our enterprise channel continues to provide significant 
sales opportunities for our wireless services. Wholesale again was challenged 
by network proving of some of our wireless customers. And we also saw in 
the impact of our acquisition of the Leap this quarter as those previous 
external wholesale revenues now are internal to AT&T.
 
While our small business is benefiting from wireless bundles and continued 
U
-
verse broadband growth. The lack of new business for
mations is still 
impacting the business opportunity.
 

impacts from changes in the wireless subsidy model and Project VIP on our 
margins. In the second quarter when adjusting for Leap int
egration expense 

performance especially when you consider our very strong postpaid and 
smartphone net adds in the quarter.
 
Adjusted EBITDA was $6.5 billion stable year
-
over
-
year, the 
total EBITDA 
margin was down due to the impact of the 24 million smartphones moving to 
Mobile Share Value pricing, some promotional activity we had in the first half 
of the year. And new business investments and things like Cricket and 
Digital Life.
 
For th
e quarter our adjusted consolidated margin was 17.7% compared to 
19.1% in the year ago quarter. As Ralph said, the shift to Mobile Share plans 
ahead of equipment purchases pressure our results.
 
Wireline margins were down from a year ago, but essentially fl
at with first 
quarter levels. The decline in revenue from legacy services was part of the 
impact, but at the same time success
-
based video content cost 
retransmission price increases and expenses for project Agile and VIP also 
cause pressure.
 
For example o
verall content cost increases for more than double, the total 
increase of wireline operating expenses for the entire quarter. But this 
wireline pressure was partially offset by growth of consumer revenues gains 
in strategic business services and solid exec
ution of cost initiatives.
 
We expect project Agile and are moved to software defined networks to 
provide margin help, project Agile drive efficiency and speed to market as 
we transform how the company organizes and operates all around our 
customers.
 

ve said before, we are reinvesting in savings at this point, we feel real 
opportunity to reduce cost through this effort. We expect run rate in savings 
in the $3 billion range by 2017.
 

alf of 
the year, cash from operations totaled nearly $17 billion and about $8.1 
billion in the second quarter. Capital expenditures were up $11.8 billion for 
the six months and 16 for the quarter. Free cash flow before dividends was 
$5.1 billion year
-
to
-
da
te on track with full year guidance even with 
investments in Project VIP and our wireless customer base.
 
We did monetize $800 million of our Next receivables in the quarter and 
there continues to be great interest at additional sales. But even after that 
o
ur net investment in customers increased by more than $1.5 billion during 
the year. So we expect to meet our free cash flow guidance even with the 
substantial working capital invested in AT&T Next customers. And net debt 
to adjusted EBITDA was at 1.71 as w
e maintain the best credit rating major 
U.S. telecom company.
 
In terms of cash, I think you know the story, dividend payments remain our 
first priority and year
-
to
-
date total $4.8 billion and we continue to be 
opportunistic with our share buyback program.
 
Our asset sales including América Móvil also strengthened our cash position 
and balance sheet. We ended the quarter with more than a $11 billion of 
cash about 4.6 that has already been used for debt redemption leaving more 
than 6 billion of cash on hand at
 
the current time.
 
We have balance in flexibility to pay down more debt and position ourselves 
for the upcoming spectrum auctions and DIRECTV acquisition, while 

maximize our bal
ance sheet efficiency. We expect another $3 billion of asset 
monetization by the end of the year, with the sale of our Connecticut 
wireline property and remaining proceeds from our América Móvil sale.
 
The DIRECTV transaction continues to move forward, Braz

regulator has approved it without restrictions and we have completed the 
reviewing process at the state level without conditions, which included 
Arizona, Louisiana and Hawaii. We also received good news today when the 

pproval notice allowing us to fund our pension plans 
with the preferred equity interest in América Móvil was posted in the federal 
register website.
 
Now let me close with a quick summary and a recap of our full year 2014 
expectations.
 
There continues to be
 
a lot of moving parts in this quarter and throughout 

direction. We staked out our course in our plan for the year and we are 
confident that we are on the right track. First we expect c
onsolidated 
revenue growth at the low end of the 5% range to define that, but said that, 
we will say that the range is, we define that range as 4.5% to 5.5% and 
expect the numbers of the AT&T Next upgrades to ramp substantially in the 
second half of the ye
ar powering that growth.
 

greater benefits, as more customers shift away from the subsidy model to 
the back
-
half of the year. We continue to expect adjusted EPS in a low end 
of the mid
-
sin
gle digit range even with the pressure from Leap integration 

spending in $21 billion range even as we accelerated investment in the first 
half of the year. And we expect free c
ash flow in the $11 billion range even 
with strong AT&T Next sales.
 
I now will turn it back to Susan to take your questions.

Operator
 
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from the 
line of Mike McCormack with Jefferies. Please go ahead.
 
Mike McCormack 

 
Jefferies
 
Hey guys thanks. Maybe just to comment on the churn side, obviously 

how do we get more confident that this is going to be a long
-
term benefit? 
And then just secondarily on the Leap side, how many of those customers if 

n the postpaid platform? Thanks.
 
John Stephens
 
Ralph do you want to take the question?
 
Ralph de la Vega
 
Yes, let me comment a little bit on that, Mike when John was going over the 
chart he was explaining just the extension that we see in the customer life 
time value, when you take our overall churn going from 1.02 to 0.086. The 
thing that is really encouraging to me is that that is the total average for 
postpaid. When you look at smartphones, you see a similar change and what 
is driving the overall churn do
wn our smartphones. And then when you look 
at smartphones on Mobile Share Value plans and Next they are even lower. 

encouraging to me in the second quarter.
 
In the second quarter
 
typically churn for our company goes up in May and 
June compared to April. What we saw in this quarter was a change in the 
trend, so both May and June were actually lower in churn than April despite 

 
very certain that as 
more and more customers sign up to Mobile Share Value plans and Next it 

net promoter scores. Our net promoter scores for customers who are in 
Mobile Share 
Value plans compared to family talk for example are twice the 
number.
 
So every indication we have from our customers is that these are 
sustainable and sustainable even during some pretty intense competitive 
activities as we always see in the wireless busin
ess. Now you are asking 
about Cricket, let me give you a quick update on Cricket. As you know, we 
actually launched Cricket on a nationwide basis, the new Cricket on the 
19
th
 

happened we 
successfully converted both the AIO brand the old Cricket 
brand to the new Cricket brand. We rebranded the stores and we started 
converting customers at rates that we expect that from the old CDMA 
network that LeapPad to our GSM network and Mike the result
s are really, 
really encouraging. As you know that network covers 97% of the customers, 

again of Cricket customers improving month after month as they get the 
sample, the GSM network 
compared to their old CDMA network.
 

terms of the net additions since we completed the conversion. In fact if you 
look at the second quarter, Cricket numbers compared to a year ago, w
e 
have reduced the factors (ph) by one
-
third. Just in the first quarter alone 

continue throughout the year. Again as customers sample this great network 
that they have now that is a na
tionwide network as we move those 
customers over, we are seeing lower churn.
 


Next in driving lower churn.
 
Mike 
McCormack 

 
Jefferies
 

get any benefit on the postpaid side from customers from Leap?
 
Ralph de la Vega
 
No not any significant improvement no Mike there was no 

 
no significant 
mov
ement from prepaid to postpaid in our case.
 
Mike McCormack

John Stephens
 
Thanks Mike.
 
Susan Johnson
 
Next question.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question is from John Hodulik with UBS.
 
John Hodulik 

 
UBS
 
Okay 
thanks guys. Maybe first just a follow
-

and then another one for John. Ralph is there any, I like that where you are 
going with the churn, is there any risk that churn could start to move up 
within the Next phase once the 

 
m
aybe the pre
-



the bill were down start to see it go back up again and maybe talk abo
ut 
your experience there? And then maybe for John, in your prepared remarks 
at the beginning of the call, you talked about some stronger growth and 
stronger trends in the second half. Is it just equipment driven or can you 
give us a little more detail on w
hat some of those trends are and to the point 
where we have an eye when we will start to see service revenue trends start 
to churn?
 
Ralph de la Vega
 
John on your comment about what happens as people upgrade to Next as 

e already seeing about half of our 

referring to and those customers when we sample them their net promoter 
scores are high. So we are not seeing any concerns at this point and I think 
that once they get on Next they are going to be able to get the new 
smartphone every year or every 18 months depending on the plans that 
they select. So we feel really good so far, but everything we have seen from 
the plans no major concerns.
 
John Stephens
 
John specifically the customers that we allow to go up on the Mobile Share 

on rates over 90% of the company
-

the Next program. So they like 
it, they really seem to be very sticky. So we 

 
John Hodulik 

 
UBS
 
Got you.
 
John Stephens
 
With regard to the stronger trends there is a couple of things that are just 
really important, one w
hen you add a million customers on the quarter and 
we added total change was 1.6 million smartphones that was a conversion of 
about 900,000 feature phones to smartphones. And then there was net adds 

ly significant 
number, we had another good quarter of tablets, about 350,000. But we 
really had great performance on our smartphone net adds. So that gives us 
confidence in generally more revenue.
 
Additionally we are seeing people take insurance, almost so
rt of 50% clip on 

those insurance rates anywhere from $7 to $10 a month. We see really good 

mentioned. I thin
k we mentioned Ralph mentioned that there was 14 million 
or so Mobile Share Value accounts, over half or about half of those are 
taking 10 Gig or better.
 
And with the new phones coming up people are using more data, we 
continue to see usage growth which is
 
going to drive revenue growth. All of 
those things are what give us confident in what we see and why we believe 
there is going to be real opportunity for improving revenue trends.
 
Lastly, there are much so we think the Next take rate and especially with t
he 
opportunity for maybe some new devices in the holiday season will also 
generate some improvement in our numbers. So feel really good about kind 
of the whole package not just the equipment story.
 
Ralph de la Vega
 
John one other thing that I think we both
 
feel good about is if you look at 
those larger data buckets we mentioned that about half of our base is on 
buckets that are 10 gigs or higher. But if you look at actually as customers 

hat 
are selecting the 10 gig or higher plan to be 70%. So we got about half the 
base, but on the 

 
the ones that are getting added the take rates are even 
significantly higher.
 
So it gives us great encouragement and as you look at Mobile Share and 
Next, nu
mber one is producing lower churn and number of customer life 

resulting in these large data bucket purchases that we know will increase 
ARPU as we define it now could be phone
-
onl
y ARPU plus Next billings. 
Those are expected to increase for the remainder of the year. So we feel 

 
John Stephens
 

about 200 
basis point pressure in the wireless margin, wireless revenue growth this 


 
our Next program 
through our agents. And so and sort of recognizing the revenue when we 
deliver to the agent, we reco
gnize the revenue when they deliver to the 
customer and so that delayed and have the impact on revenue score. By the 

where the inventories are traditionally low.
 
In addition, we
 
had some early on in the quarter; we had some pressure 
from some promotional activities, as you know we really have a round of 
significant promotional activities since the April timeframe. So we think 

put those two things 
together, we have a better starting point that we may appear based on our 

 
on the appropriately reported results.
 
John Hodulik 

 
UBS
 
Got it. Okay thanks for the detail guys.
 
John Stephens
 
Thanks.
 
Susan Johnson
 
Next question.
 
Operator
 
Our next question is from the line of Joe Mastrogiovanni with Credit Suisse.
 
Joe Mastrogiovanni 

 
Credit Suisse
 
Hi thanks for taking the question. Ralph can you give us the sense for the 
exit rate for churn at the end of the quarter? And then John you just
 
mentioned the promotional activity, do you have an idea of how much of the 
sub
-
growth was actually driven by the promotional activity we saw early on 
in the quarter?
 
Ralph de la Vega
 
First on the churn in the quarter, as I mentioned earlier what is really
 
encouraging is that we saw both May and June be lower than our postpaid 
churn in April and usually is the reverse. So it says that that the plans that 
we have put in place are bending the curve in the right direction, trending to 
lower churn in the back
-
h
alf of the quarter as suppose to being higher which 
is traditionally what we have seen in mobility. So it is very encouraging and 

will drive it in a different direction.
 
John Step
hens
 
We 

 
shall we bolster in the whole operation, we are very optimistic about 
churn continuing to improve kind of an year
-
over
-
year basis compared to 
the historical levels. So we feel really good about that. With regard to the 
net adds we have, we really
 

programs in a fact in May or June, we had some in March and some of the 
cost of those were appropriate carryforward when the customers are earning 

 
in the 
way of significant customer change with regard to that. We may have seen 
some of that benefit in March, but I will tell you it seems like in the new 
environment we and a lot of our competitors were very active in that. And 
quite frankly we were not
; we were not as active as others.
 
Ralph de la Vega
 
By the way Joe one other point of reference, the 0.86% churn number as far 
as I know if you go back and look at the history of wireless is the second 
lowest churn ever reported by a company in the 
history of wireless and the 
one that was lower than that was only two basis points lower two years ago. 
So not only is at the lowest were AT&T, but some of the lowest churns ever 
reported by any company in wireless.
 
John Stephens
 
Obviously Joe we feel real
 

performing and the team is doing great job.
 
Joe Mastrogiovanni 

 
Credit Suisse
 
Okay guys thanks.
 
Susan Johnson
 
Next question.
 
Operator
 
Our next question is from Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley.
 
Simon Flannery 

 
Mor
gan Stanley
 
Thanks a lot, good evening. John on capital spending you reiterated the $21 
billion that implies about a 20% drop second half versus first half and I know 
there has been a lot of talk in the market around the CapEx freezes and so 
forth. So perh
aps you could just provide a little clarity about how you are 
going to get there and what impact that has on wireless or wireline? And 
then for Ralph, I think in the June release you said about one half of 
customers would be on no
-
device plans by mid
-
year 
and two
-
thirds by the 

targeting about two
-
thirds number or are we coming in a little bit lower than 
that? Thanks.
 
Ralph de la Vega
 
Let me answer the last one first Simon, and yes
 

targeting. What we have seen Simon is first of all we started with our 
company
-
owned retail stores and it was a huge smash hit. Then we brought 
in our dealers and they have been a huge smash hit, almost exactly the 
same performan
ce that we saw in our company
-
owned retails, which are 

national retails, these are national retail agents that have not sold Next up 
to this point, will be coming online. And so we exp
ect those to come online 


reported in the second quarter.
 
Simon Flannery 

 
Morgan Stanley
 
Perfect, okay.
 
Joh
n Stephens
 
Simon with regard to the CapEx story as we did reiterate that we will be in a 

commentary on over about a billion dollar spend in the first six months; I 

 
of the commentary that the talk that many have had 
that we had changed our spending patterns based on those numbers. It 
would seem that some people are misinformed maybe have been more 
about the spread or the hearing amongst our 

 
amongst our spend. If yo


suggest this we are very near complete with our $300 million LTE build. And 
in fact we expect to complete that later this summer. So most of the 
spending for that and much of spend
ing for the network intensification has 
been already placed. We just need to go out and utilize and put those assets 
in the services, which we have to do.
 

with regard to laying out
 
fiber and other things that we expect will moderate 
in the second half of the year and focus more on the utilization of assets that 
we placed in service. So, certainly it will be a challenge and be a lot of work. 
We feel good about the fact that we can st
and at $21 billion range.

some financing for your handset receivables which I believe Randall had 
alluded to as an 
opportunity during your most recent analyst event. Now 

further opportunities to finance some of these receivables? And then 
secondly there has also been a lot of chatter around the poss
ibility of 

amount of time looking at. But love to hear thoughts around where you think 
legislation is and where it ultimately shakes out and the potential 
opportunity here with resp
ect to your sort of cash flow positioning?
 
John Stephens
 
Sounds great, we are let me turn it Amir, first of all Citi was our lead bank in 
the Next monetization transaction that we completed in June. We received 
about $800 million in cash from the monetizat
ion of some of our Next 
accounts receivables. With that being said, we still had a net investment and 
are customers of $1.5 billion more than $1.5 billion actually from January 
1
st
 
to June 30
th

 

contortion to buy those receivables there was plenty of demand.
 
The financing costs were extremely low, very, very attractive and the terms 
and conditions were very attractive. So we 
went ahead and did it, we also, 
we are also very pleased with the fact that the collection of major banks 
established the real validity and the real value of those receivables. And we 
believe there continues to be great demand in fact all the participants 
and 


are, cash flow guidance for the year in the sense that we have that one of 
those levers is the monetizat
ion process. So it gives us great comfort.
 

extended, there has been a number of builds out there, some to make it 
permanent others to extend it. There seems to be a general sense that t
he 
extenders will get completed and approved, but maybe not until later this 
year. That would be a very good thing for capital intensive industry like us 
and help us continue to make significant investments in our network. The 
biggest cash impact for us wo
uld be in 2015. We would certainly help 2014, 
but the biggest cash impact for us would be in 2015, because of some of the 
new answers of tax rules.
 

opportunity to promote that legisla
tion.
 
Susan Johnson
 
Next question.
 
Operator
 
That comes from Mike Rollinswtih with Citi Investment and Research.
 
John Stephens
 
Hello mike.
 
Mike Rollinswtih 

 
Citi Investment and Research
 
Thanks for taking the questions. Just a couple of follow
-
up if I could
 
please. I 
think last quarter you mentioned what the installment net receivables were 
at the end of the quarter, I was wondering if you can give us an update 
there? And then secondly, if I can just go back to the churn improvement 
that you saw during the q
uarter, how should we think about who specifically 
the improvement came from, in other words did it come from customers that 
were had a contract and were able to churn but took advantage of the no
-
sub Mobile Share Value. Was it customers earlier in their l
ife that may have 
churn prematurely or you were able to capture a benefit from this, a way to 
think about the segments of customers were you saw that churn savings? 
Thanks.
 
John Stephens
 
I think the Mike couple of things, one I think the biggest churn 
impr
ovements we saw over are quite frankly in smartphones in the overall 
category of smartphones where the smartphone churn is lower than that 
0.86 postpaid churn we saw. Secondly, the customers who participate in our 
Mobile Share Value plan as they are churn 
is also lower than the 0.86%. So 
as those plans grow and as our smartphone, 80% smartphone base 
continues to go to flow share of 92% you can understand why we are 
optimistic about further kind of churn improvement and the opportunity we 
continue this good 

 
Ralph de la Vega
 
Yes, Mike let me add a little more color to that, like John said when you 
compare the 1.02 churn to 0.86 that extends the life of a customer by a year 
and a half. If you do the same analysis not on the total base, but on 
smartphones that life extension goes to 2.5 years. The churn difference is 
actually greater if you compare smartphones on the same basis. So you 
extend the life of the customer by 2.5 years and then if you take 
smartphone who will have Mobile Share Value a
nd Next you extend that 
even further than that.
 

that customers who choose Mobile Share Value and Next on smartphones 
are driving this thing down to really low levels. And by the
 
way the numbers 

involuntary churn. So the voluntary churn numbers are actually even lower 
than the ones that we have just published.
 
John Stephens
 
Mike, I will add to the sort of the inst


one specific line of the financial statements. But if you look at our accounts 
receivable and then you add in our long
-
term assets that rel
ate to Next, 
because some of the receivables are over 12 months. And then you look at 
the deferred purchase price from the city organization to get a sense where 

account or reduc
ing it for the 

 
for the monetization we did. We will disclose 
this information in 10
-

we 

 
as we have in the first quarter to disclose that.
 
Susan Johnson
 
Next question.
 
Operator
 
Next question 
comes from the line of Phil Cusick with JPMorgan.
 
Phil Cusick 

 
JPMorgan
 
Hey guys, thanks. I guess two quick ones, first the buyback pace is a little 
slower, should we think of that as sort of the new run rate given the DTV 
transaction out there and I know
 

this at this level give or take? And then second speaking of DTV, there are 
lot of opportunities in Latin America AMX made some assets, the Brazil 
auction is coming up, would you anticipate being involved in anyth
ing in 
Latin America between now and the close of the DTV deal or in the future, or 
do you think of DTV sort of it is as it is for a while? Thanks.
 
Ralph de la Vega
 

and certainly
 
we take into consideration all factors the DTV deal, our CapEx 
spending, quite frankly our investment and our customers with Next. So I 
must stick with the guidance we gave before that, we are going to continue 

ight that the pace has moderated 
cash compared to last year.
 
With regard to any transactions other than the comments I have made on 

speculation. So we were just 

 
we were just really fo
cused on continuing to 
work with the regulatory agencies in getting the DTV transaction approved 


forward.

Thank you. The last question will come from Timothy Horan with 
Oppenheimer.
 
Timothy Horan 

 
Oppenheimer
 
Thanks guys. I think last quarter you gave 
the normalized ARPU and maybe 
I missed at this quarter, if you normalize for the sale of the equipment. And 
maybe I know you have channel sales and a few other moving parts. Can 
you give us what your best guess and what the normalized revenue growth 
was fo
r the quarter? And then lastly, I know you said customers are bring 
their own, more of their own devices, but are you seeing customers kind of 
trade down to lower cost devices with the next plan now that they have to 
kind of pay it for their own? Thanks.

So, Tim a couple of things if you look on Slide 10 that we showed there, you 
can see that the ARPU plus the Next billings was about 64 little bit over $64, 

range. Secondly 
I would tell you that if you look at that as of the month of 

And so what we are seeing is an expectation that through the rest of this 
year you will see the ARPU plus those Next b
illings definitely increase and 

growth. Ralph take the question.

devices that are typic

we see a new wave of low cost smartphones where our customers can 
outright purchase the device for a very low cost and in essence bringing 
their own device by paying cash. And the new line up of smartphon
es that 

devices, very functional, large screen at lower cost that will allow a customer 
to get our best price by a very simple purchase of the device. So we think 
that the BYOD will pr
obably increase as the year goes on.

Well, for the quarter Tim our BYOD units were about three times or more 
than three times what they were last year. But the encouraging win for us is 
about three quarter or more of those, went on accounts u
nder contract. And 
so the BYOD there is a required contract when they bring them put them out 
of the account that has a contract we feel real good about the sustainability 
of those and quite frankly as Ralph mentioned the fact there is no
-
subsidy 
cost thos
e makes it really a financially attractive situation.
 

made significant progress in transforming our business for growth in the 
second quarter and in particular with repositioning 
our wireless business 
model. Postpaid net adds were very strong. Specifically smartphones net 

made great strides in moving smartphone subscribers off the subsidy model.
 
We feel really
 
good about our current momentum heading into the back
-
half 
of the year and believe even stronger that our discussions to go with this 
model was appropriate. Thanks again for the call and as always thank you 
for your interest in AT&T. Have a great evening.
 
Good night.

Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your patients and standing by, and 
welcome to the AT&T first quarter 2018 earnings call. At this time, all of your 
participant phone lines are in a listen
-
only mode. And later, there'll be an 
opportunity here for your questions. Instructions will be given at that time.
 
I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Michael Viola, 
Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.

Okay, th
ank you, Justin. Good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to our first 
quarter conference call. Like Justin said, this is Mike Viola. I'm Head of 
Investor Relations for AT&T. And joining me on the call today is John 
Stephens, AT&T's Chief Financial Officer. John'
s going to cover our results 
and provide business updates, which will include progress on FirstNet, and 
then we'll follow that up with a Q&A session.
 
As always, our earnings materials are available on the Investor Relations 
page of the AT&T website. That i
ncludes our news release, investor briefing, 
8
-
K and a variety of associated schedules. Before we begin, I want to call 
your attention to our Safe Harbor statement. That says that some of our 
comments today may be forward
-
looking. As such, they're subject 
to risks 
and uncertainties, and those results may differ materially. And additional 
information is always available on the Investor Relations website.
 
Also, I want to remind you that we're in the quiet period for the FCC CAF
-
II 
auction and so we can't addr
ess any questions about that today. And so 
now, I'd like to turn the call over to AT&T's CFO, John Stephens.

Thanks, Mike, and thanks for joining us on the call today. Let me begin with 
our financial summary, which is on slide
 
3.
 
As we mentioned last quarter and noted it in 8
-
K filed last month, AT&T was 
required to adopt several new accounting standards this year. These new 
accounting standards deal with reporting issues around revenue recognition, 
pension costs, financial ins
truments, and cash receipts on installment 
receivables. These changes have some impact on our income statements 
and our cash flows.
 
And in connection with adopting the new standard on revenue recognition, 
the company will now record Universal Service and o
ther regulatory fees on 
a net basis, consistent with how we have traditionally reported other pass
-
through items like sales taxes. This specific change will reduce both 
revenues and expenses by a little more than $900 million this quarter, but 
will not 

 
t
hey will not impact operating income or net income for the 
quarter.
 
In addition to GAAP, we're providing comparable historical results to help 
you better understand the impact on financials from revenue recognition. We 
will be referring to these historical
 
results in our comparisons during this 
call.
 
Tax reform gave us the opportunity to invest and grow our customer base. 
These investments drove a significant year
-
over
-
year improvement in 
postpaid phone net adds, the second
-
highest broadband quarter in 3 ye
ars 
and solid growth in video, as we transition our TV business.
 
Our adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.85, up about $0.15 with benefits 
from tax reform and revenue recognition, offsetting the costs of investing in 
our growing customer base and a small am
ount of pressure from the new 
financial instrument reporting rules.
 
Adjusted consolidated operating margins in the quarter were up year over 
year on a reported basis, but down on a comparable basis. Our increased 
sales activities this quarter drove much of
 
the pressure we saw, as did 
continued transition of video from linear to over
-
the
-
top services. But at the 
same time, we did see margin improvements in business wireline and 
international.
 
Next, let's cover revenue, which was $38.9 billion, down from a ye
ar ago. 
Higher wireless equipment and strategic service revenues partially offset 
declines in legacy services, the ongoing impact of the video transition and 
our decision to no longer pursue some low
-
margin businesses. Cash flow 
statements have been recast
 
to show the impact of the new accounting 
standard with installment receivables, so year
-
over
-
year cash flow results 
are comparable.
 
The first quarter is traditionally our lowest free cash flow quarter and this 
year is no different. Several items impacted 
free cash flow, including our 
annual employee bonus program, a larger than usual handset payment from 
the very strong gross add and upgrade performance during the light holiday 
season in the fourth quarter and continuing into the first quarter.
 
We also had
 
unreimbursed FirstNet expenditures in this quarter. Offsetting 
some of this pressure was a tax refund we received in the first quarter, 
which was generated by the passage of the tax reform act in late December 
of last year.
 
We're still on plans to meet th
e free cash flow guidance we gave you in 
January. That guidance of free cash flow in the $21 billion range included the 
pressure from the receivables accounting change. Capital spending was $6.1 
billion in the quarter.
 
Let's now take a look at our operatio
ns, starting with Mobility, where the 
team turned in solid customer growth. Those details are on slide 4. AT&T's 
domestic Mobility operations, as you know, are divided between the 
Business Solutions and Consumer Wireless segments. For comparison 
purposes, 
we're providing supplemental information for its total U.S. wireless 
operations.
 
Strong sales activity in a usually quiet quarter helped drive a turnaround in 
postpaid phone net adds. Postpaid phone net adds showed a more than 
300,000 phone improvement com
pared to the year ago first quarter, which 
is now more than 700,000 year
-
over
-
year improvement in the last two 
quarters.
 
Prepaid phones also came in strong, with about 190,000 new subscribers, 
and that's helped our Cricket customer base grow. And today, it
s total is 9 
million customers. Congrats to our management team that runs Cricket. And 
we increased our branded smartphone base by nearly 500,000, topping 73 
million by the end of the quarter.
 
Churn keeps improving. We had another record low first quarter 
postpaid 
phone churn of 0.84%, improving both year over year and sequentially. 
Altogether, we had more than 2.6 million new subscribers, that's domestic 
subscribers, with gains in postpaid, prepaid and connected devices, more 
than offsetting our continued 
losses in resellers.
 
Revenues were up more than 3% in the quarter, thanks to our strong 
smartphone sales, while service revenues were essentially flat sequentially. 
We're confident that service revenues will improve throughout the year and 
still expect tha
t we'll be positive for the full year on a comparable basis. 
There are several reasons for that.
 
First, we're now through the toughest year
-
over
-
year compare as we lap the 
introduction of unlimited plans that came out in the first quarter a year ago. 
We're
 
adding postpaid, prepaid and connected devices, subscribers at rapid 
rates, and the pressure from reseller is stabilizing. Recent new product 
offerings will also help. Our strong sales activity also had an impact on 
margins. Postpaid smartphone gross adds
 
and upgrades increased by about 
500,000 year over year.
 
That's an upgrade rate of 4. 3%, which was higher than last year, still 
service margins came in at 48.1% on a comparable basis. Our long
-
term 
strategy to build our branded phone base and improve chur
n with bundled 
services continues to pay off. Postpaid smartphones have increased by 
almost 2 million in the last two years. Prepaid smartphones have also 
increased at a solid clip, growing by 3.4 million in the same timeframe. 
That's more than five millio
n growth in overall domestic smartphone base.
 
At the same time, a growing number of our existing Mobility customers are 
bundling their wireless with our video and our broadband services. These are 
the most valuable customers with churn significantly lower 
than single
-
service customers. These results are very encouraging and gives us the 
confidence to continue to carefully invest in our customer base.
 
Now let's take a look at our Entertainment Group results on slide 5. The 
positive impact of TV and broadband
 
promotions and our ability to bundle 
services can be seen in our Entertainment Group results. Total video 
customers, broadband connections and bundles all grew. DIRECTV NOW 
continued its solid run of subscriber growth. More than 300,000 DTV NOW 
subs were 
added in the first quarter, giving us nearly 1.5 million customers 
in service.
 
This over
-
the
-
top video growth has helped us manage the industry
-
wide 
transition of linear TV subscribers to over
-
the
-
top services. Looking at total 
video subs, we 
actually have more subscribers today than we did two years 
ago because of the success of DIRECTV NOW. This is especially important at 
a time when the industry is seeing increasing pressure from customers 
cutting the cord.
 
Transitions such as this are never
 
easy, but we have shown that we're able 
to do this time and time again, whether it'd be with our voice or broadband 
or wireless services. We don't expect video to be any different. We do expect 
revenue and margin pressure as we manage through this, especi
ally this 
year, but we're excited about DIRECTV NOW's product improvement and our 
new user interface that we're beta testing right now and expect to roll out 
soon. This has cloud
-
based DVR capabilities and supports an additional video 
stream per account. L
ater this year, we expect a more robust VOD 
experience and new pay
-
per
-
view options to be released.
 
These new services will add new revenue streams and help counter some of 
the revenue and margin pressure we are dealing with. The over
-
the
-
top 
model also is
 
low touch, with significantly lower subscriber acquisition cost 
and less capital investment.
 
As we manage the over
-
the
-
top transition, we are completing our broadband 
transition from DSL to IP broadband. About 800,000 of our residential 
broadband customer
s are still on legacy DSL. That compares very favorably 
to about 4.5 million legacy DSL customers just four years ago, so we are 
managing through this transition. This has helped drive growing broadband 
momentum for us. We had 154,000 high
-
speed broadband 
net adds in the 
quarter and 82,000 total broadband net adds.
 
Our fiber build now passes more than 8 million customer locations, nearly all 
consumer, and you see its impact on our broadband numbers. Customer 
response has been terrific. In areas where they h
ave marketed fiber for the 
last two years, our penetration rate is nearly 50%. That's quite a bit higher 
than in our non
-
fiber markets and leaves us a lot of room to run over the 
next couple years.
 
Now let's look at Business Solutions results on slide 6. A
s a reminder, 
wireless subscribers and specifically individual wireless subscribers who buy 
off a company plan have been moved from Business Solutions to Consumer 
Mobility. Historical financials have been recast to reflect that change. 
Business Solutions r
evenues were down slightly, as gains in wireless and 
strategic business services helped offset declines in legacy services.
 
Wireless revenues were up nearly 4%. Equipment revenues were up with 
increased sales, while service revenues were essentially flat. 
Wireline 
revenues were down about 3% year over year, an improvement over recent 
quarters and similar to what we saw in the fourth quarter. This improving 
trend in wireline is encouraging, and this comes before any expected bump 
from business activity that 
we might see with tax reform.
 
Another positive is the significant improvement in business wireline margins, 
where EBITDA grew year over year and margins were up 190 basis points on 
a comparative basis. The team continues to do a great job in driving cost 
m
anagement initiatives.
 
We're also beginning to see operating expense savings from our move to a 
virtualized software
-
defined network. More than 55% of our network 
functions were virtualized at the end of 2017, and we expect to have 65% 
virtualized by the e
nd of this year, well on our way to meet or exceed our 
goal of 75% virtualized by 2020.
 
Our international business also turned in another strong quarter, thanks to 
solid revenue gains in Mexico. These results are at the bottom of slide 6. 
Revenues were up 
more than 7%. EBITDA was up significantly, thanks to 
strength in Latin America and improvements in Mexico. Subscriber growth 
continues to be strong in Mexico. We added more than 500,000 new 
subscribers in the quarter and more than 3 million in the past yea
r and now 
have 15.6 million customers in total.
 
Reported service revenues were down slightly due to our first quarter 
decision to shut down a wholesale business that we inherited from Nextel. 
Without that roughly $90 million reduction in revenues, reported
 
service 
revenues were up year over year. And our Latin America satellite operations 
continue to be profitable and generate positive free cash flow.
 
Over the last few quarters, we explored the possibility of issuing an IPO for 
our DIRECTV Latin America vid
eo properties, but ended up withdrawing our 
offer. We just didn't believe it was the right time to transact. Current market 
conditions obviously played a role, and trade, interest rates, market volatility 
and foreign exchange all played their part.
 
DIRECTV
 
Latin America has been a steady performer for us, contributing 
both profitability and free cash flow. We'll continue to look for ways to 
unlock the value of those properties for investors while increasing our 
optionality.
 
Now, I'd like to provide you upda
tes on our Time Warner acquisition and our 
goal to build the world's premier gigabit network. Those details are on slide 
7. I'm not sure I need to update anyone on the status of our bid to merge 
with Time Warner, but here's the latest.
 
Both sides are wrapp
ing up their cases and are now preparing for closing 
arguments on April 30. After that, we'll wait for the court's ruling. Based on 
the court's determination, we stand ready to close. Funding is in place, even 
after we settle the special mandatory redempti
on bonds. There's not much 
more we can add at this point.
 
I'd also like to update you on our ongoing efforts to improve our networks. 
FirstNet continues its strong start. We launched the first and only nationwide 
FirstNet dedicated network core last month.
 
This network core acts like the 
brains and nervous system of FirstNet and is on physically separate 
hardware. Only FirstNet traffic will move through this core. This will serve as 
a springboard for ongoing innovation and advanced functionality, delivering
 
value
-
added capabilities and benefits that commercial cores can't match. 
This includes always
-
on access to priority and ruthless pre
-
emption.
 
The FirstNet network also is open for FirstNet
-
ready and FirstNet
-
capable 
devices. These devices support all AT&T
 
commercial LTE bands and the 
FirstNet Band 14 and meet band priority selection technical requirements. So 
far, nearly 650 agencies across 48 states and territories are already 
subscribing to FirstNet services. We see this as a real growth opportunity.
 
We'
ve also started the heavy lifting of putting Band 14 on our towers. Over 
the next 5 years, we'll be putting Band 14 on tens of thousands of new and 
existing sites nationwide. We plan to touch about a third of our cell sites this 
year alone. Our new Crown C
astle agreement will help us speed this process. 
The agreement simplifies and expands our long
-
term leasing deal for 
wireless network infrastructure. This will give us more flexibility as we 
deploy FirstNet as well as 5G technologies.
 
We're working hard to
 
build something great for first responders. With the 
introduction of the FirstNet core, first responders finally have the network 
that they have been asking for and that they deserve.
 
In addition to our efforts with FirstNet, 5G and 5G Evolution work cont
inues 
its accelerated development in several different areas that will pave the way 
to the next generation of higher speeds and quality for customers. 5G 
Evolution is made up of carrier aggregation, 4X4 MIMO and 256
-
QAM 
technologies, along with LTE
-
Local A
ssist Access (sic) [LTE
-
Licence Assisted 
Access] or LTE
-
LAA. These are building blocks towards the transition to 5G 
and will deliver speeds substantially faster than LTE. 5G Evolution has now 
expanded to 141 markets, and we expect to reach more than 500 ma
rkets 
by the end of the year.
 
Our fixed 5G trials also are providing valuable real
-
world millimeter
-
wave 
spectrum experiences both to businesses and residential customers. We're 
seeing gigabit
-
plus speeds under line
-
of
-
sight conditions to distances up to 
9
00 feet and with extremely low latency rates, some as low as 9 
milliseconds. These trials as shown in millimeter
-
wave is able to penetrate 
foliage, glass and even walls better than anticipated with no discernible 
signal performance impacts due to rain, sno
w or other weather issues.
 
Granted, these are early results in trial conditions, but we are excited about 
what we have seen so far. The backbone for 5G or any wireless network is 
fiber and our fiber network is extensive and growing.
 
We're on track to surpa
ss our commitment as part of the DIRECTV deal to 
build fiber to 12.5 million customer locations. We now reached more than 8 
million locations with fiber and plan to hit 10 million by the end of this year. 
This is in addition to the 8 million business locat
ions that we pass today 
within 1,000 feet with fiber. These 16 million locations and the more than 1 
million route miles of fiber in our overall network are the backbone of our 
network and our move to 5G.
 
With FirstNet 5G and fiber build, our network devel
opment has never moved 
at a faster pace. We're excited about the progress we're making and even 
more excited about where our network will be in a very short time.
 
That's it for my presentation. Mike, I'll turn it back over to you for Q&A.
 
Michael J. Viola

AT&T, Inc.
 
Okay. Thanks. Justin, we're ready to take questions.
 
Question
-
and
-
Answer Session
 
Operator
 
Certainly. Thank you. First, we have the line of John Hodulik of UBS. Your 
line is open.
 
John C. Hodulik 
-
 
UBS Securities LLC
 
Okay. Thanks, guys. 
Maybe first starting on Entertainment Group really on 
slide 5, John, I just want to make sure I'm reading this correctly in terms of 
the exhibit you put here. That everything left of that vertical line is historical 
accounting method. And if that's true th
e way I'm reading it, can you just 
confirm that? Yeah.
 
John J. Stephens 
-
 
AT&T, Inc.
 
Yeah. So the historical accounting method is effectively publishing first 
quarter 2018 results under the old rules, so you've got comparability with 
last year's first quar
ter.
 
John C. Hodulik 
-
 
UBS Securities LLC
 
Okay. And I guess, just doing that, it would seem that the Entertainment 
EBITDA is down in the range of about 19%, if you could confirm that, and 
then on an apples
-
to
-
apples basis.
 
And then, if so, can you just tal
k about what's driving that pressure? You 
talked about DIRECTV satellite subs declining and some of the expenditures 
you're going through to stand up DIRECTV NOW and the marketing and 
maybe then move to the new platform. How should we expect those drivers 
to evolve over the course of the year? The satellite losses are like they're 
picking up on a year
-
over
-
year basis. Should we expect that to continue and 
put further pressure, I guess, on those margins from that new 22.8% level?
 
John J. Stephens 
-
 
AT&T, Inc
.
 
Yes. So a couple of things, John. First of all, I think on a year
-
over
-
year 
basis, our linear video losses are actually less. As you can see on the chart 
in the middle there, they're actually going down, so that's improving. We've 
seen some improvement i
n our churn rate. And as for (24:21)
 
John C. Hodulik 
-
 
UBS Securities LLC
 
I was just looking at the 

 
I was thinking of the satellite
-
over
-
satellite 
number. Like the 

 
I think it was 188,000 versus I think zero you did a year 
ago. I guess, the outlook is 

 
I guess, your traditional's got a little better, 
but how do you see the satellite stuff evolving over the next 12 months?
 
John J. Stephens 
-
 
AT&T, Inc.
 
I think we're going to continue to see challenges in the satellite in the linear 
pay
-
TV model as we've 
talked about. We'll continue to see real opportunities 
to shift to the over
-
the
-
top and continue to grow DTV NOW. And then, what 
we will see is, as we come out with our new platform along that's in beta 
and then, quite frankly, some updates that we would h
ope to have by the 
end of this year, where you'll start seeing things like cloud DVR revenues, 
pay
-
per
-
view revenues, both sports and movies, some of the opportunities 
for additional streams and then eventually, revenues for advertising and 
data insights. 
We'll see a replacement of the margins and a growth in those 
margins on an extremely low capital expenditure basis. So we'll transition 
through that. That's what our expectations on that. Am I answering your 
question, John? That's what I'm trying to do.
 
Jo
hn C. Hodulik 
-
 
UBS Securities LLC
 
Yes.
 
John J. Stephens 
-
 
AT&T, Inc.
 
That's the process we're going through. It'll be challenging. It's hard work. 
It'll take us some time, not expect it to be completed this year. But we are 
optimistic about total video co
unts growing over 100,000 and the significant 
year
-
over
-
year improvement in total video, almost 300,000 improvement.
 
John C. Hodulik 
-
 
UBS Securities LLC
 
All right. I guess, John, what I'm trying to get at is the margin trajectory 
from here on new accounti
ng methodology, 22.8%. Should we expect a 
similar trajectory from this new level as we look out to the year? Or would 
you expect it to stabilize as we move through the year, just given all the 
puts and takes?
 
John J. Stephens 
-
 
AT&T, Inc.
 
Yes. I think we'l
l see some pressure throughout the year, but starting to 
stabilize at the end of the year.
 
John C. Hodulik 
-
 
UBS Securities LLC
 
Okay, great. Thanks.
 
John J. Stephens 
-
 
AT&T, Inc.
 
I do believe we'll see some ongoing pressure through the year.

John J. Stephens

AT&T, Inc.
 
Thanks, John.
 
Michael J. Viola 
-
 
AT&T, Inc.
 
Take our next question, Justin.
 
Operator
 
Sure. We have the line of Amir Rozwadowski of Barclays. Your line is open.
 
Amir Rozwadowski 
-
 
Barclays 
Capital, Inc.
 
Thank you very much. And afternoon, John and Mike.
 
John J. Stephens 
-
 
AT&T, Inc.
 
Hi, Amir.
 
Amir Rozwadowski 
-
 
Barclays Capital, Inc.
 
Hi. Wanted to touch base on the Mobility segment. If we think about the 
competitive landscape and your approa
ch to the competitive landscape at 
this point, how should we think about the trade
-
off of subscriber acquisition 
versus margins? To John's prior question, if we look at it on a like
-
for
-
like 
basis for Mobility, we did see some pressure on a year
-
over
-
year 
basis 
against the historical margin structure. And just trying to think about the 
prospects for improving that going forward or how we should think about the 
puts and takes there.
 
John J. Stephens 
-
 
AT&T, Inc.
 
Yes, Amir, it's a good question. What we're th
inking about is we're making 
the investments in the customer base from, if you will, initial basis. So 
things like BOGOs or offers on equipment. Getting that and getting the 
customers in and then having that ability to retain them for what is now 120 
month
s as opposed to moving towards a recruiting tool that would be based 
on service revenues that would occur every month. So we're taking that 
investment on an upfront basis where we can identify it, taking that pressure 
through margin certainly, but then kno
wing that we have this improving 
churn and this reliability and the ability then to add other services, whether 
it be broadband, whether it be video, whether it be wireless.
 
That's how we're viewing it. So we've got kind of an ability to turn on and off 
ou
r investment opportunity and our customer growth. We've, so to speak, 
had it turned on in fourth quarter last year and then first quarter this year, 
but I think you've seen that over 700,000 smartphone improvement in the 
last two quarters over the prior ye
ar's two quarters.
 
So if this 

 
take responsibility for that investment today and get it over with 
and then get the benefits not only over the 10 years we own the 

 
that the 
customer stays with us, but quite frankly, start getting the benefits from it in 
t
he very next quarter or the very next month as you have that investment 
behind you. That's how we're thinking about it and that's how we go about 
it.
 
I will tell you, we're trying different data
-
informed offers and we're 
exchanging them when we see things 
work or not work appropriately, and 
we'll continue to do that. But the best we can, we've focused on these 
investments to the customer base that revolve around getting everything 
upfront, knowing what the total cost is going to be and then moving forward.
 
From a competitive environment, we've seen some moderating of the 
competitive environment over the last few months. There continues to be 
some changes in that and some offers that we see that we're never sure if 
they are temporary or permanent, but overall
, we had seen some 
moderation in the environment. And we have, as you can see, performed 
really pretty well with our really, really low postpaid churn growth in prepaid 
and really, really improved growth in the postpaid phone trends.
 
Amir Rozwadowski 
-
 
Bar
clays Capital, Inc.
 
That's very helpful, John. And then, to your point on churn, we continue to 
see a decline on a year
-
over
-
year basis. What is your expectation through 
the course of the year? As you mentioned, we are seeing some changes in 
the competitiv
e landscape. Is the expectation that you're able to continue to 
drive churn lower through the course of the year?
 
John J. Stephens 
-
 
AT&T, Inc.
 
We haven't given specific guidance to churn, but let me say this. We're 
striving to continue to improve churn on
 
a year
-
over
-
year basis. Our 
strategy though really get to what we've seen is when we're able to bundle it 
with another service, a broadband, a video, wireless, any two or three of 
those together, we see better churn. And so we also have that and that's a 
differentiating viewpoint or differentiating capability that we have uniquely 
that others don't. And so when we can do that, we do have some optimism 
about the ability not only to maintain these great churn levels but even see 
some further improvement like
ly we did this quarter, both sequentially and 
year over year.

Operator
 
Next, we have the line of Simon Flannery of 
Morgan Stanley. Your line is 
open.
 
Simon Flannery

Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
 
Great. Thank you. Good afternoon, John.
 
John J. Stephens 
-
 
AT&T, Inc.
 
Hey, Simon.
 
Simon Flannery

Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
 
On the video programming, I think Randall had 

 
was rep
ortedly made their 
comment around introducing a AT&T watch offering for $15 bundled with 
wireless. Maybe you could just give us a little bit more color about that and 
what timing we have around that?
 
And then coming back to wireless, I noted the upgrade ra
te ticked up to 
4.3% from 3.9%. And I think you'd, in the past, talked about going through 
this period of very low upgrade rate and then it would start to normalize 
over time. So it'd be great just to understand was the 4.3% do you think 
you're getting bac
k to a more normal rate right now and any other color 
around how long people are keeping handsets or renewing them. Thanks.
 
John J. Stephens 
-
 
AT&T, Inc.
 
Okay. Thanks, Simon. Good questions. So, first of all, our upgrade rate and 
quite frankly, both the up
grade and the gross adds number, so we had about 
0.5 million more devices in the first quarter in the upgrade rates and the 
gross adds. So we had a big step up. I think that was due to a lot of 
enthusiasm due to our great offers that the team put out. I th
ink there was 
some pent
-
up demand for new innovative devices. And there may have been 
some change in the fact that devices have gotten another quarter older and 
people wanted to upgrade. But I think the biggest driver was really our 
offers. That's one thin
g.
 
Two, that's caused some pressure with regard to expenses on this 
comparable basis. If you use the comparable basis, then a lot of those 
expenses, particularly with regard to BOGO
-
type offers, may have fallen to 
the bottom line and caused some pressure t
here. So that's a reality. On 
those, we're more than willing to pay that, if you will, make that investment 
to get the long
-
term and, quite frankly, immediate short
-
term additional 
revenues.
 
I don't know that the upgrade rate itself because the age of devi
ces has 
changed that much. I do believe our offers drove the increase in the upgrade 
rate. And the new iPhones may have driven some of it because of the 
limitation and the lateness that they came in, in the fourth quarter, and 
some of our customers using B
OGOs to buy those in the first.
 
So that's how I view that. We'll continue to watch it. I don't believe we're 
going to go back to the historic upgrade rates. I think those are clearly a 
matter of history. And even though the fact that we're talking about 4.
3% 
being a big increase in the upgrade rate gives you the sense of we used to 
talk about normal upgrade rates being a lot higher percentages.
 
With regard to the video programming, let me just say this. As we move 
forward through this year and are able to c
ontinue to innovate, we'll have a 
lot of offers in wireless and broadband and in video. One of those would be 
the one that you're referring to that Randall mentioned, a DTV watch
-
type 
program. We'll leave it to my marketing and sales team to come out with 
the 
details on that. I know they're going to do a lot better job than I could. But I 
think the more important message is that we are willing to innovate. We are 
willing to try some different things to grow the customer base in the right 
way and continue to
 
be able to grow the overall business on a bundled basis.

Next we have Mike McCormack of Guggenheim. Your line is open.
 
Mike McCormack

Guggenheim
 
Securities LLC
 
Hey, guys. Thanks. John, maybe just circling back on the Entertainment 
Group and some of the pressures there, I was just thinking about 

 
I think 
Randall recently was quoted as comparing it to the legacy wireline voice 
business of old. 
And I don't think there's much argument that linear is under 
tremendous pressure. But as you look at that unit or that segment, how 
much of the cost is variable? And as you think about the piece parts within 
that, which parts of it can you reduce with the 
sub counts versus more 
structural fixed costs?
 
And then on the content cost side, which I presume is mostly variable, what 
benefits you guys are getting as far as cost goes or negotiating power goes 
with the programmers for the DIRECTV NOW product?
 
John J.
 
Stephens 
-
 
AT&T, Inc.
 
Again, Mike, good question, a couple things. I guess I'd view the cost of this, 
sorry, on the video entertainment piece of it, on the video side, that content 
is variable with regard to the packages we sell. But I also think there's 
some 
opportunity going forward to be variable with regard to within the packages. 
And I think we've made reference to possibly some offers, possibly getting 
to a point where we have differentiated offers and different packages. We 
have some today continuin
g to do that. So I think there is some, not only 
just based on the volume of customers but also based on what the 
customers want to buy, and we'll continue to look for that.
 
On the high
-
speed Internet side or the broadband side, I would suggest to 
you what
 
we've been building into that 8 million fiber, quite frankly, is 
something we still have a lot of selling to do into. And so that capital has 
been spent and that capacity to serve is already out there. We're just in this 
process of growing this IP broadba
nd base and serving it. So I would 
suggest to you that could be a change or provide new direction, particularly 
as we've gotten through the legacy DSL conversions, which has really been 
absorbing us for the last few years.
 
On the legacy voice and data, tho
se challenges continue to be there. Those 
costs either have been managed out or continue to be managed out. So 
that's how we think about this. But on the video side, the real growth here is 
going to be in these alternative services, whether it's cloud DVRs
, pay
-
per
-
views, data insights, advertising, doing those kinds of things while growing 
broadband at a high
-
speed level and continuing the success we've had.
 
And then as you look at that Entertainment Group, bundling the two of those 
together, but also bund
ling all that with wireless, and so that's the real 
strength in it. That's what makes it worth all the efforts that we're going 
through to transition it. So it's not just one individual piece, but it's the 
collection of those pieces that make this very att
ractive.

Next, we have Brett Feldman of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.

Hi, thanks for taking the 
question. The first one is just a quick housekeeping 
question. The new USF accounting, you noted that it's neutral to operating 
income. Can you clarify? Is it also neutral to EBITDA? I think that might help 
some comparability.
 
And then just coming back to 
the Entertainment segment, the U
-
verse video 
base has been remarkably flat. Particularly, I think you added a customer 

 
a couple customers this quarter. I was hoping maybe you could provide a 
little more insight as to why that is. And is that more directl
y tied to the 
adoption of your residential fiber product than perhaps what we're seeing in 
the satellite trends? Thanks.
 
John J. Stephens 
-
 
AT&T, Inc.
 
A couple of things. One, yes, on EBITDA, the USF revenue and expenses are 
both in the EBITDA calculations
, so they will net to zero. It won't have any 
change to EBITDA. I will tell you, though, Brett, to be clear, in prior years 
that USF revenue was in service revenues. And so it impacted service 
EBITDA margins, not EBITDA itself as a number, but the margins.
 
We 
believe this will give a better picture of what we actually collect from 
customers on our behalf versus what we collect on the government's behalf, 
much like sales taxes, which we had never previously counted as service 
revenues. So you're right. It do
es not affect EBITDA, operating income, or 
EBITDA. The starting point, though, would be, would it have an impact on 
service revenues.
 
Brett Feldman

Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
 
Got it.
 
John J. Stephens

AT&T, Inc.
 
U
-
verse, I think essentially a couple differ
ent things. One, the fiber build and 
the fiber capabilities, the broadband capabilities make that natural bundle 
very good. Two, U
-
verse is in our historic legacy telephone company 
footprint, where we generally have very good wireless capabilities, 
distrib
ution, and have had actually better results in bundling when we have 
all aspects to that. So that's another point.
 
Brett, I would tell you the need to migrate U
-
verse in the satellite to take 
advantage of differentiating content costs is ebbing or is great
ly reduced 
than possibly it was when we first merged with DIRECTV. All of those things 
are part of the process. And quite frankly, customer satisfaction with the U
-
verse product is probably the most important consideration. The people are 
happy. So those a
re all things that contribute to that aspect.
 
Brett Feldman 
-
 
Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
 
Just a quick follow
-
up question. I think you had previously indicated that 
when the DIRECTV satellite product was being sold in your landline region, 
you were seeing bett
er results there because you could bundle with 
broadband. Is that still playing out? Or are you finding that the U
-
verse 
video product is still a much more natural bundle with your broadband offer?
 
John J. Stephens 
-
 
AT&T, Inc.
 
I won't say in comparison to
 
the two U
-
verse compared to satellite, but I will 
tell you that we do believe that we do better and have better churn stats 
when we can bundle video, both satellite and U
-
verse. U
-
verse cannot by 
definition, but satellite, we have better churn results and
 
better customer 
experiences when we can bundle with our IP broadband. And to that point, 
just another reason for the fiber build and the opportunity that it presents as 
well as what FirstNet will provide to, quite frankly, all our satellite customer 
with 
regard to the potential for much better quality wireless service. So all of 
that kind of plays together.

Next, we have the line of Phil Cu
sick of JPMorgan.
 
Philip A. Cusick

JPMorgan Securities LLC
 
Hi guys. Thanks.
 
John J. Stephens 
-
 
AT&T, Inc.
 
Hi, Phil.
 
Philip A. Cusick 
-
 
JPMorgan Securities LLC
 
Hi, John. First, a follow
-
up. You were fairly aggressive in the first quarter in 
the 
wireless compared to previous first quarters, but a lot of these 
promotions fell away in April. Should we think about this as a new level of 
aggression for the full year or are you just changing up the seasonality? And 
then, a bigger question, John, the on
line and addressable advertising 
business seems to be under fire on a lot of fronts and there's some 
increased investor preference lately for online subscription businesses. How 
do the headlines impact your thinking around AT&T strategy of accruing 
content
 
and the OTT transition and the trade you seem to be making of 
giving up subscription revenue to drive subscribers in an effort to build the 
targeted advertising opportunity? Thanks.
 
John J. Stephens 
-
 
AT&T, Inc.
 
So, Phil, with regard to aggressiveness, I 
would suggest you we have the 
capabilities to be aggressive in the first quarter. We did that. We tried 
different things. As you can tell, we did that in the fourth quarter, too. As 
you pointed out, we changed them as we've gone through to make sure 
what w
e were doing was working and was getting the results, not only just 
results but the results we wanted. And we're continuing to focus on data
-
informed decisions in that light.
 
What I'd suggest you is we should continue to see us something like the 
three off
ers that we've, I guess, recently put out in the marketplace. In New 
York, where we're using video as an opportunity to attract customers; in 
Chicago, where we're using our capabilities with regard to broadband to 
attract customers; or in Los Angeles, wher
e we're using wireless. We're 
trying to be market
-
directed, market
-
informed and trying to put offers out 
that'll, if you will, make a difference. You can expect to continue to see us 
change some things, try some things. We might do a BOGO and then we 
might
 
do a second one is a 50% fee as opposed to a full BOGO. I think we 
recently did that with wireless offering.
 
So you'll see us make changes on a regular basis. We're trying to, if you will, 
make sure we're willing to invest this opportunity in the customer
 
base to 
grow the business and the opportunities for the long
-
term. I don't want to 
suggest that our, if you will, investment levels will continue to be at the 
same level they were in the first quarter. We'll go through that process as 
we go through the ye
ar and make the right decisions for the short
-
term and 
the long
-
term for the business. But I do expect we'll continue to look at 
things on a regular basis as we've been doing even here in April.
 
With regard to 

 
the recent issues with regard to, I'll call 
it, customer datas 
and customer, if you will, rights with regard to that data, we continue to 
respect our customers. We've been the guys that have been in the business 
of, if you will, simply put unlisted numbers for 100 years. We understand the 
customers'
 
data and privacy and how to deal with that. We're the ones who 
have pushed for a consumer Bill of Rights and pushed that legislative earlier 
this year, long before this became a headline story of the recent month. So 
we continue to believe, and, if you wi
ll, respecting your customers' privacy 
and treating them the right way will provide the long
-
term results.
 
With that being said, we continue to believe in the processes and practices 
we have in place as being appropriate. And we continue to believe that th
ere 
is a space for us as a trusted adviser and a trusted player in the data 
insights and data privacy space for our customers and for the advertisers 
who are clearly looking for a trusted partner in that space.

Next, we have the line of David Barden of Bank of America. Your line is 
open.
 
David Barden 
-
 
Bank of America Merrill Lynch
 
Hey, John. Thanks for taking the questions.
 
John J. Stephens 
-
 
AT&T, In
c.
 
Sure.
 
David Barden 
-
 
Bank of America Merrill Lynch
 
So first question would be, if you could kind of maybe elaborate a little bit 
more on where we are kind of on the FirstNet go
-
to
-
market process? Have 
you stood up a sales force, if you have, what exactl
y are they selling and to 
who? And when can we think about the market share opportunity that you 
have there starting to feather into your kind of gross add market share and 
net add share in the market?
 
And then the second is, a year ago, first quarter, the
 
postpaid phone net add 
market was a couple hundred thousand phones. If we look at what you and 
Verizon and Comcast have done and make a few educated guesses about T
-
Mobile and Sprint, year over year, that's going to be 3x to 4x this quarter. 
And if I look
 
at last quarter, it was actually up 50% year over year. What do 
you think is kind of driving this phenomenon where the postpaid phone net 
add market just seems kind of growing out of thin air? Is it the economy? Is 
it prepaid to postpaid migration? Is it 
BYOD? I'd love your thought 

 
your 
theories here to kind of explain it. And then, whether we can maybe assume 
it's going to continue for the rest of the year or whether this is kind of 
transitory effect? Thanks.
 
John J. Stephens 
-
 
AT&T, Inc.
 
So I think it 
depends, David. I don't doubt. Let me say it this way. For us, 
we're both growing that improved postpaid phone, improved 300,000, while 
we still had almost 200,000 

 
I think it was about 192,000, but almost 
200,000 prepaid net adds. So, for us, we're seein
g continued good 

 
really 
good performance in prepaid, but really good performance in the 
smartphone. So we're seeing a total growth in those phones. That's what 
we're seeing. I think others are seeing some conversion from prepaid to 
postpaid. I wouldn't 

 
that may be at the customers' decision just based on 
pricing opportunities or, if you will, plans that are out there.
 
But we are seeing continued growth in both for us. I do understand your 
question. And we'll wait and see about what happens with the tota
l 
marketplace. I don't have a total view of that marketplace because I don't 
think anybody does because some of the company haven't announced and 
so forth.
 
But in our, if you will, piece of the marketplace, you saw us now two 
quarters in a row over the las
t two quarters a 700,000 improvement in 
postpaid smartphones and continuing good performance, solid performance 
in prepaid. So we believe that we're doing very well in the share part of the 
game.
 
I would also tell you there's other aspects of things in the
 
postpaid net adds, 
as you all know, whether tablets are going, whether and how people count 
watches and other devices. I'll leave that to you all to decide and to 
evaluate. But on the phones, we feel pretty good about getting good value 
for the investment
 
plans we put out there and a great opportunity to 
generate value, short
-
term, the month after, with regard to the revenues 
these guys are going to generate and over the long
-
term because of our 
churn being so low.
 
With regard to FirstNet, 
FirstNet's something that we're really excited about. 
We're very excited about getting that, the only exclusive authorized FirstNet 
core up and running last month. We really do believe that that's critical to be 
able to provide the services and to provide 
that quality of service that those 
first responders deserve and need.
 
We had set up a FirstNet team last year. An individual by the name of Chris 
Sambar runs that for us. We added marketing and staff and sales people. 
We've spent money, if you will, and ti
me over the 

 
at least over the last 
nine months, if not longer, almost a year, I guess, getting to know our 
potential clients, getting into the industry, making a bigger effort to be a 
known player.
 
With regard to that, as I mentioned earlier, we've actua
lly had about 600 or 
so, if you will, departments sign up with us. And those 600 departments 
came from over 48 states because they can use 

 
we can provide the 
FirstNet quality services on our existing LTE network once we've established 
this core, which we
 
did last month. So they can get relentless or ruthless 
pre
-
emption, and they can get priority services. And that can all work now. 
We can provide that.
 
Now, some of those folks that we signed up could have been our customers 
before they just want to migra
te to FirstNet and that'll be part of the 
process. But quite frankly, I think we've been very pleased about the 
reception we've been given to at least talk to people that previously weren't 
our customers.
 
On a per person basis, if you will, some of your fi
rst line, first responder, 
you're thinking about two or three or potentially four connected points, 
whether it be a body camera, whether it be a phone, whether it be a tablet 
for their car, whether it would be some drone or some other device they'd 
use. Bu
t you also look at it from the ability to contact with the smart cities, 
their employer, so to speak, and whether we can sell other services there. 
We're also looking for the in
-
house personnel, the dispatch people that work 
at the police station or other 
personnel whether we can have an opportunity 
to sell there. And of course, there's always the friends and family approach.
 
So we're very pleased. First of all, we've got a FirstNet team already set up. 
They're very active. They've already gotten a number o
f contracts done in 
over 40 states. And we continue to be very excited about it. We will get a 
significant amount of the Band 14 up this year, and we are expecting to, at a 
minimum, meet and hopefully exceed all the milestone requirements that 
FirstNet has
 
given us. So if I sound pretty positive about it, I am.

Macquarie C
apital (
USA

Thank you. Maybe if you could talk a little bit more about the advertising 
opportunity and size up the near
-
term market opportunity for us. How 
quickly do you think you can wrap this up
 
and then maybe some growth 
trends that we should be looking at for this year and next? And then just 
very quickly on the 5G fixed wireless trials, how big is the residential 
broadband marketing opportunity, as we think about 2019 and beyond? 
Thanks.
 
John 
J. Stephens

AT&T, Inc.
 
So on the advertising, let me start. I'd point out, this quarter we were up 
9% in revenues. We have a base of about $350 million a quarter, in that 
range. I don't have the specific number at my fingertips here. And we grew 
at about
 
9%. So the team is actually proving that this works already with 
our existing, if you will, inventory of ads that we get as the distributor from 
the content folks.
 
So we're making it work. We're getting higher CPMs and getting higher 
revenue streams and m
aking it more effective. We feel really good about 
that. As we go through this year, we hope to add a lot more inventory from 
underneath our umbrella of ownership companies to that, and we'd like to 
develop that.
 
If you think about the overall digital mark
et, I don't know the exact 
numbers, but I think last year, the overall digital advertising market in the 
U.S. was north of $60 billion, and some estimates will get it in the $80 billion 
range. We're not what I would call in that piece a significant player.
 
We 
believe that we can be. We have the capabilities to be. And we've made the 
investments not only in the personnel and the team that Brian Lesser has 
established, but we're also making investments in data capabilities and our 
big data engines inside our 
company today. So we feel really good about 
that opportunity.
 
If you think about linear TV and the opportunity to grow that revenue 
stream, if you think about digital and the opportunity to grow that, and 
anything about the opportunity to take all of our d
igital insights and data 
insights and help advertisers make sure their advertising is working 
effectively and efficiently, we believe that there's a real opportunity there. 
So all of that being done within the appropriate rules and data protection 
activiti
es. So we feel really good about that.
 
With regard to the fixed 5G wireless, if you will, our tests have shown it can 
be done. We can do it. The opportunity there is something that we have to 
prove out. We're not as excited about the business case. It's no
t as 
compelling yet for us as it may be for some. The reason we don't see that, if 
you will. The question is to get that fixed wireless through to residential, you 
still have to have backhaul from where the 

 
the 1,000 feet away, the 1,500 
feet away, and y
ou still have to have that backhaul infrastructure. So that 
could be depending upon your ability to successfully pick who's going to buy 
and how much we're going to need is going to be a very tricky business 
case.
 
For us, with this extensive fiber network,
 
we will be able to have that 
backhaul. With this extensive FirstNet network, we'll be able to have that 
backhaul. But quite frankly, if we've got FirstNet and we've got fiber there, it 
may be just as effective and maybe even a better quality product to gi
ve 
those customers fiber
-
to
-
the
-
home.
 
So we're continuing to work at it. I just don't want to hold it out as 

 
right 
now, we are more excited, as you can tell, from things I've made about our 
FirstNet opportunity, about the fiber capabilities that we're bu
ilding and 
selling into that, and quite frankly, about the overall 5G Evolution and 5G 
capabilities in our overall mobility network serving much of the mobile 
broadband demands that are out there or requirements that are out there.

Operator
 
Certainly. Last, we have the line of 
Frank Louthan of Raymond James. Your 
line is open.
 
Frank Garreth Louthan 
-
 
Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
 
Great, thank you. Give us a little bit more color on maybe the free cash flow 
aspects in your Entertainment business as you're switching more to the
 
DIRECTV NOW product. That would be great. And then on 5G, some of the 
devices being available late 2018, can you give us a little bit more color on 
exactly what devices you're waiting for before the launch? Thanks.
 
John J. Stephens 
-
 
AT&T, Inc.
 
Okay. With
 
regard to the 5G, let me make this point. On the 5G Evolution, 
those devices are not only available now, many of our customers already 
have them. And so the speeds we get with 5G Evolution by putting up all our 
spectrum with regard to FirstNet, using 4
-
wa
y carrier aggregation, which 
allows us to band the spectrum that we put up now all together, and having 
4
-
way MIMO, which is, if you will, an efficient and quick way to let customers 
access the network and exit the network, those speeds are working today. 
And in our test in San Francisco, we got 750
-
meg speeds on our network. 
On a full network, that might be 10% to 20% of that level. But we believe 
we can get 100
-
meg speeds on our 5G Evolution network with handsets that 
are already out there today in people
's hands, and they're coming through 
the rest of the handset manufacturer base over time.
 
So I just want to point that out. That's one of the reasons why the FirstNet 
with the technology developments of carrier agg and 4
-
way MIMO and 256
-
QAM and all these 
other things combined as well as the new spectrum, Band 
14, gives us real excitement about the ability to serve customers really, 
really well.
 
On the 5G, I think by the end of this year, we'll have 5G networks up. The 
device that will be out will probably 
be pucks and the ability to connect to a 
puck. And then we'd expect to see what I'll call handset devices or tablets or 
those types of what I would 

 
I think many of us would normally think of as 
devices. Those would be out in 2019. And as I think Simon re
ferenced earlier 
in the call, we've got, if you will, upgrade cycles that are sub
-
5% a quarter. 
So there may be some time to getting those 5G handsets up and running, so 
to speak. So we'll see how that goes, whether that changes the upgrade 
cycles or not. 
But all of that for us points to this 5G Evolution can be a really 
beneficial thing for us because that's available in many, many handsets 
today.
 
On the free cash flow side, if you will, Frank, I guess I'll say it this way. 
Moving to the DTV NOW platform o
r moving to a thin client platform 
eventually for the home is really going to change the free cash flow aspects 
because of the upfront of truck roll cost, the upfront, if you will, climb the 
roof costs, all of that can change as well as some of the things 
with regard 
to billing and administrative costs, the fact that it's an automatic bill or it's a 
credit card bill, all of those things will change.
 
But that's one of the attractiveness is about the DTV NOW is the economics 
about not having that upfront inve
stment. That will turn into savings from an 
upfront investment from a cash flow perspective. So that's why this thing we 
strongly believe it will work long term.
 
With regard to our first quarter free cash flow 

 
and we want to make one 
point. First of all,
 
first quarter is always low for us because of bonuses and 
other things. We had a huge handset sales in the first 

 
in the fourth quarter 
and the first quarter. 500,000 up year over year in the first quarter. 700,000 
up year over year in the fourth quarter
. And many of those sales in the 
fourth quarter, we actually paid for the phones this quarter because they 
were late in the quarter last year when they were sold.
 
So we had a lot of cash flow pressure from handsets that will reverse itself 
that'll wash its
elf out. I just want to point that out. So we feel good about 
our free cash flow and keeping it in that $21 billion range is the guidance 
we've given as well as keeping all of our guidance intact.

With that, I want to thank everybody for being on the call today. We're off to 
a fast start in 2018, both in growing our customer base and in building the 
w
orld's premier gigabit network. We continue to add new subscribers in 
wireless, broadband and video, and we are on track to turn wireless service 
revenues towards growth this year.
 
The FirstNet build is kicking in the gear, and we launched the nationwide 
F
irstNet dedicated network core last month. We're working hard to build 
something great for first responders and early response from our sales 
activity has been very positive. We're also moving full speed on our 5G 
evolution and expect to be the first U.S. 
carrier to introduce Mobile 5G later 
this year.
 
Behind all of this is our expanding fiber network, which is the backbone for 
all our networks, both wireless and wired. And of course, we optimistically 
await conclusion of our Time Warner court case as a cou
rt's decision. One 
last thought, as you make your way home tonight, please remember, no 
text is worth a life. It can wait. Please be safe. Thanks again for being on the 
call and as always, thank you for your interest in AT&T. Have a good 
evening.

Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the AT&T 
fourth quarter 2016 Earnings Results Call. At this time, all participants are in 
a listen
-
only mode. Later, we will conduct a question
-
and
-
answer session, 
instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions]
 
I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Michael Viola, 
Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
 
Michael Viola
 
Okay. Well, thank you, Cathy, and good 
afternoon, everyone. Welcome to 
the fourth quarter conference call. Good to have everybody with us. Joining 
me on the call today is Randall Stephenson, AT&T's Chairman and CEO; and 
John Stephens, AT&T's Chief Financial Officer. John's going to cover our 
op
erational results along with a 2017 outlook and Randall will follow that 
with an overall business update and then will follow that with Q&A.
 
As always, our earnings material is available on the Investor Relations page 
of AT&T website, and that includes our
 
newly redesigned investor briefing 

att.com/investor.relations.
 
I need to call your attention to the Safe Harbor statement on page three, 
which says that some of our comments today may be forward
-
lo
oking, 
subject to risks and uncertainties. Results may differ materially, and 
additional information is available in AT&T and Time Warner's SEC filings and 
on the Investor Relations page of each Company's respective websites.
 
We are also in the quiet perio
d for the FCC Spectrum Auction, so we can't 
address any questions about spectrum today. And I will also turn your 
attention to page four, which is information regarding the SEC filings 
specifically the recently filed form S
-
4. Again that's on slide on four
.
 
And now, I'll turn the call over to AT&T's CFO, John Stephens.
 
John Stephens
 
Thanks, Mike, and hello everyone, and thanks for being on the call today. 
Before, I turn over to Randall for a strategic view of our Company, I'd like to 
provide a brief overvie
w of our fourth quarter and full year operational 
results that are on slide five.
 
Our teams executed very well in 2016. We grew revenues and on adjusted 
basis, we expanded operating margins and increased earnings as we had 
projected. And free cash flow cam
e in at the high end of expectations, even 
with strong capital investment. On top of that, we made significant progress 
with our integration of DIRECTV, meeting our cost synergy targets and 
launching our first over
-
the
-
top video service nationwide.
 
For the
 
fourth quarter, consolidated revenues were down slightly due to 
fewer upgrade sales and some pressure on our legacy services. But 
customer gains and growth in video and IT
-
based services mostly offset 
these declines. At the same time, we continued to see 
adjusted consolidated 
margin expansion, even as we invested in customer growth opportunities in 
mobility, video and Mexico.
 
For the fourth quarter, our adjusted EPS was $0.66 or up nearly 5%. This 
includes adjustments for amortization, our annual mark
-
to
-
m
arket pension 
plan adjustment, merger, integration related items and a one
-
time tax gain 
that was excluded.
 
During the quarter we aligned our depreciation schedules with our updated 
business cases and engineering studies for certain of our network assets; 
this lowered depreciation expense on a sequential and year
-
over
-
year basis. 
This impact was offset by investments in strong wireless customer growth, in 
both U.S. and Mexico, and the development, launch and promotion of 
DIRECTV NOW. And while we expect tho
se depreciation benefits to continue 
in 2017, they are expected to be offset by other non
-
cash items such as 
reductions in capitalized interest, benefit plan expense and taxes.
 
Earnings in the fourth quarter were impacted by revenue pressure in our 
legacy 
wireline services as a result of lack of fixed business investment as 
well as competition small business.
 
Moving to cash flows, we had more than $39 billion in cash from operations 

ntial 
value to shareholders through dividends, while also investing more in capital 
than we ever had before. Capital investment was 22.9 billion for the year 
that includes taking advantage of pricing and financing terms from our 
vendors that made good busi
ness sense for us, particularly with bonus 
depreciations still intact.
 
Our investments are growth focused. For example, we're ahead of plan with 
our fiber to the home build. Today, we market nearly 4 million consumer 
customer locations. Free cash flow was 
strong, coming in at $3.7 billion for 
the quarter and nearly $17 billion for the year. That gives us a dividend 
payout ratio of 70% for the full year. Our net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio 
came in at 2.26 times.
 
Let's now take a look at our operations wher
e you see a consistent story of 
investment and the subscriber growth it generated. Those details are on 
slide six.
 

Company is providing supplemental information for its total U.S. 
wireless 
operations. In a traditionally very busy quarter, we had strong subscriber 
growth, lower postpaid churn, and record margins. EBITDA service margin 
was the highest ever for both the full year and the quarter. And we also 
turned in record full year 
operating income margins. With did this even while 
investing in growth of our smartphone subscribers with offers such as 
unlimited wireless with video, and a buy one get one free BOGO offer. This 
helped grow our branded smartphone base by nearly 1.1 millio
n, when you 
include customer upgrades.
 

Postpaid phone churn was a record fourth quarter low of 0.98% and overall 
postpaid churn improved year
-
over
-
year, in part due to increasing
 
number 
of wireless and video bundles, and those numbers include churn pressure 
from our 2G network shutdown with strong sales even with the higher 
margins and 2G shutdown.
 
We added 1.5 million total subscribers with more than a 0.5 million postpaid 
net ad
ds. Branded phone subscribers also continued to grow. We added 
about 340,000 branded phones in the quarter. We did lose postpaid feature 
phones in the quarter. However, if you back out our forced turnover, caused 
by 2G network shutdown, our postpaid phone 
base was essentially flat. The 
2G shutdown impacted net adds or about 22 basis points of pressure to our 
total churn. We see it most in our reseller and connected device numbers. 
But the team executed well and the network shutdown is now complete. It's 
a c
ompetitive market and a busy quarter, but our wireless team turned in 
another solid performance.
 
It was also a big quarter for our entertainment group. The launch of 
DIRECTV NOW got most of the headlines. This robust over
-
the
-
top offering 
started strong, a
dding more than 200,000 paid subscribers in its first 
months. This gave us a solid video sub growth in the quarter. And we're 

careful with our expectations. Customer promotions and la
unch pricing 
helped drive strong growth and still early. We're learning more about the 
subscriber base and the platform while we are working through the expected 
challenges that come with launching a new innovative service of this 
magnitude. Early sub demo
graphics tend to be more urban, younger and 
apartment dwellers than a typical linear customer.
 
Entertainment group revenues grew with games and video and IP services. 
Legacy services are less than 10% of total revenues, but still represent 
about a 250 basi
s
-

to add scale as well. There was a $1.5 billion business in 2016 with revenues 
growing at double digit rates. Fourth quarter margins was down year
-
over
-

rowth opportunities. That 
includes startup and launch costs for DTV NOW and increased promotional 
efforts to new and existing customers, across our entire product set. There 
were additional margin pressures as a customer rate increases were less 
than the c
ontent rate increases. This supports our thesis for acquiring Time 
Warner and strengthening our position in content.
 
In broadband, overall subscribers were relatively stable in the quarter, while 
our fiber buildout continues to be a great story. Our penetr
ation of 
broadband is a full 9 percentage points higher in those markets compared 
with our non
-
fiber footprint. After we launch our 100% fiber network in the 
new market, we're seeing about half of the new broadband customers 
buying speeds of 100 megabits p
er second or higher with 30% of the 
customers taking a gig. And the real kicker is that the vast majority of 
recent sales in those markets are taking multiple services from us. So, as 

opport
unity.
 
Now, let's look at business solutions on slide seven. Our business segment 
continues to perform well even as it feels the impact of a lagging economy 
and the lack of business fixed investment. Wireless growth was solid but not 
enough to overcome the
 
pressures of legacy services decline. The drop off in 
business wireline spending was felt in all our business segments. Enterprise 
is maintaining a leading share position in the tough environment but 
comparisons were impacted by the second quarter 2016 sa
le of some of our 
hosting operations.
 
Small business is seeing the impact of competition. Strategic business 

was up $230 million or 8.3% year
-
over
-
year. These services now represe
nt 
38% of wireline revenues and an annualized revenue stream of around $12 
billion. Margins expanded as EBITDA grew by more than $50 million, as 
efficient cost management helped to offset the impact of a slow economy.
 

n our network virtualization and our 
software defined network enabled services. Our virtualization plan is ahead 
of schedule with 34% of our network virtualized at the end of the year and 
net NetBond continues to well
-
received with 19 of the leading cloud 
service 
providers now making it available.
 
Moving to our international operations, Mexico continues to be an 
investment story, while our DIRECTV Latin America operations continues to 
manage profitability in a very difficult environment. Mexico has been a 
remarkable success story. In a little more than a year, we deployed 4G LTE, 
78 million people in more than a 160 markets; rebranded our services and 
stores; and became the fastest growing wireless company in the country. 
Customer growth is strong. We added
 
1.3 million new wireless subscribers in 
the fourth quarter and over 3 million customers for the full year. This strong 
investment obviously pressures margins but as you can see in several parts 

n our Latin 
America video business, revenues grew and operating income increased and 
the business continued to generate positive free cash flow, despite the 
challenged environment.
 

guid

 
Our teams did a good job of hitting the targets we set out a year ago. 
Revenue growth hit our double
-
digit growth projection, thanks to our DTV 
acquisition and gains in IP services video. Adjusted earnings 
came in the 
middle of our mid single
-
digit EPS growth target. Adjusted operating 
margins actually expanded by 60 basis points as efficiencies and cost cutting 
overcame investment pressure in Mexico and other growth
-
related 
expenses.
 
Capital investment was 
at the high end of what we expected. We took 
advantage of vendor offers and bonus depreciation when it made business 
sense. Free cash flow came in at the high end of expectations, and we 
accomplished this even after making $750 million in payments to our 
p
ension and benefit plans this year. This includes $350 million in payments 
into our pension plan, as part of our agreement with the Department of 
Labor from our prior mobility funding. These payments now fulfill our 
obligation under that agreement a full y
ear ahead of schedule. We have also 
voluntarily made another $400 million deposit to our employee medical fund. 
These payments make our benefit plans even stronger; in fact, we do not 
expect any funding this coming year.
 
This strong cash generation allowed
 
us to easily hit our annual dividend 
payout ratio in the 70s. And if you adjust for the voluntary pension and 
benefit payment, that percentage gets to the high 60s. We also did a nice 
job of hitting our operational targets. Already mentioned hitting our 
v
irtualization goal on our fiber build, we also made significant progress with 
our 5G trials including a millimeter wave underway in Austin. And our 
network team accomplished all of this while they had expenses that were 
down year
-
over
-
year.
 
When you look a
t everything we are doing with the combination of 
spectrum, fiber, software and new technologies, you can see why we are 
confident in our ability to lead in connectivity.
 
Now, let's take a look at our outlook for 2017 on slide nine.
 
Our business always has
 
had a lot of moving pieces, but with the new 
administration taking office, there is even more to think about this year. It's 
just too early to call the impact of several issues. Tax reform has been a hot 
button and it makes sense for the company our size 
with the taxes we pay, 
would clearly have an opportunity to benefit from the change in tax rate. 
We're also staring at the potentially better regulatory environment. Positive 
change in both of these areas would help us deliver faster on plans to 
innovate a
nd grow our business.
 
Some are speculating that the economy might grow faster, and there will be 
an uptick in business fixed investment. That would definitely be good for us. 
And we are waiting to hear for the final outcome of the first of that process. 
Yo
u know that we are an approved bidder and we are optimistic about our 

 
We're also in the process of closing our Time Warner transaction. We remain 
confident that the deal will be approved later this yea
r. These are all 
potentially very good things for AT&T, but these items are not included in 
our 2017 guidance. Our outlook is based on what we know today, and here 
is what you can expect from us in 2017.
 
First, we see revenue growth in the low single digit
s. Growth in IP services 
and video is expected to offset competitive pressures, soft business 
investment and declines in legacy services. We expect adjusted earnings 
growth to continue in the mid single
-
digit range. We also expect continued 
consolidated op
erating margin expansion. CapEx is expected in the $22 
billion range, similar to last year. And we expect to see continued free cash 
flow growth with free cash flow in the $18 billion range and continuing our 

o move forward on all the 


expect from us in 2017.
 
With that, I'll turn it over to, Randall for a strategic busines
s update.
 
Randall Stephenson
 
Okay. Thanks, John, appreciated.
 
We have a new President and FCC Chairman, Bill. So, I know everybody is 
talking about tax and the regulatory reform, and you're going to have a lot 
of questions for us about that. But before we 
get to your questions, I do just 
want to take a brief moment and offer some perspective on how AT&T is 
now positioned in converging telecom media and technology space.
 


een getting ready for a world where mobile technology and 
premium video content would intersect. And we've been convinced for a long 
time that this intersection was inevitable. And when it happened, we wanted 
to have the foundation laid to make the interse
ction a very different 
experience for our customers. And that foundation in our mind begins with a 

video. It has to have deep capacity, it has to have broad distribution. And if 
you wou
ld look at slide 11, you can see that this is exactly the foundation we 
built.
 
Our high
-

network that covers nearly 400 million people in the U.S. and Mexico; there 

 
close. We're building out fiber to 12.5 million 
locations. This network is software defined, and that gives us unique 
scalability at the lowest cost per megabyte around. It's a network with an 
elegant path to gigabit speeds and 5G. And in terms of capacit
y, we're really 
in the unique position here. We've been invested $27 billion in spectrum 
over the past five years. And as a result, we have the premier spectrum 
position in the industry, 40 megahertz of fallow spectrum. And as John 
referenced, if we're suc
cessful with our first net bid, we get access to 
another 20 megahertz of prime nationwide spectrum for public safety and 
secondary use.
 
And as you also heard John say early, our 2G network has now been shut 
down. And that spectrum is being reformed for fut
ure use as well. And then, 
if you look at our points of distribution, they are second to none. 147 million 
mobile customers across North America, that includes a leading IoT 
business; we have 46 million pay TV subscribers in the U.S. and Latin 
America; 16 
million broadband subscribers and we have an OTT platform 
DIRECTV NOW that's off to a really fast start.
 

this is a very strong foundation. And so, given that, it seems only logical
 
for 
us to assume an ownership position in the critical application that's going to 


 
And if you look at slide 12, our
 
technology and distribution we think are a 
perfect fit for the best premium content creator and distributor on the 
planet. In the telecom, media and technology space, we're building a global 

 
integrated communications company in the world and DIRECTTV really 
catalyzed that strategy, and you saw us execute on that last year with our 
new TV Everywhere application and data free TV and DIRECTV NOW. And 
that integrated experience helped drive our b
est ever fourth quarter churn 
for our U.S. postpaid mobility business. Now, bringing Warner Brothers, HBO 
and all the Turner networks under the AT&T umbrella is going to allow us to 
expand the strategy beyond just simple connectivity to deep integration of
 
premium content for our customers. As we look ahead, the strategy is 
expanded to create the best entertainment and communications experiences 
in the world, and I am very convinced this foundation has been laid for us to 
deliver exactly that.
 
And so, with 
that, what I want to do is turn over to Mike and be glad to take 
your questions on the quarter or anything you else you would like to talk 
about. So, Mike?

Answer Session
 
Operator
 
[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from John Hodulik with 
UBS. Please go ahead.
 
John Hodulik
 
Randall, you brought up two important topics in your prepared remarks, the 
tax reform and regulator
y changes that we are seeing in Washington. Maybe 
first, from a tax reform standpoint, what's your view on how this unfolds and 
what it could mean, maybe especially related to guidance for AT&T in 2017 
and beyond? And then, obviously, new leadership with t
he FCC with Ajit Pai, 
just initial views on what that can mean for telecom regulation in the U.S.? 
Thanks.
 
Randall Stephenson
 
Okay. Thank you, John. I had the opportunity to meet with what was then 
the President
-
elect couple of weeks ago, and I got to say I was impressed. I 
was meeting with the CEO, it was obvious. And the President had a very 
specific agenda in terms of what he 
thought was critical, and that was tax 
reform and regulatory reform, and we spoke at length about each of those. 
And I would tell you that the man, the President is focused on these. And so, 
laughed with a degree of optimism that this could actually be pul
led off this 
year.
 
Now, what does that look like? We've seen the President's proposal; we've 
seen Paul Ryan's proposal, both of them I think trigger the impact that I 
have been talking about for quite some time. And that is, if we want to get 
off this 1% t
o 2% growth plane, there is nothing that will trigger that like 
tax reform. I mean, everybody knows the numbers. We have the most 

developed world in the United States. And to br
ing that into competitive 
levels, and you pick your number what tax rate you think that is, will have a 

rates move to 20% to 25%, we know what we would do; we would step up 
our i
nvestment levels and there are things we would like to accelerate, if we 
had a more favorable tax environment. So, John, my guess in terms of 
where this lands is probably no better than yours. But, I do think a lower 
corporate tax rate is likely, I think i
t's more than possible, I think it's likely.
 
I think there will be some things that will be done to help pay for that. And 
there is discussion about what there would be denial of deductibility of 
interest cost, for example, but they are also talking about 
immediate 
expensing of capital. So, you have to factor a timing issue or the permanent 
issue. And then, obviously what nobody really has a good handle on is what 
happens in the way of trade, border adjustment tax and so forth, and how 
that plays into this.
 
So, it's really up in the air in terms of what this will look 
like. But, I would tell you, I'm optimistic something would happen. And as 
John pointed out, none of that has been factored into our numbers and the 
guidance that we have given you.
 
If tax refo
rm does happen this year, the biggest payoff to AT&T, more than 
just the tax rates is what happens on the business side. I mean, an extra 
1% growth in GDP over the next couple of years is rather significant for 
AT&T. And if a tax rate cut caused all busine
sses to think about investment 
the way AT&T is thinking about it, and all businesses begin to invest, that 
has nothing but a stimulative effect to our customer base. We have a very 
large enterprise business customer base. So, we think this is nothing but 
p
ositive. In fact, I told some people last week in Europe that back in July, we 
had a Board meeting, and after we concluded our long range plan, the Board 
asked us to lay out for them what a recessionary environment in 2017 would 
look like. Fast forward to 
December, the Board wanted to talk about, what 
an upside scenario in the economy would look like. And nothing happened 
between those two, except an election and a President who is talking about 
corporate tax reform. So, I think this is very significant and
 
very, very 
important.
 
In terms of regulatory, in terms of what to expect, all I can base my 

obviously was not a fan of the Title II regulation that was imposed on the 
industry. He felt li
ke it had gone entirely too far; we obviously tend to agree 
with him on that. We happen to be advocates of net neutrality, just the 
concept of neutrality but placing utility style regulation on our mobility and 
internet businesses. There is no way anybody 
can argue that that is not 
suppressive to investment.
 

some of these issues that are suppressing capital investment. We're also 
optimistic that he would begin to rationalize some of t
he regulatory 
oversight, areas where 
--
 
like on privacy. We have two layers of regulation 

entertainment and content. The ability to have predictability and understand 
who oversees the priv
acy rules and who sets those rules, and so bringing 
some clarity to that, it just will be very, very helpful to clear the underbrush 
of regulation, bring clarity and some level of predictability to the regulatory 
environment. So, we're optimistic in terms 
of what Chairman Pai would bring 
to the industry.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question is from Phil Cusick with JP Morgan. Go ahead, 
please.
 
Phil Cusick
 
Can you talk for me about the success of foreign cross selling, broadband 
and wireless into DIRECTV ho

broadband, the way we would expect it with DIRECTV coming in? And how's 
that been going into wireless as you discount across those businesses; has it 
been more existing customers that are tying things together
 
or are you 
really starting to see a cross
-
selling effect? Thanks, Randall.
 
Randall Stephenson
 

told you, coming into the year, it was going to take time to get the cross
-
selling,
 
just the plumbing and the mechanics in place to be aggressive on 
cross
-
selling. And we are at a place now where the last three quarters we 
have seen multi product sales just continue to escalate. And they are little 
bit behind our plan, but I would tell y
ou, the last two quarters are starting to 
catch up to plan. So, cross
-
selling on each sale is really getting to levels that 

it's really good.
 
Early on, you hit the nail on the head;
 
it has been our existing customers 
that are attaching the services to each other. And so DIRECTV customers, 
who are attaching unlimited wireless with their DIRECTV bundles, but we are 
seeing some migration of wireless through the DIRECTV product sets s we
ll. 
And I think the best place is this is manifesting itself, Phil. We were probably 
not the most promotional in the industry in the fourth quarter. And we set a 
record low churn rate in the fourth quarter. And it's getting to a point where 
we are beginnin
g to be able to attach causing effect to a lot of the integrated 
solutions and the integrated offerings including unlimited data, data free TV 

place and the billing is getting re



 
John Stephens
 

 
the churn characteristics 
and then really strong performance on the mobility side, we attribute some 
of that to this video bundle with the wireless property. We have about 8 
million customers now on that unlimited video bundle, and we believe that 
that's 
providing real cross, if you will, product improvement.
 
Finally, if we look at where we are going with the fiber to the prem on the 4 
million homes we are selling into, the vast majority of those high
-
speed 
broadband sales are taking multiple products with
 
us. So, that continues to 
go well, taking not only the broadband but the video and also the wireless. 
So, that continues to go well.
 
And then lastly, the attach rates that we are having through both, the video 
and the 
--
 
excuse me, the broadband and the v
ideo product continue to 
improve throughout the year. And so, the efforts that Randall talked about 
and training 
--
 
getting the plumbing right and training the call center people 
and training the tax and so forth is paying off. We remain optimistic about i
t; 

going well. And as I say, the strongest point might be the $8 million 
customers who quickly bundled their video and their wireless offering, and 
you see it quietly frankly in the c
hurn results we have. It's really very good.
 
Phil Cusick
 
If I can follow up, how did the sales of paying DIRECTV NOW customers 
lineup to either your wireless or fixed businesses?
 
John Stephens
 
I think what we will you is that we are still going through all
 
that details and 
you got to remember the DIRECTV NOW customer sales are much different 
with regard to the necessity. When you are paying with the credit card 
online, the information you have with regard to physical location and so 
forth is different. But,
 
what we are finding is, as we mentioned, they are 
more urban, they are younger and they are apartment dwellers. And so, 
they are giving us an opportunity, we believe, to penetrate a market 

--
 
where we are not as 
effective 
as we are in some of the other markets. So, we think it's real opportunity. 
So far, it is lining up I think as expected in that urban, that multi
-
dwelling 
unit, that young marketplace and then a marketplace that, if you will, we 
have an opportuni
ty to grow share to get to some of the same levels as we 
have of share in some of the more established markets.

Thank you. Our next question is from David Barden with Bank of America 
Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.
 
David Barden
 
I guess, if I could
 

pretty clearly stated positions on the open internet order and price 
regulation, and even things like zero rating. Could you kind of map out a 
game plan that AT&T would have for taking advanta
ge of that? And what 
kind of appetite do you see in Silicon Valley in the content community for 
trying to take advantage of some of the zero rating offerings that AT&T has? 
And then, second, if I could for you John, on the guide, if you could, maybe 
unpack
 
the revenue growth outlook a little bit as to what the biggest moving 
parts are. And if I annualize the depreciation benefit you got quarter
-
over
-
quarter, it looks like there is about 1.8 billion of lower depreciation 
incrementally in 2017 that would othe
rwise help earnings. I think you said it 
was going to go away to other non
-
cash items. If you could kind of lay out 
what those are would be great. Thanks.
 
Randall Stephenson
 
Hi, David. As it relates to our plans, on zero rating under a Pai chairmanship, 

d say that you shouldn't expect that they will change. We were going hard, 
and we had worked very diligently to put in place a mechanism that makes 
this capability available to all comers. Anybody who wants to take advantage 
of zero rating, they can come i
n and take advantage of the lowest wholesale 
rate we offer, and they could do the exact same thing. So, we put this in 
place in a very thoughtful fashion, in a fashion that is consistent with many, 
many years, in fact decades of precedent in terms of how w
e implement 
something like this. And so, we actually were quite confident that zero 
rating, as we were implementing it, was fine under a Pai chairmanship or 

 
Now, the FCC obviously issued a letter the last week of the prior 

tenure, and the letter was critical of it. But we think the letter is without 
basis, any legal basis. And so, you should expect to see us go hard. We're 
having some really good success in the marketplace with this. This is a value 
proposition th
at our customers area loving. 200,000 DIRECTV NOW 
subscribers are on it; they are taking advantage of it; it is a very elegant 


g deal and it's proving 
to be very advantageous in the marketplace for our customers. So, you 
should expect to see us continue that and continue to push aggressively on 
this.
 
I'll tell you, if you wanted a prospective on 200,000 subscribers and how 
attract
ive this was in the marketplace at $35 price point, we launched U
-
verse back in 2007. It took us a year and a half to get to 200,000 
subscribers on U
-

attractiveness of it to our customers. So, we're pr
etty excited about it.
 
John Stephens
 
David, with regard to the kind of giving a little some additional insight into 
the guidance, I'll go about it this way. On the mobility side, we've seen the 
penetration of mobile share value plans, unlimited plans and t
hese bundled 

through that migration. And we believe that with that, we have this 
opportunity to not only retain customers and continue to show good 
subscriber mechanisms results
, but also have an opportunity on the revenue 
side to prove that out. We're not giving specific guidance on individual items.
 
Secondly, with regard to the handset business, we did see a year
-
over
-
year 
slowdown in handset upgrades, even in the fourth quarte
r, even with the 
launch of a new device, an iconic new device. So, we are learning about 
what the customers want. We've given them their choice; they shown up 
with more BYOD; they chosen to hold their devices longer and pay off their 
equipment installment 
plans in full. And that's all been good for us; it's been 
good for our retention, for our customer accounts, for our churn, but quite 
frankly it will impact depending upon how popular sales are, how many 
upgrades we have, the revenues going forward from th
e equipment sales. I'll 
point out, this year, we had gross adds that grew year
-
over
-
year, we had 
upgrades that were down significantly year
-
over
-
year. And so, we are 
sharing in the new competitive market, but our customers that are staying 
with us, because
 
of low churn are choosing to hold devices or bring their 
own devices to us.
 
On the business side, continue to have good penetration, good success with 
wireless, Internet of Things, connected devices all the capabilities there. And 
our outlook is still opt
imistic about that. The challenges with regard to the 
traditional legacy business revolves around the economy. We continue to see 
good success in strategic services, once again the best answer for that might 
be tax reform from a perspective of as Randall m
entioned, if people think 
similarly to us and take those savings and invest and build their businesses, 
it will be the best way for us to grow our top line, which will be really good 
for our customers, good for our shareholders, quite frankly good for jobs
, so 

 
On the entertainment side, we're seeing good growth in the speeds that 
customers are taking on broadband and good response with the ARPUs 

completel
y through the migration to higher speeds that will continue on but 
we are on the IP broadband platforms.
 

grow and continue to see 
--
 
will learn about what happens with regard to o
ur 
over
-
the
-
top product. And lastly, we have the challenges there of the legacy 

services but that's the challenge. That's how we unbundle it, that's how we 
look at it.
 
The last p

tremendous story of customer growth, which should give us the opportunity 
for revenue increases. The challenges there are quite frankly foreign 
exchange and what happens with the peso,
 
so that we will see constant 


improvement in our base case. And then DIRECTV in Latin America is just 
continuing t
o perform really well from a management perspective in what 
continues to be a difficult tough economy.
 
With regard to the depreciation initiative, let me pose it this way. I'm not 

this
. The depreciation benefit year
-
over
-

million down, on a sequential basis this year 
--
 
and that's in this year's 
numbers, so that in and of itself goes to the comparison next year. But 
secondly, with regard to that depreciation
, there is also other non
-
cash 
items, things like capitalization of interest with regard to spectrum, and as 
you know, we're putting more and more spectrum to use; changes at our 
benefit plans and benefit expense, those things will continue to impact it; 
a
mortization of customer installation costs; quite frankly income tax rules, 
all of those matters go to offset the depreciation. I would suggest you say 

-
over
-
year.
 
What I'll really point 
you out to though is really the asset test for me and is 
the fact that we're going to 
--
 
we've given guidance that we will have free 
cash flow in the $18 billion range. And you can do the math on that, that 
free cash flow is consistent if not higher than o
ur guidance with regard to 
earnings. So, we feel really good about our earnings and particularly feel 
really good about our cash flows going forward.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. And we'll go next to Mike McCormack with Jefferies. Please go 
ahead.
 
Mike McCormack
 
Ra
ndall, maybe just a quick comment on the overall competitive landscape 
in wireless. We saw a lot of different happenings this year, and you guys are 
obviously doing some bundling, T
-
Mobile getting aggressive, at least initially 
that free iPhone deal back i
n September. Just getting a sense for how would 
you characterize the industry and how do you think that changes as we look 
into 2017? And then, maybe just one for John on the economics, as you 
think about U
-
verse subscribers moving off the U
-
verse platform
 
onto 
DIRECTV proper, what's the sort of economic trade off there?
 
Randall Stephenson
 

we think it looks like this coming year, we think it's really competitive this 
coming year.
 
And it was 
--
 
fourth quarter was just a very promotional 
quarter. All the competitors got very, very promotional, and free devices and 
buy one get one free type stuff. We were probably less promotional than 
most and doing that while maintaining what was f
or us a record low churn 
rate, we felt really good about.
 
Our intention, as we move forward, is the same as it was the last quarter, 
and that is we're going to compete with differentiated solutions. And this 
integrated solutions for us is really, really im
portant. And as we pointed out 

marketplace of integrating our products and solutions, and our churn rate 
goes down so precipitously, when we get more than one product bundled 
together a
nd particularly, as we begin to do some creative things like 
DIRECTTV NOW and the TV Everywhere app on DIRECTTV is proving to be 
incredibly powerful. This thing 
--
 
the last numbers I looked at, John 
Stephens, you can you correct me if you have more recent 
information. But 
the volumes were growing like 40% month over month sequentially, and 

their smartphones and streaming video from DIRECTV on their devices. And 

a TV is so important, and is such an important 
variable for our customers.
 
And so that is how you should expect we will compete again in 2017, we're 
getting better and better at putting these packages together for our 
customers, and the customer adoption r
ates continue to go up. So, I think 
the next year is going continue to be very promotional; it's going to be 
probably, time will tell what happens on pricing, but I think you should 
expect the promotional activity to continue, we will compete with bundling
 
and integrated solutions.
 
John Stephens
 
Mike, on the U
-

forward. One is we still have some content cost differentiation and some 
package capabilities that are important, and we can achieve those. 
Frankly, 
it frees up the data capacity on the wired network, allows us to then provide 
broadband speeds that are quicker and quite frankly alleviate some of the 
CapEx in the back office, so to speak, or back into the network, and that's a 
positive thing. T
hird, it eventually lead us to the ability to use one graphic 
user interface support cost, on product support cost and one standard, if you 
will, face to the customer and those are all important.
 
The other opportunity though is does give us the opportunity
 
to go to the 
customer and visit with the customer and make sure we maximize all the 
products and services we can sell to them including not only the broadband, 
not only the video, but wireless and others. So, that's how we think about it. 
We certainly are
 
committed to continuing to provide a quality video product 
in either case and we are continuing now to, if you will, provide an over
-
the
-
top that allows us to do it whether we utilize either a wired or a satellite 
network. So, we're trying to cover all ba
ses to look at all opportunities.
 
Randall Stephenson
 

on the competitive environment because all I spoke of was the consumer 

ve out. The lion 
share of our wireless business is business side, and we are continuing to 
grow their very nicely, our wireless business to business customers. And that 

integrated solut
ions in wireless. Because if you think about where this has 
gone and where we are having our greatest success is our customers, 
getting them from the mobile device on a secured network VPN connection 
into the cloud using NetBond and back out without ever t
ouching to public 
internet. This is proving to be very powerful capability for our business 
customers. And then, we are having incredible success brining IoT solutions 

Internet of Thin
gs capabilities that are integrated in are VPN and in our 
mobile business together, it's proving to be a really powerful combination for 
our customers as well. And so, bottom line, the growth of wireless from our 
B2B side of the house or business customers
 
is continuing to be fairly 
robust, and it's a terrific business. And that is kind of the big proof point on 
if you could truly bring integrated solutions to bear, the significance it has in 
the market, and you compete in the different level, not just on p
romotions 
and price.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. We now have a question from Amir Rozwadowski with Barclays. 
Please go ahead.
 
Amir Rozwadowski
 
I was wondering if we could touch back on your guidance for 2017, and your 
guidance calls for adjusted operating margin e
xpansion. How should we 
think about the trajectory of your wireless business within this context, 
against a backdrop of what you mentioned will likely be a continued healthy 
pricing environment for wireless? And then, in terms of your guidance for 
free cas
h flow, you are pointing to $18 billion in 2017. Previously, you had 
suggested that cash flow could reach about $20 billion by 2020 plus. Based 
on this current trajectory, it seems that that target could be pulled forward 
excluding Time Warner as well as a
ny tax legislation changes. Is that a fair 
assumption? And what are the operational puts and takes that could get you 
there?
 
John Stephens
 
Let me take a shot at this. First off, first regarding the margins, as you 
might expect, we are not going to give individual guidance on margins but I 
would point out something that I think is straight forward. And that is we 
have gotten 78 million 4G LTE 
POPs built in Mexico; we've got a 160 plus 
markets that we've got distribution, brand, knowledge, sales opportunities, 
and if you will, effective markets, and we've grow the base of customers to 
12 million. So, we expect improvements in Latin America. You 
guys can see 

clearly displayed with what we did in Mexico. So that will in and of itself, 

 
Second point, we clearly hav
e momentum in our wireless business on 
improving margins. The team has shown that every quarter this year going 
back to last year. Challenges there are the point when we decide to, as they 
did in some cases in the fourth quarter, decided invest in growth, 
and we will 
continue to do that on a very diligent, thoughtful manner. It was very 
effective in the fourth quarter, the team still came with great record 

because we want to make sure the 
business units have those tools at their 
disposal, when they are performing at this level, to invest in growth and get 
good customer.
 
So to summarize and really if you look first at the opportunities to get there, 

oing, the fact that year
-
over
-
year 
our, if you will, back office, our network, our ATNO [ph] costs are down. If 
you see the heavy lifting work, if you see what's going on in the sales teams 
and the business unit operations and their tremendous performance 
on 
management expense, those all give us momentum. You see what's 
happening in Mexico in a sense that we have now built that platform out 
significantly and are ready to start operationalize it; that will give you that 
confidence. I feel really good about t
hat opportunity.
 
Randall Stephenson
 

and maybe emphasizing, and that is there is a lot going on inside this 
business right now. And by virtue of software defined networking 
implementa
tion and a lot of the automation that is going on in our network 
and IT organizations, that big cost structure, the network, the big iron 
network and all of our IT costs. Year
-
over
-
year, they are actually down, and 

ost curve is actually on the run. 
And I've never seen this in my 
--
 

never seen anything like this. In 2017, we're forecasting the exact same 
thing and feeling really good about our ability to execute on keeping that 
cost curve moving down is providing a lot of support in a world of aggressive 
pricing and so forth to allow us to be competitive in the marketplace. So, 

 
John Stephens
 
Amir, with regard to your comments, w
e are guiding to $18 billion in free 
cash flow, we feel good about that, it comes from all the activities that the 
entire team has pushed forward this year, really sharp cash flow 
management, everything from our supply chain, our working capital up and 
dow
n, our management teams, our sales guys help us with it, everybody up 
and down the line, the network 
--
 
construction guys, managing their 
inventories, managing everything in the flow, all of that. So, we feel good, 
feel confident about getting to that $18 
billion level. We're not going to 
guide past next year, but yes, that march or that drive or that progress 
towards $20 billion is really occurring, and we feel good about the progress 
we're making.
 

--
 

t of a year to get to 
any specific level outside of next year. But with that being said, we're 
expecting the $18 billion range next year and we feel really good about the 
cash generation opportunities of this business. What Randall just said is just 
an eas
y way to give that credibility when the hard costs of this business are 
going down year
-
over
-
year, when the management team is performing at 
their level, you get momentum, when you get momentum when software 
network function virtualization up to 34% and ha
ve a track now to 75%. And 
when you see those kinds of things happening, it gives us confidence that 
we can continue to grow the cash of this business, which is really an 
underlying support for the overall profitability; it's really the proof of the 
overal
l profitability of our business.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. And our next question is from Simon Flannery with Morgan 
Stanley. Go ahead, please.
 
Simon Flannery
 
John, I know we've talked a lot about taxes already, but could you just give 
us a sense of what your cas
h tax rate is likely to be relative to your book tax 
rate this year, assuming no changes? And then, Randall, we talked about the 
economy a couple of times, but you usually give a broader view of what you 
are hearing from CIOs and CEOs and others in terms o
f the environment. I 
thought there were a couple of comments in the business solutions about 
some pressure in some of the legacy products. Is there any change there or 
is that sort of business as usual?
 
John Stephens
 
So, I'll take a stab with the cash tax 

going to give specific guidance on cash taxes. It's clearly included in our 
overall cash guidance. What I'll suggest you that the depreciation rules, the 
bonus depreciation rules, we see a lot of benefit to compani
es that invest in 
Latin America as we do, but still in place. And there is no significant large 
changes in our assumptions. And so, I can't point to anything that I would 
imply would significantly change 
--
 
that I could point for an easy significant 
change
 
in the year
-
over
-
year basis. Specifically, we're talking about a $22 
billion CapEx range, which is similar to what we spent last year. And as I 
think we on an every year basis are very, very diligent about managing our 
cash from the tax side and there is 
no reason to expect that to change.
 
With that I'll leave it at that and hand it off to Randall.
 
Randall Stephenson
 
On the economy, Simon, we have assumed for 2017 a steady as she goes 
economic growth rate or GDP growth rate, it's actually a sub 2 is what w
e 
have built into our plan, what's built into these numbers that you are looking 

CEO community, and that is that I am optimistic as I look forward, and I'm 
optimistic that if we get l
ine of sight to real meaningful tax reform, if we get 
line of sight to 
--
 


think I'm unique in that regard. Conversations 
I'm having with CEOs, as we 
get line of sight to this, I think you are going to see people begin to open up 
the first look and begin to invest at a higher level. And so, once that 
happens that is 
--
 
there is no driver to economic growth like investment. I 
happen to be a supply side guy, I think the math and the science is with me 
on that. And as investments ticks up, economic activity ticks up, hiring ticks 
up; as hiring ticks up, spending ticks up. And so, I'm actually of a mindset 
that if we get a tax ref
orm, we could exit this year doing something better 
than what is in this plan. And so, call me optimistic. And if we get tax 
reform, I do think that there is upside to these economic forecasts. And if we 
get tax reform, I would suggest that maybe upside to
 
these guidance that 

 
And I'll also say that it's not an inconsequential attitude, if you will, among 
the CEO community about the potential in terms of what can happen with 
regulation. And nobody thinks that regulati
ons should go away. We all 
believe that the customers still needs protection and safety and all that is so 


 
with 
how you think about entering new markets. And if you really begin to get 
confident, the regulatory burden is rationalize somewhat, that in and of itself 
is going to free up investment. And so, I think as you know, GDP and 
economic growth is much a fu
nction of attitude and confidence as anything 
else. And I would tell you, a lot of people are feeling confident that there is 

early to tell right now. We're kind of 
--
 
our guidance 
is premised on a steady 
as she goes, but I think there is some potential for upside on the economy, 
if we get tax reform.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question is from Brett Feldman with Goldman Sachs. 
Please go ahead.
 
Brett Feldman
 
I am actually just goin
g to follow up on that because Randall, you said you 
would see the opportunity to invest more, if there was tax reform. And it 
sounds like part of that is simply supporting your customers who would 
probably have more investment needs and more growth. But a
re there 
certain business cases that you guys have been looking at where if there is 
tax reform, all of a sudden the math changes a lot and I'll just make 
something up, for example, instead of stopping at 12.5 million fiber homes, 
you would go much beyond 
that. I am just trying to think about 
opportunities that are unique to your business where you might accelerate 
capital if the reforms go the way you hope they would.
 
Randall Stephenson
 
So, I can 
--
 

, 
but would we accelerate the 12.5, I think we try to look at whether we could 
bring some of those forward. We're in the process of deploying 40 
megahertz of spectrum, are there some things we would do forward some of 
the wireless build and bring our speed
s, our mobile speeds up considerably. 
And let's assume, and by the way this is unknown, but we were to win the 
first net bid, we want to go faster on the deployment of first debt with tax 
reform. I mean there is just a long list of things that the business
 
cases 
really good, or you could accelerate some of your build requirements and 
accelerate the business cases on many of these.
 
John Stephens
 

--
 
this is exactly what happened this year with our fiber 
to the prem build. The team hit thi
s year's goal and hit this year's CapEx 
budget, so to speak, prior to year
-
end, and they came back and said we can 

got to give us some more money. And we did just that with bonus 
de
preciation in place this year, it gave us that opportunity to justify the 

our CapEx spending, but it's exactly the situation you're talking about.
 
Randall Stephenson
 
With 
that, I believe that will be the last question. And I appreciate 
everybody participating in this. I've got to tell you, we're feeling really good 
about what we have built here. And as we look forward to bringing Time 
Warner into the fold and doing some ver
y unique things with media and 
entertainment and content in this foundation of networks, we're feeling 
really, really positive and excited about bringing that together. So, thank 
you for your attention, and we will talk to you next time. Thank you very 
muc

First Quarter Earnings Release 2014. At this time, all lines are in a listen
-
only mode. Later, there will be an opportunity for your questions and 
instructions will be 
given at that time. (Operator Instructions) And as a 
reminder, this conference is being recorded.
 
I will now turn the conference over to Susan Johnson, Senior Vice President, 
Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
 
Susan Johnson
 
Thank you, Cathy. Good afterno

have you with us today. I am Susan Johnson, Head of Investor Relations for 

Officer. John will provide an overview with perspective on the q
uarter. Then 
we will follow up with questions and answers.
 
Let me remind you, our earnings material is available on the Investor 

 
Now, before I turn the call over to John let me quic
kly cover our 
consolidated financial summary, which is on Slide 3. We had our best 
consolidated revenue growth in more than two years up 3.6% driven by 
strong wireless growth, our best consumer wireline growth since the 
introduction of U
-
verse in 2006 and 
rapid growth in strategic business 
services.
 
EPS for the quarter was $0.71 when adjusting for some transactional 
expense associated with the Leap acquisition. When compared on an 

Consolida
ted margins were up year
-
over
-
year due to wireless expansion 
margin expansion offsetting wireline pressure.
 
Cash flow started the year strong. In fact cash from operating activities for 

id cash 
flow allowed us to make significant investments in Project VIP and the 
growth drivers of our business. Capital spending was $5.8 billion and that 
gave us free cash flow of $3.0 billion for the quarter. We also continued to 
be opportunistic in buyin
g back shares as part of our repurchase program. In 
the first quarter, we bought back about 37 million shares for $1.2 billion.
 

Officer, John Stephens. John?
 
John J. Stephens
 
Thanks, 
Susan and hello everyone, and thanks for joining us today and for 
your interest in AT&T. Before I get to our operational highlights, let me take 
a moment and give you a broader view of our business strategy beginning 
with slide 3. As you know, we have been
 
working very deliberately on multi
-
year plan to transform our business.
 
In the first quarter, we really began to see the benefits of this 

legacy services to an all IP platform and a bes
t in class network. Project VIP 
is accelerating that transformation through our LTE deployment, U
-
verse 
expansion and fiber build to businesses. We also reached a significant 
milestone in the quarter with our domain 2.0 initiative. We named two 
leading com
panies, Amdocs and Juniper Networks, as primary vendors that 
will help us achieve our vision of a user
-
defined network cloud of modern 
cloud
-
based architecture.
 
We also make significant strides in transforming the wireless customer value 
proposition. This 
transformation began with the move from feature phones 
to smartphones. These smartphones soon became the remote control of our 
lives and drove significant data usage. In recent years we began the 
transition to usage based pricing and away from device subsi
dies.
 
In the first quarter, we accelerated that transformation, thanks to the 
transparency and simplicity of our Mobile Share and Next plans. At the same 
time, we transformed our wireline business from legacy services, such as 
DSL to IP networks and IP ser
vices. In the first quarter this transformation 
helped drive our strongest consumer wireline growth in years. And in 
business our strategic business services continued its steady growth. And 
our transformation is not slowing down.
 
Yesterday, you saw us ann
ounced plans that strategically target 21 new 
markets to expand our ultra
-
fast fiber networks to deliver U
-
verse with 
GigaPower. Moves such as this are one more indicator of our ongoing 
transformation. Behind all this is the strength of our balance sheet, 
our 
strong cash from operations allows us to return substantial value to 
shareholders through dividends and share buybacks, while still having the 
ability to invest in our future.
 

e 
had an impressive start to the year. Let me begin with a quick overview of 
the quarter. We made major moves in wireless that are reshaping the way 
we do business. We completed our Leap transaction and have begun the 
integration process. This will acceler
ate our prepaid initiative as we launched 
a new Cricket brand in the second quarter. And we have reached a critical 
point in our wireline business where we can clearly see that our Project VIP 
plans are working and transforming the business. These efforts 
results in our 
strongest consolidated revenue growth in more than two years while also 
driving double
-
digit adjusted EPS gains. And we did this while still dealing 
with a very weak economy.
 
To start wireless execution was superb in the quarter. We had our 
best 
postpaid net adds first
-
quarter in five years and revenue growth was strong. 
We also made massive strides in changing the subsidy model giving 
customers greater choice and a more transparent way of choosing their 
wireless equipment and service plan.
 
A
T&T Next take rates were strong as more and more customers chose the 
installment plan method of purchasing handsets. And the shift to Mobile 
Share plans was nothing short of incredible. The number of new Mobile 
Share counts and connections tripled year
-
ove
r
-
year with nearly half of our 
accounts now on 10 gigabyte or larger plans.
 
At the same time, U
-
verse continued its steady march of transforming our 
wireline business. In fact we had our best consumer wireline revenue growth 
since the introduction of U
-
ver
se about eight years ago. And the outlook for 
U
-
verse continues to be solid, as we expand the U
-
verse footprint and look 
to increase penetration.
 
Transformation also continues in business wireline, strategic business 
services revenues were up more than 16%
 
in the quarter. So, a very solid 
start with excellent momentum. Now let me provide more details starting 
with our business our wireline, our wireless business on slide 6. Perhaps the 
biggest story in the quarter was the strong growth in total and postpaid
 
subscribers, we added more than 600,000 postpaid subscribers in the 

twice as many as the year ago and the best first quarter in five years.
 
Overall, we had more than a million net ads 
in the quarter, as we showed 
year
-
over
-
year improvement in every customer category. In prepaid, we 
continue to make progress in adding smartphone subscribers. In the first 
quarter alone we added 255,000 prepaid smartphone subscribers to our 
network, this h
elp drive year
-
over
-
year prepaid revenue growth. Also during 
the quarter, we took a major step in transforming prepaid with the close of 
our lead transaction, adding 4.5 million prepaid customers of which nearly 
70% are using smartphones. We are really exc
ited about this new 
opportunity. Churn continues to be a solid story for us. Total churn was 
stable for the quarter with postpaid churn down sequentially and up slightly 
year
-
over
-
year. That is a great achievement and what is definitely a noisy 
competitive
 
environment.
 
We believe Mobile Share will have a positive long
-
term impact on churn. In 
fact, postpaid churn got progressively better throughout the quarter. As the 
transition of our customer base to usage
-
based plans accelerates, so does 
the shipping of 
our handset sales to AT&T Next. Those details as well as 
revenue breakouts are on Slide 7.
 
The transformation of our customer base can be clearly seen in this quarter. 
The combination of AT&T Next to Mobile Share value plans has annual level 
of transparenc

seen before. This new model lets customers choose, what plan best suites 
their need, and many customers have been choosing to move after subsidy 
model for simpler pricing and for a large number of our
 
customers that 
means AT&T Next. More than 40% of smartphone gross add and upgrade to 

We shipped away from the subsidy of subsidy model as major implications.
 
First, when we shift two
 
equipment and service as customer signed up for 
the next contracts you. You see that in our strong equipment growth to the 
quarter with slower service revenue growth. Second, AT&T Next accelerates 
the move to LTE capable devices. About 57% of smartphones 
on our 
network are LTE capable providing a superior customer experience on a 
best
-
in
-
class network that also means the honorable sufficient network? And 
third we see this as an investment in our high quality customer base and in 
customer choice.
 
It peels b
ack the layers of the subsidy model and allows customers to make 
clear choices. It also helps build a stronger bond with our postpaid base in a 
noisy competitive environment. And we believe we are well positioned to use 
working capital in this way. With ou
r strong balance sheet, we believe we 
can do this prudently and effectively.
 
Another important aspect of Next, is that these are highest credit quality 

talked earlier about our tra
nsformation, it leads us to a different set of 
metrics, than what we have used in the past. Next in a shift to equipment 
revenue changes the way we look at ARPU. Phone
-
only ARPU a metric we 
have shared for sometime and which includes only service revenue i
ncreased 
by 0.4% in the quarter.
 
However, phone
-
only ARPU plus Next monthly billings increased by 2% 
year
-
over
-
year. This move to Mobile Share plans in the quarter was 
incredible, more details is on slide 8. During the quarter, we introduced 
several new Mo
bile Share value pricing plans for both families and 
individuals to help customers move out to subsidy model. First, we 
introduced new attractive pricing for the 10 gig or larger plans for customers 
who purchase a phone with AT&T Next or bring their own de
vice.
 
Second, we rolled out similar value pricing for one and two gigabyte plans. 
At the same time, we made it easier for subscribers to move off the 
traditional subsidy model by allowing them to take advantage of these 
attractive new Mobile Share 
value pricing options in advance of upgrading to 
Next. We see this as another investment in our customer base. The 
cumulative impact of these changes was significant.
 
First, the number of Mobile Share accounts and connections rose sharply in 
the quarter, i
ncreasing by more than 50% since year
-
end and tripling year
-
over
-
year. Second, there was a major migration of subscribers to Mobile 
Share plans up 10 gigs or higher. Customers bought up more than two
-
thirds of Mobile Share account activity with the gigabyt
es or higher plans in 

27% in the fourth quarter of 2013.
 
And third, these new offerings prompted about 1 million postpaid subscribers 
who were on unlimited plans to elect to shift t
o Mobile Share pricing. This 
helped drive the overall number of smartphones subscribers on tiered data 

the same time, we added more than $1 million new postpaid smartphone 
cust
omers that includes customers who are staying with us and upgrading 
from feature phones. Our postpaid smartphone sales continue to run in the 
90% plus range and our total postpaid smartphone base is at 78%.
 

t quarter, wireless EBITDA 

levels. Even though we had a significant increase in postpaid gross add year
-
over
-
year. The margin expansion was driven by several factors, such as the 
mo
ve to the 24 months upgrade, network efficiencies, and operational 
improvements. Next also had a positive impact on margins.
 
All these activities more than offset the pressures we saw in the quarter. 
Cause of strong net adds both postpaid and total custome
r growth, 
additional promotional activity relating to our transformation, additional 
customer care costs related to Mobile Share and Next, and increased start
-
up investment in prepaid and digital life.
 
Our actions to improve margins also help to ease the p
ressure from about 
1.1 million accelerated smartphone upgrades that occurred in the quarter. 
These are customers who took advantage of new pricing and move to Mobile 
Share plans and upgraded early. Without this boost, Next take rate would 
have been closer 
to 35%. In total, we had 2.9 million AT&T Next sales in the 
quarter. And now more than a quarter of our postpaid smartphone base is 
on a Mobile Share value non
-
subsidy pricing, and is no longer tied to the 
subsidy model.
 
Another margin comparison to total 
wireless EBITDA margin that was stable 
year
-
over
-
year even with all the growth in investment activities we had 
underway in the quarter. There is a lot of moving pieces in our wireless 
business last quarter. The huge shift to Mobile Share plans, the tremend
ous 
popularity of AT&T Next, the increase in total and postpaid net adds, and the 
transitional way for the subsidy model. But it all comes down to customer 
choice. We are making the buying process as open and transparent as 
possible and then letting custom
ers manage the process. We believe this is 
not only best for our customers, but best for our share holders.
 
Now, let me turn to our wireline story starting on slide 10. The wireline story 
continues to be one of the transformation. That transformation began
 
first in 
consumer when we introduced U
-
verse, since that time we have flipped the 
revenue model. But once with the declining revenue stream at a 4.3% 
growth in the first quarter accelerating from 2% a year ago.
 
Total U
-
verse revenues are now at nearly $14
 
billion annualized revenue 
stream and still growing at almost 30%. And U
-
verse now represents almost 
60% of consumer revenues. We also see the transformation in our 
broadband results. More than two
-
thirds of our total broadband base are 
about a 11 million
 
subscribers are now on U
-
verse broadband, highest speed 
and highest quality product. These gains drove total positive broadband net 
adds in the quarter. And we are positioned to continue that growth as our U
-
verse footprint expense and penetration improve
s.
 
It also helps drive total broadband ARPU which was up 9% in the quarter. U
-
verse TV continues to be popular as we added more than 200,000 
subscribers churn continues to be low as penetration is growing. And U
-
verse voice, our voice
-
over
-
IP product just 
passed 4 million customers. We 
also announced that important initiative in the over the top space with the 
churn in group.
 
We are excited about the new venture and believe the combination of our 
two skill sets can create something truly impressive. We hope
 
to start rolling 

on slide 11. While wireline consumer was the first out of the gates with this 
move to IP, wireline business started the process a little later, but you can 
stil
l see the transformation going on there as well.
 
The clearest way to see it is in the steady consisting growth of strategic 
business services. These are services such as VPN, Ethernet, hosting and 
other advanced IP services. Those services now make up more
 
than 26% of 
total business wireline revenue and growth is up more than 16% year
-
over
-
year.
 
Overall revenues were down year
-
over
-
year inline with the slow economy 
and recent trend, but there are positive signs. In enterprise, our global 
business services w
e actually showed slight service revenue growth year
-
over
-
year, given recent headwinds that seemed as very positive. The biggest 
drag on the quarter was wholesale. It was challenged by network grooming, 
as wireless carriers aggressively decommissioned the 
legacy circuit.
 
However, if you look at our retail business by itself, enterprise, and small 
and medium size businesses total revenue was down only slightly in the 

total AT&T bill, bot
h wireline and wireless total retail revenue actually grew 
year
-
over
-
year. We expect our transformational IP will continue to make 
headway in the business space. At the same time we continue to look for the 
signs that the economy will improve and provide u
s with additional lift.
 

impacts from our transformation on these consolidated margins. For the 
quarter our consolidated margin was 19.3% up 40 basis points year
-
over
-
year. Wireless m
argin improvement help to offset wireline pressure from the 
trailing expenses tied to Project VIP. Wireline margins were down from a 
year ago, but essentially flat with fourth quarter. Declines in legacy services, 
and content, and retransmission price incr
eases pressured our results.
 
And this pressure was partially offset by relative consumer revenues and 
gains and strategic business services. At the same time Project Agile is 

a
nd how the company organizes and operates to deliver best
-
in
-
class 
customer experience as in all IP, all mobile and all cloud services company. 
We are taking our initial cost savings from Agile and reinvesting in the 
Project. We expect one rate savings in 
the $3 billion range by 2017.
 

generate cash continues to be strong, in the first quarter cash from 

cash from 
ops in seven years and almost four times our quarterly dividend 
commitment.
 
Capital expenditures were $5.8 billion as we took the strong cash flows and 
invested in Project VIP. And free cash flow before dividends was $3 billion on 
track with our full year 
guidance even as AT&T Next changes the subsidy 
model.
 
In terms of uses of cash, dividend payments for the quarter totaled about 
$2.4 billion and we repurchased about $37 million shares for another $1.2 
billion. Our board of directors has also approved a $3
08 million share 
buyback as we continue to be opportunistic in buying back shares. Since we 
begin buying back shares about two years ago, we have bought back about 
13% of the outstanding shares of the company and save more than a billion 
dollars in cash fr
om eased divided requirements.
 
We also continue to look for opportunities to monetize some of our assets. 
This included more than $400 million in sales of América Móvil shares and 
real estate in the first quarter. We continue to move forward on our brands 
to sell our Connecticut wireline properties to Frontier for $2 billion and we 
expect that transaction to close by the end of the year.
 
During the first quarter we also closed our Leap acquisition. A high level look 
at that strategy and integration of Leap 
assets is on Slide 14. First and 
foremost the acquisition of Leap has clear and immediate benefits and value 
creation. The value of the spectrum what we see was significant about $3 
billion in value. At the same time we will be able to get significant valu
e from 


debt which will save us $500 million in interest expense or just the 
remaining term of that debt.
 
When 
you add these synergies together, the value of just these items was 
greater than the total purchase price of Leap. From a strategic perspective, 
the acquisition of the Cricket brand accelerates our move into the prepaid 
space. We planned to launch the new 
Cricket brand in the second quarter 

with the national presence and more than 3,000 distribution points across 
the country. The focus will be on simple plans with affordable devices
 
helping customers take advantage of this thing, of the smart new choice in 
no contract wireless and all this is not a best
-
in
-
class network.
 
We are also integrating Leap customers and its networks. The customer 
transition is expected to take about 18 mont
hs as we move customers off of 

deploying unutilized spectrum immediately, continuing our efforts into 2015. 
Integration costs are expected to be about $1.2 billion over a two year 
period wit
h about half of that expected in 2014.
 
CapEx will be in a $1 billion range, but significantly offset by efficiencies with 
other wireless bill plans and with the majority of the spend targeted in 2015. 
Leap operational pressure will drive $0.05 of dilution 
in EPS this year with 
most of it in the second half of 2014.
 
We are very excited about this new growth opportunity and expected to 
really kick start our new prepaid strategy. We are also updating our outlook 
for the full year after Leap acquisition. Those 
details are on slide 15. We now 
expect consolidated revenue growth of 4% or greater for the year as we 
hold in Leap and see continued strength in wireless and wireline consumer. 
We continue to expect stable consolidated margins, which includes Leap 
operati
onal pressure. So we expect EPS growth in the mid single
-
digit even 
with the dilution from the Leap operations and continue to investment in 
growth initiatives.
 
We still expect capital spending to be in the $21 billion range that we gave 
you in January wit

expect free cash flow in $11 billion range at even with expected strong Next 
sales and Leap cost. And you can expect us to continue to invest in our 
business transformation and growth opportunities.
 
And 
now I will turn it back to Susan for quick summary of the quarter and 
then we can get to your questions.
 
Susan Johnson
 
Thank you, John.
 
Our
 
recap of a very solid quarter is on slide 16, we 
definitely saw the impact of our business 
transformation in the first quarter. 
Revenue growth was strong that includes the best consolidated revenue 
growth in more than two years and the strongest consumer revenue growth 
since we launched U
-
verse. That help drive double

digit adjusted EPS growth 
f
or the quarter, wireless was led by the best first quarter postpaid growth 

the customer value proposition, and put a large dent in this subsidy model 
while accelerating the growth of 
larger tiered data plan.
 
In wireline we are seeing the impact of our investments in IP. U

continues its robust growth and business continues to transform with growth 
and strategic business services. I will now close out the call with a quick

Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley. Go ahead please.

Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
 
Thank you, very much. Good afternoon, John, if we could start with the 
guidance revision, and in particular, the Next impact. Can you just ta
lk about 
the context of where you are in the middle of April versus where you were in 
January, when you set the original guidance? It sounds like Next is gaining 
more momentum than you expected. So if you could give color around this 
35%, 40% 
-
 
are you exp
ecting that to be 50% next quarter or 60% in the 
second half? Some color around what you expect, what we should think 
about there, and how that has changed over three months. You gave the 
monthly take rates last quarter; you didn't do that this quarter. An
d then if 
you could just touch briefly on Europe. Any update to the commentary 
around, perhaps, the window being closing there? Thank you.
 
John J. Stephens
 
Thanks, Simon. Thanks for your question. First and foremost with regard to 
Europe, we stand by what 
we said before for all the same reason we said 
before the window is closing by the day, but I will say this as you can see 
from these results and as Randall and I and others have said before we are 
focused here on this market and you can see why from the s
uccess that 

United States and remains there.
 
With regard to the Next impact from an adoption standpoint, what we 
wanted to make sure everyone was aware of that, we made a decision in 
F
ebruary to allow customers to early adopt or early upgrade under Next and 
that drove about 1.1 million early adoptions that drove the margin pressure 
quite frankly in the first quarter, we were able to overcome it, but those 
early adoptions to drive some p
ressure, so the real normal kind of a run rate 
for the group of customers that were qualified under a normal 24
-
month 

 
So we did grow from that December 20% or the fourth quarter overall 15% 
u

acceleration from the 15% to more than 40% because of that early 
adoption, and quite frankly because of the early adoption we may have 
some impact on the customer during the last th
ree quarters of the year 
because they move their adoptions up and causes that margin pressure in 
the first quarter. But I do 

 


we have the sale
s in. And so I do believe that the 35% is going to become a

Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
 
Okay. So there has been a l
ittle bit of a change in your expectations, I 
guess, versus when you set guidance originally, because I guess you are 
only changing revenues at this point. But I guess there are some puts and 
takes on the other lines.
 
John J. Stephens
 
Yes, I mean so what w
e do on our revenues is really off the strength of 
consumer wireline, what we saw there, and quite frankly off the strength of 

much more about postpaid net adds and total net adds. 
And as we 



driving the change in g
uidance.

Thank you. Our next question is from Mike McCormack with Jefferies. Please 
go ahead.
 
Mike L. McCormack 

 
Jefferies LLC
 
Hi, guys thanks. John, just t
hinking about the higher Next uptake, I think, 
than what was initially anticipated, and outpacing. The impact on the cash 
flow 

 
obviously, you are not changing your guidance for that, but were 
there anticipated levers that you are thinking about pulling t
here? And is VIP 
factoring part of that thought process? And then thinking about wireline 
margins, what are we thinking about the puts and takes there as far as the 
ability to increase margin? Does Agile have a positive impact? And thinking 
about U
-
verse m
argins overall, are they starting to contribute in a more 
meaningful way?
 
John J. Stephens
 
Thanks for the questions, Mike; let's make sure I knock them all off here if 
you will, first and foremost with margins in wireline, [we feel we are at] [ph] 
in our V
IP build process, we are going to continue to see some investments 
and the customers in the build through 2015.
 
So while we are working very, very hard to improve margins as we did 
sequentially in the first quarter as we did we expect real margin or larger
 


But right now at this time we are choosing to reinvest the savings wherever 
we can in a prudent man
ner to accelerate the overall growth of the 
company.
 
Third with regard to free cash flow the real thought process on not changing 
guidance as a couple of different factors one we came down with the final 
Leap business plan, we are focused on getting the 
unutilized spectrum into 
service right away; we have some commitments on a 90 day and a 12 


 
putting that spectrum to use, the team 

intens

the transformation and the CDMA network to our GSM network is going to 

 
Second point is our working capital is evid
enced by our cash flow operations 
of $8.8 billion, our working capital was very strong. And we have efforts 
across the board receivables, payables, inventory management a number of 
items. The success the overall team showed is being able to achieve good 
ca
sh management gives us the confidence to keep free cash flow guidance 
at the same level even with these increasing Next sales.
 

financing and VIP, we have a very active process in
 
evaluating that. We have 

and whether we can do it in reasonable manner from a cost perspective. We 
are optimistic about the ability to do that and we have a

we are well down

Thank you and our next question 
is from John Hodulik with UBS. Go ahead 
please.
 
John C. Hodulik 

 
UBS Securities LLC
 
Okay. Thanks. John, could you just give us a little more detail on the 
accelerated upgrades that you saw in the quarter? Is that going to continue 
into the second quarter?
 
And if possible 
-
 
I could probably figure it out 
-
 
but 
if you could quantify the impact on margins. And then as it relates to service 
revenue growth, we saw a deceleration there, but then stronger customer 
adds than we thought. How should we expect that t
o trend through the 
year? I mean you know, it was a big decrease quarter
-
to
-
quarter. Is that 
going to continue, or is this a sort of a new level? How do those two 
variables work out? Thanks.
 
John J. Stephens
 
Well, let me make sure I get things knocked out 
here for you. John first of 
all the 1.1 million, let me give you this impression, or this explanation. First 
and foremost, with an average unit costing about $600, those that are sold 
on Next would cause us to recognize $600 of equipment expense. On a 
reve
nue side, we would start by measuring those receivables which will be 
$600 million and then basically taking two charges against those, one for an 
interest charge for the receivable being payable over 20 months to 26 
months.
 
But secondly, for the forgivene
ss of the remaining receivables when the 

have gone by model by model and evaluated the trade
-
in value, and we take 
into account all kinds of variables, whether we sold the model,
 
the day it 
was launched whether we sold the model, six months or eight months after 
launch, so on and so forth. How other related models been selling in the 
used market, whether there is an overseas market, we take all this into 
account. Essentially thoug
h I can give you this kind of guidance, on the day 
we issue it, you could have a write
-
down on the revenues from the handset 
from anywhere from zero to 25% depending upon the different facts and 
circumstances.
 

out it, you can make 

 
you could 
then take that differential, those discounts on interest and those discounts 
on the trade
-
in value, and compare how much of a loss that generates per 
unit, it will give you the idea of kind of the pressure we face in the fi
rst 
quarter from those accelerated units.
 

opportunity will impact this in the second, third and fourth quarter. The 

at take 
advantage of it, had shrunk for two reasons. One because the 1.1 million 

of the people are recovered by, now would have qualified anyway. And so it 
will work itself down, I woul
d suggest you though the strongest piece of it 
may have already occurred just because it was so successful on the first 
quarter.
 
We forgot the customer adds. John, we are not giving specific guidance on 
that. I will tell you, we were very pleased with the 
strength of the customer 
adds improved throughout the quarter. And the churn improved throughout 
the quarter. So we believe that this combination of Mobile Share, Next are 
quite frankly transparency and pricing and if you will, upfront honestly with 
custom


forward with it, but we are not giving any specific guidance.
 
John C. Hodulik 

 
UBS Securities LLC
 
Okay, thanks
 
John.
 
John J. Stephens
 
Thank you.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. We have a question from Joseph Mastrogiovanni with Credit 
Suisse. Go ahead please.
 
Joseph A. Mastrogiovanni 

 
Credit Suisse Securities LLC
 
Hi, thanks for taking the question. John, given the growth you
 
are seeing in 
data, now with a plan to sell prepaid more aggressively on the LTE network, 
how comfortable are you with your spectrum position? And you know, we 
have seen the comments about potentially reevaluating your participation in 
the broadcast aucti
ons. How do you view your need for low band versus mid 
band spectrum?
 
John J. Stephens
 
Good question Joe. Let me first, be clear on something with regard to the 
broadcast spectrums. We would like to participate at the auction, we are and 
have been working 
with the commission to establish auction rules that will 
fairly promote a good result for AT&T, but we will also pull out successful 
result for the auction. So we are interested in participating. With that being 

ot the Leap transaction done. And 
that we are able to work through with the SEC and the DOJ to get that 
completed.
 
The unutilized spectrum that we have available to us immediately in over 
200 markets that our team is putting into service right now is activ
ely 
getting that done is really helping us and will help us in quality service in 
dealing with the network demands. This acceleration through Next in these 
early upgrades to LTE devices is really helping us with our network, because 
our LTE network is our 
most efficient.
 

dealing with our issues. If you will though, the first and foremost is we feel 
pretty good with our spectrum position right now we feel like we could 
position ourselves well with the transactions the spectrum deals we done 

we are always looking to continue to have that available. Last question again 
Joe, was on prepaid and quite
 

particularly with the new Cricket brand that if you will platform that 

the past.
 
Second, we believe the network differentiation will pro
vide a real opportunity 
there. The third as we mentioned 70% of the cricket, new Cricket customers 
use smartphones. So over that 18 months when we have to transition them 
to GSM smartphones, it will be really 

 
it could be very opportunistic for us if 

e able to figure out away to take our next program trade
-
in and provide 
those kind of quality handsets to our prepaid customers, not only elevate the 



 
have
 

about it.

Philip A. Cusick 

 
JPMorgan Securities LLC
 
Hey, guys thanks. I guess, first, a really quick follow
-
up. I wanted to make 
sure that I understood when you talk about the revenue guidance increase; 
does that include the acquisition of Leap? Is that in there?
 
John J. Stephens
 
Yes, it does.
 
Philip A. Cus
ick 

 
JPMorgan Securities LLC
 

 
John J. Stephens
 

 
Philip A. Cusick 

 
JPMorgan Securities LLC
 
Okay. And then, I guess, second questio
n: as you think about the Next plan 
and sort of making it transparent for customers on what the handsets cost, 
are you seeing a different sort of selection of handsets for Next customers 
versus subsidized customers, when they walk in and they see what hand
sets 
really go for?
 
John J. Stephens
 


 
I 


ith the 


a great process for us. When we started the trade
-
in program last year 
about the middle of l
ast year and learned about how the trade
-
in process 
would work and how to utilize and then taking those skills for us, quite 


atic change in purchasing 
activity.
 
Philip A. Cusick 

 
JPMorgan Securities LLC
 
And just to follow up there, what is the sort of reverse logistics happening in 
that trade
-
in program? What are you doing with the phones now? And how 
do you expect to deal with
 
them as the volumes, I would expect, ramp 
pretty aggressively in the next couple of years?
 
John J. Stephens
 

trade
-

irst 
12 months cycle. But the expectations are couple one we are seeing great 
take rates on our insurance program, not only historically but specifically 
with Next. And so these trade
-
in phones we expect will be used in our 

. Two we are working hard to figure out a way 
to make them cost efficiently deployable in our prepaid market whether in 
specifically in the new Cricket brand.
 
Three we always have the opportunity to sell them on the wholesale market 
which is what we did ma
inly last year, with the quality of the handsets our 
customers use and without having the international standard for handset 
technology, we were satisfied or pleased with the demand for our handsets 
that we dealt with last year and feel optimistic, because
 
the handsets we 
may be dealing with this year might be newer in their lifecycle than the once 
we had do with last year. So those are the, if you will, mechanisms to make 
sure we get value out of the process.

it thanks John
 
Operator
 
Thank you. We now have a question from Tim Horan with Oppenheimer. 
Please go ahead.
 
Tim K. Horan 

 
Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.
 
Good afternoon guys. Great quarter. John, I think you blew through 

 
definitely our estimates, but I 
think the Street estimates, on subscriber 
adds. Can you maybe give a little more color? What's going on? Do you think 
the overall market is just expanding, or are you guys kind of gaining share? 
If so, maybe talk about who you are gaining it from? And then
 
I guess we 
were concerned, and there's been some concern out there, about the early 
termination fees that some of your competitors are paying. Can you talk 
about how that process hit you throughout the quarter? Thanks.
 
John J. Stephens
 
Yes, sure Tim. Let 
me, first of all I would say that lot of the offers that came 

impact but I will say that the impacts and everything we did change 
throughout the quarter, and specifically the b
iggest impact was the decision 
to push Mobile Share, value plans in February and early adoption of Next.
 
And when we did those two things in connection, we saw significant take 
rates and we saw improvements in not only in customer growth customer 
additions
. But we saw a churn come down. And we saw that improve 
throughout the quarter. So the more customers understood the better it got 
in the results. So, I guess, real simply, while it's a very noisy, competitive 
environment, we were able to do well across th

individual porting ratios, but we were certainly positive porting in total. And 

reason to believe, we should be able to continue with, we need to see how 
things p
lay out, and how we continue to play in this competitive 
environment. But we are optimistic about what we can do going forward.
 
Tim K. Horan 

 
Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.
 
And then just maybe a longer
-
term outlook on Next. Have you thought at all 
about maybe ju
st phasing out the subsidy programs and moving everyone 
over to Next in the next couple of years? Because it seems like it would be 
substantially more profitable. I know you talked about going through some 
of the economics there, but your subsidies were in
 
the $400 range before 
that. And maybe it's $100 upfront here on Next.
 
John J. Stephens
 
Yes. So Tim I mean, we certainly continue those things I guess the first 
thing 

 
and this may sound simplistic, but the first thing is it starts with the 
customer. And 
so our customers still and some of our customer still choose 
the subsidy program even in the first quarter. So we want to make sure we 
stay focused on what they have and what they want and be responsive to 

gest that it would be 
eliminated as long as there is a significant amount of customers who enjoy

see some changes in pricing and some ability for the consumer to dr

efficiency in the market, maybe the handset providers are the 

 
the 

opportunity to not only to your customers a better deal 

 
as they drive 
efficiency, they will get savings. But w
e believe as they drive efficiency and 
get savings for themselves to give us the opportunity to get savings under

term optimistic point for us, so that 
$400 to reference Tim, we would hope based on the success of Next a

customers purchasing activities in that would help us to give us an 
opportunity to make in roads into that $400.

Thank you. Our next question is from Frank Louthan with Raymond James. 
Please
 
go ahead.

Great, thank you. I want to talk a little bit about the fiber builds that you 
have announced 

 
they put them out yesterday. I just wanted to see what 
sort of the time frame and the 
commitment to those markets. And then talk 
just a little bit about the economics of deploying fiber 

 
on the GigaPower 
product now versus what you saw a couple of years ago. It seems like the 
economics have improved for you. What are some of the drivers of
 
that that 
are making that more of a feasible build than what you saw a few years ago?
 
John J. Stephens
 

in, specifically, Austin, where we made the most progress in 

 
we are being 
a
ble to view this within our scope of our VIP program and in our scope of U
-
verse, if you will able to direct dollars from that effort and move them into 
this fiber
-
focused effort of GigaPower.
 

 
that surprised 
us that 


 
very 

much more efficient manner than necessarily we have done in the past. The 
key to the success there w

permitting and pull rights and other rights to build in the same manner as 

 

oppose 
to the ubiquitous coverage. And so those two things really driving 
the success those two things drive the changes in the financial metrics when 
you can build where the demand is you can have much higher penetrations 
and get much higher returns to support t
hat build.
 
We will start 
-
 
in fact, I think there have been discussions today with many 


uniquely pos
itioned in many of those markets because the existing backbone 
we have in many of those markets. So build off of and to provide that really 
high quality service.

Thank you, that will come from David Barden with Bank of America. Go 
ahead please.

Hi guys, 
thanks for taking the question I appreciate it. So I guess I've got a 
couple of questions, if I could. So, John, thank you for your kind of walking 
through some of the accounting practices that go along with Next. I guess 
my math is that every Next custome
r is generating something around $500 
of upfront equipment revenue relative to the traditional subscriber, who 
might be generating closer to $200. And that $300 delta times 2.9 million 
Next adds would be about $900 million of incremental equipment revenue 
relative to the old approach.
 
And that seems to foot with the year
-
over
-
year change in your accounts 
receivable working capital number. So I was wondering if we could kind of 
just go right to the nuts and bolts of it and see what was the Next impact on 
the
 
quarter, specifically, from the differences in how you account now versus 
how you would have accounted if you just used the subsidy model? And 
then, I guess, the second question, if I could, was, it looks like you changed 
the definition of ARPU in the dis
closures this quarter. I guess the old 
numbers look about $2 higher than or $2 lower than the new numbers. So I 
was wondering if you could kind of talk a little bit about that change as well? 
Thanks.
 
John J. Stephens
 

g to give specific details, but let me 
give you a couple of points about what you said that I think are maybe a 
little bit need some refinement. First and foremost on day under the old 
subsidy model, we got about $240. We also got a $200 copayment, but we 
usually had about somewhere between 

 
about a $40 activation fee, so 

 
Second piece is if you think about an average phone cost about $600 and 
you would adjust that for an interest charge and you adjust it from 
anywhere from 0% to 25%
 
contingency loss for the trade
-
in value reduction, 
you are going to get a much different numbers than $500. You are going to 
get a lower number than $500.
 
Second, if you think about what happened in the quarter, we had $1.1 
million accelerated upgrade. So
 
this next program generated those, that 


tell you on the change in accounts receivable, yes, there is
 
some accounts 
receivable change related to Next. Our total Next accounts receivables are 
going to be in the $2 billion range. I think we said at the end of last year 
was in the $900 million, but I want to be straight with everyone in a sense 
that the 12 m
onths receivables, the billings for the next 12 months are in 
our accounts receivable line because they are short
-
term, the current assets. 
And those receivables that go up beyond 12 months are our long
-
term other 


 
the accounting rules
 


 
have 

the total Next receivable.
 

model and having people pay for equipm
ent, and choosing 

 
they are 
electing to pay for equipment, and for in return, they are taking a discounted 
service price. Our new ARPU metric is service ARPU plus monthly Next 

presentation y
ou can see our growth rates still strong 2% on the ARPU side, 
so you feel good about that. But if you will, a view towards what the 
customer is paying us, you know writing the check to us for on a monthly 
basis.
 
David Barden 

 
Bank of America Merrill Lynch
 
So, John, just on that 

 
so you are adding service ARPU plus a portion of the 
equipment revenue back into the service revenue number for the ARPU 
calculation?
 
John J. Stephens
 
Just a monthly billings.
 
David Barden 

 
Bank of America Merrill Lynch
 
Okay. And
 

 
John J. Stephens
 
And David, that won't tie to equipment revenue, because the equipment 
revenue is 

 

much we 

 
this is the $30 a month we bill a customer who i
s on a 20 month 
Next plan for a phone that costs $600.
 
David Barden 

 
Bank of America Merrill Lynch
 
Right. And for those advanced upgrade plans, the ones that kind of you 
allowed to upgrade early, did you book any revenue for those? Or did you 
just give th
em the phone?
 
John J. Stephens
 
No. They came in and signed up to pay us, effectively the $30 a month for 
20 straight months. So, yes, we booked revenue in the same manner as we 
booked all the others.
 
David Barden 

 
Bank of America Merrill Lynch
 
Okay. Great
, thank you guys for helping.
 
John J. Stephens
 
Thank you. Folks with that let me take a moment to thank all of you for 
being on the call today. We have started off the year very strong and have 
made major strides in transforming our business. As a result w
e saw strong 
revenue and EPS growth, along with major gains in our growth drivers. We 
drove a strategic shift, subsidy model by changing the way customers buy 

year. And we look forw
ard to the opportunities that lie ahead. Thanks again 
for being on the call. And as always thank you for your interest in AT&T and 
have a good evening.

Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the AT&T 
Third Quarter 2010 Earnings Release. [Operator Instructions] With that 
being said, I'll turn the conference now to Brooks McCorcle, Senior Vice 
President of Investor 
Relations for AT&T. Please go ahead.
 
Brooks McCorcle
 
Thank you, John. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to our third quarter 
conference call. It's great to have you with us this morning. As John 
mentioned, this is Brooks McCorcle, Head of Investor Relations 
for AT&T, 
and joining me on the call today are Rick Lindner, AT&T's Chief Financial 
Officer; and Ralph de la Vega, AT&T's President and CEO for Mobility and 
Consumer markets. Rick and Ralph will cover our results, then we'll follow 
with Q&A.
 
Let me remind 
you that our release, our investor briefing, our 
supplementary information and the presentation slides that accompany this 
call are all available on the Investor Relations page of the AT&T website. And 
as a reminder, that's
 
www.att.com/investor.relations
.
 
I also need to cover our Safe Harbor statement, which is on Slide 3. And 
that says that information set forth in this presentation contains financial 
estimates and other forward
-
looking statements that 
are subject to risks and 
uncertainties, and actual results may differ materially. A discussion of factors 
that may affect future results is contained in AT&T's filings with the 
Securities and Exchange Commission. AT&T disclaims any obligation to 
update or 
revise statements contained in this presentation based on new 
information or otherwise.
 
This presentation may contain certain non
-
GAAP financial measures, and 
reconciliations between the non
-
GAAP financial measures and the GAAP 
financial measures are also 
available on our website.
 
Before I turn the call over to Rick, let me call your attention to Slide 4, which 
provides a financial summary. Reported earnings per share for the quarter 
was $2.08, which includes the $0.13 gain from the cash sale of Sterling 
Co
mmerce during the quarter and another $1.40 gain from a previously 
disclosed tax settlement. Excluding these gains, EPS was $0.55. That's up 
about 4% versus EPS for the third quarter a year ago and up about 9% 
year
-
to
-
date versus the same period last year.
 
That's our third consecutive 
quarter of EPS growth before significant items.
 
Consolidated revenues were $31.6 billion, up both year
-
over
-
year and 
sequentially. And that was led by strong growth in mobile broadband U
-
verse services and advanced business of
ferings. Even with record integrated 
device sales, our consolidated operating margin was essentially flat from the 
prior year, reflecting operational improvements in network and support 
functions and solid execution on cost initiatives.
 
And free cash flow 
continues to be strong, $4 billion in the quarter and $11.6 
billion year
-
to
-
date. With that, I will now turn the call over to AT&T's Chief 
Financial Officer, Rick Lindner. Rick?
 
Rick Lindner
 
Thanks, Brooks. Good morning, everyone. Before we get into the hi
ghlights 
on Slide 5, let me first just say we're very pleased with what we 
accomplished in the third quarter. First off, we are excited about the trends 
that we're seeing with revenue growth. Not only did we have a solid 
consolidated revenue growth quarter
 
that was fueled by double
-
digit 
Wireless revenue growth, but we also saw Wireline consumer revenues grow 
for the first time in more than two years. Second, we continue to see the 
benefits of our mobile broadband strategy. We had just an incredible 
Wireles
s quarter across most every metric.
 
New customers are choosing AT&T and existing customers are renewing 
their contracts in record numbers. And I think that speaks volumes about 
both the strength of our network and the ever
-
widening selection of devices 
tha
t we carry. Ralph will give you more details in a moment, but we are very 
pleased with the improvement that we're seeing in revenue trends.
 
We also continue to see improving revenue trends in our business markets, 
and I'll speak to those in just a few minu
tes. But from my perspective, the 
thing I'm most encouraged by is that even with pressure on margins from 
integrated device sales, we delivered good, consolidated margins with 
earnings growth and continued free cash flow. And I think that puts us in 
great 
position to have a solid year in 2010 with good momentum going 
forward.
 
With that overview, let's take a look at revenues on Slide 6. Consolidated 
revenue totaled $31.6 billion. That's up nearly $850 million versus third 
quarter a year ago, and that growth
 
is due to strong Wireless growth to solid 
U
-
verse gains and to improved business trends. Our overall revenue mix 
continued its transformation in the third quarter, with 73% of revenues 
coming from Wireless, Wireline Data and Managed Services. That's up fr
om 
68% a year ago and 62% two years ago. Combined, the revenues from 
these sources were up nearly 10% in the third quarter, and we expect this 
shift to continue, and it's one of the reasons we have a positive long
-
term 
view of the business going forward, a
s growth of Wireless and Data outstrips 
declines of legacy services.
 
At this point, let me turn it now to Ralph de la Vega, who, as you know, runs 
our Wireless and Consumer business for an update on those areas. Ralph?
 
Ralph de la Vega
 
Thank you, Rick, and
 
good morning, everyone. It's good to have this 
opportunity to talk with you again. As Rick said, we have a tremendous 
Wireless growth quarter, everything we could hope for and more. Now what 
you keep hearing again and again is record. As you can see on Sl
ide 7, 
record sales of integrated devices, record gross adds, record customer 
upgrades, record third quarter net adds of 2.6 million, record Wireless Data 
sales. We also had the best ever third quarter total churn, our seventh 
consecutive quarter of growth
 
in postpaid ARPU, and we added 1.2 million 
connected devices in the third quarter, setting the pace for the industry.
 
These were simply the best Wireless volumes we've had in any third quarter 
in our history, off the charts. But you know what, we believe 
that we're just 
scratching the surface here, especially when you consider three areas where 
the potential is huge. First, we still see a lot of growth opportunity with 
integrated devices. About 57% of our postpaid base have these devices, but 
our sales rat
e is more than 80%.
 
Second, we believe emerging Wireless devices are just beginning to take off. 
And third, the business phase is just beginning to fully integrate mobile data 
in their operation, lots of opportunity there. So we're very pleased with our 
th
ird quarter results and even more excited about the opportunity that lies 
ahead.
 
With that overview, let me drill down and cover Wireless results, starting 
with revenue and subscriber trends on Slide 8. Our results this quarter 
showed the strength of our f
ocus on data and ARPU growth. In the third 
quarter, we accelerated both revenue growth and subscriber growth. Total 
Wireless revenues were up $1.6 billion or 11.4%, and Wireless service 
revenues grew 10.5%, up more than $1.3 billion versus the third quarte
r a 
year ago.
 
Mobile broadband and strong data adoption drove our seventh consecutive 
quarter of postpaid ARPU gain, a record unmatched by our peers, up by 
2.0%, which includes about 40 basis points of pressure from properties 
acquired from Verizon Wireles
s. For the third straight quarter, we set a new 
record in terms of total net adds. Strongest first quarter ever was followed 
by our strongest second quarter ever and our strongest third quarter ever, 
with 2.6 million net adds. Postpaid net adds were about 
750,000, up 50% 
sequentially. Prepaid net adds totaled more than 320,000, with continued 
strong sales of the iPad 3G. Customer response has been very strong since 
the iPad 3G was first introduced in late April, and we expect that momentum 
to continue as we
 
go through the fourth quarter.
 
We also added 1.2 million connected devices to our network in the third 
quarter. This is terrific business for us, lower ARPUs, but higher margins and 
low churn, and we're still in the starting blocks with this terrific oppo
rtunity. 
These results clearly demonstrate the benefits of our mobile broadband 
strategy.
 
When you look at our net adds, our ARPU gains and churn improvement is 
clear that our subscriber metrics have never been better, and they continue 
to go in the right 
direction. One of the key drivers behind our Wireless 
growth is our integrated device strategy. The details are on Slide 9. The 
rapid adoption of powerful integrated devices has revolutionized our 
industry, and customer response continues to be incredible.
 
In the third 
quarter, more than 80% of postpaid sales were integrated devices. In the 
third quarter, we had our largest integrated device quarter ever, signing up 
more than 8 million subscribers, including both upgrades and net adds. We 
added 3.8 million 
3G postpaid integrated devices in the quarter, up more 
than 14 million in the past 12 months, and ARPU for integrative devices 
continues to be 1.7x our other devices.
 
And these subscribers tend to be very sticky for us. Approximately 80% of 
these subscribe
rs are on family or business
-
related plans with churn levels 
well below our average. These results also reflect another record quarter for 
iPhone activations. More than 5 million were activated during the quarter. 
That's more than 60% higher than our previ
ous records, and sales continue 
to be strong.
 
As a result, data revenues also continued to be strong. We grew Wireless 
data revenues by more than 30%, up more than $1.1 billion year
-
over
-
year. 
This was also our first full quarter of our new pricing for Wir
eless data, and 
the initial results have been very positive. We're also seeing more customers 
being drawn to upgrade to integrated devices, adding data plans at the 
lower price point and then they can migrate up after data needs grow.
 
Our network today sup
ports more integrated devices than any of our 
competitors and more data traffic than any of our competitors, and we lead 
in connected devices. Slide 10 shows how we built this leadership position. 
We have the best portfolio of integrated devices in the ind
ustry, using all 
major operating systems. That includes Android, RIM, Apple OS, webOS, 
Symbian. And last week, we announced the addition of three new devices 
using Windows Phone 7, our portfolio keeps getting better. Three new 
Motorola Android devices are 
scheduled for the fourth quarter, giving us 
seven great Android devices for our company. Plus the BlackBerry Torch, 
which is exclusive to AT&T, continues to do well, and we just announced that 
we're launching the Motorola ES400, which is a rugged device fo
r the 
Enterprise space. In addition to these handsets, we're launching HSPA+ and 
LTE data cards like the Shockwave from Sierra Wireless and the Adrenaline 
from LG. The Shockwave will allow our customers to connect to our HSPA+ 
network, and the Adrenaline i
s our first LTE upgradable device. We also offer 
some great emerging devices including the iPad, which begins selling in our 
stores next week.
 
Our formula is great devices plus a great mobile broadband network, and 
we're in terrific spot for both fronts. W
e have a terrific technology pack for 
customers. Our strategy to continuously upgrade network speed place with 
the strength of GSM technology and provides the most elegant path to LTE 
with backwards compatibility at every step. Slide 11 has more details on
 
our 
network path.
 
Let me say that we're really excited about our network road map. We have 
the nation's fastest mobile broadband network today, and the best transition 
plan in the market. Because of the technology choices we have made, we 
will have a 
significant advantage for the next couple of years at least, and 
customers are starting to get it. This year alone, we already spent almost $6 
billion or almost half of our capital expenditures so far this year on Wireless
-
related investments.
 
Now here's t
he progress we're seeing from those investments. Earlier this 
year, we completed the HSPA 7.2 software upgrade, making the nation's 
fastest mobile broadband network even faster. Now we're in the process of 
deploying HSPA+ to our networks. This will again a
llow us to increase our 
network speeds, and we expect the software upgrade to be completed by 
the end of this year.
 
And all the while we're making progress with our backhaul upgrades, 
executing a very aggressive investment and deployment program. This 
back
haul expansion is critical today and is the foundation for LTE. The same 
work has to be done to handle the massive growth in mobile broadband. 
What all this means for our customers is a great experience leading into LTE. 
We will not have the fall back issu
es that CDMA customers will have as they 
move from 4G back to CDMA Rev A speeds. Our LTE trials are currently 
underway in Dallas and Baltimore, with an expected launch in mid
-
2011 to 
reach 70 million to 75 million POPs by the end of next year. Customers wh
o 
are excited about 4G and over the next couple of years, they will expect the 
smooth, fast ride to 4G, and that's what we plan to deliver. We believe this 
gives us a great position to continue to capture growth in mobile broadband.
 
Now I'd like to discuss
 
how these network initiatives, along with subscriber 
and revenue growth, is impacting our Wireless margins and operating 
income, and those details are on Slide 12. Obviously, the record quarter for 
integrated device sales, which includes about 2 million i
ncremental iPhone 
activations, had an impact on our Wireless service margins. Absent the costs 
associated with these additional activations, service more just would have 
been similar to last quarter. But it is important to keep in mind the long
-
term benefi
ts these customers bring including lower churn, higher ARPUs 
and strong data growth.
 
In the third quarter, our Wireless OIBDA service margin was 37.6%, down 
from the year
-
earlier quarter. We believe the impact of margins will be 
temporary, and our expectat
ions for total year Wireless OIBDA service 
margins continue to be in the low 40% range. Looking at Wireless operating 
income, you can see the trends that I am talking about. While the third 
quarter operating income was relatively flat year
-
over
-
year, year
-
to
-
date 
Wireless operating income is up 15% year
-
over
-
year to reach $11.8 billion.
 
Now let me turn and cover consumer Wireline results, starting with the U
-
verse update. Slide 13 has the information. We had another solid net add 
quarter in U
-
verse TV subsc
ribers, helping drive the first year
-
over
-
year 
growth in consumer revenue in more than two years. We had an increase of 
236,000 U
-
verse TV subscribers, bringing our total to 2.7 million, up more 
than 900,000 over the past year. Broadband and U
-
verse Voice 
over IP 
attach rates remain very high. More than 3/4 of U
-
verse subscribers have a 
triple
-
 
or quad
-
play bundle with us, and we had a very nice rebound in our 
total broadband adds, up about 150,000 for the quarter. This has led to 
improved consumer ARPUs an
d revenue trends.
 
In the third quarter, Wireline IP revenue, and that's U
-
verse services plus 
non
-
U
-
verse broadband, grew 30%. These revenues now represent more 
than 42% of total Wireline Consumer revenues, up almost 1,000 basis points 
over just a fast yea
r. ARPU for U
-
verse triple
-
play customers was about 
$160 in the third quarter, up 14% year
-
over
-
year.
 
The U
-
verse TV experience continues to receive positive customer feedback. 
The latest J.D. Power study ranked us the highest in every region where we 
were
 
ranked. We continue to add new features that take advantage of U
-
verse's IP TV platform. For example, we are the first U.S. TV provider to 
allow customers to use their Xbox 360 as a TV receiver. This replaces a need 
for an extra receiver and allows custom
ers to receive chats and game 
invitations while watching live TV and switch seamlessly from game to TV 
mode.
 
And the U
-
verse Mobile app allows customers to download and watch hit TV 
shows and much more. It's available on four operating systems, including 
A
ndroid and the new Windows Phone 7. Innovations such as this has helped 
U
-
verse transform our Consumer business. We're confident this 
transformation and the positive impact it has on revenues will continue. 
Rick, that covers Wireless and Consumer, and I'll
 
turn it back to you.
 
Rick Lindner
 
Thanks, Ralph. Before we close, let me provide a quick update on business 
customer trends on Slide 14. The fundamental trends underlying our 
business are consistent with what you've seen in earlier quarters this year. 
We'
re seeing continued signs of stabilization as we work our way through 
the economic downturn. But I think what is encouraging to us is the trends 
of our business customers in investing in productivity and efficiency, which 
helps drive growth in our strategi
c business products.
 
Revenues from these products such as Ethernet, Virtual Private Networks 
and application services were up again this quarter, more than 15%. And 
business IP revenues, overall, were up 8%. As you know, during this 
downturn, we've execute
d a clear and consistent strategy in business 
markets. First, we've invested right through the downturn, adding capacity 
reach and new capabilities. Second, we've won new business with a number 
of customer wins that played to both our global and mobility s
trengths. And 
third, as we work to make operations and service more seamless for 
customers, that's given us opportunities to improve our cost structure and 
grow margins through this downturn. Because of all of this, we are well 
positioned as the economy im
proves over time.
 
Now let's take a look at margins and cash flow, starting with consolidated 
margin comparisons on Slide 15. For the third quarter, consolidated 
operating margins were relatively stable at 17.3%, and that's despite 
Wireless margin pressure 
from integrated device sales. This reflects solid 
performance across the company. Our Wireline operating income margin 
was 12% in the third quarter. That's up from 11.2% in third quarter last 
year. This reflects improving revenue trends and solid execution
 
on cost 
initiatives. Across the business, our total force since the end of 2009 is down 
by more than 15,000.
 
Company
-
wide, we have a commitment to operate as one AT&T, and that 
means delivering a single, seamless experience to customers for all of our 
Wir
eless and Wireline products. And as we consolidate and integrate 
operations, we have continuing opportunities for cost efficiencies. These 
initiatives are going well, and they've helped us sustain solid margins while 
also improving customer service.
 
Along 
with solid margins, we continue to deliver strong free cash flow. Our 
cash flow summary is on Slide 16. In the first three quarters of this year, 
cash from operations totaled $25.4 billion. Our capital expenditures were 
$13.7 billion, and that includes a 5
5% year
-
over
-
year increase in Wireless
-
related capital.
 
We continue to expect full year capital investment of $18 billion to $19 
billion, although we're trending toward the upper end of that range. Free 
cash flow before dividends was $11.6 billion, and div
idend payments totaled 
$7.4 billion.
 
Over the last six quarters, we have generated free cash flow in excess of 
dividends of more than $9 billion. In terms of uses of cash, debt is down 
almost $4 billion over the past 12 months. That gives us a debt
-
to
-
capi
tal 
ratio of 37.8% and net debt to EBITDA of 1.5%. And all of this gives us the 
flexibility to continue to invest in the business and return substantial value 
to shareowners.
 
Let me close by recapping a few items on Slide 17. Again, first, we had a 
terrifi
c Wireless quarter, breaking about every sales record that we track. 
And in addition, Ralph's team delivered continued growth in postpaid ARPU 
and lower churn.
 
We are also very pleased with our Wireline Consumer business, which 
achieved positive growth thi
s quarter thanks to U
-
verse and the 
transformation those services are making in the business. Combined with 
continued solid cost management, this helped us deliver very strong 
financial results, with solid revenue and earnings growth and stable year
-
over
-
y
ear consolidated margins, even with record Wireless device sales. Put 
this together with the results from the first half of the year, and you're 
seeing the makings of a very good 2010. Year
-
to
-
date, we're growing 
revenue. We're expanding margins. We're inc
reasing earnings, and cash flow 
remained strong, giving us the ability to continue to invest in the business 
and return value to shareholders.
 
Brooks, I think we should stop there, and we're ready to take some 
questions.
 
Brooks McCorcle
 
Okay. John, let's o
pen up for questions.
 
Question

Answer Session
 
Operator
 
[Operator Instructions] First, we go to the line of John Hodulik from UBS.
 
John Hodulik

UBS Investment Bank
 
Rick, can we talk a little bit about sequential margin trends, maybe in 
Wireless and Wi
reline. In Wireless, it would make sense, I think, given the 
fourth quarter seasonality we normally see on that. You could maybe see 
some additional pressure on there, especially if the upgrades stay high, if 
you could comment on that? And then on Wireline
, some of the growth 
metrics were better than we thought, and despite that, you still had better
-
than
-
expected margins I was wondering if that trend can continue as well?
 
Rick Lindner
 
Yes, let's talk a little bit about margin trends. First off, as Ralph mentioned 
in his remarks, we would expect at this point margins in Wireless to rebound 
and be stronger in the fourth quarter versus the 37.6% we had in third 
quarter. The amount of incre
ase there and improvement is a little difficult to 
project at this point. It's going to be based on the volume of integrated 
device sales, particularly as we go through the holiday season. But even with 
that, I would expect margins to be a bit stronger in 
Wireless. One other 
thing that is impacting or will impact Wireless margins in the fourth quarter 
and probably for the next two or three quarters is the transition and 
conversion of the customer base that we acquired from the former Alltel 
properties. As w
e're now getting to the point where we're going to begin 
aggressively moving that customer base from their current network to new 
GSM networks to new billing systems. And in the course of doing that, we're 
going to have to provide that base with new device
s, and there'll be 
subsidies involved in that. And we talked about all of that as part of the 
acquisition when we first announced it. But I just wanted to remind you, 
we're now, as we move into the fourth quarter, we're going to be getting 
into that period
 
where we'll be going through that activity. But even with 
those, I would expect some improvement in Wireless margins. On the 
Wireline side, as you mentioned, John, we've had very good results in 
Wireline margins, and that business is going through a massi
ve 
transformation as it moves increasingly from voice and legacy Data Services 
to U
-
verse to IP
-
based Data Services and to Managed Services. We've 
managed that transition, I think, very well. It's an ongoing effort here, 
believe me, in terms of finding way
s to be more efficient in the business. 
And the one AT&T initiatives that I mentioned in my remarks have been a 
major contributor to that, and it really does involve almost an internal 
merger and integration of organizations, processes, systems that suppor
t 
Wireless and Wireline, and we have to move in that direction in order to be 
able to interface with customers and provide single points of contact, and 
that's really the way customers want to deal with us across both our 
Wireless and Wireline products. Bu
t at the same time, it's contributed to our 
ability to take a lot of costs out of the business. As we go into the fourth 
quarter, I would expect there to be the normal seasonal pressure that we 
have on Wireline margins, and you've seen that typically every
 
year. It's a 
function of two or three things. One, being the fourth quarter typically has 
fewer business days, which affect things like long
-
distance revenues, for 
example. So it impacts both revenues and margins. We also typically have a 
bit higher overt
ime rates in the fourth quarter due to holidays and due to 
some of the typical seasonal weather patterns we get in some of our 
regions. But beyond that, we'll continue to focus on margins on the Wireline 
side. When you step back from all of that, our expec
tation is still to be for, in 
total, for the year, as we guided, in the low 40s in EBITDA margins for 
Wireless and in the lower 30s in the EBITDA margins for the Wireline 
business.
 
Operator
 
Our next question is from Jason Armstrong with Goldman Sachs.
 
Jaso
n Armstrong

Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
 
First, on Wireless postpaid ARPU, if we sort of deconstruct what's going on. 
Data seems a little bit stronger. Voice a little bit lighter. I'm sure Alltel, I 
believe also, a universal service fund cut contributed to t
his. I'm just 
wondering if you could size up this for us and help us think about the 
outlook here for postpaid ARPU growth. And then second just quickly on 
buyback. I think there's a sense that a buyback will be a big part of the 
discussion at the December
 
board meeting. But I'm wondering there's been 
some recent debt ratings agency discussions I think in the late summer that 
implied risk to ratings. So I guess the question is how does this play into 
your approach in terms of what the appropriate leverage c
apacity is for the 
business and the potential for a share buyback?
 
Ralph de la Vega
 
Jason, this is Ralph. Let me try to size up the postpaid ARPU question for 
you. I mentioned in my comments that the Alltel acquisition impacted us by 
40 basis points as the
 
customers that we acquired with those properties had 
lower average postpaid ARPUs than those of AT&T's, so that accounts for 40 
basis points. There's another 70
-
plus basis points that are accounted for as a 
result of lower regulatory fees, including the u
niversal service fund fees and 
the regulatory cost recovery fees. If you put those two things together, that 
accounts for almost more than 100 basis points of difference. If you add that 
to the 2% growth that we reflected in this quarter, then it's pretty 
much in 
line with what we have been reporting for the last several quarters, 
somewhere north of 2% to 3% ARPU growth, and we expect that as we 
continue to sell more integrated devices, our base has the capability to 
continue to get on higher ARPUs in the c
oming quarters ahead.
 
Jason Armstrong

Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
 
And, Ralph, just a follow
-
up, Alltel was in for the full quarter, the USS cut is 
that a full quarter impact as well, so we're sort of a good run rate for now?
 
Ralph de la Vega
 
The full run ra
te should be reflected in the fourth quarter, Jason. We'll 
double check that for you. But I'm pretty sure it's in for the full quarter.
 
Rick Lindner
 
Jason, on the buyback, first of all, we kind of stepping back and looking at 
the business and cash flows an
d capital structure. We had another good cash 
flow quarter in the third quarter. And in fact, one of the things we've been 
very pleased with is over the last two years, as we've gone through a very 
difficult time, the company's continued to reduce strong c
ash flow, and that's 
given us the flexibility to continue to invest in areas where we see 
opportunities for growth, including doing a couple of Wireless acquisitions 
that we've closed in the last year. And it's also given us good, solid support 
for our div
idend and growing the dividend, and it's allowed us to pay down 
debt and strengthen the balance sheet. We are sitting right now, similar to 
where we were last quarter about this time at kind of the upper end of our 
target credit metric ranges. And part of 
the reason we continue to stay at 
that kind of same range over the last quarter is because we have been 
absorbing the acquisition of the Alltel properties. As we go forward, as cash 
flow permits, I think we're going to and as we migrate solidly into our ta
rget 
ranges, I think then that gives us flexibility in addition to continuing to 
invest in the business and support the dividend, to look at some other 
alternatives like share repurchase. In terms of the ratings activities, we have 
essentially not changed 
our, for many, many years, our desire and 
commitment to maintaining a strong balance sheet. And I can tell you in the 
last six years, we have not changed essentially the credit metrics that we 
target to support a strong balance sheet. But each of the ratin
g agencies 
look at the numbers and the results and have their own proprietary 
calculations and their own targets, and it's different for each one. And so we 
will continue to be very consistent in the metrics that we target in some 
cases. For example, I thi
nk the rating activity you're talking about is S&P 
moving us to a credit watch position. If you look at their press release when 
they did that two or three months ago and look at the numbers they put in 
that release, we would have to delever substantially 
to the tune of as much 
as $15 billion in order to hit the ranges they were targeting. And I think 
that's beyond the level that we are targeting in our credit metrics. So we 
continue to be very consistent in how we're applying that. I think that's the 
right
 
way to manage the business, given the capital intensive nature of the 
business, the size of our business, the size of the debt portfolio. I think it's 
prudent, and we will continue to be consistent with that as we move firmly 
into our target credit metric
s as I've said. That and the cash flow gives us a 
lot of flexibility to continue to invest where there's opportunities, to continue 
to support the dividend and to consider other alternatives like share 
repurchase.

Our next question is from David B
arden with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
 
David Barden
 
Ralph, I guess my two questions, if I could, are for you. First would be, could 
you talk about a little bit about your reaction to the reports that Verizon has 
chosen to, number one, price a little bit
 
higher for their entry
-
level services 
like $15 for 150 megabytes relative to you guys? And then also, their 
decision to kind of maintain an unlimited data plan relative to where you 
guys decided to try to cap people out of two gigabytes, and kind of your 
interpretation of that from a competitive standpoint and from how you think 
they're positioning relative to AT&T will evolve going forward? And I guess 
the second question would be within the context of your 40%, kind of low 
40% margin guidance, I guess ba
sed on history, you guys have said that 
there's a positive net present value proposition for iPhone customers, it 
would seem that if there's an end to the exclusivity of that iPhone in the 
future, that getting as many of those customers locked down as quic
kly as 
possible would be the rationale thing to do into the biggest selling season of 
the year. Could you talk a little bit about your thinking on kind of the 
promotional and marketing end of the year?
 
Ralph de la Vega
 
David, it's difficult to comment on c
ompetitor prices. I want to be very 
careful other than to say that I'm glad to see that more and more in the 
industry are, in fact, realizing that spectrum is a valuable resource. And our 
pricing data consistent with valuable resource that needs to be take
n into 
account. So I think it's interesting that several of our competitors are now 
offering customers the choice of a lower
-
priced plan if they use a lower 
amount of data, and that's consistent with our view that, that is 
fundamentally the right approach 
for the long
-
term benefit of the industry. 
So that will be my viewpoint on that. In terms of the value of customers that 
are signing up for either iPhones or integrated devices, those are the highest 
APV value customers that we have. So we like to see them
 
sign up in record 
numbers like we did this past quarter. 8 million in total in terms of 
integrated devices. It's a fantastic quarter, and I think it guarantees that we 
are getting under contract these very valuable customers in record numbers. 
So I'm very
 
pleased with both of these issues.
 
David Barden
 
Ralph, if I can just follow up on that real quick, would be do you feel that if 
Verizon has an unlimited plan and you have a limited plan that you're at a 
competitive disadvantage but an economic advantage? 
Is that how you think 
about it or how should we think about the relative positioning?
 
Ralph de la Vega
 
Here's the way I would think about it is we had record sales quarter this past 
quarter when everybody else was still offering unlimited plans. It says th
at 
the scheme that we came up with to give customers assurance that they 
were not going to incur a lot of overdues, and at the same time, give them a 
price break. It's a useless data. It's working extremely well. I was really, 
really pleased, Dave, to see 
how customers are signing up in record 
numbers for both new customers and upgrades. And this is not a significant 
issue. Our sales people have no issues in selling our products with their data 
plans that we anticipate that those trends will continue into t
he future.
 
Operator
 
And next, we go to Brett Feldman with Deutsche Bank.
 
Brett Feldman 
-
 
Deutsche Bank AG
 
I was hoping we could talk a little bit about what's going on smartphones. 
This quarter, we saw the usual trends were really strong smartphone sales 
w
as correlated with a temporary step back in your margins. And as Ralph 
noted, you got the point where a large majority of your sales of 
smartphones and we're seeing that at every other operator as well. So with 
this huge scale that we're seeing in demand f
or smartphones across the 
industry, should we expect to get to a point where you're not going to see 
such high level of subsidization on the devices?
 
Ralph de la Vega
 
That's a great question. You would expect that if smartphone sales continue 
to drive at this range, that there will be a reduction in the cost. And I think 
what it's going to be interesting is to see how some of these smartphones 
kind of develop in terms o
f having a lower
-
end smartphone, if that's what 
customers want. We're seeing an interesting set of devices that can become 
available that perhaps are lower cost devices, but they probably also will 
have lower memory and some other things that lower the pri
ce. So it will be 
interesting to see what customers eventually opt for. But I think the 
technology and the capability with these operating systems are that they can 
be such that they can adapt to all sort of lower
-
priced SKUs and the question 
is, will that
 
be something that customers buy? We all always have the view 
that we should give the customers the choice, and that we have a wide 
range of devices with different price points. So if they want a low
-
end 
smartphone, that maybe doesn't have as much processi
ng power or as much 
memory, they can have that. And still have all the great access to the Web, 
to their applications with a lower
-
end device, and our view has always been 
to give the customers that choice.
 
Brett Feldman 
-
 
Deutsche Bank AG
 
How much visibil
ity do we have here? I mean, we're already hearing a lot of 
prepaid operators saying that the vendors are trying to get to them a $100 
smartphone, not immediately but also in the not too distant future. I mean, 
if the prepaid guys can eventually get there,
 
it would seem that you guys 
get there. I mean, is 2011 a year where maybe seasonal swings in 
smartphones sales may not be correlated with such intense seasonal swings 
in margins?
 
Ralph de la Vega
 
It's going to be interesting. My guess is this will develop
 
over time. There 
won't be a one
-
time event that will happen on any particular quarter. And if 
the customers do want a lower
-
priced device, we are going to see it 
gradually develop. We've seen all kinds of different capabilities on the 
devices. The key, in
 
my view, is will customers want the lower
-
end device. 
And look if they want the lower
-
end device, AT&T has the volume and the 
scale to be able to deliver to them as good as anybody in the planet. So I'm 
very comfortable that if that's the trend, we'll be 
able to offer a competitive 
device. But my estimation, if that happens, it will be gradually over time. It 
won't be a one
-
time event in a particular quarter, down in 2011.
 
Operator
 
And next, we go to Jonathan Chaplin with Crédit Suisse.
 
Jonathan Chaplin 
-
 
Crédit Suisse AG
 
First, I was wondering if you could give us a sense for whether there are any 
big promotions that you expect that haven't been announced yet that would 
come in the fourth quarter that we could use to kind of gauge where 
margins would come 
in for Wireless. And then second, it looks like you're 
coming in at the higher end of that $18 billion to $19 billion range for CapEx. 
Could you give us some kind of sense for what the mix is going to look like 
between Wireless and Wireline? And whether we
're sort of the peak spending 
level for Wireless CapEx, what's that the level we should expect for the next 
few years?
 
Ralph de la Vega
 
Jonathan, this is Ralph. I'll address the promotional and let Rick talk to 
CapEx. We always have some great fourth quart
er promotions, but I don't it 
would be wise to announce to my competitors what we are planning to do. 
Just rest assured that there's always some great promotions in the fourth 
quarter. We will have some great promotions in the fourth quarter like our 
compe
titors will have. But I would expect that it would be similar to what 
you see in past quarters.
 
Jonathan Chaplin 
-
 
Crédit Suisse AG
 
Will the one
-
year upgrade promotion continue, Ralph?
 
Ralph de la Vega
 
I am not going to be able to comment on any specifics.
 
Rick Lindner
 
So Ralph took the part of the question that we couldn't answer and then 
shifted the other one to me. He's starting to get the hang of these earnings 
calls. In terms of capital expenditures, it's always a function of timing and 
demand in the b
usiness. And so as I mentioned in our remarks, I think we'll 
probably trend towards the upper end of the range. Our Wireless CapEx is 
up year
-
over
-
year about 55%. We talked about being $2 billion higher for 
the year this year versus last year in Wireless C
apEx and year
-
to
-
date, 
that's about where we are. So I think everything's coming in pretty much as 
we expected. You did see this year a shift in our 
--
 
while the overall capital 
levels haven't changed dramatically, you have seen a shift between Wireline 
an
d Wireless. I think as we go into the next year or two, I think you'll 
continue to see some shifts there. And that's a very natural transition. It's 
following the shifts in the business. Wireless is nearly 50% of our revenues 
today. And in addition, as we 
look forward over the next year, we've got 
commercial deployment of LTE on the Wireless side. And at the end of '11, 
we'll be starting to wind down the primary build activities we had around U
-
verse. And so all of those things will contribute, as well as t
he trends in the 
business toward shifting some capital between Wireline and Wireless.
 
Operator
 
And next, we go to the line of Tim Horan with Oppenheimer.
 
Timothy Horan 
-
 
Oppenheimer & Co. Inc.
 
Ralph, two questions if you don't mind. Could you maybe talk ab
out the 
different handsets out there? It seems like the iPhone, based on your 
numbers, are still kind of pulling ahead of their competitors here. I guess 
Droid being the main competitor. When do you think maybe that could 
reverse a little bit and I guess y
our flow anyway where the Droid and the 
new Microsoft phones can start to gain a little bit more share on iPhone? And 
then secondly, can you give a little bit more color when you upgrade to 
HSPA+, what the customer experience is like? Because I assume the 
churn 
on the iPhone issue is going to be largely dictated by network quality and 
maybe just a little bit more update on where you are with the backhaul 
upgrade and what will become six months from now or so?
 
Ralph de la Vega
 
Yes, what is happening in the i
ndustry and by the way, it is my view that the 
U.S. now is leading the world what it comes to smartphones and tablets. The 
development of the applications and operations systems are leading the U.S. 
to be at the epicenter of everything that is happening ne
w with 
smartphones. And I think what you're seeing is more choices coming into 
the marketplace and every year, everybody's phones seem to be getting 
better and better and better. So I think what is happening in the industry 
the battle is a battle of innova
tion cycles, who can innovate quicker and 
faster based on the fact that all these OS have a very good base capability. 
It's all now about innovation. I've never seen innovation cycles come 
quicker. And so I think we're going to have the opportunity to do i
s to offer 
customers an incredible choice of applications and services based on this 
innovative capabilities. But if you look at Android, it has some very good and 
fast innovation cycles. So does Apple. Microsoft just came out, and they've 
already announce
d they're going to upgrade some things in that 
infrastructure and operating system in early next year. So I think it will be a 
race of innovation to see who can develop the most innovative products and 
services. And the thing that I liked about our positio
n is we believe we 
believe in having a wide choice of OSs, having every single major one. So 
that if there's any innovation that is important to our customer base, they 
know that they can come to AT&T, and we'll be able to have it for them. And 
that's been
 
our view. In terms of HSPA+, I think any speed that we can 
provide to the network to make it faster, makes all these devices faster. The 
beauty about it is that the faster network speeds that we're offering today 
make these devices really come to life. If
 
you have a slower network, I don't 
think you're going to get utility out of the processing power and the memory 
capabilities and the video that these devices are capable of delivering. So I 
think our HSPA+ piece will take a one additional level and give y
ou a 
fantastic experience when you have one of these processors that now have 
one gigahertz as a basic core processor. But what we see in the horizon is 
actually dual core processors, two processors as fast as one gigahertz each. 
So you can imagine that th
ose devices, unless you have a really fast 
network, are not going to be able to deliver the best experience to our 
customers. So that's why I like our positioning so much that we'll have 
HSPA+ delivered by the end of the year. We're going to have the capab
ility 
to begin the backhaul upgrades and to provide the services on a geographic 
basis as soon as the backhaul is complete, and when you get one of these 
devices with one gigahertz processor, maybe even dual processors, they're 
going to absolutely hum. The
y're just going to be awesome. And so I think 
those are the trends that I see in the marketplace, and we're very excited 
because I think it plays to our strengths.
 
Rick Lindner
 
Tim, this is Rick. Let me offer just a couple of additional comments on both 
of
 
those questions. One on handsets and devices, Ralph's exactly right, and 
we're seeing an unprecedented level of innovation. And it is just fun in this 
business, frankly, to see the innovation, the new devices, the new features 
that are coming out literall
y every quarter. But I want to make sure while it's 
fun to talk about all the different devices of handsets, I want to make sure 
that we don't lose sight of the real story here from our perspective. And the 
real story here is this quarter, with as large of
 
a postpaid base as we have, 
well over 80% of the devices we sold into that postpaid base, both upgrades 
and new gross adds, were integrated devices. That's astounding, and it's 
huge compared to even where we were just a year ago. And I think what 
that spe
aks to is the combination of the features in these devices along with 
the network speeds that Ralph talked about has really facilitated a value 
proposition for customers and has turned the mobile phone into a mobile 
computing device. And increasingly, cust
omers want to be able to access 
applications, access the Internet and receive content via their mobile 
devices. That is really the real story here. And it leaves us into a Mobile 
Broadband business for us that's approaching a $20 billion a year business, 
a
nd a business that's growing at 25% to 30%. That's underlying it. That's 
the real story, and I think the opportunity for us and why we're excited 
about this space. And why, frankly, we continue to push integrated devices, 
we continue to push Data Services 
into our postpaid base. The other thing 
that I want to comment on really relates to the overall customer experience 
in our network as we migrate up first, as we migrated up to HSPA 7.2 and 
then to HSPA+ and then to LTE. I think we've got the opportunity ov
er the 
next few years to offer a superior experience on these devices because to 
facilitate the kind of Data Services and applications and devices that we're 
going to have and everyone's going to have on the network and that 
customers want, it's going to r
equire mobile broadband speed. And as a 
result, you see all the carriers rolling out 4G networks, whether they be LTE 
or whether they'd be WiMAX or other technologies. But everyone is working 
to increase speeds. The advantage that we'll have is not just in
 
terms of the 
speeds available on these new 4G networks. But initially, these 4G networks 
are going to cover a relatively small piece of geography. And in our network, 
as customers move off of that geography, they're going to have a great 
experience in LTE
 
as they move off of that geography. They're going to have 
a very, very good experience in HSPA+ across our network. And that will be 
an advantage versus other carriers where you will see a significant decrease 
in speeds when you're out of their 4G footpri
nt.
 
Operator
 
And that will be from Michael Rollins with Citi Investment Research.
 
Michael Rollins

Citigroup Inc
 
Just two quick questions. One is you mentioned that on the Enterprise side, 
70% of the customers have converted already to IP. And can you 
help us 
think about if you look at the global Enterprise revenue change whether you 
look at year
-
over
-
year or sequentially, how much of that can be attributed to 
this conversion process of moving to lower
-
cost IP services versus how to 
think about the busi
ness organically in terms of the demand for traffic in a 
more normal pricing environment once you get through conversion? The 
second part of the question was more of a strategic question. As Wireless 
continues to evolve and start to take share of the broad
band market more 
substantially, in your view, does it still makes sense for Wireless and 
Wireline to be part of the same company? Or are there advantages over time 
in thinking about what Wireless can do to compete more effectively against 
what is the tradi
tional Wireline business?
 
Rick Lindner
 
Those are great questions, Mike. Let me take a shot at those and invite 
Ralph to comment as well. First of all, I think when you look at our business 
sales and revenues and look at the various business revenue streams
 
there, 
again, that's a business going through a transition. We've actually crossed 
the line this quarter where traditional voice revenues as part of our business 
revenues are down below 40% of business revenues. Increasingly, it's 
becoming a business driv
en by data, by IP
-
based services, Managed 
Services and increasingly as we go forward, as companies move more of 
their applications and their content into the cloud, hosting cloud computing 
becomes more important, as well as facilitating applications throug
h mobile 
devices. And I think we're well positioned in all areas of the business where 
there are growth opportunities. And that's why you see strategic business 
service revenues continuing to grow quarter after quarter at mid
-
teens 
rates. It's why you've s
een in the last several quarters IP
-
based data 
revenues increasing on the business side, getting into the upper single digit 
rates of growth. We're also seeing impacts in other areas, still a lot of 
demand for bandwidth and transport. Now the revenue strea
ms there have 
been flatter more recently, but that's more a function of companies 
increasing their bandwidth, but at the same time, grooming their networks 
and moving to higher speed services. And so we're seeing both on a retail 
and a wholesale environmen
t, significant demand for Ethernet in backhaul. 
Again, all of those areas were positioned very well. The one area that has 
been a drag in the business somewhat has been voice volumes, and I think 
we will see some improvements there. But as we require some 
improvement 
in the economy in employment and as well as on the small end of the 
business, in new business formations. As we see that and as the business 
becomes increasingly driven by IP
-
based services that are on a good growth 
trajectory, I think that, th
at's what gives us comfort that the overall 
revenues on the business side will continue to improve. And as we've talked 
about, we think longer term this is a GDP, GDP
-
plus type of growth sector 
for us. You asked a very good question about the importance of
 
or the need 
or desire to have both Wireless and Wireline assets, given this environment. 
And I guess what I would say, Michael, is I think more than ever before, we 
think there are advantages and strengths in having a combination of 
Wireless and Wireline 
assets because that's what is required to provide the 
kinds of service experience that customers want. And essentially, whether 
you're a business customer or a consumer customer, you want the 
convenience of mobility and mobile access to networks and to dat
a 
applications and content. And you want that over a variety of devices. That's 
why you see the proliferation of devices on the network from all of the 
connected devices that Ralph's team is selling to notebook computers to 
tablet computing. That's the way
 
people want to access the network. But in 
order to provide the bandwidth and to provide the capacity and to provide 
the kind of service experience you want, you've got to drive that traffic as 
quickly as possible into a wired infrastructure, which improve
s service 
quality and provides significantly more bandwidth. That's why, for example, 
in our case, that's why we believe having the Wi
-
Fi infrastructure and 
hotspots that we have across the country and around the world are so 
important. So in our view, we 
believe to provide the kinds of services that 
consumers and businesses demand in the future, having both Wireless and 
Wireline capabilities and having an integrated carrier model is the best way 
to provide those services.
 
Ralph de la Vega
 
Mike, of 
course, I would agree with that. The other thing I would throw your 
way is based on all the modeling that we have done, there's not enough 
spectrum to be able to take everything that you're sending over wired 
facilities and put them over Wireless, especial
ly when it comes to video. So 
in the end, you're always going to need a combination of both and our view 
is the more integrated you are, the better you're going to be in terms of 
being able to give the customers what they want in the future.
 
Rick Lindner
 
F
olks, I'd like to offer a couple of comments and closing. First of all, I want 
to thank you for taking part in the call today. And again, I just like to 
highlight a couple of key points. First, as we talked about, we continue to 
see the benefits of our mob
ile broadband strategy with just an incredible 
Wireless quarter. Record sales and activations of integrated devices, double
-
digit revenue growth, our seventh consecutive quarter of postpaid ARPU 
growth, and all of that adds up to excellent momentum in our 
Wireless 
business. And the second point that I'd like to make is that we continue to 
post very good, very solid financial results. Consolidated revenue growth and 
the revenue growth trend is improving. Wireline margins have improved, 
and even with pressure
s from record Wireless sales, we grew earnings, and 
cash flow continues to be strong. When you look at our year
-
to
-
date 
financial results, I think you see the foundation for an outstanding year, and 
our job now is to execute and finish the year strong. Aga
in, I want to thank 
you for being on the call today, and as always, thank you for your interest in 
AT&T.

Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to AT&T 
Fourth Quarter Earnings Release 2012 Conference Call. (Operator 

 

conference call over to your host Ms. Susan 
Johnson. Please go ahead.
 
Susan Johnson
 
Thank you, Tony. Good afternoon everyone, and welcome to our fourth 

Johnson, Head of Investor Relat
ions for AT&T. Joining me on the call today is 


comments and then close with 2013 guidance and John will cover ou
r 

 
Let me remind you our earnings materials are available on the Investor 

 
Of course I also need to cover our Safe Harbor statement, which 
is on Slide 
3. This presentation and comments may contain forward
-
looking statements.

comments before we let John take you through the results. But many of you 
were on the call a year ago and you probably recall m
e talking candidly with 
you about what we had to get done in 2012 and our number one priority 
was spectrum. And I also said, we needed to accelerate our shift into our 

aggressive in re
turning value to our owners and this where we focused our 
efforts during a year.
 
And on the spectrum front, we have signed nearly 50 deals and those 
include introducing WCS spectrum into the mobile ecosystem for the very 
first time, and actually just kind 
of fresh off the wire today we formerly 
closed the NextWave acquisition, which was the property that included the 
largest block of that spectrum. So that transaction has closed today.
 
You put all these deals together and they increase our average national 
spectrum by a third. And while everybody in the industry is always going to 
be looking for more spectrum, at this stage I like our position.
 
The spectrum was obviously an important piece of the puzzle for Project VIP 
and we outlined Project VIP for you in 
the November. And this is without a 
doubt the most comprehensive organic growth initiative for us in several 
decades. And it includes expansion in both wireless and wireline.
 
And most of you are familiar with the plan, it includes LTE covering 300 
million 
people by year end 2014 with an extensive network specification 
aspect to it, IP broadband to 75% of our wireline customer locations, fiber 
into a million additional business locations and we plan to execute a full 
transition of our network to wireless plu
s IP.
 
Then once the Project VIP is complete, nearly all of our customers will have 
access to high
-
speed broadband through wireless, wired or some 
combination of both. So this going to give us a much larger platform for new 
services, it will improve our rev

structure for many years to come.
 
Most important, it will let a layer on services that we believe we are going 
change every aspect of our customers lives. How they buy things. How they 
manage and secure their hom
es. How they access entertainment. Their 
experience behind the car wheel is going to change. There is going to be a 

industry is moving beyond the device and into a new era of solut
ions and 
services.
 
We also delivered solid financial results. For the year, we had on an apples
-
to
-
apples basis revenue growth of 2.4% and adjusted EPS up 8.5%. Our 
cash from operations came in over $39 billion. We invested $20.5 billion in 
capital of spec
trum.
 
We paid out $10 billion in dividends and increased our dividend for the 29 
consecutive year. We bought back 6% of our shares, which will reduce 
dividends by about $700 million per year. And if you combine the buybacks 
and dividends we returned $23 bi
llion to our owners last year. And we do 
this with a very small increase in debt and we refinanced $12 billion of our 
debt to take advantage of the low rates.
 
And then on top of that, we began the process to solidify our pension plan 
and we are contributin
g a preferred equity interest in AT&T mobility, which is 
our best asset into the plan, and we are working with the Department of 
Labor to complete that this year. All this give us a really good starting point 
for 2013. And here is what you would expect fro
m us.
 

businesses this year, including Digital Life, our mobile wallet JV, connected 
cars and a number of others. And over the next few years these represent 
billions of dollars of new re
venue opportunity for us.
 
In a quarter you should expect us to maintain a strong balance sheet and 
continue returning value to our owners. So I think we are executing well, I 
like how we are set up for 2013.
 

John Stephens to take you 

on our 2013 outlook. So John?
 
John Stephens
 
Thanks, Randall, and good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us 
today. Let me begin by providing a
 
consolidated financial summary, which is 
on slide six. When you look at 2012, our adjusted financial results were 
strong across the Board, revenues, margins and earnings per share. When 
you exclude our divested Ad Solutions business and adjust for the 
Sup
erstorm Sandy impacts revenues were up 2.4% for the year and 2.8% in 
the fourth quarter.
 
Operating income increased 4.8%. Consolidated margins improved even with 
record smartphone sales and as a result, we grew adjusted earnings per 
share 8.5% for the year
. And we had our strongest ever annual cash flows.
 
Cash from operating activities totaled $39.2 billion in 2012 and free cash 
flows were $19.4 billion. That strong free cash flow allowed us to be 
aggressive with our share buybacks. We repurchased more than
 
370 million 
shares during the year.
 
Looking at the fourth quarter, we have reported earnings per share of a 
negative $0.68 but excluding $1.12 adjustments, earnings per share was 
$0.44, a 10% year over year increase. These adjustments included $1.10 of 
no
n
-
cash pressure from the year end mark
-
to
-
market change for our benefit 
plans. This actuarial loss from the benefit plans was solely by the reduction 
in the discount rate from 5.3% at the end of last year to 4.3% at the end of 
this year and $0.02 of pressu
re due to storm impacts from super storm 
Sandy.
 


2.8% year
-
over
-
year when you exclude Ad Solutions and the st
orm impacts. 
Driving this growth was strong mobile Internet results, excellent U
-
verse 
gain and continued strength in strategic business services.
 
On the left side of the slide you can see how our growth drivers, wireless, 
wireline data and 
mainline services have become a larger and larger part of 
our business. In the fourth quarter 81% of our revenues came from these 

areas were up $1.4 billion in in the quarter, our almo
st a 6% growth rate. 
We expect this mix shift to continue and by 2016 we expect these growth 
drivers to represent close to 90% of our total revenue.
 

ARPU on slide eight. Wireless 
data continues to drive solid revenue results. 
Data revenues were up more than 14% in the quarter that helped drive 
4.2% service revenue growth and total wireless revenues were up over 
5.5% in the quarter. Data revenues were impacted somewhat by the growth
 
of mobile share plans with unlimited messaging and voice are standard for 
those plans and we booked messaging revenues in our wireless voice 
category while mobile share data revenues go to data.
 
You can also see the impact of data growth when you look at 
ARPU. Postpaid 
data ARPU grew at nearly 12% and total postpaid ARPU which includes 
postpaid devices such as tablets was up 1.9%. And phone
-
only ARPU was up 
2.5% growing off a much higher ARPU base than anyone else. Postpaid 
ARPU was impacted somewhat by su
per storm Sandy. In an effort to help 

Without that revenue loss total postpaid ARPU growth for the quarter would 
have been about 2.1%.
 
One of the highlights of the quarter was our 
strong postpaid growth where 
we had our largest gains in 3 years, details are on slide 9. We added almost 
800,000 postpaid subscribers in the quarter with strong gains in 
smartphones, tablets and mobile premise solutions. Overall we added 1.1 
million new s
ubscribers with additional gains in connected devices and 
reseller.
 
Prepaid net adds were impacted by declines in both session based tablets 
and go phone. Branded computing subscribers are up 26% year
-
over
-
year 
driven by strong tablet sales. Postpaid churn
 
also had another strong 
quarter, down from the year ago fourth quarter and smartphone churn was 
even lower. The growing number of subscribers on family, business or Mobile 
Share plans also help reduce churn. Subscribers on these plans tend to be 
stickier 
with lower churn.
 

-
based data plans on slide 
10. Mobile Share growth was dramatic especially when you consider that we 
give customers a choice with taking those plans or keeping what they 
already have.
 
These p
lans were first introduced late in the third quarter of 2012. By the 
end of the fourth quarter, 6.6 million subscribers were on Mobile Share plans 
or about 10% of our postpaid base. And these subscribers were on 2.2 
million accounts, which gives us an aver
age of about three devices per 
account.
 
Take rates on the higher data plans continue to run above expectations. 
More than a quarter of Mobile Share accounts have 10 gigs or larger plans. 
And we continue to see a steady movement of subscribers on unlimited 
plans taking advantage of Mobile Share. More than 15% of our subscribers 
are moving from unlimited plans to Mobile Share.
 
Overall more than two thirds of our smartphone base has moved to usage
-
based plan in the last two and one
-
half years, and we expect th
at trend to 
continue. We also had another record quarter for smartphone sales. Our 
wireless team sold 10.2 million smart phones, the most smartphones ever 
sold by any U.S. carrier.
 
Those sales accounted for 86% of all postpaid sales and 89% of postpaid 
pho
ne sales in the quarter. Smartphone subscribers now account for almost 
70% of our postpaid phone base.
 
When looking at the full year, our smartphone base grew by almost 8 
million. These are the premium subscribers in our business. ARPU was twice 
that of no
n
-
smartphone subscribers and they have much lower churn.
 
We also saw our best ever Android and Apple device sales in the quarter. 
More customers continue to choose the iPhone on AT&T's network. We 
activated 8.6 million iPhones in the fourth quarter with ab
out 16% new to 
AT&T from about the same percentage of new subscribers as last year.
 

As you know, the investments we've made to drive record smartphone sales 
impacted margins. While 
we continue to make progress in improving our 
margins, we also are more than willing to invest in smartphones because of 
the benefits they bring. Those include higher ARPU, lower churn, strong data 
growth and with that growing operating income, which was u
p more than 
6% for the year.
 
In the fourth quarter, wireless EBITDA service margin was 29.1% about the 
same as last year's fourth quarter. And it was nearly 30% taking into 
account the impact of Superstorm Sandy.
 
For the full year, our EBITDA service margi
n was 39.6% and was 39.9% 
while adjusting for storm impacts. So even though we sold 1.5 million more 
smartphones in 2012 than we did in 2011, our wireless EBITDA service 
margins for the year improved almost 100 basis points and improved even 
more when you 
account for the storms.
 
And the number of upgrades was down for the year about 5% which 
provided further margin support. We are making progress with margins and 
we expect that progress to continue going forward.
 
Now, let's look at our wireline operations s
tarting with consumer, which you 
can see on slide 12. A quick look at our U
-
verse results helps explain our 
confidence as we expand these services to 75% of our wireline base through 
project VIP. We continue to see strong subscriber growth, both video and 
high
-
speed broadband. This in turn has accelerated customer revenue 
growth to 3% in the fourth quarter, our best performance in more than four 
years. We continue to hit new and higher benchmarks with U
-
verse, 
including 8 million total U
-
verse subscribers, 
4.5 million U
-
verse video 
customers with 192,000 net adds in the quarter and 7.7 million high
-
speed 
IP broadband subscribers. That's nearly a 50% increase for the year with 
more than 600,000 added in the fourth quarter and for the first time, our 
consumer 
high
-
speed IP broadband subscribers outnumber our legacy 
broadband customers.
 
And while overall broadband subscribers remained steady in the quarter, 
total broadband ARPU was up more than 10% year
-
over
-
year. U
-
verse is 
now a $10 billion annualized revenue 
stream growing at 38% for the full 
year. And IP data revenues driven by U
-
verse now represent 61% of 
consumer revenues, up from 53% just a year ago. But we believe the best is 
yet to come. We think there is a lot of room for growth here, penetration 
rates 
are just starting to climb so the runway is long. And with our project 
VIP expansion that opportunity will only grow as we bring U
-
verse video and 
high
-
speed IP wired broadband to million more customer locations.
 

e on slide 13. The story in the 
fourth quarter is similar to what we've seen all through 2012. Customers 
delayed combined decisions due to concerns with the economy. The fiscal 
cliff uncertainty lasted the entire quarter and small business starts continued
 
to lag last year's level. But the silver lining in the fourth quarter was some 
small signs of revenues stability.
 
On a sequential basis, revenues were up due to growth in enterprise. Service 
revenues were up slightly versus the third quarter and wholesale
 
revenues 
also showed signs of stability. Overall business and the wireline revenue was 
down 2.1% in the fourth quarter, slightly better than the 2.6% drop in the 

have been able to
 
continue to hold margin steady while transitioning legacy 
products to IP data services.
 
Our strategic business services also continued to grow, that includes 
products such as Ethernet, VPNs and application services, which were up 
10.5% for the quarter and
 
up 13.5% for the full year, and data revenues 
continued to grow even in this challenging environment with IP data 
revenues up 2.4% year
-
over
-
year and still a weak market, but we are 
cautiously optimistic that this business is showing some signs of stabili
ty. 
And we are hopeful that an improving accounting will get this part of the 
company growing again.
 

are on slide 14. Even with strong postpaid net adds and record breaking 
smartphone
 
sales, consolidated margins improved. For the year our adjusted 
consolidated margin was 18.2%. That compares to 17.8% in 2011. Wireline 
operating income margin also expanded during the year as wireline 
continued its transformation from voice to IP data. T
his helped to offset 
declines in legacy services and a sluggish economy thanks to improving 
revenue trends in consumer, scaling IP and solid execution of One AT&T cost 
initiatives. We continue to keep a sharp eye on cost efficiencies, and we see 
more oppor
tunity to reduce expenses as we move ahead.
 

summary is on slide 15. Cash from operations was a record $39.2 billion, 
and we had record free cash flow as well. Free cash flow before dividend
s 
was $19.4 billion, up more than 34% from a year ago. Strong cash flows 
give us the flexibility to invest in the business and return value to 
shareholders through dividends and share buybacks. We were able to do all 
of these in 2012.
 
Capital expenditures 
were $19.7 billion with more than half of that invested 
in our wireless business. Dividend payments for the year totaled $10.2 
billion and we repurchased more than 370 million shares or about 6% of 
outstanding shares worth about $13 billion.
 
We completed o
ur initial 300 million share buyback authorization in the 
fourth quarter and began buying back shares under our second 300 million 
share authorization. When you look at both dividends and buybacks, we 
returned $23 billion to our shareholders during the yea
r.
 
In terms of uses of cash, our net debt
-
to
-
adjusted EBITDA ratio increased 
only slightly to 1.58, and net debt edged up as we took advantage of 
historically low interest rates, with a net debt
-
to
-
capital ratio of 43%.
 
As we begin our Project VIP investme
nts, our balance sheet is sound, our 
debt metric solid, our strong cash flows give us the flexibility to invest in 
growth, while returning value to shareholders.
 

look on how we 

 
On an adjusted basis we expected consolidated revenue, margin and EPS 
growth, and that's what we delivered, that include hitting on the high
-
end of 
our EPS range. We also expected the 
mobile Internet to drive wireless 
growth and we saw subscriber gains, postpaid ARPU growth and expanding 
wireless service margins during the year.
 
We over deliver on wireline margins and consumer wireline growth, thanks 
to the increasing strength of our U
-
verse services, we bumped up our free 
cash flow estimates during the year, but finished the year even stronger 
than expected, and CapEx ended the year in the range we expected.
 
We also were aggressive on the share buybacks, adding a second 300 
million repu
rchase authorization during the year, and as Randall said earlier 
we knocked that out of park in executing our strategies in 2012.
 
Altogether, an excellent performance in a challenging economy and a 
performance that gives us confidence as we head into 2013
.
 
With more details on that let me hand it back over to Randall. Randall?
 
Randall Stephenson
 

questions here. But just a couple of comments on what you can expect from 
us in 2013. And
 


that, we expect to take our LTE build to 250 million or more POPS by year 
end.
 
We going to see us launch several of 
our new growth businesses I discussed 

and obviously, there will be an emphasis on wireless and Project VIP.
 
In terms of financials, we expect to delivery EPS growth in the upper sin
gle 
digits or higher. Consolidated revenue growth should exceed 2%. 
Consolidated operating margin should be stable and wireless margins should 
expand.
 
We expect cash generation to be strong in fact free cash flow after CapEx 
will exceed $14 billion. This g
ives us room for continuing share repurchases 
and actually we expect to complete our current buyback authorization as 
early as midyear.
 
So I characterize this as a very achievable outlook, I mean, you know our 
history, we tend to be conservative, and this 
assumes no lift from the 
economy.
 
So, to close, I like how we are executing. We have a really strong financial 
position, which gives us the opportunity to invest aggressively and continue 
returning value to our owners. And I like the moves we are making to
 
expand our growth platforms.

Thank you very much
. (Operator Instructions) Your first question in queue 
will come from Phil Cusick with JP Morgan.
 
Phil Cusick 

 
JP Morgan
 

know if this is right or not but saying that international 
or European 
acquisitions may be inevitable to continued growth. Can you address that for 
us? And then second, for John, going through this buyback by midyear, 
that's great. What do you think about the potential to reauthorize and how 
does the board think a
bout that so far?
 
Randall Stephenson
 
Yeah sure Phil. As it relates to international I was asked about consolidation, 


out. As 

impressive what transpired in the mobile Internet revolution and the U.S. 
has been outpacing the rest of the globe fairly considerably. And I think 
most people expect the res
t of the world will catch
-
up and so the question 
you have to ask is are there opportunities for us to participate in that growth 
outside the U.S. And we look at this from a lot of different ways as more and 
more people around the world begin to deploy LTE.
 
There are probably some 
opportunities to create some unique roaming arrangements, roaming each 


partnering in China, C
hina Telecom deal that we did. And you will probably 
see those kind of deals more and more in the mobility side, do you invest at 
the infrastructure level is a big question.
 

gr
owth outside the U.S. at the application level? And this year is going to be 
very instructive in that regard to us because services like digital life, which is 
really 

 

monitoring and so forth, a
nd is it possible to carry those platforms outside 
the U.S.? We are already licensing that platform to companies in Europe. 

U.S. So as we kind of look at this we do believe that U.S. 
experience will 

would participate in that, there are lot of avenues for that.
 
Phil Cusick 

 
JP Morgan
 
That sounds like acquiring something is less on your mind than other 
opportunit
ies.
 
Randall Stephenson
 

to characterize here, Phil. There are lot of options.
 
John Stephens
 

decision on 

currently. Secondly, in evaluating and providing information with regard to 
share buyback, first and foremost it's a question of valuation of shares 
compared to the market 
price that is out there and we look at what analysts 
say. We look at our own internal valuations of share price and we look at 
what the market is trading the stock at. But before you get to a further 
authorization you need to make sure that one, your cash 
flows from your 
business which 

 
we have really very solid cash flow performance, you have 
to make sure you can continue to reinvest first, you can continue to pay 
your dividends first. And you have to have enough cash flow leftover to be 
able to take adva
ntage of opportunities like Randall mentioned today, an 
opportunity to give some more spectrum in the Nextwave transaction that 
we closed today.
 
And if you're comfortable with that, then you go into the decision of what 


basis and we will continue to do that. This is a unique time from a market 
perspective in that the cash costs of our equity are high compared to 

d that's 
the reason why we incurred slightly more debt than we usually carry.
 
Operator
 
Our next question in queue will come from Simon Flannery with Morgan 
Stanley.
 
Simon Flannery 

 
Morgan Stanley
 
I wanted if you could talk about the CapEx side of the equa
tion and you talk 
about 21 million just a mid
-
single
-
digit increase year
-
over
-
year. How should 
we think about that in the context of the analyst meeting and up to sort of 

over the 

achieving some of the goals. And could you be, be more specific about what 

rollout but perhaps on the wireline sid
e, should we be sort of hitting a third 
of the three
-
year targets over the next 12 months or any other color on that 
would be great? Thanks.
 
Randall Stephenson
 
So let me try and answer couple of your questions. First and foremost, the 
$22 billion we gave i
n November was 
--
 
that information went into a three
-

an engineering perspective and really work specific business cases in a more 

rtunities.
 
Quite frankly, we had more efficiency in our capital program last year and 
--
 
for example, we mentioned that today we have about 174 million POPs 

ahead of our achievement and s

that into account.
 

where the overlap between our wired and wireless projects in VIP are going 
to allow for some more efficiency. All of 
those pieces go into the guidance 

 
Specifically, with regard to achievements, we are expecting to get $250 
million POPs covered with LTE by the end of this year. We will also make 
--
 
we'
re not disclosing specific levels of fiber building or expansion of U
-
verse 
footprint this time but you can think about it as kind of ratable builds to 
schedule as we go forward.
 
And we are moving forward today with some of the fiber building efforts and 
m
oving forward, immediately hit 13 on very many of those velocity projects. 

financial flexibility, we will do as much as we can as early as possible.

UBS. Please go ahead.
 
John Hodulik

Hey, thanks. Maybe a question on the wireless side. During the year, you 
guys changed eligibility requirements in
 
the institute of these. Do you think 
that there is still some other levers you can pull that it could be used to 
enhance profitability. And then Randall, maybe as you look out over the 
year, there has been some significant changes in the wireless industry
. Do 
you expect to see any change in the level of comparison as we move 
through the year? Thanks.
 
Randall Stephenson
 
Good question, John. Certainly, we do believe that there are additional 
opportunities for us to focus on our cost structure, improve profit
ability and 
specifically in wireless. If you look at the changes to our upgrade cycle 
policies, they reduced our upgrades by about 5% this year. If you guys do 
the math, you will find itself in the 1 million phone reduction, 1 million 
upgrade reduction ran
ge. So it did have a significant impact in some of the 
other steps we took generated benefits for us.
 

well as evaluating cost structure opportunities and one AT&T type 
opportunitie
s for additional efficiency. So those are ongoing optimistic that 
those exist and that is part and parcel of our guidance when we say that we 

 
John Stephens
 
In terms of, John, the industry dynamics, it s
hould be an interesting year. 
There is a lot of talk and lot of press on the different industry players. And 

considering it internally is, probably, a little bit of open field runn
ing this 
year as T
-

timing is on that.
 

that transaction close, we expect there to be some dynamics in the 
marketplace that 
--
 


 


watc
hing, how it is received in the market place. And in terms of other 

--
 
it's hard to say what the dynamic will be. But I think it 
will be just a little bit of open field running this year.

Operator
 
Our next question in queue will come from Michael Rollins with Citi.
 
Michael Rollins 

 
Citi Investment Research
 
I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about the enterprise and 
the business environment, your exiting last year and early this yea
r, are you 
seeing any changes in the sale cycle or the competitive intensity and can 


 
are you 

just some add
ed color would be helpful. Thanks.
 
Randall Stephenson
 
I will start and let John chime in with some details but we are seeing little 
glimmer of hope on the enterprise side. It's really hard to predict this 
segment right now when you have continuing resoluti
ons and you have fiscal 
cliffs, and you have debt ceilings, and you have sequesters and people are a 
little bit stuck right now. And it's been this way for about six months. But 
when you look at the mid
-
level market and above we actually saw positive 
growt
h in the first quarter. We have not seen that in quite some time. The 
pressure on the enterprise segment is coming from small business and 
particularly state and federal governments and there the spending cycle is 
really slow. And obviously the spending is
 
down considerably. And so if we 
get through a lot of the budget situation perhaps you can expect to see 
some lift but our current expectation Michael is we build the plan around 

assumption.
 

from fixed investment increases or hiring.
 

some rather slow economic indicators and our hope is at this mid
-
level 
ente
rprise business and above that they will continue investing in 
productivity efforts because productivity efforts tend to require the types of 

uncertain right now.
 
John Stephens
 
Mik
e, the only thing I would add to that is that we are continuing to see 
some investment in strategic business, services and people willing to invest 
in growth. It is slow. And secondly, with our project VIP investment we hope 
to self
-
generate some changes i
n the small business by providing some 
additional broadband services and capabilities as we do with some of our 
fiber to the building, some of our expansion of our U
-
verse footprint and give 
us some opportunities on a self action 

 
self
-
led action to help 
increase our 


significant recovery.
 
Randall Stephenson
 

ittle bit obscured in how 
industry reports numbers. But we talk about enterprise being in decline on 
the fixed line side, when you look at the spend on the wireless side though, 

d 
is really being directed towards mobility and the world of tablets and the 
world of smartphones is really driving significant spend in enterprise 
business. So in total it is growing, the fixed line side is little pressured for 
the reasons we talked about
.
 
Michael Rollins 

 
Citi Investment Research
 
And just a follow up briefly, is there a way investors should think about how 
much of your sales on enterprise are now tied to wireless, is there a metric 
that you want us to keep in mind in terms of the demand 
from your 
customers to bundle the build together and work with you on a combination 
too?
 
Randall Stephenson
 

seeing in some of the VPN and cloud hosting services which are really part 
a
nd parcel generated by a lot of the employee mobility issues that the large 


chosen not to do that for cl
arity of information as opposed to we think we 
could draw some challenges, we'll rethink that, and continue to reaffirm right 
now. I think the way we get information is the clearest picture for you.
 
Operator
 
Our next question in queue will come from the li
ne of Mike McCormack with 
Nomura Securities.
 
Mike McCormack 

 
Nomura Securities
 
Thanks. John, just looking at the wireless margins as we progress into 2013 

--
 
John Hodulik's comments sort of hit on it as 
well, thinking about the 
impact on subsidies, well, we can change there. But 

color on that?
 
And then secondly, also regard to smartphones, is there going to be an issue 
eventually where we have smartphone pen
etration reaching heights that, 
when we start talking about record activations of smartphones are becoming 
sort of a bad word, meaning we are seeing more smart
-
to
-
smart and is 
there still ARPU opportunity to gain from the subsidy from that?
 
And then lastly
, again, John, thinking about the targeted leverage and the 
dividend payout, when you think about, how many shares you think about 
repurchasing over period of time, are you targeting an absolute reduction in 
dividend payment itself?
 
John Stephens
 
So let me
 
kind of go through, I guess, lot of questions here Mike, let me go 
through those. First and foremost, certainly the dividend reduction that 
results on the buybacks and as Randall mentioned, I think, this year we are 
going to stay close to $700 million in 
that because of the share buyback 
process is an important piece of it.
 
But quite frankly, it's not the controlling piece, certainly taking into 

balancing the capital structure in tod
ay's environment with some certainty 
for longer term while protecting our ability to invest, pay dividend and keep 
flexibility for things like we mentioned, whether it would be NextWave or the 
Atlantic Tele
-
Network acquisition that we recently announced.
 
T

lower than the cash cost of our equity and so that give us that opportunity. 


 
Secondl
y, with regard to smarthphone, once again, whether we are talking 
about percentage of sales of 
--
 
smartphones as a percentage of phones sold, 
which was up 89% this quarter or smartphones as a percentage of total 
postpaid devices, which was about 86%, eithe
r one of those is well above 
our smartphone penetration of about two
-
thirds today.
 
So we have a natural 
--
 
with the existing base we have a natural growth 
opportunity, just by converting those to smartphones and we've been 
growing that percentage of our po
stpaid base smartphones 2% to 3% a 

 
Two, as we are saying we added 400,000 tablets or nearly 400,000 tablets 
this quarter. So we are seeing the data
-
only devices, data centric devices 
like tablets draw gen
erating lot of growth, we believe that will continue.
 
Our LTE rollout, 74 million POPS and moving to 250 million POPS is going to 
generate speed, which we think will generate usage, which we think give us 
the opportunity because of our new usage in tier da
ta plans and the 
movement of our customer base to that will allow us to grow revenues.
 
So, we are optimistic about our position and then when you add on Digital 
Life, when you add on connected cars, when you add on the healthcare 
infrastructure that analysts talk about, when you add on the mobile premise 
solution or the home
-
based mobile phone.
 
All of those opportunities along with our mobile wallet are going to give us 
real chances to continue to grow revenue and at a scale base, 
when you are 
a player of our size. So we are optimistic about that.
 
With regard to the wireless margins and consistent with what John was 
asking earlier, we are just looking at every aspect of our arrangements with 
our customers of our service, trying to m
ake our service effortless but very 
efficient, and so we are looking at all of those and believe there is still 
opportunities to improve margins through making things easier on our 
customers while we are reducing costs on ourselves, so.

Our next question in queue will come from the line of Jason Armstrong with 
Goldman Sachs.
 
Jason Armstrong 

 
Goldman Sachs
 
A couple questions, I guess first for Randall, realiz
ing you obviously just did 
WCS and QUALCOMM, when do you envision the next opportunity to look for 
meaningful additions to your stock and portfolio, and if you look at the SEC 
and the current attempt to sort of better define the rules for you around 
spectr
um ownership and potential caps, how does that influence your view 
on timing? And then second question just for John, at the analyst day you 
guys obviously had pretty extensive detail and commitment on potential 
decommissioning of copper plant. As you star
t to get into those efforts from 
an engineering perspective and really gauge your response from regulators 
on the feasibility, how quickly do you think those efforts can progress and 
really translate into changes to the cost structure?
 
Randall Stephenson
 
H
i Jason, on the spectrum you'll see in all likelihood some additional 
purchases of spectrum this year filling in some holes. And so you will see us 
continue to do some of that during the course of 2013. But in terms of when 
the next meaningful block of spe


date. I hope that, that's accurate. I would be impressed and surprised if it 
were. Our expectation is that hopefully they can get into the market 
in the 


kind of I think made the spectrum caps issue I think far more interesting. It 
looks like Sprint is a
bout to secure a significant amount of spectrum, T
-
Mobile combining with Metro PCS obviously their spectrum depth and 
position is radically different.
 
And so our view and our expectation is as we get closer to a government 
auction that the need to do a lot
 
of evaluation on spectrum caps seems less 
and less relevant and it seems like there is going to have to play into this 
--
 
an equation of how much spectrum does an entity hold versus how much 
spectrum are they using and we continue to reinforce that spectr
um caps is 
the wrong way to think about this. The right way to think about this is 
ensuring that spectrum markets are fluid and liquid and that there are 
aggressive build requirements on spectrum. You put those two Things in 
place and you ensure kind of a 
market
-
based economic allocation of 

not anticipating any significant spectrum caps being placed that would inhibit 
any of the players from engaging in an auction in the future.
 
And wh
en you consider the situation that the federal government has right 

Congress would be most interested in having an auction that would yield the 
greatest benefits and the greatest ben
efits and spectrum caps do not go 
hand in hand.
 
John Stephens
 
Jason, with regard to the decommissioning capital plan issue, we continue to 
work that issue not only on a network engineering and our IT guys with 
regard to products and services and all the is
sues really the 

 
transitioning 
to an all IP service based providers but we are also working it from an 
external affairs on the regulatory side. I will tell you from a cost savings 
perspective that there are no significant cost
-
savings expected in this 
gui
dance that we gave for 2013. And I would suggest you that is a 

 
it is a 

years out in the sense of 

 
this is a longer process to work with all the 
interested parties and make s
ure we do it right, do it effectively and do it

Our next question in queue will come from th
e line of David Barden with 
Bank of America.
 
David Barden 

 
Bank of America
 
I guess two. First, John, could you, on the guidance change, the increase in 
earnings per share growth expectations from mid
-
single digits at the analyst 
day to now high single dig
its, could you clarify if that's more about the 
timing and pacing of buybacks, or is there something fundamental that's 
improved relative to your view that you gave I guess in October, and if you 
could kind of elaborate a little bit on what that is?
 
And th


lot of advantages relative to as you mentioned some of the interesting 
events that are going to take place thi
s year. But as you look at yourself 
relative to Verizon, they are taking three times the net ads that you took in 
the quarter, including tablets maybe four times, if you exclude tablets, they 
are guiding to 10% higher margins in 2013 versus what AT&T got i
n 2012. 
LTE is about a year ahead?
 
I mean, how do you think about trying to close the distance with respect to 
Verizon? Do you care and what do you prepared to do in terms of margin 

 
John Stephens
 
Okay. Let me take the increase in EPS first, first, I think the 
--
 
at the Analyst 
Conference, we were talking about a three
-
year cycle or three
-
year term. 
And so, that was the information we provided there and I think as we told 
you that 

--
 
there 
are different timeframes, different patterns just from the get go.
 
I will tell you, we have taken the account some of the really solid results that 
we had in the fourth quarters, specif
ically with regard to tremendous 
wireless sales and postpaid net adds, great performance on broadband and 
our consumer U
-
verse business, great performance on TV. So, and quite 
frankly, some really good news from our enterprise business sides.
 
So, we update
 
that, we take that into account and of course, we take into 
account our recent share repurchase, but really the answer your question, I 
think is more about we were talking about two different sets of time period. 
One was the three
-
year general information
, today is a commitment on 
guidance that we expect meet or exceed.
 
David Barden 
-
 
Bank of America
 
Got it.
 
Randall Stephenson
 
In terms of the comparison versus our competitors I think you asked the 
question do we care or think about it, you probably know us
 
better than to 
ask that question, and of course, we care, we think about it a lot and we 
focus on it and our objective is to not lose share throughout the course of 
this year and to 
--
 
actually get to a point where we gaining share vis

expansion and as we commented early on our guidance, we expect to 
expend our margin again this year, and so objective is to get our margins 
comparable to our competitors and also equa


industry.

Thanks Randall.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next in queue will come from the line of Timothy Horan with 
Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.
 
Timothy Horan

Oppenheimer
 
Thanks guys. And two for Randall while I have you. With the re
-
elected 
Obama administration, Randall maybe just some thoughts on what you think 
they might focus on. Are you optimistic or concerned a
bout any issues they 
might focus on? So one thing I have really scene is they seem to want to 
have much faster broadband speeds. Do you think there's anything they can 
do to really help the deployment?
 
And secondly, Randall, while we have you, I mean, Appl
e is still a very large 
percentage of your iPhone sales and it doesn't seem like the subsidies have 
really declined in that for the last six years. With Android catching up in 
terms of quality, it would allow more global consolidation, do you see a point 
w
here those subsidies start to decline and if so, when? Thanks.
 
Randall Stephenson
 

might expect, the current chairman has expressed obviously an interest in 
having broader broadband dep
loyment. We're actually very supportive. We 
would like to see the administration come out with a position that is very, 
very supportive of broad
-
based broadband deployment.
 
And in our VIP announcement, it fits perfectly in line with that and in fact, 
the a
dministration has expressed appreciation for our commitment to 


change how we view the industry right now.
 
I thin
k the biggest issues that could impact our industry and our company 
tend to be more macro policies in nature, tax policy for example. Do we get 
a big budget deal done and if we do get a big budget deal done, is there an 
appetite and an interest in doing ta
x reform? And we would obviously be 
very, very significant supporters of tax reform, we would really love to see 
the effective rate on profits come down and understanding that means some 
of the preferences like bonus depreciation may have to be compromised
 
but 

for the U.S. economy. So those are the issues that are probably most 
impacting to us.
 
I think other policy issues that are kind of unknown, they could affect the 
industry o
r us specifically the Affordable Care Act as those regulations were 


going to affect all others.
 
And so the ma
cro will be probably more important, Tim, and more relevant 
to us in 2013 than industry specific issues. As you think about subsidies, we 

marketplace. And we had a record quarter in
 
terms of selling Android 

into the market place.
 

vibrant, healthy set of options for our customers and the w
hole ecosystem is 

for competition among all the players which from our standpoint would 
probably be good for us as well.

Thank you. The final question will come from Brett Feldman with Deutsche 
Bank. Please go ahead.
 
Brett Feldman

Deutsche Bank
 
Thanks for getting me in. During the quarter, I 
believe, you were running a 
promo on your tablets. I think it was a $100 rebate, which sort of looks like 

experience with that? Did you find that it ended up having a meaningfully 
posit
ive effect on people buying tablets and attach them to their data plans 
or are you finding that the tethering option is accomplishing that without the 
cost?
 
Randall Stephenson
 

r
esults, you will see that we added just under 4000 tablets for the quarter, 
which is a significant number for us in the postpaid space. And we do believe 
that the $100 promotion was part of that and was part of the success.
 
When we looked at what those cus
tomers bought and what they added to in 
their mobile share or on their separate plans, we were pleased with the 
ARPUs that we got out of it and so we viewed it as a positive and think of it 
as a tool that could be really beneficial to help us grow the busi
ness from a 
data centric device.
 
Brett Feldman 
-
 
Deutsche Bank
 
So do you think you may get a little more of permanent feature in the way 
you priced tablets or just use it as a one
-
off motional from time
-
to
-
time?
 
Randall Stephenson
 

ok at that on a regular basis and decide it as we go 
forward with it. In the fourth quarter, the results were positive, not only on 
the sales activities but on the revenue commitments that we got out of it 
from a monthly basis. So the ARPU aspects of it wi
ll also more than 
satisfactory to us. So we felt like it was a very successful strategy.

Thanks for taking my question.
 
John Stephens
 
Thank you. With that, I want to thank all of you being on the call with us this 
afternoon. W

on the expectations that we laid out for you at the beginning of 2012. And 
as Randall mentioned, we are positioned well for 2013. We are focused on 
growth and have a solid achievable plan that 
will help us get there. Thanks 
again for being on the call and as always thank you for your interest in 
AT&T. Have a good evening.

Executive Officer, Randall Stephenson. Randall?
 
Randall Stephenson
 
Thanks, Brooks. Good morning, everyone. Before Rick covers our results, I 
want to take just a couple of minutes and offer my view of the business and 
what you should expect from us in 2011. And as you've seen in our release, 
we had a ve
ry productive 2010. Our revenues grew. We grew earnings. Cash 
flow was strong. We closed the year well, and we expect another solid year 
in 2011 with continued revenue growth, margin expansion and growth in 
EPS and free cash flow.
 
As we look ahead, our con
fidence in the industry and our business in 
particular continues to be very high. We've invested heavily over the past 
few years, and those investments are beginning to scale. And it's driving 
revenue growth and margin improvements, and you know what these
 
areas 
are. U
-
verse has driven growth in our consumer revenues now each of the 
last two quarters. And based on the results so far this year, we're adding 
more pay
-
TV subscribers than any other U.S. provider. Our VPN capabilities 
have proven to be a really 
strong platform for our strategic business 
services, and these services are going at a consistent mid
-
teens clip. And on 
top of these, mobile broadband is obviously our big driver. We just posted 
the best Wireless net add year in our history. In the fourth
 
quarter, our 
mobile data revenues grew better than 27%, and we've grown postpaid 
ARPU now for eight straight quarters. As mobile broadband phenomenon just 
continues to exceed all of our expectations, our industry has, frankly, never 
experienced anything q
uite like it, and we haven't even talked about 4G yet.
 
And as you know, we've completed our nationwide HSPA+ deployment, and 
where we combine that with advanced backhaul, we're getting 4G speeds 
today up to six meg. And we have planned to launch around 20 
4G devices 
this year, two in the first quarter.
 
And then on top of this, we've accelerated our LTE deployment. And when 
you combine HSPA+ with LTE, it's going to result in a much more consistent 
4G experience for our customers. And then on the business sid
e, when you 
take these mobile broadband capabilities and then layer on cloud and 
applications
-
based services, it really begins to let customers mobilize 
everything they do. So these are all large opportunities. They're scalable 
opportunities. And they're a
ll early in their growth cycles. And as you can 
see from our results in sales of tablet and connected devices and our strong 
growth rates and strategic business services, we're way out front in each of 
these areas.
 
Now, while the future Mobility will be dr
iven by broadband, mobile voice 
quality is, obviously, important. And over the last 45 days with our vendors 
finally clearing their backlogs, we brought online a significant amount of new 
capacity. And our call retainability across the country is up 20 bas
is points at 
about 99%. And we see even greater improvements in Manhattan and San 
Francisco, and you should expect voice quality improvement throughout this 
year. So that's just a real quick overview. Again, 2010 was a very productive 
year. We're executing
 
well. I expect another strong year in 2011 in our key 
platforms: Mobile Broadband, Business Solutions and U
-
verse. We think 
they're going to provide a nice platform for growth in the years ahead.
 
So, Rick, I'll turn it over to you.
 
Rick Lindner
 
Thank you,
 
Randall. Good morning, everyone. I'd like to start by providing a 
consolidated financial summary, which is on Slide 5. When you look at 2010, 
I think our financial results speak for themselves. They were strong across 
the board. Revenues for the year were
 
up 1.4% and 2.1% in the fourth 
quarter. Consolidated margins improved even with strong sales of integrated 
devices. And as a result, we grew adjusted earnings by 10.6% for the year.
 
In the fourth quarter, we had reported earnings per share of $0.18, and t
hat 
includes: $0.26 of pressure from the year
-
end mark
-
to
-
market change in 
our benefit plan accounting, which we announced a couple of weeks ago; 
$0.09 of pressure due to severance charges; and $0.02 of pressure from 
asset impairments. Excluding these one
-
time items, earnings per share for 
the quarter totaled $0.55, and that's up 10% versus the fourth quarter a 
year ago. And cash flow continues to be strong. Free cash flow was $3.1 
billion in the quarter and $14.7 billion for the year.
 
Now I'd like to take 
a look at revenue growth and revenue mix on Slide 6. 
Our fourth quarter consolidated revenue totaled $31.4 billion, and that's up 
$653 million or 2.1%. The drivers continue to be strong Wireless growth and 
U
-
verse, which is improving our Wireline Consumer 
results and continued 
strength in strategic business services. These trends continue to transform 
our revenue mix.
 
In the fourth quarter, 73% of revenues came from Wireless, from Wireline 
data and from Managed Services, and that's up from 65% two years ago
. 
Combined revenues from these sources were up 9% in the fourth quarter. 
And in fact, the fourth quarter marks the first time where our Wireless 
revenues have surpassed Wireline. We're confident that this mix shift will 
continue as mobile broadband continu
es to be a huge growth driver.
 
You'll see the impact of mobile broadband in our Wireless results, starting on 
Slide 7. It was another terrific Wireless growth quarter. Total Wireless 
revenues were up $1.4 billion or 9.9%, and Wireless service revenues grew
 
9.6%, up more than $1.2 billion versus fourth quarter a year ago. This was 
driven by continued subscriber gains and strong data adoption. Data drove 
our eighth consecutive quarter of postpaid ARPU gain, a record unmatched 
by our peers, up by 2.2%, and we 
continue to have the highest postpaid 
ARPU in the industry.
 
Churn, both total and postpaid, continues to reach or match best
-
ever 
levels. We also had our best net add quarter ever, adding 2.8 million 
subscribers in the fourth quarter. In fact, we had our b
est ever year with 8.9 
million subscribers added to the network in 2010, and that doesn't include 
those added through the Alltel property acquisition. Net adds in the fourth 
quarter were led by an increase of 1.5 million connected devices, the highest 
quar
ter ever. These devices bring lower ARPUs but attractive churn and 
margin characteristics.
 
Postpaid net adds for the quarter were 400,000. Prepaid net adds totaled 
more than 300,000, with strong iPad and Android
-
based tablet activations. 
In fact, during th
e quarter, we added 442,000 tablets to the network, and 
we also had a solid reseller quarter with nearly 600,000 new subscribers.
 
Our Data revenues continued their exceptional growth. The details are on 
Slide 8. We grew Wireless data revenues by more than 
27%, up more than 
$1 billion year
-
over
-
year. Integrated device sales, those are handsets with 
QWERTY or virtual keyboards in addition to voice functionality, are a key 
driver of this growth, and we had another incredible integrated device 
quarter, our seco
nd highest sales quarter ever. Signing up more than 7.4 
million subscribers, both upgrades and new customers, these sales netted 
3.4 million new 3G postpaid integrated devices in the quarter, and were up 
more than $13 million in the past 12 months.
 
Our res
ults also reflect another strong quarter for iPhone activations, with 
more than 4 million activated during the quarter, resulting in 90% of our 
iPhone base being under contract. And in addition, our other smartphone 
sales increased significantly over the p
revious quarter. ARPU for integrated 
devices continues to be strong, 1.7x our other devices, and these 
subscribers tend to be very sticky for us, with more than 80% of the 
integrated device subscribers on family
-
 
or business
-
related plans with churn 
levels
 
well below average. And the good news is we continue to have room 
to grow. About 60% of our postpaid base use these devices today, but our 
sales rate continues to increase and is now more than 80%.
 
Obviously, integrated device sales, along with high upgra
de levels, have an 
impact on margins. The details are on Slide 9. Within integrated devices, 
we're also seeing a shift to a higher mix of high
-
end smartphones, devices 
that use an advanced operating system such as RIM, Apple OS or Windows 
7. These devices 
tend to have higher subsidies than quick messaging 
devices, but they also bring higher ARPUs due to more robust data 
capability. And our customers continued to upgrade to higher
-
end 
smartphones in record numbers. In the fourth quarter, we had about 2 
milli
on more smartphone sales than we did in fourth quarter of 2009. And 
over 9% of our base upgraded their device in the quarter, signing a new 
two
-
year contract in the process, and I think that says a lot about the 
confidence and the loyalty they have in AT&T
.
 
Smartphone sales and upgrade levels did impact fourth quarter Wireless 
margins. In the quarter, Wireless OIBIDA service margin was 37.6%. That's 
flat sequentially and down from fourth quarter a year ago. And for the year, 
our OIBIDA service margin was 40
.7%. The offset to higher device subsidies 
is the long
-
term value these customers bring, including higher ARPUs, lower 
churn and strong data growth. And you see that in our Wireless operating 
income which was up more than 10% for the year to reach $15.3 bi
llion.
 
I'd like to turn now and cover our Wireline results, starting with consumer 
trends on Slide 10. This was another strong quarter for U
-
verse, and it drove 
our second straight quarter of year
-
over
-
year revenue growth in Consumer 
Wireline. We had 246,0
00 U
-
verse video net adds in the quarter, and we hit 
an important customer milestone earlier this month when we reached 3 
million subscribers. Broadband and U
-
verse Voice over IP attach rates 
remained very high. More than 3/4 of U
-
verse subscribers had a t
riple
-
 
or 
quad
-
play bundle, and the ARPU for these customers continues to grow, up 
14% year
-
over
-
year. As a result, our U
-
verse economics are attractive and 
growing. It is now a $5 billion annualized revenue stream, and U
-
verse 
exited the year with positiv
e impact on margins.
 
We also had another strong quarter in total broadband adds, up 210,000 
year
-
over
-
year. Our Wireline Consumer IP data revenues, that's U
-
verse 
services plus non
-
U
-
verse broadband, grew 30% for the year, and these 
products now 
represent 45% of total Consumer Wireline revenues, up 
almost 1,000 basis points over the past year. We expect continued U
-
verse 
growth and scale to drive further improvements in our overall Wireline 
financials.
 
Now let's take a look at business Wireline on
 
Slide 11. Here, we're seeing 
the same consistent trends impacting the business that we have all year. As 
the lack of growth and business formations and employment continue to put 
some pressure on the Wireline business, you see that in our fourth quarter 
s
ervice revenue results, which were down 4.3% year
-
over
-
year on a 
reported basis and 3.5% after adjusting for the third quarter sales of the 
company's Japan assets. We are, however, seeing some bright spots in our 
federal networks contracts and in our Whole
sale business, and we had our 
strongest quarter of the year in strategic business products. Revenues from 
these products including Ethernet, Virtual Private Networks and application 
services were up over 17%. And overall business IP revenues were up 9% in 
the fourth quarter and contributed to positive business data growth.
 
Plus, we continue to do well, selling Wireless into the business space. We're 
seeing a fundamental shift with more enterprises asking us to help them 
deploy full mobile solutions, solutio
ns that bring together mobile broadband, 
cloud computing, seamless access to applications and even social media. 
We're well positioned to lead in this transition, and we're excited about this 
future opportunity.
 
Now I'd like to take a look at margins and c
ash flow. Consolidated margin 
comparisons are on Slide 12. We said at the beginning of last year that we 
expected stable to improved consolidated margins when compared to 2009, 
and we delivered on that. For the year, our adjusted consolidated operating 
inc
ome margin was 18.5%, that's up from 17.7% in 2009. This reflects 
improving revenue trends in both Wireless and Wireline Consumer and solid 
execution of cost initiatives across the company. Our Wireline operating 
margin remains stable from 2009, and that w
as driven by improving revenue 
trends and good cost management.
 
Across the business, total force was down by more than 16,000, and we're 
making great strides with One AT&T. As we consolidate and integrate 
Wireline and Wireless operations under One AT&T, we
 
continue to drive 
down costs. These initiatives strengthen our ability to sustain solid margins 
and put us in a unique position among our competitors to serve customers 
seamlessly with a best
-
in
-
class operation. These initiatives have achieved 
expense sav
ings of more than $1 billion a year. And recently, we launched 
our next phase of One AT&T designed to simplify our product offerings, and 
we anticipate significant value from these new initiatives on top of our 
normal cost management efforts.
 
Along with so
lid margins, we also continued to deliver strong free cash flow. 
Our cash summary is on Slide 13. In 2010, cash from operations totaled $35 
billion, capital expenditures were $20.3 billion, with a more than 50% year
-
over
-
year increase in Wireless capital. 
Our free cash flow was $14.7 billion. I 
do need to point out that as we go forward and prepare to launch our LTE 
network in 2011, we will no longer capitalize interest for the radio spectrum 
we purchased to use for LTE. This will increase interest expense 
and reduce 
2011 earnings per share by $0.07, as well as reduce capital expenditures.
 
Dividend payments in 2010 totaled $9.9 billion, and over the last six 
quarters, we've generated almost $9 billion of free cash flow after dividends. 
In terms of uses of th
at cash, our debt level is down almost $6 billion over 
the past 12 months, with a debt
-
to
-
capital ratio of 37% and an adjusted net 
debt
-
to
-
EBITDA ratio of 1.56. Our strong balance sheet and cash flow gives 
us the flexibility to continue to invest in the bu
siness while returning 
substantial value to shareholders.
 
And with that, I'll now turn it back to Randall Stephenson for closing 
comments. Randall?
 
Randall Stephenson
 
Okay. Thanks, Rick. Before we go in to the Q&A, I just want to make a 
couple of additiona
l comments. Just looking back at the last three years, 
we've executed with a lot of discipline through this downturn, and we've 
marketed well. We've won customers. I think we've done a very good job on 
the cost side. When you look at the metrics Rick just 
walked you through, I 
think it's pretty clear that AT&T is coming out of the downturn stronger, both 
operationally and financially, than we were going in.
 
We have a better balance sheet, better revenue trends, better margins and 
a more growth
-
oriented busi
ness, and then all of this reflects solid execution 
by the people across this company. And as you look ahead, most important 
thing we've done over the past few years is that we've built and we've 
scaled some very nice growth platforms for the future. Mobil
e broadband, U
-
verse, VPN and cloud
-
based services, and we've invested very aggressively 
in all these areas. We've kept CapEx strong. We've acquired high
-
quality 
spectrum. And while we've done all of that, we've maintained the financial 
strength to return 
substantial value to the owners. We've increased the 
dividend now for the 27th straight year, and we authorized a stock 
repurchase.
 
So as we look forward to 2011 and I've laid this out for you on Slide 15, we 
have a solid plan to continue growing revenues,
 
earnings and cash flow. And 
so here are the variables: We do expect healthy contract subscriber growth 
in 2011 even with the introduction of another carrier for the iPhone. 
Obviously, this is going to make things a little bit harder to predict early on 
in
 
the year, but with the introduction of new Android and other devices, we 
think the smartphone market will continue to be very strong for us. And this 
is consistent with what you saw on the fourth quarter, which was our second 
highest smartphone quarter in
 
our history; we also had a strong fourth 
quarter in tablets and connected devices, we expect that momentum to 
continue through 2011 and beyond; we expect to expand our Wireless and 
our Wireline operating margins; and excluding the capitalized interest 
imp
acts, we expect 2011 EPS growth in the mid
-
single digits or better. And 
as the market settles beyond 2011, we have an opportunity to accelerate 
our EPS growth even further; we're targeting capital this year in the low to 
mid
-
$19 billion range, and we expec
t free cash flow will be up from 2010.
 
So this is an outlook that reflects the quality of the growth platforms. It also 
reflects our proven ability to execute on the cost side. And I'd add that it 
does not include any kind of significant lift from the econ
omy. And I'm 
hopeful we're going to see more from the economy this year. We're 
beginning to see a few encouraging signs. But we do not have any kind of 
economic turn built into our expectations and that just reflects our approach. 
As most of you know, we t
end to be very conservative in these areas. So we 
had a very productive 2010. We are confident 2011 is going to be strong as 
well, and what has me most excited is this industry's potential over the next 
few years and how AT&T is positioned here in the long
 
term.
 
So, Brooks, with that, I think we're ready for questions.
 
Brooks McCorcle
 
Okay, great. John, I think we're ready to open up the line for questions.
 
Question

and

Operator
 
[Operator Instructions] First, we'll go to the line of John Hodu
lik with UBS.
 
John Hodulik

A quick question on the guidance. I guess as it relates to the earnings 
growth for 2011, I would have expected something more of a 
--
 
I guess you 
could call it a loss of iPhone exclusivity dividend in terms 
of so much faster 
earnings growth. Maybe, Randall or Rick, could you talk a little bit about 
your strategy going into 2011? Obviously, a lot more smartphones, but do 
you expect that to 
--
 
and I know a lot of confidence about the group being 
able to grow th
e postpaid base, which I think is you don't hear a lot of, but 
do you expect to have to spend more or advertise or increase subsidies or 
how do you expect to 
--
 
is that really the difference there that margins 
might not expand as much as the lower iPhone s
hipments would probably 
suggest?
 
Randall Stephenson
 
John, this is Randall. I'll take it first and then let Rick add some color to it. 
But when you look at the guidance, there a couple of things that are 
underlying it and I just spoke to them. But just very
 
briefly, obviously, the 
economy, we are not expecting any kind of dramatic lift in economic growth. 
And this is 
--
 
we think it's fairly conservative. I think it's prudent that we set 
our cost structure around a slower economic growth scenario. But we're 
b
eginning to see some encouraging signs. Businesses are investing again, 
and we're seeing early indications of that. We are starting to see some 
hiring. But the reason we moderate this is business starts to continue to be 
negative across the country, and th
at's probably one of the best early 
indicators for us when this thing begins to turn. So we're hopeful as we kind 
of work through this first quarter and second quarter, we begin to see the 
business starts turn and with any luck, we'd get some upside from t
he 
economy there. The second area, though, is this idea of an iPhone going on 
to a second network. This is going to create some volatility in the first part 
of the year, and it's going to be kind of hard to predict the first part of the 
year as Verizon lau
nches an iPhone. But as I mentioned in the comments, I 
feel fairly confident we're going to be able to grow over the course of the 
year through the disruption, and there's a couple of reasons for this. And 
one of them is if you just look at the fourth quar
ter, it was no secret that the 
iPhone was going to be available on a competitor's network, and the 
competitive environment was reflecting that. And in spite of that, we had our 
second
-
best integrated sales quarter ever, and iPhone sales continued to be 
ver
y strong in the fourth quarter. In fact, it was among the best quarters 
we've ever done as well. We sold 4 million iPhones, and that just kind of 
gives us some confidence in terms of customer loyalty to the network. And 
so again, it'll probably
--
 
it may be
 
rocky in the beginning of the year, kind of 
volatile, hard to predict, but we think as we work, the market stabilizes, we'll 
be able to grow through it. The other thing is the sales mix will change this 
year. We have not been very aggressive in the Androi
d portfolio, and we're 
bringing Android into the mix very aggressively this year. You've seen some 
of the devices that we'll be bringing in. And so we're going to be a heavy 
participant in the Android market this year, and so you're going to see a 
signific
ant shift in mix. And then you add Windows 7 and RIMs products are 
actually starting to do very well and getting a lot of traction in the market 
and then our sales channels. We think were actually going to have a nice 
mix shift and do quite well in those a
reas. And then last, we're really starting 
to feel good about the network situation. We're making a lot of progress 
here. And as I commented in the opening comments, we had a significant 
clearing of backlog from our vendors in December. We were having some
 
serious capacity constraints in key markets, and we really saw the backlogs 
clear. And we spent the last 45 days literally just bringing capacity online in 
a rather dramatic fashion, and we're seeing those numbers move. And so 
you put all this together, w
e actually feel like, again, with a little volatility in 
the first part of the year, we can grow contract subscribers through the 
course of this year.
 
Rick Lindner
 
John, the only thing I'd add to that in terms of any color is obviously, as 
Randall said, th
ere is probably a little more volatility and it's a little more 
difficult to project this year in 2011 and certainly the first half of this year. 
But there is, obviously, there's an interplay in the modeling, in the guidance, 
in the expectations between 
--
 
in the Wireless side between volumes and 
mix of volumes and device sales and what kind of margins and earnings 
growth you expect. And as Randall said, as we look at the trends and we 
look at the trends particularly in the last quarter or two, what we're s
eeing is 
continued strong iPhone sales despite the anticipation of the iPhone being 
nonexclusive. We did over 9 million iPhones in just the last two quarters. 
That's a pretty phenomenal number when you think about it. That, plus the 
high upgrade rates we'v
e seen and the growth we're seeing in sales of other 
smartphones 
--
 
smartphones with a RIM operating system and a Windows 
operating system, the Android models we've got coming on into the device 
lineup in 2011, I think are very exciting. So our guidance is
 
based on a 
presumption that we're going to continue to see strong sales of 
smartphones, and we're going to continue to grow the business. We're going 
to grow it in customers, in ARPU and obviously, in revenues. In terms of how 
you compete in this environm
ent, again, we feel we're in a good position. 
We're going to have a tremendous device portfolio for customers to choose 
from. We've got a network evolution path, I think, that is 
--
 
will be the most 
elegant from a customer standpoint by having both HSPA+ a
cross our entire 
footprint as we roll out LTE. And then finally, as Randall said, we are seeing 
and expect to see continued significant improvements on the Voice side. So 
that's essentially the position that we'll compete from as we go into '11.

O
ur next question is from Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley.
 
Simon Flannery

Morgan Stanley
 
Just following up on that last question. Is there any change in the trends in 
January since the formal announcement of the Verizon iPhone? And then can 
we talk 
about the cost side of the equation? In '11, you had strong 
productivity performance, 16,000 head count reduction. Where are we in 
terms of ongoing opportunities, both Wireless and Wireline, in 2011?
 
Rick Lindner
 
Yes, Simon. It's too early, I think, to com
ment much in terms of January 
trends. You always have kind of a bit of a lull as you get past the holiday 
season. But again, we're seeing, I think, continued good sales activity. I 
think the iPhone 3G model at a $49 price point will be an attractive model 
for our customer base. And again, as you look at the fourth quarter activity, 
the level of upgrades we had, which is really the second highest level of 
upgrades and customers signing two
-
year contracts that we've ever had only 
surpassed by the third quarte
r of last year combined with the sales of 
smartphones, I think both of those bode well for the business in an 
environment where the iPhone is not exclusive. In terms of the cost side, 
and we touched on this a bit in the presentation, but we see continued 
o
pportunities, both in the Wireless and Wireline sides of the business, and 
it's driven by a couple of things. First, the One AT&T initiatives, which is 
really, it's been a series of initiatives over the last few years. And as we 
mentioned, we just, at the 
end of last year, kicked off a new set of One 
AT&T initiatives targeted at simplifying some of our product offerings. But 
these initiatives, if you step back from it over the last several years, have 
consistently been providing cost reduction on a year
-
ove
r
-
year basis in 
excess of $1 billion a year. And we see the same kind of opportunity going 
forward as we look into 2011 and 2012. But secondly, and this is kind of a 
broader piece of it and it gets to a comment Randall made in the 
presentation about the op
portunity to begin to accelerate some of the trends 
in the business as we get even past 2011, is we talked about the change in 
the mix of our business. And what you're seeing is that some of the growth 
platforms, and U
-
verse is a perfect example, those gro
wth platforms are 
beginning to scale. And just a natural part of our business, as those products 
and platforms scale, the margins improve. So we're seeing steady, 
consistent margin improvement there. And as we go forward and particularly 
as we get out past
 
2011, you start to see some of the drag on the business 
from legacy products like Wireline voice start to decline, and it's the 
combination of those two things that I think gives the business opportunity 
to begin to accelerate both in terms of revenues an
d margins as we go 
forward even past 2011.

Our next question is from Mike McCormick with Nomura.
 
Michael McCormack 
-
 
Bear, Stearns & Co.
 
You've done a pretty good job, you had obviously [indiscernible] integrated 
devices 
--
 
maybe just a comment on
 
postpaid ARPU growth. It looks like 
there's been about [ph] in here in the sort of mid
-
2% range. Do you guys 
have any expectation for acceleration there as we go through 2011? And 
then secondly, Verizon seemed to put up a pretty good quarter that 
contribu
ted to net adds using these MiFi devices for the iPad. Does that 
cause you guys to think about changing your strategy there?
 
Randall Stephenson
 
Let me start, Mike. This is Randall. In terms of ARPU, what's driving ARPU 
for the industry is moving these post
paid bases onto integrated
-
type 
devices, and we have been hitting this really hard for the last three and a 
half years. In fact, we're, by a sizable margin, way out front of the industry 
on this. We have more than 60% of our customer base, postpaid custome
r 
base now on integrated
-
type devices. And if you look at just the sales 
channel, the sales funnel, about over 80% of the sales into our postpaid 
base are on integrated devices. And then by the way, that number just 
keeps creeping up quarter in and quarter
 
out, and so I don't think 80% is 
going to prove to be the cap on what percentage of these bases have 
integrated devices. So we've got quite a bit of room to run just in our 
traditional postpaid base on ARPUs, and then those ARPU improvements are 
significa
nt when they move onto integrated devices. So we'll continue, as an 
industry, to push that, and we'll continue to move that along. I think 80% is 
going to prove to be a floor and not a ceiling. So plenty of room there. When 
you think about MiFi, we're sell
ing MiFi
-
type capability today. If you think 
about what those MiFi products are serving, largely they tend to be serving 
tablets. As you know, we have the 3G capability built into the tablets, 
predominantly, that we sell. And when you look at what we sold 
in the fourth 
quarter, we sold 442,000 tablets that are running on the network, and so I 
kind of compare the two. Those are equivalent. And so we're having very, 
very strong results in terms of selling tablets, and I'd tell you to keep in 
mind we're really
 
early on in tablets. I mean, this thing is still in its infancy, 
and we think this has a lot of room to run. And by and large, the tablet 
market is being dominated by the Apple products, the new stuff is just now 
coming online. And so you're going to see 
a lot of Android
-
type tablets come 
online, and that'll push that along as well. So we think we have a lot of 
opportunity in terms of tablets. And I would also tell you not to disregard the 
connected devices. This is a huge growth area for us. And so if you
 
think 
about ARPU being the first place we're obviously going as an industry. 
Smartphones and integrated devices, tablets are going to be a significant 
driver to revenue growth as we move forward. Connected devices are 
proving to be very powerful, and we a
dded 1.5 million of these in the 
quarter and kind of setting the pace for the industry. And I believe the 
connected devices products are going to accelerate as we move into 4G 
capabilities. So you put all those together, and it gives us a lot of 
confidence
, we're going to continue to grow this Wireless business for the 
next few years.
 
Michael McCormack 
-
 
Bear, Stearns & Co.
 
It does seem like the definition of the different categories of Wireless adds is 
making comparability a lot tougher these days.
 
Randall
 
Stephenson
 
Yes, I think it is, and we, probably as an industry, we're going to have to 
land on that. But I think just talking about tablets, it's going to be a category 
that's very, very important for everybody. And so we're going to give you 
more visibil
ity into that.
 
Rick Lindner
 
I think one of the strong things about the quarter, Mike, is that we did grow 
customers across every category. We grew customers in postpaid. We grew 
customers in prepaid. We grew it in reseller and as Randall said, had a 
record
 
quarter in connected devices. There is some comparability issues 
because, as you know, a large majority of the tablets that we've talked 
about, those sales were of the iPad and to the extent they're going to 
consumer customers, they tend to be under a pre
paid rate plan. But it's a 
plan where we're seeing good consistent usage and ARPUs from. But we put 
it in the prepaid category. So I think as you're comparing our results and as 
you're looking at growth, it's helpful to understand that or to put the two 
ca
tegories, the prepaid and postpaid, together from a comparative 
standpoint.

Our next questions from Phil Cusick with JPMorgan.
 
Philip Cusick 
-
 
JP Morgan Chase & Co
 
So let's focus a little bit on the Wireless margins. It doesn't seem like the 
guida
nce implies that, that moved toward or to low
-
 
to mid
-
40s like we've 
talked about. What's going to happen to get to that point, do you think? 
Number one. Number two, what's the sort of cost cutting potential within the 
Wireless business? Can you expand on 
that a little bit? And then number 
three, the upgrade policy here, so very aggressive, and I see Verizon pulling 
back a little bit. Is that part of what's required to get to that sort of mid
-
40s 
margin? And does it make sense to start pulling back here, or
 
do you give it 
another year to really upgrade your base before you start really tightening 
down on those upgrades?
 
Rick Lindner
 
Those are good questions, Phil. First of all, in terms of guidance and our 
expectations for Wireless margins, we finished the y
ear in 2010 at 40.7% in 
terms of OIBDA service margin. Our expectation going into '11 and beyond, 
frankly, is that we'll continue to grow Wireless margins. And so I don't think 
in terms of a longer
-
term basis or our expectation for that business longer 
ter
m hasn't changed. Our plan is to continue to grow the margins there, to 
grow it on a consistent basis and obviously, respond and compete in the 
marketplace. But there is an opportunity here, and it's important, I think, to 
take advantage of that opportunit
y to migrate your base up into higher
-
end 
data capable devices, and the upgrade policy is a part of that. But we'll 
continue to watch and see what's happening in the marketplace and make 
decisions that we feel are right for the company at the time in terms
 
of 
striking the right balance in increasing smartphone penetration, as well as 
managing upgrade cost. And that's purely what it is, it's a balance.
 
Philip Cusick 
-
 
JP Morgan Chase & Co
 
And what about the potential to sort of cut cost away from that?
 
Rick 
Lindner
 
Well, two things in Wireless. Like all of our businesses, as you continue to 
grow and scale, you have the opportunities to increase margins. I think a 
broader device lineup, and you see us even broadening the device lineup as 
we go into 2011, just 
naturally creates a more competitive environment 
among device manufacturers and gives you opportunities to mitigate and 
manage subsidy costs, which are important. A couple of areas, in addition, 
as we've pointed out, some of the incremental areas, the tabl
et sales, which 
come on generally at low to no subsidy levels, in many cases, offer good 
margin opportunities. The connected devices provide incremental margin 
opportunity. And on the cost side, the One AT&T initiatives that we're 
pursuing really allow us 
to reduce costs because we're combining 
organizations and processes that support both Wireless and Wireline 
businesses. So those benefits accrue both to the Wireline and to the Wireless 
portions of the business. So those are the things that give you the 
op
portunities to continue to expand the margins there. But we see a lot of 
upside in Wireless margins as we go forward over the next few years.
 
Operator
 
Our next question's from David Barden with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
 
David Barden
 
Two if I could. The first one, I just wanted to return to this ARPU equation as 
it relates to integrated devices and smartphones. Obviously, we saw a 2.2% 
postpaid ARPU growth in the fourth quarter. But if we look at the first half to 
the second half of th
e year, it's more like 1% growth. And if we look from 
second quarter to fourth quarter, it's actually less than 0.5% growth. And 
we've seen some of the strongest ever quarters that you guys have ever 
reported in terms of upselling customers and upselling i
nto integrated 
devices and smartphones. And so with the incremental competition we've 
got coming in 2011, what gives you guys the comfort that just doing more of 
what you've been doing is actually going to continue to create year
-
over
-
year ARPU growth? Bec
ause the trends seem to be really sliding towards 
little or no growth even now at this stage before the real competition has 
come. And the second question is, on the other side, Rick, I think you said 
U
-
verse is actually contributing positively to margin n
ow. Could you 
elaborate a little bit, is it positive margins or is it greater margins than the 
average of the Wireline base helping the overall total?
 
Rick Lindner
 
Sure, David. First of all, on the ARPU trends, I think I understand that the 
numbers you wer
e using 
--
 
I'm going to use a bit different set of numbers 
there, but I think we're talking the same thing. If you looked at our results, 
our postpaid ARPU growth in the first half of the year, we were in the kind of 
3%
-
plus range year
-
over
-
year and in the
 
second half on a year
-
over
-
year 
basis, it scaled down to kind of a low 2% range. There were two items that 
had some impact there. The biggest, the largest was the impact of 
regulatory fees and recovery charges that are embedded in the service 
revenue and 
the ARPU. And those fees and charges are just cost pass
-
throughs, and they do go up and down over time based on the costs 
incurred. And in the second half of the year as we reset those costs, the 
costs had gone down, and so the regulatory recovery charge w
ent down. 
And so that contributed to really the reduction of going from a 3%
-
plus kind 
of year
-
over
-
year ARPU trend to a low 2% ARPU trend. So when you kind of 
strip that aside, what you're seeing is Data revenues and the impact on 
ARPU has been 
--
 
continu
ed to be very good and very consistent through the 
year. So that gives us comfort going forward. And then on top of that, I 
think as you continue to see Wireless data traffic growth and you start to 
think about the opportunities in a 4G environment and the
 
applications 
there, as that usage grows, you will continue then to see growth 
opportunities in Data ARPU as well there. So that's kind of the ARPU trend. 
On U
-
verse margins, let me give you two data points. U
-
verse has crossed 
and looking at the business 
in total, including not just the recurring margins 
but the acquisition costs associated with customers, the margins are positive 
from an EBITDA standpoint. They are below the average Wireline margins 
but they are positive and they're growing every single q
uarter. And that's 
just a function 
--
 
that's just the normal course that happens when you have 
a base and the base is relatively small in the beginning, and you're adding a 
lot of customers, the acquisition costs overwhelms the recurring margins 
from that 
base. But we're definitely seeing that trend improve, and it's 
turned positive. But secondly, if you look at 
--
 
put the acquisition, customer 
acquisition cost aside for a minute, and to give you some idea of the 
capability in U
-
verse from a margin standpoi
nt, the recurring margins of our 
U
-
verse customers are well into the 40s, which is, obviously, on an EBITDA 
basis, significantly above our Wireline EBITDA margins. So again, that's what 
gives us, I think, comfort about the projected improvements and the 
op
portunity we've got with U
-
verse as it scales.

Christopher Larsen

Piper Jaffray Companies
 
First, I just want to make sure I have this clear. If you take the 400,000
-
plus tablets in the pr
epaid and then the 400,000 or so postpaid customers 
on a combined basis, we're in that range of about 800,000 units. Just trying 
to get back to that comparability issue. And then secondly, you exited fourth 
quarter with a year
-
over
-
year growth rate of arou
nd 2.1% and the full
-
year 
average was about 1.4%. What should we think about as we're going into 
2011, is there anything that should make us think that the growth rate in 
2011 on a top line won't be above that of what we saw in 2010, just given 
the exit ra
tio?
 
Randall Stephenson
 
Your comparison of our postpaid plus the tablets, I think that's a fair 
comparison. I don't have exact insight into some of the other folks' 
numbers. But you think about a tablet, which is running a $30
-
type of ARPU 
and put that wit
h our postpaid adds, the two together are probably a good 
comparison to what some of the others are doing. In terms of the top line, 
our guidance is really 
--
 
we should see top line growth comparable to what 
we saw in 2010. And again, so much of this is de
pendent upon the Wireline 
side of the house until we can get some economic lift on the Enterprise 
business side. I hope we get some upside surprise there. But we're just 
assuming a fairly low economic growth rate during the 2011 time frame and 
that we can 
get the Enterprise business side kind of moving towards that 
growth profile by year end. But right now, our current estimate is that we 
kind of keep the top
-
line growth rate about what we saw in 2010.
 
Operator
 
And next we go to Tim Horan with Oppenheimer.
 
Timothy Horan 
-
 
Oppenheimer & Co. Inc.
 
Can you give us an estimate on what percentage of your towers are fiber 
backhaul now and maybe at the end of the year? Secondly, just to clarify on 
Phil's question, Rick, on the iPhone. Do you have flexibility to end 
the one
-
year upgrade at some point in the next 12, 18 months? And then lastly, the 
access line trends were a little bit weaker this quarter. I know margins were 
a lot better. Were there some correlation there or anything else going on 
with the access line?
 
Rick Lindner
 
Tim, in terms of fiber deployment, we're in the low
-
 
to mid
-
20s in terms of 
deployment currently. We expect as we go through 2011 that number will 
significantly increase. We expect 65%, 70% of our traffic to be covered 
under fiber backhaul as
 
we get towards the end of '11. So you'll continue to 
see that increase. That will continually improve HSPA+ speeds. And 
obviously, it's the same infrastructure then that is used as we roll out LTE, 
and it is an important component. You've got to have both
 
the radio 
infrastructure, as well as the backhaul in place in order to maximize the data 
speeds in these networks. In terms of upgrades, what we did in 2010, as 
you know, in the second half of the year, is we did accelerate some 
upgrades by allowing custo
mers that would have been eligible through the 
end of the year to begin upgrading earlier in the third quarter. And as I 
mentioned before, we continually look at our upgrade policies relative to the 
economics of these customers, what the subsidy levels are
, what their usage 
ARPU and overall relationship with us is. And so I'm confident we're striking 
a good balance there from an economic standpoint, but we continue to 
evaluate it.
 
Timothy Horan 
-
 
Oppenheimer & Co. Inc.
 
And then the access line trends were a
 
touch weaker?
 
Rick Lindner
 
Yes. Actually, we were a bit better in terms of voice connections. I think 
we're seeing some improvement in the trends in voice connections in 
consumer. Some of that, obviously, doesn't show up in our access line 
numbers, Tim, b
ecause about 60% or so of our U
-
verse customers are using 
a Voice over IP product. So the revenues are comparable, but they show up 
as Data revenues as opposed to access lines in Voice. I think we did see 
some continued declines on the business side, and t
hat's a reflection, I 
think, of two things. It's a reflection of, again, business customers moving to 
IP
-
based services. But it's also just some continued weakness, particularly in 
the [indiscernible] of the market where we've not had strong growth or 
posi
tive growth in new business formations. And when you look at kind of 
our small business base in particular, actually we're seeing churn rates and 
outward activity go down and are very positive. But with negative new 
business formations, we're not seeing th
e level of inward activity that we'd 
like to see going forward, and hopefully, that will improve as we go through 
2011.

And that'll be from the line of Brett Feldman with Deutsche Bank.
 
Brett Feldman

Deutsche Bank AG
 
Just a few quick ones here a
bout your marketing strategy this year in 
Wireless. First, can you maybe give us an update on the experience you've 

you'd hope that it would do and maybe areas where you might evolv
e that 
during the year? And then the second, you talked about an increasing focus 
on Android, one of the ways some of your competitors have had a lot of 
success with that platform despite creating these proprietary 4G brands like 
Droid and Evo, are you con
sidering a similar strategy as well?
 
Randall Stephenson
 
On the marketing side, as it relates to tiered pricing, Brett, that has done 
everything we would have hoped, to be quite honest with you. As you've 
seen, our data ARPU trend, as Rick articulated, cont
inues to move along at a 
fairly steady pace. And what it has done, and I think you see this manifest 
itself in terms of our penetration of our postpaid base with integrated 
devices, it's opened up the integrated device market to a whole new 
demographic. An
d so that's one of the things that's really stimulated and 
accelerated the penetration of the postpaid base into smartphone. So right 
now, I like the structure of it. I like what we're seeing in terms of the 
customer behavior and the customer usage. And I 
really like how it positions 
us as we move forward into 4G networks, and then the ability to, as usage 
accelerates on these devices, make sure we have some capability to 
monetize the usage as we move forward. In terms of Android, we're 
probably going to be
 
doing a number of things. Android is going to become a 
very broad
-
based OS for our portfolio, and there will be some proprietary 
labeled products. But Android is going to be so broad
-
based, it's going to be 
hard to put it into one single category. And so 
you're seeing a number of 
things we're doing in terms of tablet devices coming out on an Android 
platform, this new Motorola, which is a really exciting device, the Atrix. That 
will not be a proprietary brand, but it will be an exclusive to us. And so 
ther
e's going to be a lot of activity around Android because it is such a 
broad
-
based platform that's going to be utilized in a number of different 
areas, and it's going to be a high priority for us as we move into 2011. 
You're going to see a lot of activity f
rom us in Android. So that's what you 
should expect. Now, with that, I guess I'll close by saying I appreciate 

outline for you our discussion today that I think we have a pretty g
ood plan 
for 2011. It's a solid plan. And it's got a conservative economic forecast built 
into it. It's the kind of plan that I think you've come to expect from us. You 
know our track record in terms of executing and delivering the types of plans 
we put in
 
front of you. And as I said earlier, our confidence in the industry is 
really high, and the confidence in our company's ability to execute is really 
high. So again, thanks for your interest in AT&T and participating in the call, 
and I look forward to talk
ing to you all. Thanks very much.

Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the AT&T 
First Quarter 2012 Earnings Release. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, 
today's call is being recorded. With that being said, I'll turn the conference 
over to Susan 
Johnson. Please go ahead.
 
Susan Johnson
 
Thank you, John. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our First Quarter 
Conference Call. It's great to have you with us. I'm Susan Johnson, Head of 
Investor Relations for AT&T. With me on the call today is John Ste
phens, 
AT&T's Chief Financial Officer; and Ralph de la Vega, AT&T's President and 
CEO for Mobility. John will cover our consolidated and wireline results and 
Ralph will give us an update on our wireless business. And then we'll follow 
up with Qs and As.
 
Le
t me remind you, our earnings material is available on the Investor 
Relations page of the AT&T website at www.att.com/investor.relations. I also 
need to cover our Safe Harbor statement, which is on Slide 3. This 
presentation and comments may contain forwar
d
-
looking statements. 
They're subject to risks. Results may differ materially. Details are on our 
SEC filings and on AT&T's website.
 
Before I turn the call over to John, let me quickly call your attention to Slide 
4, which provides a financial summary. EPS
 
for the quarter was $0.60, a 
5.3% increase over last year's first quarter EPS. Consolidated revenues were 
up once again, thanks to strong revenue growth in wireless, gains in U
-
verse 
services and continued improving trends in wireline business. Margins we
re 
up, both in consolidated and wireless, even with continued smartphone 
sales. And cash flow continues to be solid. Cash from operating activities for 
the quarter totaled $7.8 billion and free cash flow of $3.5 billion. We also 
began our share repurchase 
program in the first quarter. John will go into 
more detail. But for the quarter, we bought back more than $2 billion in 
shares. And with that overview, I'll now turn the call over to AT&T's Chief 
Financial Officer, John Stephens. John?

Thank you, Susan, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for being with 
us today. During our last earnings call, our Chairman, Randall Stephenson, 
laid out a few strategic focus areas for 2012. I would like to start this 
morning by giving you an update on
 
what we've done so far. The highlights 
are on Slide 5.
 
First, we had a terrific start to the year. In January, we talked about our 
ability to execute and grow the business and laid out clear objectives for the 
year. At the end of the first quarter, we rem
ain confident in our business 
operations and our ability to achieve guidance in every area. Second, we 
told you that we would begin buying back shares as part of our 300 million 
share authorization. We've done just that and we have done so aggressively, 
bu
ying back more than 67 million shares in the first quarter.
 
Third, we remain focused on improving our overall growth profile by looking 
at opportunities to divest or restructure low
-
performing and nonstrategic 
assets. You saw us take a step in this directi
on with the announced sale of 
Advertising Solutions to Cerberus Capital Management. We expect that 
transaction to close in mid
-
year. And we continue to look for other ways to 
improve the growth profile of our business. And fourth, we also spoke of the 
impo
rtance of spectrum, not just to us but to the entire wireless industry. 
We've taken action by acquiring additional spectrum through smaller 
transactions: 10 separate transactions closed in the first quarter alone and 
we have 4 more deals currently in proce
ss at the FCC. We also continue to 
maximize our network capacity and quality with existing spectrum through 
network management and tiered data pricing. Our LTE rollout is growing 
strong. So as you can see, we are off to a very strong start in executing the
 
plans we have laid out. And we remain confident in our ability to execute 
and grow the business.
 
Let's now take a look at first quarter operational highlights on Slide 6. No 
matter which financial metric you focus on, you see solid results. We grew 
revenu
e thanks to a strong wireless quarter and the best revenue growth in 
wireline consumer in years. Operating income margins were up across
-
the
-
board, consolidated, wireless and wireline. And we grew earnings in the mid
-
single
-
digit range. We also continue to
 
see impressive strength in all our 
growth drivers. Data growth, driven by the mobile Internet, leads the way. 
Ralph will give you the highlights in a moment, but let me give you a few of 
the headlines.
 
We continue to set the pace in smartphone sales. We a
ctually sold slightly 
more smartphones this quarter than a year ago, but our service margins 
were up significantly. We also had another record first quarter with branded 
computing sales, thanks to tablets and tethering plans. All this helped drive 
strong m
obile data growth of almost 20%, or more than $1 billion higher 
than the first quarter a year ago. Throw in our lowest postpaid churn in 7 
quarters, and you can see the strength of this business and of our mobile 
Internet strategy. We also continue to be p
leased with the extensive 
transformation of our wireline business. U
-
verse continues to make 
impressive gains. Not only did we hit 4 million TV subscribers, but we also 
had strong U
-
verse broadband sales. Year
-
over
-
year, business wireline 
revenue trends al
so continue to improve, thanks to another strong quarter 
from strategic business services. So you're seeing strong execution in every 
part of the business and a very solid start to the year.
 
With that as a background, now let's look at detailed results sta
rting with 
consolidated revenues on Slide 7. First quarter consolidated revenues totaled 
$31.8 billion, up 1.8% from a year ago. Our growth drivers continue to 
transform our revenue mix, including strong mobile data results, solid U
-
verse gains and improvi
ng trends in our wireline business. In the first 
quarter, 78% of our revenue came from wireless and wireline data and 
managed services. That's up from 74% a year ago and 70% just 2 years 
ago. And revenues from these areas grew almost $1.4 billion, or more 
than 
6% in the first quarter.
 
As I mentioned, we announced earlier this month that we have agreed to 
sell our Advertising Solutions and Interactive business units to Cerberus. In 
return, we will receive $750 million in cash, a $200 million note and a 
minor
ity interest in the new entity. If you want to take a look at what this 
quarter would look like without Ad Solutions, our consolidated revenue 
growth would've been 2.3% and our wireless and wireline growth drivers 
would contribute close to 80% of our total
 
revenue. We'll continue to 
sharpen our focus on our growth drivers and expect this mix transition to 
continue. I now would like to turn the call over to Ralph de la Vega, who will 
give us a wireless update. Ralph?
 
Ralph de la Vega
 
Thank you, John, and goo
d morning, everyone. I appreciate being on the call 
once again. Let me start with a wireless overview on Slide 8. As John said, 
we delivered a great set of wireless metrics in the first quarter. Our 
smartphone sales were slightly better than last year, whi
ch makes for a 
record first quarter. And we did this while facing more iPhone competition 
than ever before. Strong smartphone sales drive strong data sales and data 
drives this business. This quarter, data revenue was up more than $1 billion. 
That's almost
 
20% growth off of a large base. In fact, mobile data is a $24 
billion annualized revenue stream for us. I'm also really proud that even 
though our smartphone sales topped last year's record, our service margins 
increased significantly to 41.6%. And to top
 
it off, we also delivered our best 
postpaid churn in 7 quarters.
 
Let me give you more details on this quarter's result with a look at revenue 
and ARPU on Slide 9. Our leadership in mobile data continues to drive solid 
revenue results. Total wireless reven
ues were up 5.4% in the quarter and 
wireless service revenues increased 4.3% versus the first quarter a year 
ago. Postpaid ARPU also continues to perform well. Postpaid ARPU growth 
was 1.7%. And when you look at phone
-
only ARPU, it was up more than 2%. 
Thi
s growth has not only been consistent 13 consecutive quarters in a row, 
but we also continue to do this from a much higher ARPU base than anyone 
else. Helping drive that growth is our growing postpaid smartphone base. 
We now have more than 41 million smart
phones on our network. That's up 
nearly 10 million smartphones in just 1 year and ARPU for smartphones is 
90% higher than our non
-
smartphone subscribers. We also continue to bring 
in more subscribers onto our network with tiered data plans. Just over 25 
mi
llion or almost 61% of our postpaid smartphone base is on tiered plans, 
with more than 70% choosing the higher
-
priced plans. That is a remarkable 
transformation of our subscriber base in less than 2 years and a key factor in 
helping us continue to invest a
nd build our networks while returning value to 
shareholders.
 
Another positive metric for us this quarter is postpaid churn. Let's look at 
that and subscriber gains on Slide 10. Postpaid churn delivered its lowest 
level in 7 quarters. This lower churn is ti
ed directly to the quality of our 
network and the investments we've made to deliver the best customer 
experience. So at a time when there's more competition than ever, our 
customers continue to be loyal to AT&T. In fact, iPhone churn hit its lowest 
level i
n 5 quarters.
 
One reason for lower churn is the large number of customers on family or 
business plans. About 88% of smartphone subscribers are on these plans, 
and these customers tend to be sticky, with churn below our average. Total 
churn was up in the fi
rst quarter versus a year ago due mainly to churn in 
consumer
-
connected devices and in our reseller channel. But despite that 
increase in total churn, we added subscribers in every customer category 
and we've done that for 7 consecutive quarters in a row. 
As a result of great 
sales and lower postpaid churn, we added more than 700,000 subscribers in 
the first quarter. Postpaid net adds were 187,000, which gives us almost 70 
million total postpaid subscribers. Prepaid net adds were up 125,000. 
Reseller net ad
ds came in at 184,000 and we had 230,000 connected device 
net adds. That's lower than in past quarters for 2 reasons. In the first 
quarter, we saw more sales of WiFi
-
only computing devices and the ongoing 
adjustments we make for inactive devices.
 
Now I wou
ld like to take a look at mobile data revenue growth and 
smartphone sales. The details are on Slide 11. Data revenues were $6.1 
billion, up more than $1 billion from the first quarter a year ago. As I just 
mentioned, data revenues are now a $24 billion ann
ualized revenue stream, 
growing at nearly 20% a year. Data drives this business, and I firmly believe 
we're still in the early stages of mobile data growth, driven by the mobile 
Internet. We sold 5.5 million smartphones in the quarter or slightly higher 
th
an a year ago, when we set a first quarter record. Smartphone subscribers 
now make up almost 60% of our postpaid subscriber base and accounted for 
78% of postpaid sales during the quarter. These results reflect another 
strong quarter for iPhone activations
, with about 4.3 million activated during 
the quarter and about 21% of those iPhone subscribers were new to AT&T. 
These customers are choosing AT&T for a reason. We provide the best 
mobile Internet experience on the nation's largest 4G network, which lets 
iPhone 4S users download 3 times faster than our competitors. We also had 
a solid performance in branded computing devices. We added 460,000 in the 
first quarter, more than 1/2 of those came from tablets. We now have 
almost 5.8 million branded computing de
vices on the network, and that's up 
nearly 70% in the past year.
 
Now let's take a look at wireless margins. The details are on Slide 12. Strong 
smartphone sales usually impact margins. This quarter, the story is a little 
different. We actually sold more sm
artphones than we did a year ago, but 
our wireless service margin was significantly higher, about 260 basis points 
higher, delivering a service margin of 41.6% for the quarter. Some of this is 
due to the impact of the Alltel and Centennial mergers a year a
go. But about 
1/2 of the increase is due to management focus on cost containment and 
prudent spending.
 
We've taken other important steps that will have a positive impact on 
margins but aren't yet showing up in our results. First, the impact of new 
data pri
cing plans that we announced earlier this year was minimal this 
quarter. Second, there was also minimal impact this quarter with a higher 
upgrade fee that we announced in February. And third, we have yet to see 
the impact of the new upgrade policy that we 
introduced last year. We 
expect all of these to provide additional margin support going forward.
 
We'll continue to invest in smartphone subscribers. You know the long
-
term 
value they bring: lower churn, higher ARPUs and strong data growth. Our 
strategy has
 
been to grow this base, which we continue to do while keeping 
existing smartphone subscribers on our network. Handset upgrades were 
about 7% in the first quarter, which tracks nicely with our stable smartphone 
sales forecast for this year. We also saw a p
ositive lift in our wireless 
operating income, which is up more than 11% this quarter. We feel that 
much of our success this quarter in sales and churn can be tied back to the 
quality, the speed and the reach of our network.
 
And I would like to take a look
 
at operational improvements we made in this 
area during the first quarter. Highlights are on Slide 13. In the first quarter, 
the nation's largest 4G network became even larger. We now cover 260 
million POPs with our 4G network and we cover thousands more 
cities and 
towns than our closest 4G competitor. This means that we deliver the best 
mobile Internet experience to more of the country than ever. But you don't 
have to take my word for it. Last week, PCWorld released the results of our 
4G speed test and de
clared that AT&T's 4G LTE network delivered faster 
download speeds than any other carrier tested in the 9 markets surveyed. 
And that is great news. But it gets better. See, they also said that AT&T's 
ace in the hole was pairing our LTE and HSPA+ networks. 
PCWorld called it, 
""The fastest combination offered by any carrier."" And I can't say anything 
better than that. It really puts an exclamation point behind our network 
strategy and our goal of providing the best mobile Internet experience for 
our subscriber
s. Customers know this and they love our 4G network.
 
About 30% of our smartphone subscribers use a 4G
-
capable device, and that 
number continues to go higher as we introduce new and compelling LTE 
devices, such as the Nokia Lumia. At the same time, our LTE 
4G rollout 
continues to go well, 35 markets so far, including St. Louis earlier this 
month. We're on track to double our LTE coverage this year. And our LTE 
build will be largely complete by year
-
end 2013. We continue to look for 
ways to make the network e
xperience even better. Our enhanced backhaul 
build continues. 86% of our data traffic now travels on it. We're also making 
good use of WiFi and Distributed Antenna Systems. We have the largest WiFi 
network in the country, with nearly 30,000 hotspots and we
 
have 3,000 
Distributed Antenna Systems in high
-
traffic areas, such as arenas and 
stadiums. So we're off to a great start this year, and we are very excited 
about what lies ahead. With that, I want to turn it back to John to discuss 
wireline results. John?
 
John Joseph Stephens
 
Thank you, Ralph, and a great quarter. Now let's take a look at wireline, 
starting with business, which you can see on Slide 14. We continue to see 
improving business revenue trends. In fact, in many ways, we had our best 
quarter in y
ears. Strategic business services continue to lead the way. That's 
products such as Ethernet, VPNs and application services, which were up 
19% for the quarter and is now more than a $6 billion annualized revenue 
stream for us. That helped drive service rev
enues to its best growth rate in 4 
years, down only 0.3% compared to a decline of 4.4% in the year
-
ago 
quarter. And total business revenues were down less than 1%. And again, 
the best comparable that we have had in years.
 
A big factor of this success is ac
celerating data revenue growth. Its 4.2% 
growth was the best we have seen in years. Driving this are positive trends 
in almost every part of the business. Global enterprise had its fourth 
consecutive quarter of increasing data growth. Our wholesale busines
s 
actually grew service revenues in the first quarter for the first time in 3 
years. And revenue trends in small business continue to improve, with solid 
growth in bundles. This success helped our wireline business margins 
improve year
-
over
-
year for the fi
fth consecutive quarter. We are very 
pleased with these results. The progress has been slow but steady. And we 
still expect that wireline business will return to revenue growth this year, 
even without the benefit of a lift from the economy.
 
Let's now 
turn to our wireline consumer results on Slide 15. We have done 
an outstanding job scaling U
-
verse in the last few years. This has helped 
drive wireline consumer revenue growth by 1%, strongest revenue growth in 
years. Total U
-
verse subscribers, both TV an
d High Speed Internet, reached 
6.2 million in the first quarter. U
-
verse TV net adds continue to be solid, as 
we hit 4 million subscribers. TV penetration continues to expand, more than 
27% in areas marketed to for 42 months or more. And consumer U
-
verse i
s 
now an $8 billion annualized revenue stream, growing at about 38% year
-
over
-
year.
 
If U
-
verse was a standalone company with its annualized revenues, it would 
be in the Fortune 300. Not bad for a business that we started just over 5 
years ago. Meanwhile, o
ur U
-
verse broadband net adds continue to 
accelerate, more than 3x our TV additions, which includes new U
-
verse small 
business customers, where we grew subscribers this quarter. This helped 
drive overall broadband growth as customers moved from DSL to high
er
-
speed U
-
verse services. Faster broadband speeds plus mobility is a 
combination small business customers are looking for, and AT&T's strength 
in both of these areas is a competitive advantage. So all in all, a very solid 
quarter in wireline, both in busi
ness and in consumer, with improving trends 
in both areas.
 
Now let's look at margin and cash flow. Consolidated margin comparisons 
are on Slide 16. We said in January that we expected to deliver improved 
consolidated margins this year, with wireless margin
 
expansion and stable 
wireline margins. Our first quarter results show that we are on track. Our 
consolidated operating margin was 19.2%. That's up from the first quarter a 
year ago and sequentially, thanks to growth in wireless and consumer 
wireline reven
ues and operational efficiencies. We saw improving wireline 
revenue trends impact our wireline operating margin, which was up year
-
over
-
year. Also helping to offset declines in legacy services were solid cost 
management, scale in U
-
verse and solid executio
n with our One AT&T cost 
initiative.
 
Along with solid margins, we continue to have strong cash flow. Our cash 
summary is on Slide 17. In the first quarter, cash from operations totaled 
$7.8 billion. Capital expenditures were $4.3 billion, with more than 1/
2 of 
that invested in the wireless business. Free cash flow before dividends was 
$3.5 billion and dividend payments totaled $2.6 billion. In terms of uses of 
cash, total debt is down $3.8 billion from 2 years ago, with a debt
-
to
-
capital 
ratio of 38% and a 
net debt
-
to
-
EBITDA ratio of 1.48. We also began to 
aggressively pursue our authorized share buyback. In the first quarter, we 
purchased more than 67 million of our 300 million share authorization or 
about $2.1 billion worth of stock. We will continue to pu
rchase shares under 
the authorization, which could include open market purchases, structured 
programs such as accelerated share repurchase and other programs, 
including 10b5
-
1 plans where appropriate. When you look at both dividends 
and the stock buyback, 
we returned $4.7 billion to our shareholders in the 
first quarter alone. We are very proud of our financial management. Our 
balance sheet is sound, our debt metrics solid and our strong cash flow gives 
us the flexibility to invest, to retire debt, all the 
while returning substantial 
value to our shareholders.
 
Now before we get to your questions, let me close with a quick recap on 
Slide 18. First, we are off to a very good start for the year. We are executing 
well against the strategy we laid out in January 
while delivering a strong 
financial performance. We also continue to be a pacesetter in the mobile 
Internet, the wireless industry's #1 growth driver. Data revenue growth is 
strong, postpaid churn is down and smartphone and branded computing 
device sales c
ontinue to grow. At the same time, wireline is transforming 
from legacy products to IP data and is poised for growth. And our balance 
sheet is second to none in our industry, while returning substantial value to 
our shareholders through dividends and share
 
buybacks. So all in all, a solid 
start to the year, with growing confidence as we move ahead. Susan, that 
concludes our prepared remarks. We're ready for Q&A.

Morgan Stanley.

Morgan Stanley, Research Division
 
Ralph, impressive numbers on the churn. It's best in quite a few quarters. 
Can you
 
talk about the outlook for churn? Is this sort of a good new base 
level? Or do you think there's opportunities here to drive this further as your 
smartphone loading continues to build? And then John, you got the directory 
sale through. Can you talk about 
where we stand in reviewing the rural 
access lines?
 
Ralph de la Vega
 
Simon, let me address the churn question. Yes, I think there's room for 
improvement. I think we're always focused on that metric, which is a key 
metric that allows our business to grow in
 
every way. We think that the 
improvements that we're making in the network and in the customer 
experience are significant and that quite frankly, the best is yet to come. So 
I'm very bullish on keeping churn low and even performing better than what 
we hav
e seen here in the first quarter. I'm very bullish on the LTE network 
that we're building. As you heard me say, the PCWorld article is a great 
article that really tested our network in 9 cities head
-
to
-
head against the 
best in the industry and we came out 
on top. And so I am very excited about 
the prospects that a great LTE network with HSPA technology bring to the 
marketplace. I mentioned this in my earlier messaging, but I want to repeat 
it, that I think we're on the verge of a tipping point with the mobi
le Internet. 
IDC released the figures that last year at the end of the year, for the first 
time ever, the shipments of smartphones topped the shipments of PCs. And 
then when you add on top of that tablets, which are mobile devices, it's 
estimated that we h
ave reached the tipping point with the mobile Internet, 
that from here on out, you can expect to see more and more increases in 
people accessing the Internet through their mobile devices. And that plays to 
our strategy of building a great LTE network on to
p of our HSPA network, 
and then rolling out terrific new LTE devices like we just did with the Nokia 
Lumia. I think that combination of network, devices, applications, when you 
combine it with cloud computing and HTML5 capabilities, it says that 
customers 
are going to continue to access the mobile Internet in ways that 
we have not seen before. And that applies both to business and consumer 
customers. Our business team did a terrific job this quarter in adding 
subscribers and connecting them to the network. 
So we're very bullish on 
the outlook for the mobile Internet and churn. It goes a long way to say that 
customers love what we're doing in this area.
 
John Joseph Stephens
 
Simon, let me address your question with regard to our portfolio analysis 
processes on
 
specifically rural access lines. As we've said before and as I 
think you're aware, the key here is that at this time, we don't have a 
broadband solution for rural America right now. So over the next 12 to 24 
months, we'll spend 
--
 
we'll continue to spend 
time analyzing that situation 
and analyzing alternatives for it. I won't speculate about what conclusions 
we might reach or what impact that might have on our financial metrics. I 
will tell you that we are very aware and very proud of being known as a 
stro
ng, consistent dividend payer. And our philosophy in that regard has not 
changed.

Our next question is from John Hodulik with UBS.
 
John C. Hodulik 
-
 
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division
 
Maybe Ralph, just a quick question on spectrum. The deals t
hat you guys 
have done sound like they're helpful in addressing some of the spectrum 
needs you guys have. Could you maybe talk a little bit about it in, one, your 
potential interest in the B block that Verizon will be selling over the 700 
megahertz spectru
m they have, and maybe sort of needs going forward, 
especially as all this data traffic demand increases?
 
Ralph de la Vega
 
Yes. John, I don't think it's appropriate for us to speculate on what would 
happen with the Verizon spectrum. But we've said before, 
we prefer low
-
band spectrum. That is our preferred option. And we did get low
-
band 
spectrum with the Qualcomm purchase, which is something that we're 
looking to put into play with our LTE aggregation capability. And like John 
Stephens mentioned, we have be
en looking for small acquisitions, which 
we've done several in the first quarter already and we'll continue to look for 
more because we don't see this data growth slowing. I think I mentioned 
several times in the call that I think this mobile Internet is g
oing to continue 
to drive data growth. And so we're going to continue to look for the FCC and 
others to bring spectrum to market so that we can address the longer
-
term 
needs that we have, and quite frankly, that the industry has.
 
John C. Hodulik 
-
 
UBS Inve
stment Bank, Research Division
 
Okay. One quick follow
-
up. You guys did very well in terms of upgrade rates. 
It's 7% versus the 9% last year. And as you said on the call, you really even 
haven't even seen the benefits of the fee or the tighter upgrade stand
ards. 
Is that 2 percentage point difference year
-
to
-
year, is that what we could 
expect going forward? Or do you think that delta can expand as these 
initiatives kick in?
 
John Joseph Stephens
 
All right. John, as the way we look at it is I think we gave guid
ance that we 
expected smartphone sales to be 25 million for the year. That's what's been 
out there. That's what our expectations are. We're not moving off of that. I 
clearly understand the reasons for your question and so forth, but right now, 
we're going 
to stay in that range. I will tell you the things you mentioned are 
one of the reasons we have growing confidence in meeting our guidance and 
continuing to perform total company and in the wireless margin area very 
well.
 
Operator
 
Our next question is from 
Phil Cusick with JPMorgan.
 
Philip Cusick 
-
 
JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division
 
Two things on wireline and, I guess, the economy overall. Can you give us 
an update on what you're seeing in terms of economic trends, both in terms 
of business and then 
in also consumer housing? And also how do you think 
about U
-
verse growth going forward? What we hear from some people is 
concern that video slows down now that your addressable markets are sort 
of fully covered. Should we think about this 200,000 video add
s sort of 
continuing at a pace that it's been for the last year? Or should that slow 
down from here?
 
John Joseph Stephens
 
Thanks, Phil. From an economy standpoint, I would suggest to you that we 
-
-
 
as I mentioned before, we've not assumed any lift in the e
conomy 
throughout this year. And quite frankly, to date, I don't believe we've seen 
it. I think you know very well about the current status of unemployment 
metrics, interest rates, business starts. But I will tell you that a couple of 
things have gone on i
n the sense of we continue to see large business willing 
to invest in strategic services and the efficiencies they bring. And the uptick 
in the strategic services revenue growth year
-
over
-
year at 19% gives us 
confidence that, that's going to continue. So b
usinesses are willing to invest 
in those new next
-
generation products and services and efficiency. On the 
consumer side, specifically in the mobile area, I think our results speak for 
themselves in the sense of when you offer a good quality product, your 
c
onsumer, customer's not only willing to you come to you but willing to stay 
with you. And we've had great results there. On the U
-
verse side, we 
continue to be optimistic about our growth for the video product. As we 
mentioned, for those markets we're in l
onger than 42 months, we're at a 
27% and growing penetration rate, much closer to the 16% on an overall 
basis right now. So I think it's obvious that there's more opportunity. But in 
addition to that, we've been very pleased by the broadband additions that
 
have been available through the U
-
verse platform, over 700,000 additions to 
U
-
verse broadband in the quarter. And those not only help our consumer 
business but also help our small business customers. So that's our approach 
and that's how we're looking to 
that transition and the securing of that 
customer base with high
-
speed broadband.
 
Philip Cusick

JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division
 
Got it. For your 200,000 adds this quarter, would you say you're limited by 
sort of demand or by the ability of your i
nstalled base to go out and do the 
work?
 
John Joseph Stephens
 
I will tell you to get to the 200,000, our install team did a great job in 
coordinating with our sales team to not only get that level of installs 
completed but to do it in an efficient basis. A
nd so I would suggest to you 
that it's a positive response for the quarter in the sense of the coordination 
and the achievement. And quite frankly, I expect that type of performance 
and that type of cooperation to continue. It proved to be very successful 
for 
us in the first quarter. And I know the teams involved believe that and are 
going to continue that. So I wouldn't look to any, if you will, governor or 
limiter on either side.

And next, we go to Tim Horan with Oppenheimer.
 
Timothy K. Horan

O
ppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division
 
And just a follow
-
up on John Hodulik's question. John, maybe do you think 
the handset policies though are going to be impactful? I know you're sticking 
to your 25 million upgrade. But do you think they're meaningful
 
and maybe 
the timing of that impact? And then maybe the same thing on the wireless 
pricing front. I know you've made some pricing moves here. Have you seen 
much impact yet in the quarter? Or when do you maybe [indiscernible] start 
to hit the revenue state
ment? And lastly, on the pricing moves, do you think 
you have any other pricing moves out there over the next 12 months? Or 
you're in a pretty good spot at this point?
 
John Joseph Stephens
 
Let me try to respond to it and I'll ask Ralph to add to it as he c
an so 
capably do. First of all, we won't talk about any pricing initiatives going 
forward. Those are things that we wouldn't discuss on this type of call or 
publicly at all. With regard to the pricing changes we've had, we had one 
that came in at the end o
f January with regard to our tiered data plans. And 
while that went into effect, it had a very minor impact in the first quarter 
and it will come in as people renew their plans. So the impacts of it will be 
spread over many quarters. That gives us optimism
 
that we'll continue to 
see the benefits and growing benefits. But it won't give us an immediate 
--
 
and it did not give us an immediate benefit in the first quarter. Secondly, the 
change in the upgrade fees went into effect in March. And so we saw very 
lit
tle impact in the first quarter. We will see that throughout the year, but it 
is in place now. So we will see it for the full quarter in the second quarter 
and there forward. With regard to the handset policy, yes, I believe it will 
have a meaningful impac
t on us in managing those handset costs. But I 
think it's a very reasonable policy in comparison to the marketplace and will 
provide us the opportunity to continue to not only attract but to retain 
customers.
 
Ralph de la Vega
 
Yes. Tim, what I can add in te
rms of the pricing from a sales point of view is 
that we haven't seen any significant impact to any of the pricing moves that 
we've made. Our sales team continues to sell well. We have great traffic in 
our stores and we're very pleased with where that situ
ation stands. In terms 
of the handset policy, I think John said it all. But I do want to clarify that we 
typically expect handset upgrade volumes to fluctuate when there are new 
devices in the marketplace. They go up and down and they'll be subject to 
that
. That's no different than what we have seen in the past, but we feel 
really good about the forecast that we gave you for flat smartphone sales 
year
-
over
-
year at this point.
 
Operator
 
And we go to David Barden with Bank of America.
 
David W. Barden

BofA Me
rrill Lynch, Research Division
 
Two, if I could. Just first, maybe, Ralph, as we think about the second half 
coming up here, in the second half of 2010, AT&T took a lot of actions to 
lock down a good portion of the subscriber base to ensure that there wasn'
t 
a big market share swing with the launch of the Verizon iPhone. We're going 
to be coming up on the second anniversary of that in the second half of this 
year. And as you think about kind of more expensive upgrade policies and 
more expensive tiered plans,
 
what is your game plan for kind of tackling the 
risk of churn maybe in the second half of the year as those guys come up for 
renewal? And then the second question would be maybe for John, on the U
-
verse kind of overhaul, you guys talked about in the rural
 
markets making a 
big push, especially in small business to upgrade from DSL to U
-
verse. 
We've seen big swings, 700,000
-
plus U
-
verse Internet minus 600,000 DSL. 
How far through this process are we? How is that going to kind of evolve 
over the rest of the y
ear?
 
Ralph de la Vega
 
Yes. Dave, this is Ralph. Let me just try to address the first part of the 
question. I think what we're doing to address any concern in the second half 
of the year is what we normally do with the basics. And I really love where 
our ba
sics are in this business in that our network is expanding with 4G 
capability. It keeps getting better. Other people are saying it, customers are 
noticing it. You see that in our churn numbers, both for total postpaid and 
iPhone. So I think all the fundame
ntals are moving in the right direction. And 
I know we're going to get better on the network side. I also can tell you that 
I said briefly that we're working on the customer experience. I'm very proud 
that our retail team in the last several quarters have 
been ranked #1 by 
Nielsen in terms of their willingness to recommend in our retail stores. Just 
an incredible progress being made there by Paul Roth and the retail team. 
And so a combination of those 2 things is the best that we can do to ensure 
continued 
success, continued low churn, that is to give customers great 
service, both from a network point of view and from a customer service 
point of view. And we're very proud of those 
--
 
the progress that we've 
made in both of those areas.
 
John Joseph Stephens
 
D
avid, if I could add to what Ralph said. We had a significant growth in 
smartphones. We're up to 40 million 
--
 
over 40 million of our postpaid 
customers on smartphones. And I think the percentage is around 88% of 
those are on business or FamilyTalk plans. 
So while Ralph's got greater 
activity going on with regard to customer care, the customer rules approach 
and we have great developments in the network, we also have great pricing 
packages that we think customers will choose to stay because they're 
getting 
great bargains, either in our FamilyTalk or our BusinessTalk plans. 
David, with regard to your question on U
-
verse, where we are seeing this is 
in maybe the urban markets where our U
-
verse is built out. We have made 
significant progress in the area. Our br
oadband U
-
verse base is about 
--
 
it's 
just under 6 million customers today. And as we mentioned, we grew over 
700,000 in the quarter. So we're seeing a quick migration, which gives us 
confidence that we can compete with all broadband providers on speed and
 
price and quality of service. We would expect that this transformation, which 
has accelerated over the last year, will continue. And so we are optimistic 
about continuing to shift our 16 million broadband customers from legacy 
DSL products and services to
 
our next
-
generation U
-
verse high
-
speed 
broadband.

Our next question is from Michael Rollins with Citi Investment Research.
 
Michael Rollins

Citigroup Inc, Research Division
 
I was just trying to consider the prospects for future postpaid ARPU gro
wth. 
Can you discuss how ARPU's performing for customers who have had a 
smartphone for 1 year or 2 years? And also, are you seeing a significant 
difference in data usage and spending for those smartphone customers that 
are on a 4G
-
capable device versus a 3
G
-
capable device?
 
Ralph de la Vega
 
Mike, let me give you some thoughts on the future of postpaid ARPU. I feel 
very good about the guidance that we've given you to look for the 2% 
range. And I think we mentioned on the call that when you look at 
phone
-
only ARPU, that's actually already north of 2%. And what I really like about 
what we see with customers these days, and I want to make sure everybody 
gets this, our research has demonstrated to us that whereas a couple of 
years ago, customers are act
ually afraid to use some of these smartphones 
because of the technology, they were not sure they could deal with them. 
Two years hence, the feedback that we're getting when we do customer 
research on these smartphones say that customers now feel that these
 
devices make their lives easier. That's a huge, huge change in the attitude of 
customers. So they're accepting smartphones in numbers that we have 
never seen before. And the good thing about that, which is why I feel good 
about the trends for postpaid ARP
U, is that smartphones have ARPU that is 
90% higher than quick messaging devices or feature phones. So customers 
are loving these devices for their ease
-
of
-
use now. I think the ecosystem, 
the combination of the various OSs, the application developers and e
nabling 
networks that we're building are making it real easy, very low
-
latency 
networks, very great speeds are all leading to better usage. When you talk 
about better usage, then we see ARPU growth opportunities. And it's a little 
bit too early to tell you
 
what we're seeing in the trends between 3G and 4G. 
But generally, when we make faster networks available, we see that 
customers' usage grows. And that's why I like so much our position on tiered 
data plans, that we have over 60% of our customers now on ti
ered data 
plans. So if they want to use more data, they can use more data, and we'll 
see ARPU and revenue growth as a result of that.
 
John Joseph Stephens
 
Well, if I could add, I want to make sure everyone's aware, the 60% on 
tiered data plans is a change 
from 12 million customers first quarter last 
year to almost 25 million customers today. So it's actually double that base. 
And what we're seeing is 70% of those customers are taking the higher 
tiered plans. So as Ralph eloquently laid out the increase in u
sage, his team 
has also structured the arrangements with the customers that there will be 
[indiscernible] associated with that increased growth. So we feel like we're 
very well positioned there.
 
David W. Barden

BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division
 
And j
ust a quick follow
-
up. Are you seeing a significant upgrade rate for 
those to take low tier and then eventually move to higher tier? Or is the 
70% really just when they first pick their rate plans, 70% just choose the 
larger bucket upfront?
 
John Joseph Ste
phens
 
I think we are seeing some movement upfront, but we do see a fairly large 
take rate on the larger buckets on an upfront basis.
 
Ralph de la Vega
 
Yes, I think that the nature of these networks, Mike, because of their speed 
and their latency and the usa
ge, I think customers will trend to use the 
higher
-
tiered plans as they go to the higher
-
speed networks.

Our next question is from Jonathan Chaplin with Crédit Suisse.
 
Jonathan Chaplin 
-
 
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division
 
So 2 quick questions, if
 
I may. First, sorry to hop on the upgrade rate, but 
it's a key driver of margins for you guys for this year. So 7% is a 
phenomenal rate to start off the year. Looking at the trends last year, the 
upgrade rate improved in 2Q and 3Q. Should we expect that s
ame trend to 
continue this year? Or are we looking at an unusually low upgrade rate in 1Q 
after a very heavy upgrade rate in 4Q? And then the second question is just 
if you could give us a little bit more context around the split for CapEx 
between wireless
 
and wireline for the year? It looked like wireless came in a 
little heavier than expected this quarter. Wireline was a little lighter. I'm 
wondering if there were any anomalies in there or whether that's going to be 
a trend for the whole year as well.
 
Joh
n Joseph Stephens
 
Thanks, John. And John, we're not going to give a breakdown by quarter of 
any expectations with regard to the upgrade rate. I think we'll stick with flat 
year
-
over
-
year of smartphone sales, the 25 million number. So hopefully, 
that's help
ful to you. With regard to the CapEx side, there's the 3 buckets 
that we have. It's really the wireless, which took about 1/2 of our total 
CapEx budget, that's the direct wireless spend. Our wireline bucket, which 
took slightly less than 1/2. And then some
 
of our shared services, or if you 
will, dual
-
use projects, where we have shared usage by both wireless and 
the wireline business. I will tell you on the 2 point 
--
 
about 1/2 of the CapEx, 
you see we continue forward on a timely basis in line with our expe
ctations 
on our LTE buildout. That's going well. We're optimistic about that, and quite 
frankly, on the continuing service quality and expansion of our capabilities to 
our overall network in wireless. I think those results are showing up in churn 
as very p
ositive. And I think that's what Ralph was referring to before. But 
that's the basis for the spend.
 
Jonathan Chaplin 
-
 
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division
 
Got it. And so should we expect 
--
 
I think guidance is for CapEx being 
roughly flat overall. Should w
e expect roughly 1/2 of that to be wireless for 
the full year? Or does wireless ramp through the course of the year?
 
John Joseph Stephens
 
I think it will be that level or slightly more as we continue to move forward 
with our LTE buildout and other capacity
 
buildout, and quite frankly, as 
we've completed our U
-
verse basic build and initial passage of the 30 million 
homes.

Our next question is from Mike McCormack with Nomura Securities.
 
Michael McCormack

Ralph, can you just maybe comment on, you made a few comments about 
the ARPU story, but we've seen a reacceleration of growth quarter
-
on
-
quarter if we're looking at the data side, and that's before the price increase. 
And then secondly, on the voice side
 
of the ARPU equation, still declining 
pretty rapidly, although the year
-
over
-
year rate of decline is the same as we 
saw last quarter, which is the first stabilization we've seen. Maybe just walk 
us through your thoughts on what's happening on the voice si
de? What, if 
any, you have, for plans on changing plan structure to deal with voice or 
text migration or just lowering those buckets? And then final question, 
Ralph, if you would, thinking about the lower upgrade percentage this 
quarter, is there some corr
elation between smartphone penetration? 
Meaning, you've got enough people with high
-
end phones, but they just 
don't upgrade? Is there something to be said that, that can provide a benefit 
going forward?
 
Ralph de la Vega
 
Okay. Mike, let me address the first
 
one. I think that data is going to 
continue to drive our ARPU growth. And quite frankly, I think that it's hard 
for us to see a cap on that. I think that with the customer demand, the great 
applications, the great content that we see and the fantastic net
work 
capabilities that we're building to allow customers to consume that content, 
that's going to continue to drive growth for the foreseeable future. In terms 
of voice, what we're trying to do is stabilize voice. And we're beginning to 
see that we anticip
ate that voice will stabilize. We saw a little bit of an 
impact when we launched our free mobile to any mobile. But we anticipate 
that, that will stabilize. And then ARPU growth will continue to drive 
--
 
our 
overall ARPU growth data will drive our overall 
ARPU growth. And then in 
terms of the smartphone penetration, I don't have any additional insights 
that I can give you in terms of the higher end of the market. But typically, 
upgrades are triggered when there's a new device that people love in the 
market.
 
And that's why I mentioned that it'll go up and down by quarters, 
depending on what the customer needs are. But we feel very good about 
where we are right now and we always give the customers the choice. We 
think we have a terrific lineup in every operati
ng system, including the new 
Microsoft OS. And so we feel pretty comfortable that we've got a great 
capability to offer customers.

Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division
 
Ralph, I'm sorry, just on the voice commentary. I mean, is 
there a huge 
degradation for you guys if you just moved into an unlimited voice and text 
world? And I mean, clearly, the data part of that equation is much more 
costly from a spectrum and network utilization standpoint.
 
Ralph de la Vega
 
Well, we 
continue to look at those kind of options, Mike. We always try to 
look at that, and quite frankly, also continue to look at data, and how we can 
have data packages that address this changing trend that I mentioned with 
data usage. And we will address those
. But I don't think it's appropriate to 
release those details on this call. But rest assured that we're looking at the 
things that you mentioned, as well as others, to address the changing trends 
in this industry.
 
Susan Johnson
 
Okay. I think we have time f
or just one more question.
 
Operator
 
And that'll be from Jason Armstrong with Goldman Sachs.
 
Jason Armstrong

Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division
 
Maybe first, Ralph, you've talked a lot historically about the need to add 
spectrum. But when you look
 
at Verizon potentially at this point having to 
commit to sell some spectrum in order to buy additional spectrum, what's 
your interpretation for AT&T as we go forward? Do you sense an increasing 
risk that you have to think about things the same way as you 
approach 
spectrum deals? And then John, obviously very strong buyback numbers in 
the quarter, which has pretty significant benefits to the EPS stream over the 
course of the year and the ability to grow that. Would you expect this 
accelerated level of buyba
ck activity to continue from here?
 
Ralph de la Vega
 
Jason, in the spectrum area, I don't think that we need to abide by what 
somebody else may have to deal with because that's a very specific situation 
to a particular carrier. So no, I don't think we shoul
d feel like we have to do 
something similar should more spectrum become available.
 
John Joseph Stephens
 
Jason, with regard to the buyback question that you asked, first and 
foremost, we are pleased with the amount of buybacks we were able to 
achieve in the
 
first quarter. We had good market conditions, we had good 
cash flows. We're ending the quarter in a good cash position with over $2 
billion of cash in the balance sheet. And we were able to do that while 
retiring some more expensive debt during the quarte
r and calling some more 
expensive debt that we had. So all in all, we're pleased with what we've 
been able to do. We will continue buying back shares throughout the year. 
We are confident in where the company is going and our growth 
opportunities. The pace
 
at which we'll buy back is going to depend on many 
things: market conditions, continuing strong cash flows, financial flexibility 
and maintaining strong financial flexibility and our debt ratios. All of those 
things are in very good shape right now as we 
speak today and at the end of 
the quarter. So we're very pleased with that. But those things will continue 
to be monitored as we go through the year and will guide our judgment on 
buybacks.
 
Before we close, I'd like to quickly summarize the highlights from
 
this 
quarter. We're off to a really good start this year, which gives us confidence 
as we look ahead. We delivered strong financial metrics, strong mobile data 
growth and we continue to see encouraging trends and performance in 
wireline. One more item tha
t I'd like to bring to your attention. Starting with 
our next quarter, we're going to be moving this call up 30 minutes. So we 
will be discussing our second quarter results starting at 9:30 a.m. Eastern 
Time or 8:30 a.m. Central Time on July 24. That's it 
for us. I'd like to thank 
Ralph for joining us once again and especially for bringing such great mobile 
results to the call. And thank you for being on the call. And as always, thank 
you for your interest in AT&T. Have a great day.

Second Quarter 2012 Earnings Release. For the conference, all the 
participants are in a listen
-
only mode. There will be an opportunity for your 
questions, and 
instructions will be given at that time. (Operator instructions) 
As a reminder, today's call is being recorded.
 
With that being said, I'll turn the conference over to Susan Johnson. Please 
go ahead.
 
Susan Johnson
 
Thank you, John. Good morning, everyone, an
d welcome to our second 

Susan Johnson, Head of Investor Relations for AT&T. Joining me on the call 

update
 

 
Let me remind you, our earnings material is available on the Investor 
Relations page of the AT&T website, at www.att.com/investor.relations. 
Okay, I also need to cover our Safe Harbor statem
ent, which is on Slide 2. 
This presentation and comments may contain forward
-
looking statements. 
They're subject to risks. Results may differ materially. Details are on our 

 
Before I turn the call over to John, let me qui
ckly cover our consolidated 
financial summary, which is on Slide 3. As a reminder, we completed the 

8. Our reported results for this quarter and prior period still include Ad 
Soluti

our 47% continuing equity ownership in YP Holdings.
 
Reported EPS for the quarter was $0.66, a 10% increase both sequentially 
and year
-
over
-
year. The fundamental trends in our business co
ntinue to be 
solid. When you exclude the Advertising Solutions business, consolidated 
revenues were up 2% year
-
over
-
year. Thanks to strong mobile data growth, 
gains in U
-
verse, and advanced wireline business offering.
 
We had our best consolidated margin in
 
four years, with operating income 
expansion in wireless and wireline, both sequentially and year
-
over
-
year, 
and cash flow continues to be strong. Cash from operating activities for the 
quarter totaled $9.7 billion. Free cash flow was $5.1 billion. And our
 
share 
repurchase program continued in the second quarter. In the quarter, we 
bought back almost 76 million shares for $2.5 billion.
 

Officer, John Stephens. John?
 
John J. Steph
ens
 
Thank you, Susan, and good morning, everyone. It's great to have you with 

straight forward, all about executing our strategy and growing the business. 
In wireless, you can cle
arly see the benefits of our mobile Internet strategy. 
This has resulted in strong wireless data revenue growth, almost 19%, 
record high service margins with our EBITDA service margins hitting 45%, 
and our lowest churn ever, postpaid, prepaid in total.
 
In 
wireline, the transformation from legacy voice and data products to 
advanced data services continues at a solid pace. U
-
verse video and 
broadband continue to scale, while driving the strongest consumer revenue 

argins steady and improved 
wireline operating income, both sequentially and year
-
over
-
year even with 
few signs of a business recovery. This performance drove solid financial 
results. We grew revenue, expanded margins and increased earnings, and 
cash flow w
as very strong.
 
We also took steps to make our balance sheet even stronger, recall debt and 
reduce future interest cost by refinancing at favorable rates. And as Susan 

than $5 billion t
o shareholders through share repurchases and dividends in 
the second quarter, and close to $10 billion year
-
to
-
date. All in all, a very 
positive quarter, which puts us in a great position heading into the second 
half of the year.
 
With that as background, l

with the consolidated revenues on Slide 5. As you know, the sale of our 
Advertising Solutions business was completed in early May, so this second 
quarter did not have a full impact of Ad Solutions revenues.
 
And because we 
retained an equity interest in the business, we cannot restate past quarters. 
Even so, on a reported basis, consolidated revenues increased year
-
over
-
year, and if you exclude Ad Solutions from all periods, they were up $600 
million or 2%.
 
T
he drivers are: Strong mobile Internet growth, U
-
verse revenue growth of 
more than 38% and continued growth in strategic business services. When 
excluding Ad Solutions, 80% of our revenue came from wireless, wireline 
data, and managed services in the secon
d quarter. That's up from 77% a 
year ago, and 74% two years ago.
 
Revenues from these growth areas, these next
-
generation products and 
services were up about $1.3 billion or more than 5% in the quarter. We've 
made remarkable progress in transforming our bus
iness in the last few 
years, and we expect this mix shift to continue.
 
Now let's look at Wireless, starting on Slide 6. We have confidence in our 
mobile Internet strategy, our network and the ability of our team to execute 
and compete. After our second qua
rter performance, that confidence has 
only been reinforced. Margins were at record levels.
 
As you've seen, our service EBITDA margin for the quarter was 45%, and 
churn was at record lows, revenue growth was solid, thanks to gains in data 
revenues. This dro
ve our 14th consecutive quarter of postpaid ARPU growth, 
and phone
-
only ARPU was up more than 2% growing off a much higher 
ARPU base than anyone else.
 
We now have more than 43 million smartphone subscribers on our network, 
or about 62% of our postpaid base
, and smartphone sales continue to be 
strong. We also continue to bring more subscribers on to our network with 
usage
-
based data plans. It's been two years since we introduced these 
tiered plans, and we now have 27 million or about two
-
thirds of all 
smartp
hone subscribers on these plans, with most choosing the higher price 
plans.
 
Let's talk more about churn and net adds; details are on Slide 7. Postpaid 
churn hit an all
-
time low, dropping below 1% for the first time ever. We also 
had our best ever total in 
prepaid churn. There are a number of reasons for 
this, the quality and depth of our network, and improved customer 
experience, our focus on customer
-
friendly plans, and the fact that we have 
88% of our subscribers on FamilyTalk or business plans. For all t
hese 
reasons, customers are choosing to stay with AT&T.
 
We also continue to add new customers, 1.3 million in the quarter that 
includes gains in every customer category. Postpaid net adds were 320,000, 
an increase from the first quarter; prepaid added 92,0
00 subscribers. A solid 
reseller quarter netted us 472,000 new subscribers, and we have 382,000 
connected device net adds as well. These results are tied directly to the 
performance of our network, and the quality of the customer experience.
 
We now cover 2
75 million POPs with our 4G network, with more than a third 
of our postpaid smartphone subscribers using a 4G device, and almost 90% 
of our data traffic is on enhanced backhaul. This drives higher speeds for our 
customers and greater efficiency in our netw
ork.
 
Our 4G LTE build continues on track, and we now have LTE in 47 markets. 
Record low churn and strong sales tell the story of our wireless business. 
New customers are choosing AT&T and existing ones continue to stay with 
us in record numbers.
 
You can al
so see the strong performance in our wireless data results and in 
our smartphone and branded computing sales, which are on Slide 8. Data 
revenues were $6.4 billion, up $1 billion year
-
over
-
year. Data revenues are 
now at $25 billion annualized revenue strea
m, growing at almost 19%.
 
Smartphone sales were solid, and we continue to build our subscriber base 
with 5.1 million smartphones sold in the quarter. Smartphone subscribers 
now number 43 million, and make up 62% of our total postpaid base. But 
smartphones 
accounted for 77% of postpaid sales during the quarter, 
showing continuing opportunity for growth. And when you look at our total 
smartphone base, we've added 9 million high
-
value smartphone customers 
in just the last 12 months.
 
We also continue to activat
e more iPhones than any other carrier. We had 
3.7 million this quarter with about 22% of those subscribers new to AT&T. 
These customers are choosing AT&T for a reason, we provide the best 

 
Brand
ed computing sales also drive data growth. Sales continue to be strong 
in the second quarter. We had 496,000 net adds in the quarter, we now 
have 6.3 million branded computing subscribers, tablets and tethering plans 
on the network. And that's up more than
 
50% in the past year.
 
Last week, we announced our new shared data plans. We believe this will 
drive even more branded computing subscribers onto our network. But 
perhaps the best story this quarter is our wireless margins, details are on 
slide 9.
 


but to put that in context, two years ago our margins were about 200 basis 
points lower, and this quarter we sold
 
1.2 million more smartphones than we 

was twice that of non
-
smartphone devices, plus smartphone subscribers 
have lower churn and strong data growth.
 

 
that have a positive impact on margins. 


pricing plans we announced earlier this year also help drive revenues w
hile 
offering customers more data, and our continued focus on overall cost 
management.
 
All this helps explain the strong growth we saw this quarter with our 
operating income, almost 18% year
-
over
-
year and 13% sequentially. We are 
pleased with our wireless 
results this quarter. Our entire team had another 
outstanding wireless performance.
 

slide 10. Business wireline revenue was down 1.5% this quarter that 
compares favorably to a declin
e of 4.1% in the year ago second quarter. 
This business continues to be a multi
-


doing so, but others are holding off positions because they
 
are more hesitant 
to spend in uncertain economic times and small business formations 

results.
 
Large businesses or enterprise customers continue to invest in advanced 
data services. Th
is has led to improving revenues even without any lift from 

than four years. The growth was small, but still a positive trend.
 
At the other end of the spectrum, our small business r
evenue growth was 
down slightly sequentially once again challenged by the lack of new business 
starts. And our wholesale and government sector saw revenue pressure as 
some customers reduced legacy data connections.
 
We continue to see strong growth in strat

products such as Ethernet, VPNs, and application services, which were up 
13.5% for the quarter. This would have been even higher without the impact 
of foreign exchange. And IP data revenues were up more than 5% year
-
over
-
year
 
as well. This shows the businesses continue to invest in efficiency 
and in advanced data services even in this tough economic climate.
 
We also held business wireline margins steady by doing a good job of 
keeping expenses in check. A positive growth in ent
erprise revenues is an 
encouraging sign, but we are facing continuing economic headwinds. There 
is a great opportunity in this business, especially as we continue to transition 
to advanced data services. But based on the current business environment, 
the r
eturn to growth in revenues, they take longer than we originally 
anticipated.
 
You should also see the transformation to IT data in our consumer results, 
details on slide 11. We had another strong quarter with our U
-
verse 
services. So strong in fact, that w
e are seeing our best growth in consumer 
wireline revenues in more than four years, 1.7%. U
-
verse has transformed 
wireline consumer. We now have 6.8 million total U
-
verse subscribers at 
both video and high speed Internet. That includes 4.1 million video 
su
bscribers with a 155,000 added in the second quarter.
 
And we added more than a half a million U
-
verse broadband subs in the 
quarter as well. This includes new high speed broadband small business 
subscribers. And U
-

s now a $9 
billion annualized revenue stream, growing at about 38% year
-
over
-
year 
and we believe there is a lot of room for further growth. Overall video 
penetration is at 17% and continues to grow.
 
Now let us look at margins on slide 12. For the second qu
arter, consolidated 
margins were up both sequentially and year
-
over
-
year on track with the 
expectations we set out in January. Our consolidated operating margin was 

wireline revenues, o
ur continued focus on improving the customer 

ways to interact with us and doing a business in a way that customer 
prefers.
 
Wireline operating income margins also expanded both seque
ntially and 
year
-
over
-

margins for the year. Helping offset declines in legacy services were growth 
in U
-
verse and advanced data, solid cost management and execution of one 
AT&T initiatives.
 
We continue to keep a sharp eye on cost efficiencies and 
see more opportunity as we move ahead.
 
Along with solid margins, we continue to have strong cash flows and we 
have taken several steps to improve our capital structure. Our summary is 
on slide 13. I
n the first half of the year, cash from operations totaled $17.5 
billion. Capital expenditures were $8.9 billion with more than half of that 
invested in the wireless business.
 
Free cash flow before dividends was $8.6 billion and dividend payments 
totaled $
5.2 billion. In terms of uses of cash, total debt is down $1.2 billion 
in the quarter with a debt
-
to
-
capital ratio of 38.4% and a net
-
debt
-
to
-
EBITDA ratio of 1.42%.
 
We have been very active in the debt market taking advantage of favorable 
interest rates an
d our strong cash flows. We have paid off some debt early. 
We have called $7 billion in debt so far this year. We now have no debt due 
for the remainder of this year and only $3.5 billion due in 2013. At the same 
time, we continue to pursue share buybacks.
 
In the second quarter, we 
repurchased almost 76 million shares. So far, we have bought back more 
than 143 million shares or about half of our 300 million share authorization. 
That totaled $4.6 billion of stock.
 
When you look at both dividends and the stoc
k buyback, we returned nearly 
$10 billion to our shareholders in the last six months. And as always, any 
shares we purchase could include open market purchases, structured 
programs such as accelerated share repurchase and other programs 
including 10b5

structure. Our strong cash flow gives us the flexibility to both invest and 
retire debt. our balance sheet is sound, our debt metric is solid, and we 
continue to retu
rn value to shareholders.
 
Now, before we get to your questions, let me recap the quarter on slide 14. 
Our key growth drivers, wireless, data and managed services, now account 
for 80% of our revenue growing at a more than 5% rate year
-
over
-
year. Our 
mobile 
Internet strategy continue to click with strong smartphone sales, 
record low postpaid churn and the best service margins we have ever seen.
 
U
-
verse continues to power wireline consumer transforming the business 
with solid growth and record revenues. We als
o saw positive enterprise 
revenue growth even with no lift from the economy and we continue to 
strengthen our balance sheet while returning substantial value to our 
shareholders through dividends and share buybacks.
 
The transformation of our business took 
a major step in the quarter with the 
sale of our Advertising Solutions business and we continue to add to our 
wireless portfolio through spectrum acquisitions. Put it all together, we had a 
very strong quarter with continued confidence as we move into the 
second 
half of the year.
 
Susan, that concludes our prepared remarks, I think we are ready for Q&A.

Please go ahead.
 
John C. Hodulik 

 
UBS Investment Bank
 
Great, thanks. Two quick ones. First, John, just on your comments on the 
business market, you turned positive on the enterprise side, do you expect 
that to remain positive going forward and as the slight changes, some 
incremental weakness on the sort of lo
w end SME side? And then on the 

to be substantially complete with the buyback by year
-
end? Thanks.
 
John J. Stephens
 
Morning, John. Thanks for joining the call. Let me take the secon
d question 
first. With regard to the buyback, two things, we do expect to continue in 
the marketplace participating in buyback. That will be impacted by market 
conditions, continued strong cash flows, and the other factors that we 
spelled out. We have not 

any of the future quarters. But I think, as we said at the beginning of the 
year and on the January call, we are in a position with the cash on the 
balance sheet with the beginning of the year, and strong ca
sh flows this year 
that we have an ability to buyback a large part of the [authorized] share 
repurchase, and we'll continue to monitor that and continue to pursue those 
opportunities.
 
On the business side, we do have continued growth in strategic services,
 
and 
that growth is encouraging to us, but we are seeing business has to be very 
careful, seems like whether they are hesitant about the elections, about tax 
law changes, about the federal deficit, they have abilities to spent or 
encouraged by that, but th
ey are being very careful, we are seeing a lot of 
no decisions. So we're certainly hopeful to be able to continue our positive 
enterprise revenue story, but we'll have to prove that as well everybody 
else. We're still optimistic about our wireline business
 
and believe 
particularly our business revenues are going to be positive going forward. It 
just may take as a little bit longer than we would have expressed to you in 
January.

Our next question
 
from Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley. Please go

Simon Flannery

Thank you very much. Good morning. John, I wonder if you could update us 
on the status of the review of the rural lines, and also churn investment this 
quarter, you 
went through some of the factors driving that. How should we 
think about churn going forward from here, you had a pretty substantial 
drop 

 
is there more room for year

over
-
year improvements in that or if this 
is as good as you think you can get to? Thanks
.
 
John J. Stephens
 
Morning, Simon. Thank you. First, on question with regard to kind of our 

that, we've seen the continued movement on spectrum in 12 acquisitions of 
smaller acq
uisitions, why should we close a number of deals that are sitting 


 
from the strategy side, our 

improve some usability for some of the WCS sp
ectrum we owned. So, those 
are parts of the strategy.
 

soon as we have something for sharing, we will, but we are going through 
that process and we will continue to go through that proc
ess. Just want to 
be careful to make sure we complete that analysis and have a full story for 

 
Simon Flannery 

 
Morgan Stanley
 

still an option
 
rather than a choice at this stage, is that right?
 
John J. Stephens
 
Everything quite frankly at this stage is an option and we are looking at our 
whole host of different opportunities or different alternatives as you might 
expect, our shareholders would e
xpect from us.
 
Simon Flannery 

 
Morgan Stanley
 
Okay. On the churn?
 
John J. Stephens
 
On the churn side, it was very encouraging. It was not only encouraging on 
the postpaid, but it was encouraging that it was across the board, we saw 
improved churn. We are 
optimistic about our ability to hold onto those kinds 
of levels and continue to improve it. We will see as we go through some of 
the seasonality in the business in the second half of the year, how that 
impacted.
 

or a long time making significant 
investments over a number of years and improving the quality of our 
network. And our wireless team, including our business wireless team has 
put a lot of effort to improving the customer experience. So, yes, our 
networks g
etting better but the customer experience is getting a whole lot 
better, and so we are optimistic that we will be able to move forward 
building from this positive base.
 
But as we go on to the second half of the year and a part of the wireless 
business here
 

and see if we can meet our goals.

Thanks.

get 2% ARPU gr

by 

 
where we are at on the 1.7% so far this year including all the impacts 
of high margin, high profit, but lower ARPU data in ten devices and tablets. 
As we mentioned in the call, our phone
-
only 
ARPU was 2% this quarter.
 


done with regard to drawing the smartphone base by 9 million subscribers, 
converting
 
those lower ARPU subscribers that we had last year to 


that structure of tier data customers. We get better 
additional revenue, 

 
With regard to any shared data plans, we need not expect those to be 

 
we 
expect those to be accretive over time. We think the conversion of those is 
going to be measured over t

customer friendly, we believe in the old plans available to our customers and 

expecting it to transition in, but over time we expect it to be
 
accretive 
because it will allow, if you will our customers the more they share, the 
more they are going to save. And I think that will be good for both us and 
them.
 
With regard to our reporting activities, right now we're going to stick with 
our customer 



the best way to provide the information to a

Our next quest
ion is from Jonathan Chaplin of Credit Suisse. Please go 
ahead.
 
Jonathan Chaplin 

 
Credit Suisse Securities
 
Thanks, couple of quick ones, if I could. So firstly, it looks like your 
smartphone sales this year are trending well below where they were at this 
point last year. I'm wondering if that means we are on track to do even less 
than the 25 million smartphone sales that you expected for the year or if 
you are just expecting a blockbuster fourth
-
quarter with the new iPhone 
launch?
 
And then I'm just wonderi
ng if you could give us some context around what 
to expect for EBITDA margins? Given that trend, it seems like we should see 
an even lower upgrade rate next quarter, so sort of a seasonally up quarter 
for upgrades and with the iPhone launch you should be e
ven low next 
quarter, but expect margins to be even higher? And then I'm wondering 
what they could potentially be in the fourth quarter as well? Thank you.
 
John J. Stephens
 
Okay, Jonathan, good to hear it from you. a couple of things, one on the 
smartphone
 
upgrades and sales, a couple of things, one, we are seeing our 
policy kick in, change in our policy we told you about last year, we told you 


that. Quite frankly, I think in the first 
six months, our outsourcing effects of what would be considered a very 
healthy upgrade cycle fourth quarter of last year, particularly when the old 
upgrade policy of the shorter timeframe was still in place.
 
So I t

upgraded in the fourth quarter last year is 

 
helping lower or slow some of 
the upgrades in the first and second quarter of this year. We're not going to 
give guidance on specific EBITDA mar
gins or upgrade cycles for the second 
half of the year. we are going to 

 
we are sticking with our upgrade cycles 
being flat year
-
over
-
year. I openly recognized the fact that the map of the 
upgrade process is that we are running at a rate, trend rate for t
he first two 
quarters below that. but as we get these devices and have the seasonality of 


 
Jonathan Chaplin 

 
Credit Suisse Securities
 
Thanks, John.
 
John J. Stephens
 
As far as EBITDA margins, team did great 

 

they are at and about all the items that the actions that the team took to get 


 
on so
lid 
business focused, customer focused strategies, things that we can do at the 

grow EBITDA service margins year
-
over
-
year and that we expect that to be 
greater than 40%, and I unde
rstand how the comparisons look today, but 

 
Jonathan Chaplin 

 
Credit Suisse Securities
 
John, one point of clarification quickly, when you say sticking with guidance 
on smartphones, do you mean, y

sales for the year. The upgrade rate has to be down year
-
over
-
year right?
 
John J. Stephens
 
Yeah, so John, you make a great point. I appreciate the clarification. I think 
it will be 

 
the year would be flat year
-
over
-
year at 25 million.

Jason Armstrong with Goldman Sachs. Please go 
ahead.
 
Jason Armstrong 

 
Goldman Sachs
 
Great, thanks, good morning. Maybe just a follow
-
up, there is obviously 

John you just gave a 
lot of good data points. I think people probably still 
wrestle with, is this the result of policy changes versus is this just new 
handset availability or lack thereof, maybe another way of attacking this is, 
are you seeing notable changes in the percent of
 
subscribers that are eligible 
for an upgrade at this point, but are postponing decisions? Maybe that would 
be helpful as sort of gauge to what to expect of the next several of quarters. 
And then just second quick question, the union deal you recently sign

just wondering if you talk us through benefits from that deal and how they 
may change the cost structure? Thanks.
 
John J. Stephens
 
So with regard to the new 

 
the change in the trend for upgrades, let me 

nto one full quarter here with regard 
to 

 
this is the first quarter where the upgrade policy change has really 
impacted us. And as I mentioned before, the fourth quarter last year was 
unusually high, so there is some impact I think on the first and second
 

the upgrade policy is impacting 

 
the new upgrade policy is impacting 

 
Secondly, there maybe some im
pact quite frankly of the change in upgrade 
fee. It was a small change, but we 

 

suggest you that we can measure that.
 
Third, there maybe some impact from customers deciding to wait until the 

 


device may come out. So I guess the key for us, (inaudible) walk away with 
this is, it appears our policy is working, it appears our 
plans are working, we 
need to continue down this path. But when you look at the upgrade numbers 
and then tie in the churn, I feel really good about the policies are [working] 
in a customer appreciative or a customer friendly way.
 
So with regard to our rece
ntly announced tentative agreement with both the 

appreciative of their leaderships bargaining in good faith, we are 
appreciative of the efforts that both teams made in coming to a resoluti
on. 
And quite frankly, I want to point out the resolution in these contracts is 
right about the same week that we resolved these contracts three year ago. 

employees and their representati
ves.
 
We will let the details come out from the union and we will let them go 
through the process of ratification with the employees, which we are very 

employees, but we also th
ink it continues to make a rational progress in not 

good fair deal and it gets our employees interest and our shareholders 
interest aligned. More details to come out and hopefu


 
One other thing I want to add to is, if we're fortunate to get these, which we 

contracts and the I
BEW extension we've signed a few weeks ago that would 
bring 25,000 or more than 25,000 of our employees that whose contract 

good progress on that front.
 
And we look forward to worki
ng with the representatives from the West and 
the East, and quite frankly the Southeast in coming to resolutions on 
contracts with them. We're [pause] about this 

 
we have a lot of good 
people here, and we're looking forward to keeping them working.

Hey guys, thanks for taking the questions. John, maybe just a fol

behind the headcount is, both this past quarter and maybe for the rest of 
the year.

down the road for an AT&T. Are you guys abl
e to share any statistics right 
now about for instance what percentage of the base would actually, could 
actually generate over hedge either now or in the near future, the next year 
or two. I guess one of the questions everyone has is, we hear about the 
av
erages being large, but a lot of those people are still on a limited plan. If 
your average customer is only using 300 megabits, 400 megabits or 500 

could be many, many years before the
se tier plans kind of generate profits. 
Could you help kind of clear that issue up for us? Thanks.
 
John J. Stephens
 
Okay. First and foremost, on the employee count information if we could, 


 
if you will doing 
comparative numbers here. 
We did pull out the Ad Solutions employees from our employee base 
because of the transaction. And I think that maybe the biggest 

 

talking about a 4% change, it would have to be that, that explains the 
difference and that
 
was probably 

 

change.
 
David Barden

Okay.

if anybody think that really the impact of what

Two, customers are choosing the higher tier plans, whether that would be 
the 3 
gig or the 5 gig plans with 

 
and a clip of more than 70%. And so 


 



also comfortable with this because of our recent changes to the buckets 
where we increase the available amount of data to them with a slight
 

churn, is just another encouraging piece that we can serve customers well 
and still get ourselves set up for revenues that are going to be tied to usage, 
which will then be tied 
to our capital requirements and a really profitable 
situation.

Oppenheimer & Co.
 
Thanks. Good morning, guys. John, I seem to beat a dead horse here, but 
on smartphones the $25 million in sales maybe a touch more color on the 
outlook. Do you think, you can continue to control that over the next couple 
of years and at the same type of pa
ce and I guess the latest of that with the 

possibly still raise prices there maybe up to around the $50 price point or 
so? And then lastly on the handsets, it does seem like the 

 
all 
the subsidy is 
coming down I guess for the non
-
iPhone devices the average selling prices 

seeing any benefit from that? Thanks.
 
John J. Stephens
 
Yeah. So Tim, I guess just probably more ge
nerally than you prefer, I mean 
the handset as the smartphones and the subsidy issue is day
-
in and day
-
out 

kinds of things.
 
I would suggest to you that we believe that this is just t
he first quarter of 
the upgrade policy change being fully in effect. and so we are optimistic 
about our ability to continue to manage it, to measure it, to provide 
customers, not only to enforce it but also to provide customers the 
opportunity to buyout, i
f they want to upgrade before their cycle times. and 



 
s
econdly, with regard to the environment as new handsets come out, as 
things get more competitive, we believe there will be more rationale pricing 
in those 

 

disciplined actions of pricing [tags] or
 
our own disciplined actions of seeking 
out more cost advantageous devices. We need to continue to focus on 
lowering the costs or managing the costs of those subsidies.
 
At the same time, we have some very good customers who are willing and 
who desire, who 
want handsets, and are willing to entering the contracts and 

more than happy to continue work with them and continue to hold on to that 
customer base.

O
ur next question is from Michael Rollins with Citi Investment Research. 
Please go ahead.
 
Michael Rollins 

 
Citi Investment Research
 
Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I was curious if you could 
talk a bit more about, how do you think about t
he first half of free cash flow 
performance relative to the guidance of $15 billion to $16 billion for the 
year? And within that context maybe you could discuss directionally how you 
are seeing capital spending for wireline and wireless, the implications f
or 
cash taxes going into next year? And then last and not least is, just pension 
contributions and given the new laws, should we be thinking any differently 

 
John J. Stephens
 
Thanks, 




also with our CapEx guidance. And so 


 

and others that use CapEx were real efficient and real careful.
 
A
nd if you will, spent the money like it was their own to be careful in 


return more to a kind of normal 
spin, which will not only have a tick up in 


 
will also impact free cash flow.
 

-
by
-
quarter 
basis, I would suggest you, I think the situation for us is a little diff
erent 
over the long
-
term than others. First and foremost, most depreciation has 
gone away, but that impact will be spread over three years for us, because 
of the way to estimate favorables where.
 

enefits that we 
are going to get. The contract termination payments in the transfer 
spectrum we made and the pension funding we did in the fourth quarter of 

 
Probably more importantly tough is, i
f you think back to our 

 
an IRS 
settlement we entered into in September of 2010 for about $8 billion. If 

of cash tax benefits that are coming out of that settlement and that
 
will give 
you every year 

 
through the year, I think 2022. So, that settlement, which 
provides cash balance into the future.
 


e, and all the 

purposes, but they are deductible and amortizable for tax. So, we got a lot 
of things going on that are going to allow us to manage cash taxes and we 
put a lot of focus on 
that.
 
With regard to the pension funding in the highway bill/pension funding, a lot 


 
For 2013 going forward, certainly it could affect us, bu

about that. We have to see how our return on assets do this year. We have 
to see how our liabilities work out. I will tell you, our focus on the pension 

 

the change in the highway bill pension loss.

Brett Joseph Feldman 

 
Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
 
Thanks for taking the question. I just want to follow
-
up a little bit on CapEx, 

Could you 

that it would likely be on the wireless side in light of your LTE build out plan, 
but there are some wireline investments you need to make, that will be 
helpful color.
 
A

doing a fairly dense initial deployment of LTE, many are hitting quite a few 
sites or most of your sites with that build out. So how do we think about 
capital intensity in the wire
less business after that initial deployment is 
complete. Could we see CapEx tick down or are you relatively comfortable 
with the level of investment in the business and you would redirect this 
dollars and to say capacity deployment?
 
John J. Stephens
 
Great,
 
let me try to (inaudible) so one at a time, first of all we do a tick up in 
there, a step up in span of the second half of the year in CapEx, yes 

 
we 
expect that fits with our 

 
sticking with our guidance of about $20 billion.
 
Secondly, I think the 

 
whi

down quarter
-
by
-

the year we spent about 60% or so, close to 60% of our CapEx in wireless 

 
want to give any 
guidance that would move you from that.
 
I think the logical pieces there, things like the U
-
verse build and the fact that 

in that area, the consumer is for succes

explains why some of the wireline maybe moderating, and the LTE build and 
accomplish that process. And the importance of that too is, it shows, may 
give you some insights of the why CapEx on the wireless side maybe 
in

the best quality service to our LTE customers, and we think in the long
-
term 

strategy, we stuck with that, 

the customers are going to win, because that we decided to make that our 
strategy.
 
With regard to so to speak next year and future years, when you think about 
the fact that the LTE build is well on its way, I
 
think we mentioned 90%, 

roll it out, yes there is a logical thought that maybe you can lower CapEx 
and you just going forward. But we are sticking with our guidance of mid

teens a

of great opportunities in this business, we believe in the business, both in 
the wireline and the wireless business.

opportunities for that investment, I already discussed this specifics, but I

Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the AT&T 
Third Quarter 2012 Earnings Release. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, 

 

Johnson. Please 
go ahead.
 
Susan Johnson
 
Thank you, John. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our third quarter 

Johnson, Head of Investor Relations for AT&T. Joining me on the call t
oday is 

President and CEO for Mobility. John will cover our consolidated and Wireline 

follow with Qs 
& As.
 
Let me remind you our materials are available on the Investor relations page 

 
www.att.com/investor.relations
.
 
I always need to cover our Safe Harbor statement, which is o
n Slide 3. This 
presentation and comments may contain forward
-
looking statements. 


 
Before I turn the call over to John, let me quickly cover our c
onsolidated 
financial summary, which is on Slide 4. Reported EPS for the quarter was 

divested Ad Solutions unit we are up $0.03 or 5% for the quarter and 8% 
year to date. Revenue 
growth continues to be solid. When you exclude the 
divested Advertising Solutions business, consolidated revenues were up 
2.6% year
-
over
-
year thanks to strong revenue growth in Wireless, continued 
gains in U
-
verse Services and growth in strategic business 
services.
 
Consolidated margins were down slightly year
-
over
-
year due to higher 
smartphone sales. And cash flow was very impressive. In fact, it was at 
record levels. Cash flow from operating activities for the quarter totaled 
$11.5 billion. And free cash f
low was $6.5 billion. We aggressively bought 
back shares as part of our repurchase program. Through the end of last 
week we have bought back more than 271 million shares for $9.4 billion.
 

ncial 
Officer, John Stephens. John?
 
John Stephens
 
Thank you, Susan, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for being 

overview. Highlights are on Slide 5.
 
During the quarter, 
we continued doing an excellent job of growing the 
business, transforming our revenue streams, and improving our cost 
structure. We had solid revenue growth, consolidated Wireless and 
Consumer Wireline. We grew earnings, and we had our best free cash flow 
ever, both in the quarter and year to date. We also took a significant step to 
improving our funding status for our pension plans.
 
Last week we filed an application with the Department of Labor that seeks 
authorization to voluntarily contribute a $9.5 bill
ion preferred equity interest 
in AT&T Mobility into the Pension Plan Trust. We see this is a win
-
win 
situation for investors, our employees, and our retirees. This will increase 
funding well above the required level by law and further assure the long
-
term 
health of our pension fund. We will collaborate with the Department of 
Labor to provide any details it might need, and work to obtain approval 
before the end of 2013.
 
As we look at our operations, Wireless had another strong quarter. Ralph will 
give you mo
re details in a moment, but the headline was strong revenue 
growth led by the Mobile Internet, including our strongest post
-
pain ARPU 
growth in six quarters. And U
-
verse continues to be a great success story for 
us. We continue to add subscribers at a rapi
d clip. We now have 7.4 million 
total U
-
verse subscribers, both TV and high
-
speed Internet. This drove our 
ninth consecutive quarter of consumer Wireline revenue growth and our 
strongest growth in more than four years.
 
So the team is executing at a high le

taken steps to improve our capital structure, and all this puts us in a great 
position to continue delivering strong results as we finish the year.
 

 
revenues 
on Slide 6. As you know, the sale of our Advertising Solutions business was 
completed earlier this year. If you exclude Ad Solutions, consolidated 
revenues were up $0.75 billion, or 2.6%. The drivers are Mobile Internet, 
strong performance with U
-
verse and continued strength in strategic 
business services. These growth drivers now account for 81% of our 

years ago. This is up about $1.5 billion, or more than 6% year
-
over
-
year.
 
We expect this mix shift to continue as we sharpen our focus on our growth 
drivers and continue to successfully transform our business.
 
With that, I now would like to turn the call over to my good friend Ralph de 
la Vega, who will give us a Wireless updat
e.
 
Ralph de la Vega
 


give you a quick update on some strategic moves we made during the 
quarter that positio
n us for future growth; details are Slide 7.
 
First, we introduced Mobile Share, our new data plans that allow customers 
to share buckets of data with up to 10 different devices; second, we 
accelerated our LTE build putting us ahead of schedule with our dep
loyment 
plans; and finally, we announced an incredible new portfolio of 14 LTE 
devices that take advantage of that network including the launch of the 
iPhone 5. Let me give you a quick overview on Mobile Share.
 
Since we first offered this in August, we hav
e been really excited with the 
results. Customer response has been incredible, early take rates have been 
impressive, and in fact more than a third of Mobile Share subscribers are 
choosing the larger data plans of 10 GB or more. Plus, all customers love 
ha
ving the choice to take Mobile Share plans, keeping what they have, or 
choosing from one of our other usage
-
based data plans.
 
Now let me provide more detail on our LTE deployment with our network 
update on Slide 8. We made tremendous progress with our LTE 
deployment 

coverage this year, already reaching more than 135 million pops. Download 
speeds for LTE network have been blazing fast with speeds up to 12 Mb per 
second, and in many markets 
average download speeds are even faster. You 
can see this LTE speed boost with our Android devices where average 
download speeds have increased more than 50% since the first of the year.
 
With our combined LTE and HSPA
-
plus networks, we also have the nation

longest 4G network, covering more than 285 million pops and thousands 
more cities than our closest competitor. On our 4G HSPA
-
plus network, 

talk and surf at the same time on the iP
hone 5 and on all of our LTE 
smartphones.
 

quality improved by 16% year
-
over
-
year, and our dropped
-
call rate also 
improved by 34%. Having a great network and stable stakes in our in
dustry, 
and I also believe that we have the best selection of devices. The devices 

fourth quarter includes several devices using the new Windows 8 operating 
system including ou
r exclusive Nokia Lumia 920 and Nokia Lumia 820.
 
We will also be the only carrier offering new Windows 8 tablets from ASUS 
and Samsung. We also added great Android devices to our lineup, the HTC 

 
tablets. We 
also offer the Samsung Galaxy camera, which allows you to shoot, edit and 
share photographs and video easily and quickly without connecting to a 

their first mobile hot


bringing 14 new LTE devices to our product lineup arriving just in time for 
the holiday season.
 


results with a look at revenue and ARPU Slide 10. Our leadership in the 
Mobile Internet continues to drive solid revenue results. Total Wireless 
revenues were up 6.6% in the quarter and Service revenues were up 4.5%, 
o
ur best performance in five quarters, thanks to another great quarter in 
Data.
 
We also had our best post
-
paid ARPU growth in six quarters, growing at 
2.4% and phone
-

higher ARPU base than anyone else i
n the industry. Helping drive that 
growth is our expanding postpaid smartphone base. We have now nearly 45 
million of these valuable subscribers in our network and smartphone sales 
continue to be strong. About 64% of our postpaid base has smartphones 
now w
ith smartphone sales making up more than 80% of postpaid sales. 
The smart phones subscribers and driving strong data growth and those 
details on Slide 11.
 

$1 billion 
year

over
-
year. Data revenues are now at $26 billion, annualized 
revenue stream for us. And helping drive this impressive growth was 
another strong quarter for smartphone sales as customers continue to 
migrate to these devices. One of the reasons for stron
g sales was the 
introduction of the new iPhone. But we also sold a record number of Android 
and Windows phones in the quarter.
 
We sold 6.1 million smartphones in the quarter, and that compares to sales 

1.4 million high
-
value 
smartphone subscribers in the quarter and more than 8 million over the past 
year. We also had another successful iPhone launch quarter. We had 4.7 
million activations this quarter with about 18% of those subscribers new to 
AT&T and o
ur iPhone 5 sales were about twice that of our closest competitor.
 
We also continue to bring in more subscribers onto our network with usage

based data plans. More than 28 million or about two
-
thirds of our 
smartphone subscribers are on usage
-
based plans. 

than a year ago. Our mobile share plans are going strong and early sales 
have been positive. Nearly 2 million subscribers have signed up for mobile 
share plans in the first five weeks they have been available and take rates 
on the hi
gher data plans are stronger than expected. More than one third of 
our subscribers are taking plans of 10 GB or higher. And about 15% of the 
new mobile share subscribers are changing over from unlimited data plans.
 

 
gains on Slide 12. Those pictures 
also improved year
-
over
-
year to 1.08% continuing positive trends. In fact, 

even lower, less than 1%, even with the new product launch. One reason 
for 
the lower churn is the large number of customers on family or business 
plans and the newly launched mobile share plans. This continues to be a 
strong point with almost nine out of ten smartphone subscribers on one of 
these plans.
 
These customers tend t
o be sticky, with churn well below our average. We 
continue to add new customers, about 700,000 total net adds in the quarter, 
and our post
-
paid net adds were 151,000. We had a record number of 
iPhone pre
-
orders and tremendous customer demand in the 10 day
s of the 
quarter that the device was available, but we face significant supply 
constraints on the iPhone 5 in the third quarter, which clearly effects our net 
adds.
 

a new iPhone we 
see strong and immediate demand for it. But given the 
limited supply, the vast majority of third
-
quarter iPhone sales went to 
existing customers, where there was considerable pent
-
up demand. We 
anticipate that as we received additional iPhone inventory, th
e percent of 
gross adds for smartphone sales will increase as they have in past iPhone 
launches. We also anticipate a higher number of net adds from tablets in the 
fourth quarter.
 

iPhone launch 5 impacted margins compared to a year ago. These are 
premium subscribers for us and they bring lower churn, higher ARPUs and 

support margins even with strong sales. This i
ncludes our new upgrade 

launch quarter, upgrades held steady at about 7%. And we had changes in 
upgrade fees and early upgrade charges. These changes, as well as more 
smartphone sales,
 
help drive a 28% increase in equipment revenue. And you 
see these initiatives paying off this quarter.
 
Two years ago, we sold about the same number of smartphones that we did 
this quarter, but our margins this quarter were more than 300 basis points 
highe
r. And nothing shows the value of our smartphone base better than 
that. As we head into the seasonally strong fourth quarter, we expect 
continued strong sales of smartphones. But even with these expected sales, 

improve margins over 2011, 
targeting 40%. Year

John J. Stephens, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
 

you can see on Slide 
14. Consumer turned in another solid quarter. Revenue 
growth continues to accelerate. We had 2% revenue growth in the quarter, 
our best performance in more than four years and are ninth consecutive 
quarter of growth. Once again, the story here is the incre
dible growth of U
-
verse.
 
U
-
verse is now a $9.5 billion annualized revenue stream, growing at more 
than 38% year
-
over
-
year. We now have 7.4 million total U
-
verse subscribers 
as both video and high
-
speed Internet. That includes 4.3 million video 
subscribers 
with almost 200,000 added in the third quarter alone. And we 
added more than 600,000 U
-
verse broadband subs in the quarter.
 
Bringing our total year to date to almost 2 million. This increase in U
-
verse 
broadband subs helped drive total Wireline broadband A
RPU up almost 10% 
year
-
over
-
year. U
-
verse has transformed our consumer revenue mix. IP 
revenues now account for 59% of consumer revenue, up from 51% a year 
ago and 43% just two years ago. And IP revenues continue to grow at more 
than 17% year
-
over
-
year. Th
e success of U
-
verse establishes our ability to 
compete and gain share and gives us confidence as we continue the 
transformation of the Wireline business.
 

trends we began to see la
st quarter. Wireline business revenues were down 
2.6% this quarter. That compares to a decline of 2.2% in the year
-
ago third 
quarter. Last quarter, we talked about some business customers being 
hesitant to pull the trigger on buying decisions due to concer
ns with the 
economy. And this is essentially what we saw this quarter as well.
 


fiscal cliff. So overall, just a lot 
of uncertainty clouding business decisions. 
We, like every other business, hope to have some clarity soon. But in the 
meantime, we continue to focus on growing the parts of the business where 
customers are investing, such as on productivity, while at the s
ame time 
keeping a tight control on spending.
 

application services were up 11.4% for the quarter. And data revenues 
continue to grow even in this challenging environment. IP data reven
ues 
were up more than 3% year
-
over
-
year. Business Wireline margins also 
improved year
-
over
-
year, thanks to an excellent job by the business team of 
keeping expenses in check. So we have some bright spots even in a 
challenging economy. But we look forward t
o more clarity in the economy to 
get this business growing again.
 

are on Slide 16. As you can see, strong smartphone sales had an impact on 
our consolidated margins as well. For the t
hird quarter, our consolidated 
margin was 19.2%. That compares to 19.8% in the year
-
ago quarter, which 
did not include an iPhone launch. And if you look at year
-
to
-
date 

income margi
ns improved from a year ago, helping offset declines in legacy 
services were improving revenue trends in Consumer, solid cost 
management, and execution of our One AT&T cost initiatives.
 
We also made progress on several contracts with our represented 
employ
ees. We reached an agreement with the Midwest region in the Legacy 
T contracts. We also reached healthcare agreements with 40,000 mobility 
employees. And we continue to work on contracts with the other regions. 
One of the innovative features in our approve
d contracts is our success
-
sharing plan. While this plan does increase costs, this quarter and year

to

shareholders.
 

rter. Our 
summary is on Slide 17. Through the first nine months of the year, cash 
from operations totaled $28.9 billion. We are meeting and exceeding our 
build targets with capital expenditures at $13.8 billion, with more than half 
of that invested in the 
Wireless business. And free cash flow before 
dividends was $15.1 billion, a 22% increase from a year ago, a record 
performance for us, and dividend payments totaled $7.7 billion. With our 
strong year
-
to
-
date results, we now expect free cash flow to come in
 
at $18 
billion or higher for the year.
 
In terms of uses of cash, total debt is down $7.5 billion over the past four 
quarters with a debt
-
to
-
capital ratio of 38.6% and a net debt to adjusted 
EBITDA ratio of 1.42% to. At the same time, we have aggressively 
pursued 
our authorized share buyback. In the third quarter, we repurchased more 
than 100 million shares, and we continue to buy back shares. Through the 
end of last week, we had repurchased 271 million shares of our initial 300 
million
-
share authorization 
for about $9.4 billion.
 
When you look at both dividends and the stock buyback, we returned more 
than $17 billion to our shareholders. And as you may recall, our Board has 
authorized a second 300 million
-
share buyback in July. This demonstrates 
our commitme
nt to prudently restructure our balance sheet, to return value 
to shareholders, and our confidence in our ability to continue to generate 
cash. Our record cash flow gives us the flexibility to invest in the business or 
to retire debt. Our balance sheet is 
sound. Our debt metrics are solid. And 

 

where we stand on guidance that we first gave you in January. The detail
s 
are on Slide 18. In January, we laid out a solid growth plan and we are on 
track. Were growing revenues, expanding margins, and increasing earnings 
in line with those expectations. In Wireless, we are also on pace to improve 
Wireless service margins, and
 

postpaid ARPU is more than 2% for the year. In Wireline, we still expect 
stable Wireline margins even in this challenging economy. And thanks an 
outstanding performance of our U

verse team, we actually are ahead of
 
our 
forecasts for consumer Wireline revenue.
 
We did expect this Wireline to return growth this year, but as we told you 
last quarter that recovery is taking longer than we anticipated. And as I just 
mentioned, we expect free cash flow to be $18 billion or
 
higher. At the same 
time, capital expenditures for the year are now expected to come in slightly 
lower than previously thought, at the low end of the $19 billion to $20 billion 


re doing more with less. And as Ralph told you, we are ahead of our 

network build goals. We also have been buying back shares aggressively 
with available cash, while keeping our debt 

seeing a solid performance this year, even in a challenging economy.

Okay. Thank you very much. Good morning. 
John, I wonder if you could just 
spend a couple of minutes just talking through the rationale behind the 
actions you are taking on improving the pension funding position and why 
you chose that solution versus, say, other solutions And then, Ralph, 
perhaps 
you could give us more color on the mobile share. What are you 
seeing in terms of changing behavior? Are people really starting to add more 
devices now such as tablets to their plans? And is the share decisions and 
the dilution, if any, sort of in line wit
h expectations? Thanks.
 
John Stephens
 
Good morning, Simon, and thank you for your questions. With regard to the

a year in time, but far into the future. Third, if we would have put a large 
amount of cash into the

representatives of the 
DoL and had positive conversations with them on the 
possibility. When you put it all together and you can, if you will, solve or 
resolve funding for many, many years to come in a very cash efficient 
manner and join your employees in a form of ownership in

Ralph de la Vega
 
Thank 
you John. And Simon, the results from our mobile share plans are just 

mentioned on the call, the take rate, 2 million in five weeks, is outstanding. 
The fact that a third or m
ore of our sales are picking the 10 GB or higher 
plan says that the ARPU that we were expecting from these plants is actually 

dilutive. And in fact, this is yet to play out, but they co
uld be accretive. And

John Hodulik

Okay. Thanks, guys. Ralph, ma
ybe a question for you on the Wireless side 
and the iPhone. Have you thus far into the quarter seen those supply 
constraints that you talked about that shifted the sales into the base from 
gross adds, has that changed at all, or do you have better visibili
ty in terms 
of volumes into the holiday season? And have you seen that percentage that 
goes into the base versus into gross adds, has that started to shift? And 
then secondly, you listed a couple of drivers in terms of ARPU growth. The 
smartphone mix is on

you think this is rate that can accelerate from here, or is this how we can 
expect ARPU trends to continue through the next couple of quarters?
 
Ralph de la Vega
 
John, I think that what is happening with su
pplies of iPhones during the 
launch is what we typically have experienced. In these first few weeks after 
launch, there typically is a supply constraint. And then it usually eases up, 

what 

they slow down, and then they get more reasonable because of the process 

 


additional customers as supply becomes available. We actually have seen in 
days in which we have supply available reach 5,000 or 10,000 net adds in a 

fluctuati

confident like in other launches that, that inventory will become available 

 
In terms of the smartphone mix, I love what we have done. As we
 
mentioned in the report, we have added 1.4 million smartphones in the 

customers that were paying us feature phone revenues, and almost doubling 
their revenues to us as we add 1.4 million sma
rtphones.
 

smartphones in the quarter, which is up 1.2 million over a year ago and up 

mix of smartphones, 
which is a platform for future growth. And which by the 
way, John, we look forward to our meeting with you on November 7 and 

going to use that smartphone platform to grow a host of ot
her services that 
will allow us to grow ARPU.

Our next question is from Phil Cusick with JP Morgan. Please go ahead.
 
Phil Cusick 

 
JP Morgan
 
Hi, guys. Thanks. So I guess two, one for Ralph. First of all, the
 
voice device 
is flat, it is driven my iPhone. But there is essentially no growth in the Voice 
business today, or in the industry overall. How you think about this going 
forward? Are people looking for voice growth? Are we just looking at it the 
wrong way 
and really we should be focused on tablets for industry growth 

available in the industry?
 


g it back at multi
-
year highs on the stock. Are there 
other potential things to do with this cash, whether that be sort of invested 
back in the business and try and drive the business a little faster even? Or is 
that just not really possible or are there p
otentially acquisitions out there 
over the next year that you might start thinking about alternative uses? 
Thanks.
 
John Stephens
 

to the stock buyback, I think one thing you 
have to take into account with 
regard to the process is, for example, the shares we bought earlier in the 

alone. Because of our dividend rate the cash that comes back to the 
company, 

 
Two, we do a very disciplined approach at looking at our net present value of 
our cash flows out of our business and our business plans. We compare that 
to, quite frankly, what analysts and 
people think of the value of our stock. 
And then third, we compare it to our difference between our cash cost of 

follow it closely in making all our decisions to buy back shares.
 
Thir

but our debt ratios have actually come down. We continue to have great 

1.4 and our debt to equities well bel

shares with, so to speak, cash that would be sitting on the balance sheet. 

there is no lack of our ability to buy or to invest in our business. W
ere

up to that

John Stephens
 
And let me take the revenue question, though,
 
too. And I understand the 
customer account issues and so forth, but I really want to make a point from 

is 6.6%. Service revenue growth is 4.5%. ARPU growth at 2.4%, and when 
you t
ake out the data
-


when things like to churn are down And network build plans are ahead of 
schedule And your quality of your net
work is operating continues to improve 

different metrics to look at.
 

simply a finance perspective. Rev
enue growth in this environment at a 6% 
cliff is pretty impressive.
 
Ralph de la Vega
 


terms of an approach to
 


the best examples I can give you is our launch of Digitize that will happen 
next year. And it, again, leverages this huge smartphone
 
database and adds 
services on top of it and not just data access, but services that differentiate 


your car
 
with all kinds of entertainment services.
 
So I see this huge level of services that are over and above the basic access. 

to layer on top of that great smartphone platform...

Nomura Securities
 
Hi, guys. Thanks a lot. Maybe just this first question for Ralph, 

digging in a lot on ARPU and voice trends, but thinking about the ARPU 
reacceleration, you guys had the lowest voice ARPU decline on a percentage 


 
not pricing down to the buckets now like they were 
over the past year or so? And is there also a connection potentially for just 
seeing less family plan pressures going forward? And then a second one for 
John, if I can, looking at the deferred taxes resul
ting from the pension 
change, how should we frame that looking at the share repo as we look into 
2013? Thanks.
 
Ralph de la Vega
 
So, Mike, I think some of the things driving our pricing and the price moves 
we made almost a year ago where we increased our da
ta pricing. And that is 

data. And the fact is, as you sell more smartphones or more tablets, people 
need more data.
 
And the fact that we have a base that I think is the largest base 
in the 
industry with usage
-
based data pricing means as usage goes up, we can see 
some of that lift also coming from additional ARPU. So not only do we feel 

you have to have that bas
e of usage base in order to be able to monetize 
the data growth that we foresee in the future.

With regard t
o deferred taxes in the pension plan, the pension plan 
contributions as all pension plan contributions are going to be deductible.

making. In the sense of loweri


cash flows.
 
And that will all be taken into account as we make these regular evaluations 
of our buyback strategy. So certainly it will be taken into account.
 

mean the climate will make a decision one way or the other, but it is an 
important piece of it. And quite frankly, in an environment where there is 
some hope that in the next few years corporate tax rates may come down,

Hi. Thanks for taking the questions. A question for Ralph and question for 
John, first Ralph, if you could talk about the change in customer behavior 
with respect to device replacement, if you go back historically, it seems like 
th
e average for years was 24 months plus or minus for a replacement cycle 

wondering what your thought is on that. Is it just the change to upgrade 
fees or policies? Or is there someth
ing more profound happening where 
customers want to keep their devices for a longer period of time?
 
And then, John, just going back to the enterprise side, you mentioned about 
some of the uncertainty clouding business decisions, and I was wondering 
what ef
fect that has on pricing? Do you see some of your competitors trying 
to get more aggressive on pricing to force a decision from the customers in 

 
Ralph de la Vega
 
Mike, this is Ralph. Let me address the
 

customer upgrade cycles. First of all, I think some of the policy changes that 
we put in definitely have impacted some of that behavior. And our approach 
is to give the customer a choice. If they want to get in earlier upgr
ade, they 
can do so by paying us an appropriate amount.
 
But we also have done some research, Mike, that addresses that issue of, 


go through the 



some of the latest 


seeing a slight change with a small number of customers that are holding 

e not churning. 

 
John Stephens
 
Mike, with regard to the enterprise side, on the competitive landscape and 
the uncertainty. Quite frankly, in individual contract and proposal situations, 
we may see some
 


-
making process not being driven by 
the pricing aspect, but more being driven by this uncertainty. And so we 

e as a rational pricing 

always be unique situations, but generally speaking, rational and the lack of 

environmen
t.

Our next question is from Timothy Horan with Oppenheimer. Please go 
ahead.
 
Tim Horan 

 
Oppenheimer
 

for de
vice, how do you see that kind of trending out in the next few years, 

iPhone a little bit. Can you see those subsidies come down? And maybe just 
on that point, is there any wa
y really to reduce the subsidies on the iPhone?
 
And then, John, would you be willing to go above the 1.5 times debt
-
to
-
EBITDA? It seems really conservative in this environment. Thanks.
 
Ralph de la Vega
 
Tim, we work every day to look for devices that cost l
ess and carry less 

have all the features that customers want with less subsidy than we have 
seen actually in prior years. So we like the lineup that we have with Lumia 
devices comi
ng in from Nokia. They are very nice devices, and they fit that 
same mold. So I see more and more devices coming to market that gives us 
the opportunity to continue to work on subsidies, which is something that is 
at the top of mine.
 
But the way we want to
 
do it, is to have a great device that customers love, 


drive that down in the future as result of this gr


to make. And so we can pass some of those savings on to the consumer. 
And some of them we can use to actually reduce our subsidies.
 
John Stephens
 
Tim, wit
h regard to the 1.5 times debt
-
to
-

operating in that environment and with that as a policy guideline. But with 

very reasonable question to ask.
 
Let me give you these insights. One is, 


our average interest costs are coming down. You saw that in the t
hird
-
quarter results. And even in the third quarter interest expense results we 
included some call premiums are included in the interest expense line or 

 
So the interest
-

re 
should be some flexibility with that net debt
-
to
-
EBITDA ratio. The reality of it 
is, at this point in time, our cash flows have been so strong that they have 

existing cash, while not o
nly holding but quite frankly, improving debt
-
to
-
 
EBITDA. But very directly, we actively look at it. We actively look at it, not 
just from the traditional debt ratios standards, but also from the cost of 
interest and how that might affect our ability to es
tablish debt ratios. And

Our next question is from Jason Armstrong with Goldman Sachs. Please go 
ahead.
 
Jason Armstrong 

 
Goldman Sachs
 
Great. Thanks. Good morning. A couple of questions, maybe first for John, 
just on cash flow the extra sort of $2 billion plus, and maybe you can help us 
think through granularity on the bridge to get there between sort of better 
operating profit level vers
us lower cash taxes, lower CapEx, et cetera? And 
then the second question is for Ralph. I think one of the most interesting 
stats in the release as you pointed to is that a third of mobile share subs 
taking 10 gigs or higher.
 
When you look at that compared
 
to wired broadband averages, which are 
sort of in that range, does this cause you to think differently about how 
these products compete with Wired? And maybe as an extension, as you 
guys look to review rural lines and prospects for sales divestitures or 
u

be an effective solution for home broadband maybe in rural territories? 
Thanks.

billion. If you want to look at where the pieces of that come from, certainly a 
piece of it comes from the fact that our network and our capital build guys 
are really being efficient with capita


pricing unit costs are better. Our cycle times are better, just a whole lot of 
activity there. So a piece of that is going to come from 
certainly that, and 

ahead of schedule with their build targets.

coming from. And we believe we cannot only maintain that going forward, 

 
Ralph de la Vega
 
And Jason, concerning the performance of our data plans and LTE in 
general 
compared to wired broadband, I am thrilled, first of all, with the 
performance of our network. We said it was averaging 5 to 12 Mb per 

being conservative on what to say, but 
when you compare it to even Wi
-
Fi in 

way. And then to answer that, the response that we have seen in mobile 
share, say absolutely that I think there is a place where in some rur
al areas 
where I see the outline, that it could serve as an alternative to wired 
broadband.
 
Certainly in terms of speed and reliability and flexibility, it is absolutely very, 
very possible. And were going to be talking to you about that on November 
7, giv
ing you more details about our thinking of how we can use this 
technology. And, quite frankly, the customer reception to the technology in 
terms of their willingness to pay for great quality data in large, large 
amounts on November 7 when we meet with you 
and give you more 
guidance on our future growth plans.

Hey, guys. Thanks 
for taking my question. Ralph, maybe two questions for 
you, if I could, first is one of the things that has really helped this sector and 
I think people get very comfortable with these stocks, has been the kind of 
fairly rational read improving price envir
onment that the sectors enjoyed for 
the last year or so.
 



ou feel about that 
situation and what levers exist for AT&T to pull to move that more in your 

out there to be gotten?
 
And then second, obviously, looking down market things are 
changing quite 
a bit with the T
-
Mobile PCS deal and soft bank trying to put $20 billion to 
work in the industry. Is there anything about these lower
-
end competitors 
trying to shore up their financial resources and their scale that makes you 
think different

terms of pricing and competition might be changing? Thanks a lot.
 
Ralph de la Vega
 



think these mobile share plans are very compelling to customers. And I think 

down the road because I think the reception has been exceptio
nal.
 
We mentioned that this quarter was a bit unique for us, Dave, in that we had 
10 days of an iPhone launch and in those first 10 days what we see is a 
preponderance of iPhone customers, existing iPhone customers, which 
happen to be the best customers we
 
have, the most loyal, with the highest 
ARPU, sign up in record numbers and use up the available inventory. I think 


n the postpaid 
churn numbers, which are the best postpaid churn numbers for any third 

 


ventory and when 
we go into the fourth quarter with a great lineup of tablets and our mobile 

compared to we were in the third quarter, in terms of net customer 
additions. But what I 

not reliant on connecting more people or playing the traditional postpaid net 
adds game.
 

grow the business by layering services, li
ke Digitize, on top of this great 
base of customers that we have.
 
Those services are not dependent on adding more customers per se, but 
connecting more houses, connecting more cars and connecting more things 
that drive significant revenue streams with good
 
margins for us and in a 


feel very confident about that. In terms of what we see happening with 
others
 


our plan, instead of us reacting to them.
 
But I feel very comfortable that we have the right strategy, both short
 
term 



our postpaid churn, si
gnificant improvement in postpaid churn, the best 

terms of our ARPU growth, the best in six quarters, postpaid ARPU growth.

Thanks for taking the question. You talked a little bit about some of the 


wondering whether the capital efficiency of the LTE network is a part of that. 


fairly signi
ficant number of your cell sites as part of this initial build
-
out 

end of this late next year, you might be set up to see your CapEx in Wireless 
move down a notch?
 
John Stephens
 
S

you clarity with regard to the specifics of the network build. First and 
foremost, we are seeing efficiencies throughout our CapEx program from our 
procurement efforts, our price pe
r unit efforts are a One AT&T cost initiative 

network programs, but because LTE is such a large piece of the network 
spend this year, we are seeing it there.
 
Secondly, with some prud
ent planning, both from our marketing sales guys 
on the demand aspect and our network guys on supply aspect of a quality 

building in our 3G and 4G network, as opposed to new capacity 




 
With regard to our LTE build, I believe we



not doing what some other companies are doing with regard to a more 
s
carce build
-
out. I think that goes to the quality of speeds that Ralph talked 
about, where they are far in excess of the 5 MB to 12 MB speed that we had 
talked about previously.
 
Ralph de la Vega
 
Brett, I just wanted to add to what John has said, that our n
etwork team has 
done a fantastic job of building out great coverage, with great reliability, at a 
really low cost. In addition to that, the products and services that are rolling 
out are some of the best that we have seen. The iPhone 5, for example, has 
so
me of the lowest drop call rates in this network environment that we have 
seen of almost any phone.
 
So we think as we move customers to our LTE network, it improves their 
service, it gives them great data, it actually improves the voice performance 
and at 
the same time, it relieves our HSPA plus network and the HSPA plus 



ng to see from us on the great LTE 
network that our team is building.

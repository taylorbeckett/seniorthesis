was $28 million or 0.2% negative operating margin comparing with GAAP 
operating income of $79 million.
 
Our income
 
tax expense was $83 million. GAAP net loss was $274 million or 
$0.60 per diluted share compared with net income of $63 million and $0.14

Third quarter 2012 includes a loss of $169 million, $0.37 per diluted share 
related to our equity

Accounts payable increased 28% to $8.37 billion and accounts payable days 
increased to 75 from 72 in the prior year. Our Q3 2012 capital expenditures 
were $716 million.
 
The increase in capital expenditures reflects 
additional investments in 
support of continued business growth consisting of investments in 
technology infrastructure, including Web Services and additional capacity to 
support our fulfillment operations.
 

nce. Incorporated into our 

-
date and what we believe today 
to be appropriately conservative assumption.
 
Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by 
factors including a high level of 
uncertainty surrounding exchange rate 

possible to accurately predict demand and therefore our actual results could 
differ materially from our guidance.
 
As we describe in more detai
l in our public filings, issues such as settling 
intercompany balances and foreign currencies amongst our subsidiaries, 
unfavorable resolution of legal matters and changes to our effective tax 
rates can all have a material effect on guidance.
 
Our guidance 

business acquisitions, investments or settlements, record any further 
revisions to stock
-
based compensation estimates and that foreign exchange 

 
For Q4 2012, we expect net sales of between $20.25 billion and $22.75 
billion, a growth of between 16% and 31%. This guidance anticipates 
approximately 45 basis points of unfavorable impact from foreign exchange 
rates.
 
GAAP operating income or loss to be b
etween $490 million loss to $310 
million income compared to $260 million income in the prior year. This 
includes approximately $290 million for stock
-
based compensation and 
amortization of intangible assets.
 
We anticipate consolidated segment operating inc
ome or loss which excludes 
stock
-
based compensation and other operating expense to be between a 
$200 million loss and $600 million income compared to $462 million income 
in the prior year period.
 
We expect capital expenditures for ongoing operations includ
ing capitalized 
software development to be approximately $0.9 billion to $1.0 billion. These 
anticipated investments are driven primarily by our expectations of 
continued business growth consisting of investments in technology 
infrastructure, including Ama
zon Web Services and additional capacity to 
support our fulfillment operations.
 
We expect additional capital expenditures of approximately $1.4 billion 
related to the purchase of our currently leased corporate office space as well 
as property for developme
nt of additional corporate office space located in 
Seattle, Washington. We remain head
-
sound focused on driving a better 
customer experience through price, selection and convenience. We believe 
putting customers first is the only reliable way to create las
ting value for 
shareholders.

Hi. Thank you. Two please, if I could, Tom. First on international margin, I 
know some of that actually is affected by currency

secondly, what else is driving that down? I would anticipate China 
investment digital and Italy and Spain being contributors there?
 
Then secondly on shippi
ng revenue up 44% year

over

if you could break that down between shipping revenue or more versus the 
revenue allocation of FBA? Thanks.
 
Tom Szkutak
 
To take the first part of your question Scott, as it relates to operating profit 
in int




the number of new geographies.
 


have there, but certainly those are investments right now. China, as you 
al
so mentioned is creating a long

term opportunity for us, but certainly an 
investment and it is impacting that number.

LOVEFiLM for Europe. So those are things that are the primary drivers of 

 
In terms of shipping revenue there is not a lot. I can help you, but there is a 
number of factors that go into 
that number. If you take a look at both, the 
shipping revenue and then the resulting net shipping cost of fuel, the net 

closer to customers with our RFC footprint. So those are
 
some of things, but 
again a lot of dynamics that are certainly impacting that shipping revenue 
number.

tipping point or am, I over reading into just one quarter? Thank you.
 
Tom Szkutak
 
In terms of the paid unit growth question, it was

was a deceleration from last quarter. Keep in mind still, the 39% growth is 
still growing at a faster rate than revenue, one.

Great. Thank you. I had a question about pop

ff recently about Amazon trying to leverage those as a way to get closer 

wondering if you could share with us your strategy there.

Yeah. Could you elaborate on what you

up store, meaning something that might only be open for between 
say, Black Friday and January 1st, a short

The vast majority or the highest percentage of our revenue
 
is certainly 
coming from our online sales. We do, in the case of Kindle are using physical

launched the First Fire devices. And I was hopping, you could give us a 
sense of how that cohort of users might be tracking, in terms o
f their buyer 

terms of media content consumption, Prime usage and overall purchasing? 
And how do you feel about that strategy now as you continue to tie upon 
into devices? Than

customers certainly purchasing a lot of content. We like the idea of selling 
our Kindle Fires and then being rewarded through purchases of content 
going forward. All that be


behalf of them to make sure that content is not only very wide but also at 
great prices.

Cantor Fitzgerald
 
Yea
h. Thank you very much. I actually want to follow
-
up on the question 
that was just asked. So, intuitively, it really makes a lot of sense what it is 

selling the device or all these dev
ices is kind of near breakeven?
 
Maybe is there anticipate metric that you can point to help us understand 
the lifts you get either in terms of the frequency of buying or listing in 
average transaction value or anything that could kind of help us gauge from
 
the outside the success of our strategy? And then second, maybe if you 
could just speak to the thinking behind your content costs related to your 
streaming service going forward, just how should we be thinking about it? 
Thank you.
 
Tom Szkutak
 
In terms of 
--
 
there is not a lot of specifics I can give you on a per device 
basis from a content standpoint in terms of what the purchasing patterns 
have been, but as I mentioned in the previous question, certainly customers 
are engaged in the device they are purcha
sing content. They all are also, in 

content.
 


that are 
going very well. We like what we see there, which is why we continue to 
investment in that business, which is why you see the offerings, the very 
compelling offerings that we have out there right now. So those are things 
that you should expect us 
to do more of.
 


 



it very ca
refully. You should expect us to add more content going forward.
 
We launched Prime, some number of years ago now and we had a little over 
1 million items at launch. We then expanded that dramatically with many 

ms through Prime as well, most 


subscribers coming out of these efforts and we like what we see so far.

Over the longer term, are there any particular regions that you think may 
never reach the efficiency level, as you may currently see in your olde

geographies? Thank you.

making in terms of predictability, certainly, I would consider the fulfillm
ent 
capacity to be more of the running of the business type investments.
 
We have a lot of experience starting up new facilities, operating those 

to offer that service for our reta
il business, we also offer that to sellers to 
fulfill by Amazon. So those are things that we feel. Certainly those 


 
And yo

investments where we absolutely need too. But in terms of deploying that 
capital is those resources, we feel very good about it.

Hi. Thanks. I have two questions, please. Can you talk to what you saw 
throughout Europe? Did you see any weakening in the European markets 
throughout the quarter, and if so any comments on specific pockets or 
countries of weakness?
 
And then secondly, 
can you talk a little bit about social and kind of use of 
social networks like Pinterest? Do you feel comfortable working with other 
social networks to drive business to Amazon as you are now, or do you think 
over the long

term or time you like to have mor

terms of growth. But as you can see from the results, we grew 27% in 
international and local currency basis, which
 
includes obviously our footprint 
in Europe as well as China and Japan.
 
So we feel the growth has been in the high

Hi. Great, guys. Just two quick questions. First is on Brazil, second on 
fulfillment. So you guys are hiring in Brazil for local content relationships for 
Kindle and some warehouse personnel. So how 
important do you view that 
market in terms of the retail business. When do you think you could be in 
Brazil with the retail presence?
 
And then the second question is fulfillment, as a growth 
--
 
as a percent of 
gross profit showed year
-
on
-
year leverage for 
the first time in like three 


there any reason why that would reverse back down again from here?
 
Tom 
Szkutak
 
In terms of the first question, we have a longstanding practice of not talking 
about what we might or might not do. Certainly, Brazil is an interesting 
geography as well as there are others. And we certainly export to Brazil 
today, but beyond that 

 
In terms of fulfillment, you are seeing a little bit of leverage in Q3 versus 

read too much into that at this stage. But certainly, we feel good about 
the 

added since 2010.

Great. Thanks, guys. Two quick questions. I guess when you look into your 
holiday as
 
you might go into the holiday season with your third
-
party 
inventory last year hitting sort of a bump with video games, as well as some 
of the Thailand floods. I was wondering what types of steps you guys are 
kind of doing to better prepare yourselves for
 
holiday season that this 
upcoming holiday season?
 
And the second question is wondering, how we should think about the 
increasing cost 
--
 
shipping cost leverage as you go into 2013 with your 
distribution centers much closer and a higher percentage of FBA u
nits? 
Thanks.
 
Tom Szkutak
 

--
 
as you can see 


continuing
 

some of that already in the numbers.
 



forward to have a great experience for customers during Q4.
 
In terms of shipping cost leverage, I think there is a great opportunity over 
a longer period of time in terms of providing w
hat there would happen from 
a short
-
term leverage standpoint to be premature to that at this stage. But 
we can checking in future periods and talk more about that.

I
 
have just one question. On the North America media segment just a 
modest deceleration. I would imagine that digital content sales and 
download to rent probably grew much faster than the growth rate of that 

nything specifically that you 
can call out that was weighing that growth down in that segment, whether

in the number that you see there, beyond that there is not 
a lot of call outs with the exception of. If you look back over the past five 


 

 
But again, very good growth on the digital media 
also keep in mind, that the growth of digital will also trail our device sales

Hi, good afternoon. Tom, last quarter you made a comment that same day 

anecdotal evidence of people getting a lot of same day delivery especially 
here in New York. There was some news from Wal
-
Mart that they were going 
to start shipping from their stores. So could you give us any updated 
thoughts or philosophy you might have 

amount of time to strive for to deliver to people?
 
And then as a quick follow
-

guiding to sort of 1% operating margins. And just wondering like is that a 

re managing the business. Is there sort of an 
infinite number of things that you guys could spend on if you wanted to. And 
we should expect this sort of level going forward?
 
Tom Szkutak
 
In terms of same day delivery or delivery speed, we have just a 
tremendous 
amount of selection and what I was referring to last time was, I said, I 
talked about with a large amount of selection broadly to that certainly 

economic standpoint.
 
That 
being said, we 
--
 
if you look back over the past several years, we have 
done

we have large FCs that are 
closer and closer to customers that has helped improve our delivery speed to 
customers and programs like Pr
ime specifically has helped us get closer and 
closer to customers from a delivery speed standpoint.
 

going to continue to improve the customer experience in every possible way 
we can, whic
h includes getting closer to customers from a shipping 

improvements some in the past year and in the past several years and New

ver the last two years? And as far as like 
return on investment capital, is the profile of your returns changing over 
time as you think about history?
 
And then when can we start seeing kind of returns on this as far as revenues 
improving or kind of some of
 
the financial ratios starting to turn. Can give us 

 
And then, just have a financial question. U.S. revenues for other were up 
63% and then international was plus 15 for other and I think the difference

we should think about? Thank you.

In terms of return on invested capital beyond the total numbers, there is not 
any specifics that I can point to right now. But what I can te

Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Amazon.com Second Quarter 2012 
Financial Results Teleconference. (Operator Instructions) Today's call is 
being recorded. For opening remarks, I will be turning the call over to the 
Vice President of 
Investor Relations, Mr. Sean Boyle. Please go ahead.
 
 
Sean Boyle
 
 
Hello, and welcome to our Q2 2012 financial results conference call. Joining 
us today is Tom Szkutak, our CFO. We will be available for questions after 
our prepared remarks.
 
 
The following d
iscussion and responses to your questions reflect 
management's views as of today, April 26, 2012, only and will include 
forward
-
looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional 
information about factors that could potentially impact our
 
financial results is 
included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our 
most recent Annual Report on Form 10
-
K. As you listen to today's 
conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, 
which includes
 
our financial results, as well as metrics and commentary on 
the quarter.
 
 
During this call, we will discuss certain non
-
GAAP financial measures. In our 
press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the 
SEC, each of which is posted o
n our IR website, you'll find additional 
disclosures regarding these non
-
GAAP measures, including reconciliations of 
these measures with comparable GAAP measures.
 
 
Finally, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against 
our results f
or the comparable period of 2011. Now I'll turn the call over to 
Tom.
 
 
Tom Szkutak
 
 
Thanks, Sean. I will begin with comments on our second quarter financial 
results. Trailing 12 months operating cash flow was $3.22 billion compared 
with $3.2 billion. Trail
ing 12
-
months free cash flow decreased 40% to $1.1 
billion. Return on invested capital was 11%, down from 21%. ROIC is trailing 
12
-
months free cash flow divided by average total assets minus current 
liabilities excluding the current portion of long term de
bt over five quarter 
ends.
 
 
The combination of common stock, stock
-
based awards outstanding, was 
468 million share compared with 468 million shares. Worldwide revenue 
grew 29% to $12.83 billion or 32% excluding the $272 million, unfavorable 
impact from the
 
year
-
over
-
year changes in foreign exchange rates. We are 
grateful to our customers who continue to take advantage of our low prices, 
vast selection and shipping offers.
 
 
Media revenue increased to $4.12 billion, up 13% or 15% excluding foreign 
exchange. E
GM revenue increased to $8.16 billion, up 38% or 42% 
excluding foreign exchange. Worldwide EGM increased to 64% of worldwide 
sales, up from 59%. Worldwide paid unit growth was 43%. Active customer 
counts exceeded to 180 million. Worldwide active seller acc
ounts were more 
than 2 million. Seller units were 40% of paid units compared to 36% of paid 
units in Q2 of 2011.
 
 
Now I will discuss operating expenses excluding stock
-
based compensation. 
Cost of sales was $9.49 billion, or 73.9% of revenue compared with 7
5.9%. 
Fulfillment, marketing, technology and content and G&A combined, was 
$2.99 billion or 23.3% of sales up approximately 307 basis points year
-
over
-
year. Fulfillment was $1.3 billion or 10.1% of revenue compared with 9.2%. 
Tech and content was $970 mill
ion or 7.6% of revenue compared with 6.3%. 
Marketing was $521 million or 4.1% of revenue compared with 3.3%.
 
 
Now I will talk about our segment results and consistent with prior periods, 
we do not allocate to segments our stock
-
based compensation or other 

36% to $7.33 billion. Media revenue grew 18% to $1.87 billion, EGM 
revenue grew 41% to 4.94 billion representing 67% of North America 
revenues up from 65%. North America segment oper
ating income increased 
61% to $344 million a 4.7% operating margin.
 
 
In the international segment, revenue grew 22% to 5.51 billion adjusting for 
the $269 million year
-
over
-
year unfavorable foreign exchange impact, 
revenue growth was 28%. Media revenue gre
w 8% to 2.25 billion or 12% 
excluding foreign exchange. And EGM revenue grew 34% to 3.22 billion or 
42% excluding foreign exchange. EGM now represents 59% of international 
revenues up from 53%.
 
 
International segment operating income decreased 91% to 16 mi
llion or 
0.3% operating margin. Excluding the unfavorable impact from foreign 
exchange, international segment operating income decreased 74%.
 
 
Consolidated segment operating income decreased 7% to 360 million or 
2.8% of revenue down approximately 109 basis
 
points year
-
over
-
year. 
Excluding the unfavorable impact from foreign exchange CSOI decreased 
4%. Unlike CSOI, our GAAP operating income includes stock based 
compensation expense and other operating expense. GAAP operating income 
decreased 47% to $107 mill
ion or 0.8% of net sales.
 
 
Our income tax expense was $109 million a 75% effective tax rate for the 
quarter and includes a one
-
time expense of $51 million related to the 
integration of Kiva Systems acquisition. Accordingly, our Q2 2012 effective 
tax rate i
s higher than both our current estimated 2012 annual effective rate 
and our 2011 effective tax rate.
 
 
GAAP net income was $7 million or $0.01 per diluted share compared with 
$191 million and $0.41 per diluted share. Q2 2012 net income includes $65 
million 
of estimated loss related to the acquisition and integration of Kiva 
Systems.
 
 
Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and marketable securities decreased

year to 4.97 billion. Inventory increased 36% to 4.3 
billion and inventory turns we
re 10.1 down from 11.3 turns a year ago as we 
expanded selection, improved in stock levels and introduced new product 
categories.
 
 
Accounts payable increased 24% to 7.07 billion and accounts payable days 
decreased to 68 from 69 in the prior year. Our Q2 20
12 capital expenditures 
were $657 million, the increase in capital expenditures reflects additional 
investments in support of continued business growth consisting of 
investments in technology infrastructure including Amazon web services and 
additional capa
city to support our funding operations.
 
 

guidance are the order trends that we have seen to
-
date and what we 
believe today to be properly conservative assumptions. Our results ar
e 
inherently unpredictable and maybe materially affected by many factors 
including a high level of uncertainties surrounding exchange rate fluctuations 
as well as the global economy consumer spending. It's not possible to 
accurately predict demand and ther
efore, our actual results could differ 
materially from our guidance.
 
 
As we describe in more detail in our public filings, issues such as settling 
intercompany balances and foreign currencies among such subsidiaries, 
unfavorable resolution of legal matters
, and changes to our effective tax rate 
can all have a material effect on guidance.
 
 

business acquisition, investments or settlement, record any further revision 
for stock
-
based compensatio
n estimates, and that foreign exchange rates 
remain approximately where they have been recently.
 
 
For the Q3 2012 we expect net sales of between 12.9 and 14.3 billion or 
growth between 19 and 31%. This guidance anticipates approximately 425 
basis points of
 
unfavorable impact from foreign exchange rates.
 
 
GAAP operating income or loss to be between 350 million loss and 50 million 
loss down from 79 million income in the comparable prior year period. This 
includes approximately $275 million for stock
-
based com
pensation and 
amortization of intangible assets.
 
 
We anticipate consolidated segment operating income or loss which excludes 
stock
-
based compensation and other operating expenses to be between $75 
million loss and $225 million in income, or between a 129% 
decline and 14% 
decline. We expect capital expenditures including capitalized software 
development to be approximately $0.8 billion to $0.9 billion. These 
anticipated investments are driven primarily by our expectations of a 
continued business growth consi
sting of investments in technology 
infrastructure, including Amazon web service and additional capacity to 
support our fulfillment operations.
 
 
We remain heads on focused on driving better customer experience through 
price, selection and convenience. We be
lieve putting customers first is the 
only reliable way to create lasting value for shareholder. Thanks. With that, 
Sean, we will move to questions.

(Operator Instructions) We will take our first question from Spencer Wang 
with Crédit Suisse.

Crédit Suisse
 
 
Thanks, good afternoon. Just one question on Kiva and a couple of parts, 
Tom. Now that you have closed the acquisition, can you talk about how you 
will deploy the Kiva technology? Is that for new fulfillment centers only or 
can you use that in your legacy 
fulfillment centers and perhaps what type 
efficiencies that could gain. And then last part would be, is there any impact 
on your 3Q guidance from the Kiva acquisition specifically? Thanks.
 
 
Tom Szkutak
 
 
Sure. In terms of Kiva itself, we are very very excit
ed to have Kiva as part of 
the Amazon team. You know we are looking forward to getting great 

just have to stay tuned in terms of the plan. In terms of the impact, you 
mentioned Q3
. Let me just provide a little bit of data on both Q2 actuals and 
Q3. In terms GAAP operating income in Q2, it was negative $25 million. For 

Q2, it was a loss of approximately $65 m
illion. And so those are the 
numbers for Q2 and Q3. But again we are very very happy to have them 
part of them and that we look forward to working with them going forward.

Question on the gross margin, continues to climb up, and I was wondering if 
you could give any commentary there around how agency versus wholesale 
and eBooks is contributing to that?
 
 
Tom Szkutak
 
 

lated to overall 3P, a number of 
factors of different factors certainly driving the improvement in product 

broader 3P. So if you take a look at from a units perspective, third pa
rty was 

basis points increase as a percentage of total units which is certainly one of 
the factors that you are seeing there.
 
 
Operator
 
 
We will go next to Herman Leung with Susque
hanna.
 
 
Unidentified Analyst
 
 
This is [Deepak] sitting in for Herman. So the question I had was on the 
hardware business. So how important do you think is the hardware strategy 
to you for the digital content? Now given that Kindle Fire has been out there 
f
or a while, so could you discuss about the strategy on the business and how 

 
 
Tom Szkutak
 
 
Sure. You know we are very excited about both the hardware and the 
content of the business. We think if you take a look at our devic
es, certainly 

experience. And so we have been very excited about the progress we have 
made so far from both a device and content standpoint. And we are super 
excited about the 

happy with what the team is doing there.

And we will go next to Brian Nowak with Nomura Equity Research.
 
 
Aram Rubinson

Nomura Equity Research
 
 
This is Aram Rubinson sitting in for Bria
n Nowak. I notice your shipping cost 
was lower as a percent of sales for the first time in nearly three years. The 
driver it looks like it's shipping cost per unit which fell about 10%. Can you 
talk about how much of that might be attributable to proximity
 
of 
distribution centers to metro areas, lower fuel, more favorable carrier pricing 
etcetera, and whether or not you see anything on the horizon that would 
change that course.
 
 
Tom Szkutak
 
 
Yes, we are seeing, there is a number of different factors, but ce
rtainly one 


again we have a lot of opportunities to improve that overtime, but again the 
team is making
 
good progress and you are seeing that reflected in the 
results so far.

We will go next to Justin Post with Bank of America/Merrill Lynch.
 
 
Paul Bieber 
-
 
Bank of America/Merrill Lynch
 
 
This is Paul Bieber for Justin. Just going back for the gros
s margin question, 
I was wondering if you could give us some color on the relative impact of 
few different things; category, maturity, advertising, 3P, and maybe digital 
content on gross margins, which ones are impacting gross margins more 
than others. And
 
then just quick question on the taxes. What were the 
impact of sales tax in Texas and California beyond gross margins?
 
 
Tom Szkutak
 
 
In terms of your question on gross margins, we are not breaking that up but 
certainly 3P is having the impact, mix of busi
nesses having an impact. We 
continue to try to work with our partners to get even better prices on the 
goods that we provide for customers which is certainly impacting it. Mix of 
business things like [AWS] is certainly impacting that as well, given the 
gro
wth rate there. So, again those are things that are impacting. In terms of 
sales taxes, any impact that we certainly would expect to see would be 
included in guidance that we are giving for Q3, but one thing to keep in mind 
as it relates to that is we righ
t now approximately 50% of our business 
around the world, we either collect sales tax or value added tax. We have 
very good businesses in those jurisdictions and so [keep that in mind] you 
should think about any upcoming changes.

We will go next
 
to Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan.
 
 
Kaizad Gotla

JPMorgan
 
 
This is Kaizad Gotla in for Doug. Just a couple of questions, can you discuss 
the international media deceleration, it looks like it decelerated from 22 to 
12% on an ex
-
FX basis. And then can you may
be just give us an update on 
the fulfillment center plans for the rest of the year. Thanks.
 
 
Tom Szkutak
 
 


usiness 
grew 32%. One thing to keep this on currency basis, one thing to keep in 
mind is for both the total business international growth and international 
media, we had a very, very strong growth last year Q2. In fact our total 
growth rate last year was 5
1% for the total business and on a local currency 

over 10 years. And so when you look at that, when you are comparing 
ourselves in Q2 this year, we had very good growth given that co
mpare to 
last year, and that some of which we are seeing also in international media 
as you mentioned. So, international media was up 8%, on a local currency 
basis so it was up 12 and certainly it's a challenging compare.
 
 
Also there were some things just 
with, as we some timely things as we 
launched with the unfortunate events in Japan last year, we certainly did 

happened, they moved into Q2 just from a supply standpoint those are 

it in terms of the comparison point for last year is probably the best thing to 
do.
 
 
Operator
 
 
We will go next to Mark Mahaney with Citi.
 
 
Rohit Kulkarni 
-
 
Citigroup
 
 
This is 
Rohit Kulkarni filling in for Mark. Couple of questions. Can you talk 

eBay talked about mobile affecting their growth rates quite materially, 
perhaps even by a few percentage poi
nts and accounting for almost 10% of 
their revenues maybe.
 
 
And second is, can you talk about the broad philosophy of management 
about short
-
term profitability versus long
-
term growth. Probably this is the 
first time in a while that you have bracketed nega
tive pro forma operating 
income in your guidance. How should we view your short
-
term investment or 
the short
-
term profitability outlook.
 
 
Tom Szkutak
 
 
Sure. First in terms on mobile. Clearly, smartphones and tablets are a 
significant tailwind for our busin
ess. While we are not breaking out the 


that will continue. In terms of short term versus long
-
term, yo
u know we are 
all about trying to make sure we do the right long
-
term things for both 
customers and shareowners. But more specifically around Q3, you know Q3 
is similar to Q2 and other previous quarters and that we are investing 
certainly for the long term
.
 
 
Yet, on the flip side, keep in mind, as you look at Q3 specifically, we are 
getting ready for a most seasonal quarter and we expect, given the growth 
that we have had, we are seeing very strong growth so we are investing 
heavily to get ready for that. I
n terms of capacity for example, we have 
announced 18 new fulfillment centers so far this year. We have actually 
opened eight of those already this year, out of the 18. And we are looking at 
potentially opening even more than that. I am sorry, six opened s
o far this 
year, out of 18. So those are certainly something are impacting the cost so 
far and you will be seeing that heavier in Q3 as we get ready for the most 
seasonal quarter.

Hi, I was hoping, you could share some perspective on your URL expansion 

there and how material it is in your overall numbers. And should we expect

looking as you would expect us to do, ways to continue to grow and certainly 
that will be part of our strategy.

We will go next 
to Scott Tillman with Caris & Company.

Caris & Company
 
 
Tom, I was just curious, we have had a few quarters where operating 
income has far surpassed the upper end of your guidance range and we had 
a quarter here you definitely seemed to we
aken as the months went by. Just 
wondering what you think is causing that divergence between sort of 
expectation at the beginning of the quarter and how things are playing out. 
Then just as a quick follow up to one of the other questions. You are looking 
a
t the fulfillment center network, just wondering if you are satisfied with the 
fee increases that were put in place in February that that business is now 
matching the margin for the rest of the business.
 
 
Tom Szkutak
 
 
I am sorry, could you elaborate on the
 

your question.
 
 
Scott Tillman 
-
 
Caris & Company
 
 
On operating income, we have had a couple of 
--
 
a few quarters here where 
the numbers have come in far better than guidance. And we actually had a 
situation where Europe 
actually got worst as the quarter went on. So 
wondering what is driving that out performance.
 
 
Tom Szkutak
 
 

most recent quarter, but we had a lot of strength across many differ
ent 
areas. One of the ones I mentioned that certainly helped our operating profit 
as well as our gross margin with the third party business continued to be 
very very strong. And certainly that was a factor. Again, there was a number 
of factors. One thing t
oo, you do see some timing differences to some extent 
between Q2 and Q3 in terms of our prep for Q4, you see that knowing our 
operating results, but you see that in our CapEx. In the last 90 days ago we 
said that we would spend approximately 800 to $900 mi
llion of CapEx for 
Q2, we spent little less than 700. You see that number for Q3 being 8 to 900 
as well. It's 900 million. So, again those are things that you are seeing just a 
little bit of a shift between Q2 and Q3 there.

I wanted to ask you a quick on 3P and given it's around 40% of sale this 
year, item sold. What point you believe the customer experience on Amazon 
is at risk given the rise of third
-
party sales. And any i
nsight in terms of 
adoption on FBA by third parties would be very helpful. And then one quick 
follow
-
up just on your comments on CapEx, I think you said, it came in 
lower in 2Q, guidance is for another 8 to 900 million, is that guidance sort of 
consistent 
maybe going out, going forward or is this sort of one
-
time build 
around technology. Thank you.
 
 
Tom Szkutak
 
 
In terms of the third party units, certainly FBA is having an impact on that, 

entage of 
total units go up. And we have looked at and we have been working very 
hard over a number of years on improving the experience for both 
customers and for sellers and FBA is an example of that. And what ends up 
happening is FBA sellers wants their
 
part of the program, those units that 
FBA and our fulfillment network are eligible for all of our programs including 

a great program for our customers, it's great program for se
ller and it's 
great program for investors.
 
 

lot of retail units that we send directly to customers, we are offering a great 
experience on third party units which includes FBA
 
and a number of other 
programs that we have. So, again we will continue to try to make that even 
better for customers overtime, but it's working very well, and again those 
are the benefit of having third parties on a platform is we get to [equate] 
some ne
w selection. We also have competing offers directly on our detail 
pages, so when customers come they get to choose in terms of who they 
want to purchase from. So, it's a competitive environment on our platform. 

or us.

can you give us some color on what happened perhaps. And secondly, can 
you talk about the kind of traction you are getting with LOVEFiLM given all of 
the exclusive content you are getting there.
 
 
Tom Szkutak
 
 
LOVEFiLM business is doing very well. It's growing nicely as you mentioned 
we continue to add content there, and we pl

ales tax and performance in your

In terms of delivery speed to customers, we are certainly trying to get 


for some time. But in

This is Perry Gold on for Anthony. Can you please touch on the online 
sales 
tax issue and how it could affect your build out strategy for fulfillment 
centers?
 
 
Tom Szkutak
 
 
You know as I mentioned earlier, we have 
--
 
we do collect in several states 
within the U.S. We do collect in a number of geographies that have an 
equival
ent value added tax, approximately half for our business. We actually 
sales tax, the value added tax. We do very good business in those 
geographies. Those geographies reflected, for the most part, if you go back 
on the last several years, most of them have
 
been included. We have also 
certainly added some new geographies or new jurisdictions that we clocked 
during that time period. But you see that we have seen very very strong 
growth even while collecting. So we are very supportive of collecting. We 
think t
he best way to do that is through a federal solution and we keep 
working with Congress and others to try to get that passed.

We will go next to Kerry Rice with Needham & Company.
 
 
Kerry Rice

Needham & Company
 
 
Kind of sales tax issue again. Am
azon signed a lot of bilateral agreements 
with several states on the collection of sales tax. And I know there is a 
federal effort also going on. Can you talk about if a federal sales tax is 
passed, how does that impact your bilateral agreements with the s
tates. 
Does that supersede it or does that kind of have to continue to go on with 
those particular states and build those fulfillment centers and things in those 
states that you have agreed to.
 
 
Tom Szkutak
 
 
There is not a lot I can add to that. So I can't
 
be that helpful with your 
question, I apologize. But again, you are right, we do support federal 
legislation, we are working very hard at that. One thing to keep In mind to, 

obliga



geographies and jurisdictions where we do colle
ct. And because customers 
are coming to us because they want to have value which we offer 
irrespective of tax, there has been a number of different third parties that 
have certainly reported on that. They come because they want great 
convenience, they want
 
obviously great service, and those are things we are 
focused and those are the things that we believe customers will still want 
over the long

The international segment operating income has been under a lot of 
pressure. Is that primarily related to existing markets, growth in new 
markets? And would that be on the merchandize margin side of the P&L or is 
it more of an operating cost issue.
 
 
Tom Szkutak
 
 

--
 
certainly there are some that we are investing in. We mentioned certainly in 
other calls, China is an area that is growing very fast 
but we are certainly in 
investment mode there. In recent years, we have launched Italy and Spain. 
We are certainly investing in those geographies and like what we see there. 
Those are certainly impacting. We are also adding a lot of fulfillment 
capacity. A

Lazard Capital
 
 
I have two questions. One on guidance and the other one prime members. 
Can y
ou give us some color on guidance, what you are baking for growth in 
international versus domestic? And guidance implies there is some 
compression in margin. Is it again mostly the function of the sales mix or is 
something else going on there. And then a s
econd on prime members. Can 
you remind us the profitability of prime members versus non
-
prime member 
and in the longer
-
term where do you think the penetration of prime 
members within your overall base?
 
 
Tom Szkutak
 
 

the segments in terms of the split. 


and so rounded it's just under 36% on the high end and 23% on the l
ow 

with what we saw in Q2 and certainly giving as we have in past quarters a 
wide range for Q3. In terms of the bottom line, in terms of operating income 
and CSOI guidance that we hav
e given, as I mentioned earlier, certainly a 
number of different factors like the last several quarters, as we have been 
talking about we are certainly investing a lot in the business, but one thing 
to keep in mind is for the guidance in upcoming quarter t
o Q3. And we are 
certainly getting ready given the growth rates we had for our most seasonal 

and as I mentioned earlier we opened a lot of performance centers, adding a 
lot of cap
acity for both our web service businesses as well as infrastructure 
support. Our retail business, so again we are investing across the business 
which is like all the periods, but again we are getting ready for Q4.

8.4%. Tech and content was $816 million or 6.5% of revenue compared with 
5.3%. Marketing was $468 million or 3.6% of revenue compared with 3.2%.
 
Now I'll talk about our segment results. And consistent with prior pe
riods, 
we do not allocate to segments our stock
-
based compensation expense or 
other operating expense line item. In the North America segment, revenue 
grew 36% to $7.43 billion. Media revenue grew 17% to $2.2 billion. EGM 
revenue grew 44% to $4.77 billion,
 
representing 64% of North America 
revenues, up from 60%. North America segment operating income increased 
20% to $349 million, a 4.7% operating margin.
 
In the International segment, revenue grew 31% to $5.76 billion. Adjusted 
for the $55 million year
-
over
-
year unfavorable foreign exchange impact, 
revenue growth was 32%. Media revenue grew 21% to $2.51 billion or 22%, 
excluding foreign exchange. And EGM revenue grew 40% to $3.2 billion or 
42%, excluding foreign exchange. EGM now represents 56% of Internatio
nal 
revenues, up from 52%. International segment operating income decreased 
72% to $49 million, a 0.9% operating margin. Excluding the unfavorable 
impact from foreign exchange, International segment operating income 
decreased 65%.
 
CSOI decreased 15% to $39
8 million or 3% of revenue, down approximately 
170 basis points year
-
over
-
year. Excluding the unfavorable impact from 
foreign exchange, CSOI decreased 14%. Unlike CSOI, our GAAP operating 
income includes stock
-
based compensation expense and other operating
 
expense. GAAP operating income decreased 40% to $192 million or 1.5% of 
net sales. Our income tax expense was $43 million in Q1, resulting in a 51% 
rate for the quarter. GAAP net income was $130 million or $0.28 per diluted 
share compared with $201 millio
n or $0.44 per diluted share.
 
Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and marketable securities decreased 
$1.17 billion year
-
over
-
year to $5.71 billion. Inventory increased 47% to 
$4.25 billion and inventory turns were 10.4, down from 11.6 turns a year 
ago as w
e expanded selection, improved in
-
stock levels and introduced new 
product categories. Accounts payable increased 24% to $6.89 billion and 
accounts payable days decreased to 62 from 66 in the prior year.
 
Our Q1 2012 capital expenditures were $386 million. T
he increase in capital 
expenditures reflects additional investments in support of continued business 
growth, consisting of investments in technology infrastructure, including the 
Amazon Web Services and additional capacity to support our fulfillment 
operat
ions.
 
I'll conclude my portion of today's call with guidance. Incorporated into our 
guidance are the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe 
today to be appropriately conservative assumptions. Our results are 
inherently unpredictable and m
ay be materially affected by many factors, 
including a high level of uncertainty surrounding exchange rate fluctuations, 
as well as the global economy and consumer spending. It's not possible to 
accurately predict demand, and therefore, our actual results 
could differ 
materially from our guidance.
 
As we described in more detail in our public filings, issues such as settling 
intercompany balances and foreign currencies amongst our subsidiaries, 
unfavorable resolution of legal matters and changes to our effec
tive tax 
rates can all have a material effect on guidance. Our guidance excludes the 
financial results on the Kiva Systems acquisition, which we expect to close in 
the second quarter of 2012, and assumes that we don't conclude any 
additional business acqui
sitions or investments, record any further revisions 
to stock
-
based compensation estimates and that foreign exchange rates 
remain approximately where they've been recently.
 
For Q2 2012, we expect net sales of between $11.9 billion and $13.3 billion 
or grow
th of between 20% and 34%. This guidance anticipates 
approximately 240 basis points of unfavorable impact from foreign 
exchange. GAAP operating income or loss to be between $260 million loss 
and $40 million of income or between 229% decline and 80% decline
. This 
includes approximately $260 million for stock
-
based compensation and 
amortization of intangible assets. We anticipate Consolidated Segment 
Operating Income, which excludes stock
-
based compensation and other 
operating expense to be between 0 and $300
 
million or between 100% 
decline and 22% decline.
 
We expect capital expenditures including capitalized software development 
to be approximately $0.8 billion to $0.9 billion. These anticipated 
investments are driven primarily by our expectations of continue
d business 
growth, consisting of investments in technology infrastructure, including 
Amazon Web Services and additional capacity to support our fulfillment 
operations.
 
We remain heads
-
down focused on driving a better customer experience 
through price, sele
ction and convenience. We believe putting customers first 
is the only reliable way to create lasting value for shareholders. Thanks. And 
with that, Sean, let's move to questions.
 
Sean Boyle
 
Great. Thanks, Tom. Let's move on to the Q&A portion of the call.

on
 
Tom, just a couple quick questions. One, I was wondering if you could 
update us on your plans for fulfillment center increases in 2012. And then 
also on Prime Instant Video, you guys are over 17,000 movies and TV 
episodes now. Are you guys at a 
critical mass? Or do you guys expect to 
continue to invest aggressively there? And one last quick clarification 
question, the CapEx guidance, was that for the second quarter or the full 
year?
 
Thomas J. Szkutak
 
Sure. I'll take the last one first. The CapEx 
was for the second quarter. And 
the first question on fulfillment centers, in terms of announcements so far 
that are out there, we've announced 13 for 2012. And so certainly, any 
changes to that, we'd be back to you. But again, we're experiencing very, 
ver
y strong growth both in terms of retail but also our FBA. We're seeing 
that in our third
-
party growth. Our third
-
party growth increased in Q1 over 
60% again this quarter. Again, a big piece of that was certainly FBA is doing 
very well. So again, we're cont
inuing to invest, and the number is 13.
 
Operator
 
And we'll take our next question from Scott Devitt with Morgan Stanley.
 
Scott W. Devitt

Morgan Stanley, Research Division
 
Tom, I just had a question around the operating margin dynamics in the 
North Americ
an market versus International. If you look at it year
-
over
-
year, I guess, or even sequentially, the International margin is down pretty 
materially, but you had a significant uptick in the North American margins, 
so sequentially and just a moderate decline
 
year
-
over
-
year. So wondering if 
you can just clarify what's happening in North America versus the 
International markets. Is it 3P FBA having a more significant effect in the 
U.S. versus other markets? And then I had one follow
-
up question.
 
Thomas J. Szkut
ak
 
In terms of the 
--
 
we're investing heavily in both segments. But what you're 
seeing is, clearly, if you look at over the past couple years, we've launched a 
few new geographies, Italy and Spain. We're investing in those geographies. 
As we've talked abou
t in the past, China, we continue to invest there. We 
think it's growing very fast. We like what we see. We think it's a great long
-
term opportunity for investing there. So those are some of the dynamics 
that are impacting International. And so we continue
 
to invest again across 
both geographies. But those are things that are a little bit different. In terms 
of third
-
party growth, we're seeing very strong third
-
party growth across 
International, as well as North America, so we're pleased to do that. And 
we'
re investing again on behalf of customers and sellers, as well as retail for 
the capacity that we need to do that.
 
Scott W. Devitt

Morgan Stanley, Research Division
 
And then secondly, on the employee base growth, I don't know if thinking 
about unit growt
h is the right way to think about it. But is there a point in 
time where you think the employee base starts to grow more in line possibly 
with unit growth? And can you maybe walk through where you're adding 
most significantly that's driving the headcount g
rowth?
 
Thomas J. Szkutak
 
Sure. We are adding a lot of resources across a number of different areas. 
But certainly if you look at both year
-
over
-
year and sequentially, the Q1 
numbers that you're looking at, the vast majority of that is in operations and 
cus
tomer service. Again, and those are based on the hirings that we did 
coming out of Q4. We have a lot of 
--
 
we do supplement our workforce with 
temporaries in Q4. We did hire a number of those coming out of Q4. And 
those are reflected in the numbers. And to
 
answer your other question, yes, 
we'll moderate it at some point certainly. But again, we're 
--
 
given the 
growth that we're experiencing right now, we are investing and we're 
making sure that we have the right resources to do that.
 
Operator
 
And we'll take
 
our next question from Mark Mahaney with Citi.
 
Mark S. Mahaney 
-
 
Citigroup Inc, Research Division
 
Tom, could you just provide a little more color on the gross margin trends? 
And it also looks within that like shipping for the first time in a while shows a
 
little bit less deleverage than it has in the past. Is there some sort of tipping 
point you've reached there? And just broadly on gross margins, that real 
drive
-
up that you've seen over the last couple of quarters, is that primarily 
just due to product mi
x shifts or revenue mix shifts? Is there anything else 
in there? And then could you also just briefly comment on 
AmazonSupply.com? Would some of that 
--
 
all of the inventory that you've 
built up for that launch, would was that 
--
 
have we seen that in the b
uildup 
in inventory and the reduction in turns? Or are we going to see that going 
forward?
 
Thomas J. Szkutak
 
In terms of the 
--
 
we're not reporting gross margin specifically. But in terms 
of 
--
 
if you take a look at the relationship between COGS and revenu
e, 
certainly, one of the things we're seeing, a number of different factors there, 
certainly mix of business is one. But another factor is certainly the one I 
mentioned earlier, which is around third
-
party growth. We saw very strong 
unit growth overall thi
s quarter, up from last quarter, so we had sequential 
growth. Third
-
party units as a percentage of total units were up 
approximately 300 basis points over last year. And we saw just great third
-
party unit growth, so it was up over 60% again in Q1. And so t
hose are 
factors that are certainly impacting our operating margins, if you will. In 
terms of supply 
--
 
AmazonSupply.com, certainly, we have inventory on hand 
to support that business. It's certainly something that we're optimistic over 
the long
-
term. But 
in terms of the inventory increase that you've seen, it's 
very broad over a number of different businesses and categories and 
geographies. So that's really what's driving it.
 
Operator
 
And we'll take our next question from Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs
.
 
Heather Bellini

Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division
 
I had 2 for you. First, I was wondering if you could talk about just over the 
last few years if you could give us a sense how much of the third
-
party 
increase has been related to agency e
-
book
s. And then the second question 
is in light of the DOJ case, I was wondering if you could walk us through 
your thoughts about the agency e
-
book model, as well as whether or not 
this will mean we should see things move back to wholesale.
 
Thomas J. Szkutak
 
Y
es. There's not a lot I can help you with there in terms of the questions. We 
do think that the suit is a big win for Kindle owners. And we look forward to 
being allowed to lower prices on more Kindle books. It's certainly our unit 
growth, if you will, in 
total 
--
 
I'm not talking 3P, just in total. Certainly, the 
paid unit growth has been certainly helped a lot by e
-
books. It's growing, as 
you can imagine very, very fast, so it's certainly impacting that growth rate 
that you've seen over the past few years,
 
which has been great for us and 
great for customers. So beyond that, there's not a lot I can add to your 
questions.

In your press 
release, you mentioned the launch of your Amazon Appstore. 
And can you just share any thoughts on current traction on Android or 
specifically off Kindle Fire? And what are some of the advantages and 
disadvantages that you see for Amazon in that area?
 
Thoma
s J. Szkutak
 
It's early, so there's not a lot I can do. We're excited about it. We think it's a 
very interesting opportunity and happy to do that on behalf of our 
customers. But stay tuned, and it's early.

-
up. If you can just maybe talk about any of the 
traction you're seeing within Kindle Fire more broadly or any thoughts you 
have maybe around Kindle smartphone, that'd be great, too.
 
Thomas J. Szkutak
 
In terms of the Kindle 
Fire, we are pleased with the growth that we're seeing 
and customers are buying a lot of content. And you're seeing that when you 
look at particularly in North America. When you look at our North American 
media growth from Q4 to Q1, you're seeing that acce
lerate. And that's 
certainly a big part of it. And so we're very pleased with what's happening, 
and we're going to continue to add more and more content for customers 
and across all of our digital categories. And we think we have a great value 
proposition 
for customers today, and we're going to continue to make that 
better over time.
 
Operator
 
And we'll take our next question from Doug Anmuth with JP Morgan.
 
Douglas Anmuth 
-
 
JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division
 
I want to ask 2 things, Tom. If you could fi
rst just give us some more color 
on the outlook around segment operating income in 2Q and just how we 
should be thinking about the drivers there in terms of the sequential decline. 
And then secondly, just the North American media business, you saw good 
rea
cceleration from 4Q to 1Q. Can you talk about the factors there leading 
to that acceleration?
 
Thomas J. Szkutak
 
Sure. I'll take the second one first on North American media. I just 
mentioned that a little bit in one of the previous questions. But certainly
, our 
digital media growth has been great and certainly it's helping that. One 
other call
-
out, just to keep in mind, in Q4, I had mentioned that video 
games, including video game consoles, the consoles are part of North 
America media, that's a seasonal bus
iness that was bringing down growth in 
Q4. So it's also something to keep in mind. In terms of our guidance, we've 
given a pretty broad range on both the top and the bottom as we have 
previously. We think the segment operating income on the bottom end of 
t
he range is certainly appropriately conservative. But again, things that you 
should think about, we'll continue to add capacity as we've talked about in 
the past. With the growth that we're experiencing, we are adding more. And 
as I mentioned on one of the
 
earlier questions, we've announced 
approximately 13 new fulfillment centers. So those are as a result of the 
growth that we're experiencing. We're also adding capacity to support AWS 
in our retail business on the infrastructure side as well. So those are 
things 
to think about as you think about Q2 from a segment operating income, as 
well as the CapEx that I mentioned in the opening. Another area is certainly 
our digital offerings. We are certainly adding more content, and specifically, 
more video content, 
which will be as reflected in our guidance. And so those 
are factors, among others, that you should think about.

Another question on gross margin. It was obviously impressive results, the 
best in 3 years almost. And it's been a little bit of a roller coaster in terms of 
the profitability quarter
-
to
-
quarter. And we understand that you're in an 
investment phase an
d there's a massive opportunity ahead of you. Is there 
anything that you can tell us as we think going forward over the next few 
quarters? Just is the investment philosophy that played through this quarter 
going to play on in other quarters? Or is each qua
rter kind of its own 3 
months and it could go either way?
 
Thomas J. Szkutak
 
Yes. Gene, in terms of guidance, we're just giving guidance on Q2 today. But 
the one thing I would say is again we're seeing very good growth, as you 
see in Q1 and reflected in the
 
guidance for Q2. And we'll have to stay tuned 
to see what it looks like for the remainder of the year as we progress. But 
we're extremely happy with the opportunities that we have. We think it's 
--
 
we're in a great position with the opportunities that we 
have. Even though 
we've reached some scale, we just have tremendous opportunities in front of 
us. And that's why we're investing in those.
 
Operator
 
And we'll go next to Brian Nowak with Nomura.
 
Brian Nowak

Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division
 
I 
have a couple of questions. The first one is I know there's a lot of focus on 
kind of CSOI margins and margin pressure from the build. But I was just 
curious if you still see areas of your business in the oldest part of your 
business, where you think you h
ave inefficiencies you can still work to 
improve execution and kind of get some margin lift out of those in the oldest 
part of the business just to improve execution. And the second one is any 
more clarity on how much roughly Quidsi and Lovefilm added to r
evenue 
growth this quarter?
 
Thomas J. Szkutak
 
In terms of opportunities for improvement, even though we've made a lot of 
progress, we still feel we have a lot of room for improvement in all parts of 
our business. Certainly, the most opportunity is the newe
r parts. But 
certainly if you go back and look at 
--
 
we're still trying to get great 
productivity and putting together programs to get great productivity in each 
of our operations. And so there's really too many to list here on the call 
today. But we look 
at in all facets for our business in terms of productivity. 
We think there's opportunities to partner with vendors even more to get 
better savings and better prices for customers. So the list is long. But I think 
when you look at the opportunities in terms
 
of the ranking, in terms of at 
least basis points improvement, start with the newer things that we've 
launched 
--
 
at least directionally, the newer things that we've launched, 
work your way backwards, and those were usually where the biggest 
opportunities
 
are in terms of basis points.
 
Operator
 
And we'll take our next question from Matt Nemer with Wells Fargo 
Securities.
 
Matthew R. Nemer 
-
 
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division
 
Just going back to the ""gross margin"", is it fair to say, given the 
change in 
that metric and the change in third
-
party units, that potentially the core 
margins in 1P really accelerated in the first quarter in addition to there being 
a continued mix shift to 3P? That's my first question. And then secondly, can 
you comment 
on any product categories in either media or EGM that either 
held you back in the quarter or were a tailwind? I think last quarter you 
mentioned video games and a few categories in terms of giving some color.
 
Thomas J. Szkutak
 
Yes. In terms of the second p
art of the question, I think the 
--
 
in terms of 
any headwinds, I would say there's a few areas, as we talked about last 
quarter with some of the supply issues that we had related to the Thailand 
floods that caused certainly issues, some issues for us speci
fically in the 
areas of some parts of cameras, audio, video, office equipment. And so you 
saw some of that impact in Q4, as well as Q1. The good news for us with our 
platform is we have many, many different sellers. So where we had supply, 
we continue to o
ffer those for customers. And in cases where we didn't, 
oftentimes we had third parties that may have had 
--
 
still had inventory. So 
it certainly helped us very well to get through that situation. So those are 
some of the headwinds that were in Q1. And the
n we had very strong broad 
growth amongst many categories, certainly, in terms of the retail categories. 
And we also had very strong growth in Kindle. Globally, AWS is growing 
very, very fast. So we had some very, very positive, if you will, tailwinds 
from
 
the strong growth.

We'll take our next question from Carlos Kirjner with Sanford Bernstein.
 
Carlos Kirjner

Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division
 
Two questions, if I may. First, on fulfillment. If you think of the expected 
authoriz
ation of your fulfillment network in the fourth quarter of this year 
versus what you had in the fourth quarter of '11, do you expect it to be the 
same, higher or lower? And secondly, on Kindle, now that you are a 
manufacturer, a seller of Android
-
based dev
ices, can you comment on your 
intellectual property position and the strategic and financial risks associated 
with potential lawsuits from competitors? For example, do you intend to go 
buy patents in the market?
 
Thomas J. Szkutak
 
In terms of the first ques
tion, in terms of fulfillment utilization, difficult to 
say at this point what our utilization will be. We have a very good team of 
people who work on this in each of our geographies, trying to make sure we 
have adequate capacity throughout the year, as we
ll as for Q4. And it's 
always a tough balance. We want to make sure that we have enough 
because we want to make sure we satisfy customers. And so we'll have to 
see as we progress through the year what the growth looks like. And we 
certainly 
--
 
based on wha
t we're experiencing so far, we expect it to be very 
good. And we'll have to see what happens in future months and quarters to 
see what that looks like. So it's a little bit early to say what we think that 
utilization will be. But we're trying to make sure
 
in any time we do this is to 
have enough but not too much. And it's a delicate balance, so hard to 
predict what it will be. In terms of your second question, I don't think there's 
a lot I can help you with there. We have 
--
 
we certainly have a lot of 
tech
nology that we develop ourselves. And we have a great technical team 
that's working a lot of different interesting areas on behalf of customers and 
will continue to do so. Beyond that, there's not a lot I can comment.
 
Operator
 
And we'll go next to Jordan R
ohan with Stifel, Nicolaus.
 
Jordan Rohan

Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division
 
A couple of point of clarification. I don't think I heard you blame macro 
weakness in Europe. Now clearly, you had stronger results across
-
the
-
board, 
so I don't see 
it evident in the results. Are you clear enough about the 
direction of the macro or its impact on your European operations that you 
can kind of say, at least from what you're seeing, it's not affecting you now? 
And the second question is on this percentage
 
of third
-
party versus first
-
party sales. Last quarter, I believe you said that it got up to 36% in part 
because of stockouts due to the Thai flood and such. At some point, one 
would think that the supply chain for cameras and other equipment affected 
by t
he Thai flood would normalize. Would we expect that to therefore 
normalize back down from 39% level back down to the mid
-
30s? How can 
we think about that relationship?
 
Thomas J. Szkutak
 
Sure. In terms of the macro economics of Europe specifically, it's 
--
 
we're 
not exactly a bellwether for the economy, and so it's hard to assess. It 
certainly is having some impact on us. And you're certainly reading the same 
press as we are in terms of what's going on, and it's very challenging. But 
it's hard to quantify wh
at that impact is, so we're certainly having some 
impact but it's hard to quantify, is how I would explain it. And then in terms 
of 3P, we have 
--
 
we've seen the dynamic that you're talking about in terms 
of it has helped us with stockouts both in Q4 and Q
1 for sure and has helped 
growth. Where does it moderate? Hard to say. But we have seen outside of 
these 2 quarters, very good third
-
party growth. And that's been accelerating 
over the past couple years in terms of third
-
party unit growth. There's a 
number
 
of different factors in terms of making that experience better for 
sellers. The most notable one is Fulfilled by Amazon. And so that's certainly 
having an impact in all the geographies that we operate and have that in. 
And so it's great for sellers, it's 
great for customers and it's great for 
shareowners. So it's a nice intersection there. So we're very excited about it, 
and that's really what's driving it. The stockouts and things, those will 
happen from time to time in various categories. And I think tha
t's certainly 
one of the benefits of our model of having both first
-
party and third
-
party 
offerings. But I wouldn't view that as the substantial driver of what's 
happened in third party over the last few years. It's other things that we've 
done to improve 
that experience for sellers.

Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division
 
Just had a couple questions around AmazonSupply. And I guess, first, 
wondering if this is the beginning of a 
bigger push into the B2B kind of 
industrial space. And then secondly, what do you all see as your strongest 
assets as you approach this space? Are you planning to rely a lot on third 
party for inventory? And then just finally, along those lines, the press 
release mentions the extension of corporate credit. Wondering how integral 
this might be to the strategy. And then just more broadly, how do you think 
about credit extension to customers?
 
Thomas J. Szkutak
 
In terms of the AmazonSupply, it's an interesting 
--
 
we've been serving 
businesses for some time. This is just again a separate URL to help us do 
that with some interesting selection, we think, on behalf of businesses. We 
work very closely with a lot of businesses today, both as a customer on our 
consumer
 
side of our business. We also obviously have a lot of third
-
party 
sellers that we work with as part of our seller business. So we're very 
excited about that. In terms of any 
--
 
in terms of extension of credit and 
everything, those are things that we're wo
rking through. And we want to 
make the right decisions on behalf of those customers. And I can't add much 
to that today. But certainly we can talk more about that in the future as that 
evolves.

On the Kiva acquisition, I was wondering if you could talk about how you're 
planning on implementing that at your fulfillment centers. And does it 
require much incremental investment? An
d then more broadly about mobile 
purchasing behavior, wondering if you could speak to just the purchasing 
behavior you're seeing from your consumers in terms of what's the order of 
magnitude and what type of mix shift in buying that you're seeing from PC 
a
nd mobile? That would be great.
 
Thomas J. Szkutak
 
In terms of Kiva, it's early. We haven't closed it yet. And so we're very, very 
excited to be having Kiva and the team as part of the Amazon team. We're 
extremely excited to have that. And in terms of imple
mentations within 
Amazon, we still have a lot of work to do to figure out how and when we'll 
do that. And so those are things that we'll be working on. But we're very, 
very excited about the opportunity to join with Kiva. So we're excited about 
it. In term
s of mobile, not a lot I can help you with there. Certainly, the 
mobile part of our business is growing very, very fast. And it's a very 
exciting opportunity. And this is not something that's new; it's something 
that we've been working on for a number of y
ears in a number of 
geographies. And we'll continue to work on that experience to make it even 
better for customers over time.

And we'll go next to Justin Post with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.

First question is on taxes. Can you help us at all understand what percent of 
your marketplaces currently pay taxes similar to, say, offline retail? And 
maybe any help on what you saw on New York with the tax law changes 
there. Maybe star
t with that, and then one follow
-
up.
 
Thomas J. Szkutak
 
I'm sorry. Could you repeat the first part of the question?
 
A. Justin Post 
-
 
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division
 
Yes. What percent of your market, including International markets, are 
already on what
 
we call level
-
tax basis, meaning the taxes are the same for 
buying on Amazon versus an offline retailer?
 
Thomas J. Szkutak
 
Yes. So you're saying sales tax.
 
A. Justin Post 
-
 
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division
 
Yes, sales tax, yes.
 
Thomas J. Szkutak
 
Assum
e that approximately 50% of our sales, we either collect a sales tax or 
a value
-
added tax. So we collect it in several states today in the U.S. and a 
large number of geographies outside of the U.S. And so it's approximately 
50%. So this is not anything new
. This is something that we've been doing 
for a long period of time. And we have very good businesses in those 
geographies and states that we collect.
 
A. Justin Post

BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division
 
And did you see any slowdown in states where they'
ve enacted sales taxes 
in your sales levels?
 
Thomas J. Szkutak
 
Yes. I can't comment on any specific geography or state. But again, you can 
see by the growth that we've experienced over the past few years, which 
includes during those past few years, certain
ly adding some geographies, if 
you will, to our collection efforts. And so those are all represented in the 
results that you've seen over the past few years and several years. So that's 
all I can add to that.

And we'll go next to Herman Leung with
 
Susquehanna Financial Group.

Two quick questions. First, I know there's a lot of investment going on in the 
data center areas for your Web Services business. I was wondering at the 
curren
t level, I mean, what 
--
 
how much capacity you're able to support, 
especially as you're signing on more of these larger type customers on the 
government side? And I have a quick follow
-
up.
 
Thomas J. Szkutak
 
Yes. No, we're ready for additional demand. The t
eam has worked extremely 
hard to make sure that we keep up with demand. And so as you've seen 
over the past few years now, you're seeing our CapEx growing. As a result of 
it, you're seeing the operating expense as it relates to that in our technology 
and c
ontent. And so the team has done a very nice job in terms of adding 
capacity and is very excited to continue this fast growth that we're 
experiencing in AWS. So we're very happy to do that.

And just a very quick follow
-
up. I guess, on your 
--
 
the GMV that's flowing 
through your third
-
party business, is there an opportunity over time to kind 
of share with us the real power of the third 
--
 
just the third
-
party volume 
that's actually flowing t
hrough the top line?
 
Thomas J. Szkutak
 
We have 
--
 
the best way to think about it, at least from our 
--
 
as it relates to 
our retail and third
-
party business, they're not 
--
 
it's certainly not a 1
-
for
-
1 
because you have new and used products. You have differ
ent category mix. 
But in terms of an overall volume perspective, as I mentioned in some of the 
earlier comments, that it was about 30 
--
 
approximately 39% of our total 
units, so it's very meaningful. And that's growing 
--
 
grew over 60% this 
quarter, again,
 
up from 36% of our total units. So again, it's 
--
 
I can't give 
you the GMV. But in terms of units as it relates to our retail units, it's 39% 
of total units, so it's meaningful.

And we'll go next to Ben Schachter with Macquarie.

Given the success of the ad
-
supported Kindle, should we expect more 
devices to be offered with an ad
-
supported option? And then also if any 
comments on the dynamics driving the increase in the shipping revenue. 
And finally, a
ny update on the share buyback?
 
Thomas J. Szkutak
 
Yes. In terms of what we do going forward, we certainly have a long
-
standing practice of not talking about what we would do going forward, so 
you have to stay tuned on that. In terms of the share repurchase
, as I 
mentioned in the opening comments, we purchased 5.3 million shares, just 
under $1 billion, $960 million during the quarter. We have a little over $700 
million or just under $800 million left on our authorization that we have from 
the board, which wa
s $2 billion, that we got some ago. So that's left on the 
authorization.
 
Operator
 
And we'll take our last question from Colin Sebastian with R.W. Baird.
 
Gregor Schauer

Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research 
Division
 
This is Gregor Schauer in for Co
lin. I have a question regarding the Kindle 
Fire, which you guys have noted for the quarter is still the #1 bestselling 
and most gifted product on Amazon.com. But it's still only selling in the U.S. 
Can you help us think through or understand sort of what 
are the other 
considerations in terms of the timing of an international rollout of the Kindle 
Fire?
 
Thomas J. Szkutak
 
I really can't. I think you'd have to stay tuned. It's certainly a very 
interesting opportunity for us. And we know that, and you'll have 
to stay 
tuned.
 
Operator
 
And that concludes our question
-
and
-
answer session. I'd like to turn the 
conference back to our speakers for any closing remarks.
 
Thomas J. Szkutak
 
Thank you for joining us on the call today and for your questions. A replay 
will be 
available on our Investor Relations website at least through the end 
of the quarter. We appreciate your interest in Amazon.com and look forward 
to talking with you again next quarter.
 
Operator
 
Thank you, everyone. That does conclude today's conference. We 
thank you 
for your participation.

Good day, and welcome to the Amazon Quarterly Conference Call. [Operator 
Instructions] At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Rob 
Eldridge. Please go ahead, sir.
 
Robert Eldridge
 
Hello, and welcome to our Q4 2010 
financial results conference call. Joining 
us today is Tom Szkutak, our CFO. We will be available for questions after 
our prepared remarks.
 
The following discussion and responses to your questions reflect 
management's views as of today, January 27, 2011 on
ly and will include 
forward
-
looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional 
information about the factors that could potentially impact our financial 
results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, 
including 
our most recent annual report on Form 10
-
K.
 
As you listen to today's call, we encourage you to have our press release in 
front of you, which includes our financial results, as well as metrics and 
commentary on the quarter.
 
During this call, we will discuss
 
certain non
-
GAAP financial measures. In our 
press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the 
SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional 
disclosures regarding these non
-
GAAP measures, including reconcil
iations of 
these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Finally, unless otherwise 
stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the 
comparable period of 2009.
 
Now I'll turn the call over to Tom.
 
Thomas Szkutak
 
Thanks, Rob. I'll begi
n with comments on our fourth quarter financial results. 
Trailing 12
-
month operating cash flow increased 6% to $3.5 billion. Trailing 
12
-
month free cash flow decreased 14% to $2.52 billion. Return on invested 
capital was 34%, down from 66%. ROIC is TTM fre
e cash flow divided by the 
average total assets minus current liabilities, excluding the current portion of 
long
-
term debt over five quarter ends.
 
The combination of common stock and stock
-
based awards outstanding was 
465 million shares compared with 461 m
illion shares. Worldwide revenue 
grew 36% to $12.95 billion or 37%, excluding the $139 million unfavorable 
impact from year
-
over
-
year changes in foreign exchange rates. We're 
grateful to our customers who continue to take advantage of our low prices, 
vast 
selection of free shipping offers, including Amazon Prime.
 
Media revenue increased to $5.23 billion, up 12% or 13%, excluding foreign 
exchange rates. EGM revenue increased to $7.39 billion, up 60% or 62%, 
excluding foreign exchange rates. Worldwide EGM inc
reased to 57% of 
worldwide sales, up from 48%. Worldwide unit growth was 43%. Active 
customer accounts exceeded 130 million. Worldwide active seller accounts 
were more than 2 million. Seller units were 30% of total units. Consolidated 
gross profit grew 33%
 
to $2.63 billion and gross margin was 20.3%.
 
Now I'll discuss operating expenses, excluding stock
-
based compensation. 
Fulfillment, Marketing, Technology and Content and G&A combined was 
$2.01 billion or a 15.5% of sales, up 101 basis points year
-
over
-
year
. 
Fulfillment was $1.06 billion or 8.2% of revenue compared with 7.7%. Tech 
and Content was $456 million or 3.5% of revenue compared with 3.1%. 
Marketing was $368 million or 2.8% of revenue, consistent with prior year.
 
Now we'll talk about our segment resu
lts, and consistent with prior periods, 
we do not allocate the segments or stock
-
based compensation or other 
operating expense line items. In the North America segment, revenue grew 
45% to $7.21 billion. Media revenue grew 13% to $2.37 billion. EGM 
revenue
 
grew 71% to $4.56 billion, representing 63% of North America 
revenues, up from 54%. North America segment operating income increased 
6% to $295 million, a 4.1% operating margin.
 
In the International segment, revenue grew 26% to $5.74 billion. Revenue 
grow
th was 29%, adjusting for the $143 million year
-
over
-
year unfavorable 
foreign exchange impact during the quarter. Media revenue grew 11% to 
$2.87 billion or 13% excluding FX. And EGM revenue grew 46% to $2.83 
billion or 50%, excluding foreign exchange. EGM
 
now represents 49% of 
international revenues, up from 43%. International segment operating 
income increased 3% to $327 million, a 5.7% operating margin. Excluding 
the unfavorable impact from foreign exchange rates, International segment 
operating income i
ncreased 16%.
 
CSOI grew 4% to $622 million, or 4.8% of revenue, down 146 basis points 
year
-
over
-
year. Excluding the $18 million unfavorable impact from foreign 
exchange, CSOI grew 7%. Unlike CSOI, GAAP operating income includes 
stock
-
based compensation exp
ense and other operating expense. GAAP 
operating income was relatively flat at $474 million or 3.7% of net sales. 
Our income tax expense was $84 million in Q4 or 17% rate for the quarter. 
GAAP net income was $416 million or $0.91 per diluted share compared
 
with 
$384 million and $0.85 per diluted share.
 
Now I'll discuss full year results. Revenue grew 40% to $34.2 billion. North 
America revenue grew 45% to $18.71 billion, and International grew 33% to 
$15.5 billion, 34% growth excluding year
-
over
-
year change
s in foreign 
exchange rates. Consolidated segment operating income or CSOI grew 23% 
to $1.94 billion or 25%, excluding $28 million of unfavorable year
-
over
-
year 
impact from foreign exchange, and operating margin decreased 75 basis 
points to 5.7%. GAAP oper
ating income grew 25% to $1.41 billion or 4.1% 
of net sales.
 
Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and marketable securities increased $2.4 
billion year
-
over
-
year to $8.76 billion. Inventory increased 48% to $3.2 
billion, and inventory turns were 11.4, down f
rom 12.2 turns a year ago, as 
we expanded selection, improved the in
-
stock levels and introduced new 
product categories.
 
Accounts payable increased 44% to $8.05 billion, and accounts payable days 
increased to 72 from 68 in the prior year. Our Q4 2010 capit
al expenditures 
were $328 million. The increase in capital expenditures reflects additional 
investments in support of continued business growth, including investments 
in technology infrastructure, including Amazon Web Services, capacity to 
support our fulf
illment operations and investments in corporate office space.
 
I'll conclude my portion of today's call with guidance. Incorporated into our 
guidance are the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe 
to date to be appropriately conservative a
ssumptions. Our results are 
inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, 
including a high level of uncertainty surrounding exchange rate fluctuations, 
as well as the global economy and consumer spending. It's not possible to 
acc
urately predict demand, and therefore, our actual results could differ 
materially from our guidance.
 
As we've described in more detail in our public filings, issues such as settling 
inter
-
company balances in foreign currencies amongst our subsidiaries, 
unf
avorable resolution of legal matters and changes to our effective tax 
rates can all have a material effect on guidance. Our guidance further 
assumes that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions or 
investments, record any further revisions to
 
stock
-
based compensation 
estimates and that foreign exchange rates remain approximately where 
they've been recently.
 
For Q1 2011, we expect net sales of between $9.1 billion and $9.9 billion, a 
growth of between 28% to 39%. This guidance anticipates appro
ximately 
140 basis points of favorable impact from foreign exchange rates. GAAP 
operating income to be between $260 million and $385 million or between 
34% decline and 2% decline. This includes approximately $140 million for 
stock
-
based compensation and am
ortization of intangible assets, but we 
anticipate consolidated segment operating income, which excludes stock
-
based compensation and other operating expenses to be between $400 
million to $525 million or between 21% decline and 4% growth.
 
We remain heads
-
down focused on driving a better customer experience 
through price, selection and convenience. We believe putting customers first 
is the only reliable way to create lasting value for shareholders. Thanks.
 
And with that, Rob, let's move to questions.

[Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from 
Mark Mahaney 
with Citi.
 
Mark Mahaney 
-
 
Citigroup Inc
 
First, on the gross margin trends, down a little bit year
-
over
-
year. Would 
that have been impacted by the strong sale of Kindle devices in the fourth 
quarter? And second, could you just talk broadly abou
t the Subscribe and 
Save offering that you have and to what extent you've seen cross selling 
into more consumer
-
staple items amongst your customer base?
 
Thomas Szkutak
 
In terms of gross margins. You are seeing some volatility to look at the 
individual quar
ters from 2010. You saw that we were down a bit in Q1, up 
the next two quarters slightly and then down a little bit in Q4, about 
approximately 45 basis points. And we haven't been talking much more on 
the gross margins because we don't think it's that mean
ingful, and that's 
what we're trying to point people to the bottom again. And the reason we're 
doing that is because of the mix of business. And so what you're seeing 
there in gross margins in Q4 is we have a very broad mix of businesses and 
geographies th
at are going into that number. And again, you're seeing some 
volatility in the individual quarters. But again, we're very pleased with what 
we saw in Q4 in terms of growth and overall performance of the business. 
And it reflects a very heavy investment loa
d to support the growth that we 
expect. In terms of the Subscribe and Save, could you repeat the question 
again?
 
Mark Mahaney 
-
 
Citigroup Inc
 
What kind of impact had you seen or what kind of adoption rate have you 
seen for that and just broadly, your penet
ration, what kind of consumer 
staple spending amongst the Amazon customer base?
 
Thomas Szkutak
 
Sure. Subscribe and Save is going very well. It's something that certainly 
customers like a lot. And we're getting that benefit in the consumer portion 
of the co
nsumer category today, again, it's something that we're excited 
about and customers are excited about, so we're happy to offer it to them.

And we'll take our next question from James Mitchell with Goldman Sachs.
 
James Mitchell

Goldman Sachs Grou
p Inc.
 
Just two questions about revenue growth, and I don't want to sound critical 
of revenue growth because obviously, growth rate's very high. But just 
picking into two components. First of all, is there any big obvious reason 
why international growth de
celerated while the domestic growth 
accelerated? And then secondly, in the Media business, if e
-
book sales are 
now bigger than paperback sales and paperback sales continue to grow, is 
there a big obvious reason why total media sales is growing at 13% rathe
r 
than a slightly faster number? I assume that the agency accounting for e
-
books is part of that, perhaps?
 
Thomas Szkutak
 
In terms of overall growth, we are very pleased with what we saw, just kind 
of frame up that discussion a bit. We saw 40% growth year
-
over
-
year total 
year 2010, which is the best growth rate we've seen since 2000. We saw Q4 
growth rate overall of 37% on local
-
currency basis, which matches our best 
growth rate for any Q4 we've had on a local
-
currency basis since 2000. And 
then unit growth
 
was 43%, which certainly going back several years, we 
haven't seen any quarter that's had that growth. So we're seeing very 
strong growth across many categories, across many geographies. In terms 
of the international growth specifically, if you look back 
to last year, we did 
have very strong media growth in international in Q4. You'll see that it's up 
26% on a local
-
currency basis, which is one of the strongest quarters we've 
had, and we're overlapping that. There were some new releases that were in 
Q4 las
t year. Most notably, the Windows 7 release one, Dan Brown's book in 
Germany is other, those are a few examples, but there are a few releases 
that were in there. The other piece to that we haven't 
--
 
certainly difficult to 
quantify but there was certainly 
some impact from some of the weather that 
we saw in Europe during the month of December. But again, we're very 
pleased with the growth that we saw in Q4 in total, including international, 
and we're happy with what we see there. In terms of some of your que
stions 
surrounding media. Again, we are seeing good growth there. As you 
mentioned, we're seeing, so far, quarter date this quarter, we saw that 
Kindle books exceeded paperbacks, which is very exciting and while having 
paperbacks continue to grow, year
-
ove
r
-
year. So again, we're seeing very 
strong growth there. So again, we're pleased with the growth we're seeing 
across the business.
 
James Mitchell 
-
 
Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
 
Is there a track on the media growth from the accounting of the agency e
-
books?
 
Tho
mas Szkutak
 
Could you say that again?
 
James Mitchell 
-
 
Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
 
Is the fact that some of the e
-
books are being sold on an agency rather than 
on a consignment basis, this year is that acting as a drag on growth 
temporarily, in terms of your 
reported revenue?
 
Thomas Szkutak
 
Certainly, the agency piece is included in the numbers that we reported 
today. But in terms of the impact, we're not breaking that out. But again, 
we're very excited with the growth that we're seeing within books, e
-
books 
s
pecifically and physical books are going well as well.

We will take our next question from Spencer Wang with Credit Suisse.
 
Spencer Wang 
-
 
Crédit Suisse AG
 
First, Tom, for the first quarter guidance, it would seem like your operating 
income guidan
ce implies that you are still reinvesting in the business. Could 
you just give us a little bit more color on is it still fulfillment centers? Is it 
tech and content, all of the above? And secondly, with the Lovefilm's 
acquisition, can you just walk us thro
ugh the rationale and how you'll 
integrate that with perhaps your other video
-
on
-
demand businesses?
 
Thomas Szkutak
 
Sure. In terms of the guidance, let me just put that in context. And probably 
the best way to do it is just again a reminder on 2010. The 
fact that we had 
very strong growth, the best growth we've seen in 10 years. Fourth quarter 
matched the best, on a local
-
currency basis growth, matched the best fourth 
quarter we've had since 2000. And again, very strong unit growth and the 
best we've seen
. With all that growth, we had to add a lot of capacity, most 
of which was in the second half of last year. We added fulfillment capacities 
for the corner retail business. We added fulfillment capacities to support our 
growing fulfilled by Amazon business 
was part of our seller business. We 
added a lot of infrastructure capacity to support our fast
-
growing AWS 
business, as well as our retail business. So those reflected, when you look at 
our Q4 results and our 2010 results, those are reflected in the CapEx 
numbers that you're seeing, and those are reflected in the fulfillment as well 
as the tech and content lines when you look at our operating expense line 
items. And so because it was largely back half of the year loaded, you're 
seeing more of that in Q1. So
 
those are reflected in the growth rate. Now 
the question will be we're not giving guidance beyond Q1, but what will this 
mean going forward? And so one of the things that we're doing is certainly, 
when you look at our Q1 guidance, you look at our topline 
guidance, we're 
cautiously optimistic about Q1, in a very strong growth. And we'll have to 
see how much we invest throughout the year in 2011 based on that. But 
again, I'm very, very happy with the capital we're able to deploy. You should 
keep in mind that
 
with the sheer amount of capacity that we added in 2010, 
it doesn't become, it's not fully utilized day 1 and we don't get the optimum 
productivity on day 1. So what that means is we get productivity on those 
operations. We get returns on those assets tha
t we deploy over a period of 
time. But if you look at our history, we've gotten very good returns on that 
capital. And so to me, I'm very pleased to put that capital in place. And if we 
have to add more in 2011, it will be a high
-
quality problem.

And on Lovefilms?
 
Thomas Szkutak
 
Lovefilm, we think it's just a very exciting opportunity. We've had a close 
association with that business for some time. We're very pleased to be able 
to offer customers the media space within Europe
 
they're offering. So again 
we're very excited about it, and you have to stay tuned on that one.

Barclays Capital
 
First, I just wanted to ask in terms of the r
evenue growth that you're 
expecting for 1Q, can you give us a sense of how much you're anticipating 
from acquisitions? And then secondly, if you could comment just on your 
thinking around the living social investment and also what you may have 
learned from
 
the recent daily offer which you ran within the last week or so?
 
Thomas Szkutak
 
In terms of the guidance for Q1, specifically in terms of acquisitions, the 
Lovefilm or Quidsi, which haven't closed yet are not reflected in guidance. So 
those are not in our
 
Q1 numbers. In terms of living social, we're very 
pleased with the investment that we've made there. In terms of any 
commentary on the recent deal, the recent one
-
day offer that they had. 
We're very excited that they offered Amazon gift certificates, and 
we think 
it's great for customers and we're happy they've enabled that.

We will take our next question from Brian Pitz with UBS.
 
Brian Pitz 
-
 
UBS Investment Bank
 
First, an update on AWS. It looks like other revenue in North America slowed 
pretty s
ignificantly and I realized that's a decent part of Other. Any 
commentary on what was the main driver of that slower growth? And 
second, on Grocery, can you give us a little more insight on your initiatives 
there and the potential cost impact from expandin
g this category?
 
Thomas Szkutak
 
In terms of AWS, we're extremely pleased with how AWS is going. It's 
growing at a very fast rate. We're investing in that business to support that 
growth rate. You're correct, in terms of seeing the North America Other 
growt
h rate drop from 52% to 45% year
-
over
-
year from Q3 to Q4. Keep in 
mind that there's a number of things in there including AWS that tend to be 
a little lumpy. But we did see actually an acceleration of growth in AWS from 
Q3 to Q4. So built into that number,
 
it actually accelerated. So again we're 
very pleased with the growth that we're seeing there. In terms of Grocery, 
we have two things that you probably could be referring to. One is our 
Drygoods business, which is within our Consumer business that we're v
ery 
pleased with that we have on Amazon.com, as well as some other sites. In 
addition to that, we have a local test here in Seattle called Amazon Fresh. 
Again, that is a test that we've been conducting. We're pleased with how the 
test is going. But again, 
it's a test and we'll continue to see how that goes 
and see if we invest further on that test. Again, we do a number of tests in 
different parts of our business and that happens to be one of them. We have 
a great team that's working on it, but you'll have 
to stay tuned to see if we 
do more there.

We will take our next question from Youssef Squali with Jefferies.
 
Youssef Squali

Jefferies & Company, Inc.
 
Tom, can you tell us how many distribution centers you actually had at the 
end of 2010? I know 
you're not going to guide to 2011. But since you're 
guiding to Q1, are you planning opening on any distribution centers, and 
what's your CapEx for Q1?
 
Thomas Szkutak
 
We had approximately 52 at the end of 2010. We added 13 last year. We 
will add more fulfil
lment centers this year. We haven't said, we weren't 
saying how many yet because again we're trying to determine what the 
growth rate will be. And based on what we've seen in Q1, we're certainly 
cautiously optimistic which is reflected in the growth rate y
ou see for 
guidance for Q1. So we'll have to wait and see, and we'll be back with you as 
we go throughout the year. But just to be clear, again, I've mentioned in one 
of the other questions that I think would be a very high
-
quality problem. And 
the reason 
why I say that is what our teams are doing around the world 
right now, which is the same thing we've been doing for the last 15 or 16 
years in working with our various fulfillment centers is even though we're 
not fully utilized in some of these new assets 
that we deployed in 2010 or 
our productivity is not optimum, that team will work to utilize those assets. 
As we continue to grow, we'll get better and better productivity as we go, 
just like we have in our other fulfillment centers around the world that we
've 
had experience with. So we're very excited about that. And so when you 
think about the fulfillment centers, even though they can be a little bit 
dilutive in the short term by looking at our fulfillment expense, the reason 
why I'm very excited about is 
that you can just look at our return on 
invested capital. If you take our return on invested capital at the end of 
2010, we had approximately $7.4 billion of invested capital. That's a 5
-
point 
average over the last five quarters. If you take out cash and m
arketable 
securities over the same period, that's about $6.5 billion. So we have about 
$900 million of invested capital. And even with our heavier spend in CapEx 
last year, we generated $2.5 billion of cash flow. So we have an excess of 
250% of return on o
ur invested capital x cash and marketable securities. 
And so again, that's a full business. It includes a lot of things over a period 
of time. But if you think about that capacity where we need it because of 
growth, we're certainly very happy. We do it jud
iciously and make sure we 
do it appropriately. But very happy to deploy that capital to get great returns 
for shareholders over time. And again, the returns that we've gotten are 
certainly historical, not predictive. But again, we're very happy to deploy 
t
hat capital, and I feel very good about it.

fulfillment.

We will take our next question from Colin Sebastian with Lazard Capital 
Markets.
 
Colin Sebastian

Lazard Capital Markets LLC
 
One follow up on the gross margins. I think historically, Amazon's 
pricing 
philosophy has been to be a price follower. And I guess I'm curious if 
perhaps you're loosening that strategy up a bit, maybe to be a price leader 
in more categories?
 
Thomas Szkutak
 
In terms of pricing, we've had a number of different strategies ov
er the 
course of our history. But certainly, our objective is to have great values for 
customers over all of our selection, over all of our geographies, and that 
hasn't changed. And so we're very excited to offer customers that. It's a 
reason, certainly on
e of the drivers for the growth that we've been able to 
have over our history. And so one of the things that we do, do is when we 
enter a new category and add selection within that category, we price it day 
1 as competitively as we can. So in other words, 
we price it competitively 
day 1 based on the intelligence we have. And sometimes that means it's a 
very low gross margin because we're just entering those particular 
categories with those particular items. And that's something we've been 
consistently doing
 
for a number of years, and we like that strategy.

We will take our next question from Ben Schachter with Macquarie.

Macquarie Research
 
There's a lot of interest in how the Kindle ecosystem actually impacts the 
margin. I was w
ondering if you could just help us understand, the one 
question would be all
-
in Kindle hardware and software, the whole thing 
together, how is that impacting gross margin? And then overall, how should 
we think about how the agency model and the e
-
books how
 
that's going to 
impact margin? And then just one quick one. There's been some speculation 
about the potential to bundle services with Amazon Prime. I was wondering 
if you could tell us how you think about that and if that's something that 
may be interesti
ng in the future?
 
Thomas Szkutak
 
First off, we have a long
-
standing practice of not breaking out any individual 
products or categories. But what I can say about Kindle is it's growing very 
fast. We're extremely pleased with what we're seeing. We sold milli
ons of 
devices in Q4. The content business, the content part of it is growing very 
fast as evidenced by some of the comments we put in the earnings 
release. .So far quarter
-
to
-
date this quarter again Q1, we have Kindle 
content, Kindle book sales growing at
 
a faster rate than paperbacks, which is 
really exciting. And so that business is going very well. And with the 
opportunity that we see there, we're continuing to invest in that business. 
We think it's a very good business for us, and we're excited about t
he long
-
term opportunity there.

Maybe you could explain why Kindle is a better business for Amazon? And 
then secondly, you talked 
about gross margin maybe not being the best way

better? And do you have individual management targets as far as 
compensation or as a company as a whole and where you want to get to for
 
operating margins?

I guess I'm asking why Kindle is a better business than your traditional 
book

selling media business?
 
Thomas Sz
kutak
 
Well, we happen to like both. Even though we're extremely excited about 
our Kindle business, our physical book business continues to grow as well. 
And so we're very excited about both parts of our business. And again we 
think, when I was mentioning K
indle, we just think it's a great opportunity 
for us. It has great tracks right now. Customers like it. We're able to offer so 
many titles right now on less than 60 seconds right to for a customer to be 
able to read. And one of the things you can't do with
 
a physical book is you 
can't, from a service perspective with our model, it's very difficult to get it to 
a customer now. And with Kindle, we can do that in less than 60 seconds. 
You can carry around your library with you very lightly, and so we think it'
s 
just great for customers, and we're seeing that the growth, both in terms of 
devices and content, is just fantastic. And so we're continuing to invest and 
continue to improve that experience for customers. In terms of gross 
margins versus operating margi
ns, we actually don't focus a lot on individual 
percentages, whether it be gross margins or operating margins. We're 
focused on ultimately over the long term on free cash flow, free cash flow 
per share. We like to look at our return on invested capital. I 
mentioned 
earlier what our return on invested capital is today. That includes 
appropriately so the cash and marketable securities that we have in that 
balance. But certainly, if you were to deploy that cash and return that to 
shareholders over time, you ca
n see the underlying returns on invested 
capital x cash are very high and in excess of 250% right now. And so we 
think it's a very efficient capital business, and we think that we certainly like 
the model that we have and the opportunity that it brings to 
our 
shareholders over the long term.

Securities.
 
Jeetil Patel

Deutsche Bank AG
 
First of all, I guess when you look at the Kindle side of the equation, do you 
believe that the proliferation of Kindle apps across devices, not just your 
own device, is helping to increase the overall consumption of books across 
the industry or Amazon? An
d then second, I guess as it relates to 
international, where do you stand in terms of Pan
-
European fulfillment 
capabilities, say shipping from Germany into the Netherlands into 
Scandinavia, et cetera?
 
Thomas Szkutak
 
In terms of Kindle apps, we think it's g
ood for customers that they can read 
their Kindle books on their Kindle, as well as many other devices. And so 
that's what you see today. We have these apps so that it's easy for 
customers to be able to do that. Customers like that feature, and you should 
expect us to continue to expand that over time. So how much is it 
contributing to overall growth? It's hard to say. But again, customers are 
responding to the vast selection that we have, the great prices we have for 
Kindle content, the ease of which they 
can carry it around with them with 
the great convenience on the device, the Kindle device itself, so we're very 
excited about it. In terms of fulfillment. We continue to work with our 
fulfillment to make it as seamless as possible for customers. That's rea
lly 
what it's all about in each of the geographies we're in, and we'll continue to 
do so. So wherever we can make that service within Europe, better for 
customers, we will. It will come from whatever fulfillment center makes 
sense.

You've had tremendous growth in customers over the past year, about 24 
million or so. Do you think that your lifetime kind of value of the customer 
equation has changed? Particularly as you looked at you have initiatives like 
Kindle and 
Prime. Do you think that the economics have changed, obviously, 
for the better that you're acquiring more aggressively? Is that how we 
should think about some of these newer initiatives that you've had over the 
last several years that have been certainly b
een pretty impactful?
 
Thomas Szkutak
 
No, I think, not commenting on the lifetime value of customers. But we 
continue to offer new things for customers to make the experience better for 
customers. So we're adding new selection to make that better for 
custom
ers. We launched Prime a number of years ago which continues to 
grow because we want to make sure that we give great service to 
customers. Many of our digital initiatives are around how do we make sure 
we get customers, not only creating great price and gr
eat selection but they 
get to have their content immediately. And so those are the things 
--
 
that is 
always 
--
 
with us, we start with the customer first. That's where our focus is. 
We found that by aligning with the customer, it's been great for customers 
as well as great for shareholders over time. So that's the focus that we've 
had and the driver behind the initiatives over the past several years.

Question on marketing. If we look at marketing as a percentage of revenues 
this year, it was up and I believe you said one of the main reasons was the 
inclusion of Zappos. And as we think about your marketing spend in 2011, is 
that the sort of
 
seasonality and pattern that we should look for or is 
anything changing in your approach to marketing?
 
Thomas Szkutak
 
Well, certainly we added, continued to support the Zappos marketing spend 
in 2010. That was a part of it. We're always looking for ways t
o reach 
customers through our marketing spend. We also did, you'd probably 
noticed a fair amount of Kindle ads during 2010, primarily starting for the 
most part heavier after Q1 of last year, which we saw a great response to.

Question on Prime membership. Now that it's been active in the U.S. for

penetration in terms of it, the existing customer base?

We are seeing adoption of Prime in our geographies. It continued 
to grow 
nicely, and customers like Prime. They like that service element of Prime. 
We have different offerings, depending on the geography that we're offering 
it in. In the U.S., you can get express two

day shipping for free, you get one 
day and also some 
other offers, in terms of weekend offers as well. So

extent that you can kind of quantify that for us? And in light of the 
investments in this quarter, 
I guess it's worth at least asking if you still feel 
like 10% is the right long
-
term operating margin to be thinking about for the 
whole business?
 
Thomas Szkutak
 
In terms of when the fulfillment centers will reach their optimum utilization 
and productivity
, we're still getting productivity on existing fulfillment 
centers that we've had for quite some time. So it'll be something that will 
evolve over a longer period of time. But again, if you look at the returns that 
we've gotten on the previous fulfillment 
centers that we've launched, they 
have been great uses of capital. So we're very happy about that. And in 
terms of your question on double
-
digit operating margins, we've said for a 
long time and nothing's changed in that regard. We think that certainly 
dou
ble
-
digit operating margins are possible. If it means that we have some 
high single
-
digit operating margin that maximizes free cash flow, we're 
certainly okay with that and have room to go there. But we're certainly 
focused on how do we get the best free c
ash flow, free cash flow per share 
while getting great efficiency on our invested capital. And so nothing's 
changed there.

We will take our last question from Sandy Aggarwal with Caris & Company.

Tom, in our 
assessment, there are many international markets which have 
grown healthier than the growth you achieved in Q4? And I know it is a 
blended growth number and probably some FX dynamics. But are you seeing 
any basically local e
-
commerce players getting strong
er in international 
market? And secondly, any early signs of traction for the launch of the site in 
Italy?
 
Thomas Szkutak
 
Again, we grew 29% on a local
-
currency basis for international, 26% on a 
dollar basis, a challenging compare from fourth quarter of 20
09 where we 
certainly, from a media perspective, had one of our best growth rates that 
we've had in any quarter previously. EGM grew at 50% on a local
-
currency 
basis, so very strong growth. And again, we have a long
-
standing practice. 
We're not talking abo
ut other companies, but we're very pleased with what 
our international team is doing. We have a great opportunity there for 
further growth. In terms of Italy, very early, but pleased with what we're 
seeing so far, and I like the opportunity there.

Good day everyone, and welcome to the Amazon.com fourth quarter 2012 
financial results teleconference. At this time, all participants are in a listen
-
only mode. After today's presentation, we will conduct a question
-
and
-
answer session. 
Today's call is being recorded.
 
For opening remarks, I will be turning the call over to the Vice President of 
Investor Relations, Mr. Sean Boyle. Please go ahead.
 
Sean Boyle
 
Hello and welcome to our Q4 2012 financial results conference call. Joining 
us tod
ay is Tom Szkutak, our CFO. We will be available for questions after 
our prepared remarks.
 
The following discussion and responses to your questions reflect 
management's views as of today, January 29, 2013 only and will include 
forward
-
looking statements. A
ctual results may differ materially. Additional 
information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is 
included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our 
most recent annual report on Form 10
-
K.
 
As you li
sten to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press 
release in front of you, which includes our financial results, as well as 
metrics and commentary on the quarter. During this call, we will discuss 
certain non
-
GAAP financial measures. In o
ur press release, slides 
accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is 
posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these 
non
-
GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with 
comparable 
GAAP measures.
 
Finally, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against 
our results for the comparable period of 2011. Now, I will turn the call over 
to Tom.
 
Thomas Szkutak
 
Thanks, Sean. I will begin with comments on our fourth quarte
r financial 
results. Trailing 12 month operating cash flow increased 7% to $4.81 billion. 
Trailing 12 month free cash flow decreased 81% to $395 million. Trailing 12 
months capital expenditures were $3.79 billion.
 
This amount includes $1.4 billion in purch
ases of our previously leased 
corporate office space as well as property for development of additional 
corporate office space located in Seattle, Washington which we purchased in 
the fourth quarter. The increase in capital expenditures reflects additional 
investments in support of continued business growth consisting of investing 
in technology infrastructure including Amazon Web Services and additional 
capacity to support our fulfillment operations.
 
Return on invested capital was 4%, down from 22%. ROIC is 
TTM free cash 
flow divided by average total assets minus current liabilities excluding the 
current portion of long
-
term debt over five quarter ends. The combination of 
common stock and stock
-
based awards outstanding was 470 million shares 
compared with 460
 
million shares one year ago.
 
Worldwide revenue grew 22% to $21.27 billion or 23% excluding the $178 
million unfavorable impact from year
-
over
-
year changes in foreign 
exchange. We are grateful to our customers who continue to take advantage 
of our low pric
es, vast selection and shipping offers. Media revenue 
increased to $6.51 billion, up 8% or 10% excluding foreign exchange. EGM 
revenue increased to $13.93 billion, up 28% or 29% excluding foreign 
exchange. Worldwide EGM increased to 65% of worldwide sales,
 
up from 
63%. Worldwide paid unit growth was 32%. Active customer accounts 
exceeded 200 million. Worldwide active seller accounts were more than 2 
million. Seller units represented 39% of paid units.
 
Now, I will discuss operating expenses excluding stock
-
b
ased compensation. 
Cost of sales was $16.14 billion, or 75.9% of revenue, compared with 
79.3%. Fulfillment, marketing, technology and content in G&A combined was 
$4.45 billion, or 20.9% of sales, up approximately 293 basis points year
-
over
-
year. Fulfillmen
t was $2.2 billion, or 10.3% of revenue compared with 
9.3%. Tech and content was $1.22 billion, or 5.7% of revenue, compared 
with 4.5%. Marketing was $833 million, or 3.9% of revenue compared with 
3.3%.
 
Now, I'll talk about our segment results, and consist
ent with prior periods, 
we do not allocate segments, our stock
-
based compensation or other 
operating expense line item. In the North America segment, revenue grew 
23% to $12.17 billion. Media revenue grew 13% to $2.9 billion. EGM 
revenue grew 24% to $8.5 b
illion, representing 70% of North America 
revenues, up from 69%. North America segment operating income increased 
114% to $608 million, a 5% operating margin.
 
In the international segment, revenue grew 21% to $9.09 billion. Adjusting 
for the hundred $83 mi
llion year
-
over
-
year unfavorable impact from foreign 
exchange, revenue growth was 23%. Media revenue grew 5% to $3.61 
billion, or 7% excluding foreign exchange and EGM revenue grew 35% to 
$5.43 billion, or 37% excluding foreign exchange. EGM now represents
 
60% 
of international revenues, up from 54%.
 
International segment operating income decreased 61% to $70 million a, 
0.8% operating margin. Excluding the unfavorable impact from foreign 
exchange, International segment operating income decreased 56%.
 
CSOI in
creased 47% to $678 million, or 3.2% of revenue, up approximately 
54 basis points year
-
over
-
year. Unlike CSOI, our GAAP operating income 
includes stock
-
based compensation expense and other operating. GAAP 
operating income increased 56% to $405 million, or 
1.9% of net sales.
 
Our income tax expense was $194 million in Q4, resulting in a 58% rate for 
the quarter and 79% rate for the full year 2012. GAAP net income was $97 
million, or $0.21 per diluted share, compared with $177 million and $0.38 
per diluted sha
re.
 
Now, I will discuss the full year results. Revenue grew 27% to $61.0 9 
billion. North America revenue grew 30% $34.81 billion and International 
revenue grew 23% to $26.28 billion, or 27% growth excluding year
-
over
-
year changes in foreign exchange.
 
Cons
olidated segment operating income or CSOI increased 6% to $1.67 
billion, or 7% excluding the unfavorable year
-
over
-
year impact from foreign 
exchange and operating margin decreased 54 basis points, 2.7%. GAAP 
operating income decreased 22% to $676 million, 
or 1.1% of net sales.
 
Turning to the balance sheet, cash and marketable securities increased 
$1.87 billion year
-
over
-
year to $11.45 billion. Inventory increased 21% to 
$6.03 billion and inventory turns were 9.3, down from 10.3 turns a year ago 
as we expand
ed selection, improved in stock levels and introduced new 
product categories. Accounts payable increased 20% to $13.32 billion and 
accounts payable days increased to 76 from 74 in the prior year.
 
In Q4 2012, we usually $3 billion of senior non
-
convertible 
unsecured debt in 
three, five and seven
-
year tranches with proceeds to be used for general 
corporate purposes. I will conclude my portion of today's call with guidance.
 
Incorporated into the guidance are the order trends that we have seen to
-
date and what 
we believe today to be appropriately conservative 
assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and maybe materially 
affected by many factors, including a high level of uncertainty surrounding 
exchange rate fluctuations as well as the global econom
y and consumer 
spending.
 
It's not possible to accurately predict demand and therefore our actual 
results could differ materially from our guidance. As we described in more 
detail in our public filings, issues such as settling intercompany balances and 
fore
ign currencies amongst our subsidiaries, unfavorable resolution of legal 
matters and changes to our effective tax rates can all have a material impact 

additional business acquisitions, in
vestments or settlements, record any 
further revisions to stock
-
based compensation estimates and that foreign 
exchange rates remain approximately where they have been recently.
 
For Q1 2013, we expect net sales of between $15 billion and $16.6 billion or 
gr
owth between 14% and 26%. This guidance anticipates approximately 122 
basis points of unfavorable impact from foreign exchange rates. GAAP 
operating income or loss to be between the $285 million loss and $65 million 
positive income compared to $192 million
 
income in the prior period year.
 
This includes approximately $285 million for stock
-
based compensation and 
amortization of intangible assets. We anticipate consolidated segment 
operating income which excludes stock
-
based compensation and other 
expense to 
be between zero and $350 million compared to $390 million 
income in the prior period.
 
We remain head sound focused on driving a better customer experience 
through price, selection and convenience. We believe putting customers first 
is the only reliable way
 
to create lasting value for shareholders.
 
Thanks for that. Sean, let's go to questions
 
Sean Boyle
 
Great, thanks, Tom. Let's move on to the Q&A portion of the call. Operator, 
will you please remind our listeners how to initiate a question.
 
Question
-
and
-
Answer Session
 
Operator
 
(Operator Instructions) We will take our first question from Scott Devitt with 
Morgan Stanley.
 
Scott Devitt 
-
 
Morgan Stanley
 
Tom, it looks that you have successfully begin the transition of your logistics 
costs in the d
irection of being more of a fixed fulfillment cost with lower unit 
based shipping costs, given that the growth rate of about shipping now 
meaningfully below the fulfillment growth rate. So the question is, is this 
something that we should expect to continu
e now in the back of this 
meaningful fulfillment center expansion ramp?
 
Then separately, but on the same topic, we are also wondering, are there 
other parts of the business in which you can make this transition to more of 
a fixed cost in the future? Thanks
.
 
Thomas Szkutak
 
In terms of the fulfillment question, you are right in terms of over the past 
few years, we have expanded in our fulfillment network pretty extensively to 
the point where we are closer to customers and you are seeing that reflected 
in our 
transportation cost, you can obviously see the fulfillment expense is 
certainly not fixed in terms of absolute terms but you can see that we had 

that you are seeing. But that is
 
a benefit of having adding to our fulfillment 
center network. We get closer and closer to customers with a lot of great 
selection. So you are seeing that reflected in the individual of business gross 
margins, which shows up as benefits of transportation c
ost.
 
In terms of other opportunities, certainly there are a number of 
opportunities as we invest in individual customer experience areas across 
the business. Many of those would be on our website. We have a relatively 
fixed expense as we launch those and w
e amortize those costs over our full 
customer base. So as they grow to become more effective on a per unit or 
per customer basis. So there is a number of opportunities that we have had 
and will have going forward to do that.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. We will tak
e our next question from Douglas Anmuth with 
JPMorgan.
 
Douglas Anmuth 
-
 
JPMorgan
 
Great, thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to ask about the shift to 
third
-
party, I guess in particularly, I think last 4Q you talked about shifting 
more the business 
in the videogame space, in particular the third
-
party 
categories that you would specifically point to in this last 4Q, you already 
made sort of a similar shift. Thanks.
 
Thomas Szkutak
 
We did see, you know, a good expansion as you mentioned in 3P, a third
-
p
arty units as a percentage of total units increased from 36% last year Q4 to 
39% on expansion of approximately 300 basis points. Our overall unit 
growth rate for the quarter in total was 32%. Our third
-
party growth rate 
was in excess of 40%, so, again, nic
e growth. You are certainly seeing it in a 
number of areas.
 
You see it certainly in our EGM business look. If you look at our North 
America growth rates are unique and see that our revenues, up 23% but our 
third
-
party, our total unit growth rate was a subs
tantially faster than that, 
and our third
-
party units were growing very fast there as well, so there's a 
number of differently that you are seeing that, but certainly you are seeing it 
there.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. We'll take our next question Brian Pitz with
 
Jefferies.
 
Brian Pitz 
-
 
Jefferies
 
Great. Thanks. Looks like you are moving more in the direction of same
-
day 
shipping. Would you provide any thoughts or insights here? Should we 
anticipate a significant ramp
-
up of fulfillment center build out, particularl
y in 
Q2, Q3? And, maybe, if you could just comment more generally on your FC 
built out plans U.S. versus international? Thanks.
 
Thomas Szkutak
 
There is not a lot I can comment on in terms of our plans similar to last year 
no as we progress through the year
, we can give you further updates on 
what we plan to do there. Last year, we opened up 20 new fulfillment 
centers, and so we saw in a very rapid growth in fulfillment capacity last 
year, and stay tuned and we'll let you know more as the year progress 
there
.

there seems a bit of a disconnect versus an active customer growth that 
didn't decelerated as much on a per customer basis, are you seeing some 
sort of change in overall activity. Is that the impact of newer international 
markets?
 
Then just on the investment cycle, the last couple of calls, you've 
consistently called out futur
e investments whether the $1.4 billion for 
Seattle or distribution center expansion. You didn't do it this quarter I don't 
over read into it, but does that we are at the end of a major investment 
cycle? Thanks.
 
Thomas Szkutak
 
In terms of unit growth, there
's not a lot more I can add to it. We did see 
very strong, we saw substantially unit growth and revenue growth in terms 
of the paid unit growth in Q4 unit, which we are seeing very strong third
-
party growth as well, was up over 40%.
 
In terms of investment 
cycle, I wouldn't read into anything related to that. 
We will still be adding capacity during 2013 in terms of the levels of how 
much we'll add. As I mentioned earlier in the call, just stay tuned and we will 
let you know as the year progresses.

Great, thanks. I was wondering if you give us just a bit of a sense of what 
you are seeing as you the rollout fulfillment centers into new state. 
Obviously the sales tax issue has 
been that's come up a good bit, but you 
touched on the impact of being closer with faster delivery in those same 
state. Net
-
net, what do you see as being the impact on not asking you to 
give us kind of a state by state breakdown, but the impact of rolling 
out the 
fulfillment center footprint taking both of those things into accounts.
 
Thomas Szkutak
 
I am not really sure how best to answer your question. I mean, we certainly 
have expanded pretty dramatically over the past really coming out of 2009 
between 201
0, 2011 and 2012. We've rapidly increase our footprint globally. 
Your comment was more directed towards the U.S., but we have also rapidly 
increased our footprint in the U.S.
 
As a result of that, your book category selection, a much broader selection 
close
r to customers as you would expect with this rapid increase. We have 
also expanded selection during that time period. So we continue to be in the 
locations we would like to be in and we will continue to expand our footprint 
over time and become even closer
 
and closer to customers. Beyond that 
there is not a lot I can add.

Good afternoon. Some high level query minus the margin difference between 
1P and 3P. I know in the
 
past you talked about you being agnostic between 
the two but the growth in 3P and what your CSOI margins imply that 3P has 
little bit higher margin. Is that the correct read through? Thanks.
 
Thomas Szkutak
 
There is some variation by business but certainly
 
that we attempt to do as 
from my pricing standpoint, is to try to be agnostic. That is really how we 
run the business. Again, this is on a third
-
party versus retail. Then, we have 
also added certainly a lot of other services over the past year in terms of
 
fulfillment. So it really depends upon where we are in the investment cycle, 
what our utilization is.
 
As you know, certainly as you look at the last few years, we have been in 
very heavily expanding in terms of fulfillment capacity because of the growth 
t
hat we have been experiencing that certainly would put pressure on our 
overall cost structure. Certainly as a per unit basis because we are not 

years after expanding.
 
So depending 
on what type of customer is, you know, whether it is a retail 
unit, a straight third
-
party units or NFPA unit but again we are certainly 
attempting this on a product basis to be roughly agnostic.

Thanks, guys. First, on the device strategy with Kindle and Kindle HD, can 
you help us at all what you are seeing with the attach rate trend on digital 
goods after people buy the Kindles. Then generally, do you see a higher 
overall GMV per cu
stomer on Kindle devices than users on Amazon Apps 
through other devices?
 
Thomas Szkutak
 


at least a
 
sense of the health of the business, the number that was in the 
release today. We sure have a multi
-
billion
-
dollar e
-
book business, growing 
approximately 70% year
-
over
-

that rate after really just launching the
 
business approximately five years 

 
We are seeing good, I can't give you specific numbers but we have seen 
very good progress on a number of our other digital media categories. 
Video, I talked ab
out a little bit earlier, we are seeing Prime customers. 
Certainly the percentage of Prime customers who were watching free content 
through Prime Instant Videos has gone up dramatically year
-
over
-
year.
 
We have also increased Prime membership dramatically, 
year
-
over
-
year. 
They are also purchasing a paid content. Those customers that are using 
this, they watch free but they are also paying for new content which is great.
 
We have launched a number of new services on the music side. Most 
recently, our CD with free MP3, which we have on many titles. It's still very 
early but we certainly like that service and pleased to offer to customers. So 
I can't give you specific for att
ach rates but the business is making good 
progress on the video content side. Again it's still very early.

Thanks, guys. Just two quick questions. As you guys build o
ut the Prime 
membership and the fees available through FBA, you run into this challenge 
of increase in your unit volume of tail items and at the same time we need 
to get products to customers in much shorter shipping cycle. So, can you 
talk about how the n
ew fulfillments helps on that front? Is your reliance on 
air going down as a percent of total items shipped. Then if I remember 
correctly, you guys reclassified some FBA revenue in early 2012. Can you 
just remind how that flows through the shipping revenue
 
line and what could 
happened as you count that in the beginning of '13. Thanks.
 
Thomas Szkutak
 
Sure. Just in terms of overall selection, as we added to Prime, what I was 
talking about earlier in terms of having a more expanded footprint is, there's 
no uni
t question that's helping us add additional selection more economically 
to Prime. And so on, that's both in terms of third
-
party selection as well as 
our retail selection and so that's something that we know continue to have 
the benefit of as we get more a
nd more members in Prime and have the 
bigger, bigger concentration of two
-
day shipping U.S. for that.
 
So, we did add the shipping portion FBA fees in Q1 of 2012 and we see some 
benefit year
-
over
-
year, but we are still seeing leverage in terms of, you 
know,
 
ex the FBA fees quite a bit leverage there, so we I do not have a 
specific number for you there, but yes we are still seeing quite a bit of 
leverage there, ex the re
-
class that you are referring to.

Great. Thank you. Last year you reported 4Q in the lower half of revenue 
range and you were able to call out Taiwan and video games category. Any 
reasons why revenues were kind of in the lower half this quarter?
 
And then if yo
u look at gross profit growth, it clearly has accelerated to 40% 
growth, but unit growth decelerated to 32%.Can you describe what's driving 
that kind of accelerating gross profit in the face of lower unit growth, and is 
it possible maybe you are letting th
e third parties handle some of the many 
less profitable categories for Amazon. Could you talk about that all? Thank 
you.
 
Thomas Szkutak
 
If you take a look at our growth rate, where we think the growth rate for Q4 
was solid. It was up 23% on revenue basis q
uite a bit higher than on a unit 
growth basis up 32% year
-
over
-
year. In terms of some of the things that we 
saw and we again we saw solid growth across many different categories and 
geographies year
-
over
-
year.
 
Certainly some things to call out in terms of 
things that may have been a 
little bit softer. A few examples would be, we did see some of the higher 
average selling price items, particularly the items greater than $1,000 a little 
bit softer, a few of the consumer electronics, you subcategories like TVs
, 
MP3 players digital cameras to some extent were softer. But, again, with the 
base that we have in Q4, still very solid growth.
 
Another one, certainly we are thrilled to have a Paperwhite in our lineup best 
e
-
reader that's out there and we are very please
d with it, but we couldn't 
keep up with demand. We would have had more sales in Q4 for able to keep 
up with demand and so the team is working very hard to make sure we have 
good in

stock going forward on that product, but we certainly could have 
sold more 
in Q4.

Great. Thanks very much for taking my question. I want to ask you on 
Amazon Instant Video, how you thought about your current offering
 
and 
your ability to add exclusive content in a cost effective manner through 
Amazon Studios, and what the relationship is between adding more titles 
and uses on your hardware such your Amazon Kindle devices? Thanks.
 
Thomas Szkutak
 
We will continue to expa
nd our selection, both in terms of Amazon Instant 
Video as well Prime Instant Video and we will do that in a number of 
different ways. We think we have a very interesting selection right now and 
you should expect that will be spending more on content as it
 
relates to 
Prime over time. We will continue to add selection on the Instant Video. 
Beyond that, you have to stay tuned.

Hi, I just had a question on your other segm
ent line. Can you talk a little bit 
about the non
-
AWS drivers within that line as you are advertising? As you 
look out, are there advantages to you in terms of having AWS as far as 
offering things like buying, serving, analytics through the AWS platform to
 
advertisers? Where are you in that rollout phase now? Thank you.
 
Thomas Szkutak
 
In terms of the AWS business, the business is growing very fast. We have 
increased the number of services pretty dramatically over the past several 
years. The team is 
doing a fantastic job there. We will continue to innovate 
on behalf of customers in that space. There is a number of other things that 
go into that line item. Some are credit card as well as other marketing 
revenue goes in there. But again, AWS is in that 
line item.

Hi, thanks. I wondered if you gave comment on the pace of business 
throughout the fourth quarter? Did you see a particular deceleration in the 
month of D
ecember? Then second question, on international, I am 
wondering, are there any call outs in terms of specific countries that may 
have been weighing on profitability? Countries where there is going to be 
outsized dollars of investment going on or accelerate
d investment at the 
current time. Thank you.
 
Thomas Szkutak
 
There are not a lot of specifics. We have long been in the practice of not 
talking about trends in within the quarter in terms of year
-
over
-
year growth 
or anything like that. Obviously the Q4 is v
ery seasonal. December is, by far, 
the largest the month followed by November but in terms of individual 

 
In terms of international, yes, there certainly are geographies that we are 
investing in heavily. 
Certainly China would be one. Some of the European 
countries including some of the new launches that we are investing in. Those 
are certainly, you are seeing those represented in those segment results.

Rohit Kulkarni

Okay, thank you for taking my question. In terms of your recent margin 
profile, actually comparing U.S. and international, I guess over the past four 
quarters, the vast majority improvement or rather the less worse ma
rgin 
trends that we have seen have been due to U.S. margins improving while 
international were declining in the range of 300 to 350 basis points. In Q4, 
international declined just 160 basis points. So my questions, should we 
read this as a beginning of a 
trend that we saw how domestic margins 
increased over the last four quarters and whether international should follow 
similar route over the next foreseeable future.
 
Thomas Szkutak
 
Yes, there is not a particular call out that I could make on that. The only 
thing that I would, in terms of the change I am referring to, but in terms of 
the difference between two, keep in mind that, a couple of factors. One, mix 
of business is a little bit different. Our AWS businesses is in North America 
segment. You also have 
some newer geographies. Or geography that I 

heavily that have a longer
-
term horizon for returns, the ones I mentioned 
earlier. So those are factors as you look at the two differen
t segments.

First just an accounting clarification, it should be pretty interesting, but the 
content cost for Prime Instant Video flowing to the cost of goods line even 
there is no direct revenue associated not into the tech and content line, 
rig
ht? Is that right?
 
Thomas Szkutak
 
That's correct.
 
Jordan Rohan 
-
 
Stifel Nicolaus
 
Okay. So, gross margins would be even higher if those costs were included 
elsewhere or broken out separately? It also seems like it's becoming a 
separate question. It's someth
ing kind of common or to reduce the carrying 
value of your investment in LivingSocial. Give a feel on a broad strategic 
level as to whether the local deals business through Amazon local or through 
LivingSocial is something that you care to keep investing i
n? Thanks.
 
Thomas Szkutak
 
There's not a lot I can specifically talk about as it relates to LivingSocial 
beyond, what's on our result today and what we'll have in our 10
-
K, which 
we filed soon, and so I would encourage you take a look at in our full 
disclosures related to that. But in terms of local, there certainly is still a very 
interesting opportunity there. We do have a couple, we have an investment 
in LivingSocial, we also have a local business ourselves.
 
So, it's an interesting opportunity, it'
s a long
-
term opportunity in and we will 
continue to work on that customers to make that experience even better and 
you should think about it, not unlike a lot of the other businesses that we 
invest in with over long
-
term horizon and it's not very early th
ere.

conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over 
to Mr. Rob Eldridge, please go ahead, Sir.
 
Robert Eldridge
 
Hello, and welcome to our Q3 2010 
financial results conference call. Joining 
us today is Thomas Szkutak, our CFO. We will be available for questions 
after our prepared remarks.
 
The following discussion and responses to your questions reflect the 
management's views as of today, October 21, 
2010 only, and will include 
forward
-
looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional 
information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is 
included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, includ
ing our 
most recent annual report on Form 10
-
K.
 
As you listen to today's call, we encourage you to have our press release in 
front of you, which includes our financial results, as well as metrics and 
commentary on the quarter.
 
During the call, we will disc
uss certain non
-
GAAP financial measures. In our 
press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the 
SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional 
disclosures regarding these non
-
GAAP measures, including recon
ciliations of 
these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Finally, unless otherwise 
stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the 
comparable period of 2009. Now, I'll turn the call over to Tom.
 
Thomas Szkutak
 
Thanks Rob. I'll b
egin with comments on our financial results. Trailing 12
-
month operating cash flow increased 16% to $2.62 billion. Trailing 12
-
month 
free cash flow decreased 5% to $1.83 billion. Return on invested capital was 
28%, down from 50%. ROIC is TTM
-
free cash flow
 
divided by average total 
assets minus current liabilities excluding the current portion of long
-
term 
debt over five quarter ends.
 
The combination of common stock and stock
-
based awards outstanding was 
465 million shares compared with 451 million shares. W
orldwide revenue 
grew 39% to $7.56 billion or 40%, excluding the $83 million unfavorable 
impact from year
-
over
-
year changes in foreign exchanges rates. We're 
grateful to our customers who continue to take advantage of our low prices, 
fast selection and fre
e shipping offers, including Amazon Prime.
 
Media revenue increased to $3.35 billion, up 14% or 15% excluding foreign 
exchange rates. EGM revenue increased to $3.97 billion, up 68% or 71% 
excluding foreign exchange rates. Worldwide EGM increased to 53% of 
w
orldwide sales, up from 43%. Worldwide unit growth was 41%. Active 
customer accounts were approximately 121 million. Worldwide active seller 
accounts were more than 2 million. Seller units were 34% of total units.
 
Consolidated gross profit grew 39% to $1.7
7 billion, and gross margin was 
23.5%.
 
Now, I'll discuss our operating expenses, excluding stock
-
based 
compensation. Fulfillment, marketing, technology and content in G&A 
combined was $1.37 billion or 18.2% of sales, up 120 basis points year
-
over
-
year. Ful
fillment was $657 million or 8.7% of revenue, compared with 
8.2%.
 
Tech and content was $386 million or 5.1% of revenue, compared with 
4.9%. Marketing was $234 million or 3.1% of revenue, up from 2.6% in the 
prior year.
 
Now, I'll talk about our segment resu
lts and consistent with prior periods, we 
do not allocate the segments or stock
-
based compensation or other 
operating expense line item.
 
In the North America segment, revenue grew 45% to $4.13 billion. Media 
revenue grew 13% to $1.59 billion. EGM revenue g
rew 80% to $2.33 billion 
representing 56% of North America revenues, up from 45%. North America 
segment operating income increased 19% to $186 million, up 4.5% 
operating margin.
 
In the international segment, revenue grew 32% to $3.43 billion. Revenue 
growt
h was 35%, adjusting for the $86 million year
-
over
-
year unfavorable 
foreign exchange impact during the quarter. Media revenue grew 16% to 
$1.76 billion or 18% excluding FX. And EGM revenue grew 54% to $1.64 
billion or 60% excluding FX. EGM now represents 4
8% of international 
revenues, up from 41%.
 
International segment operating income increased to 11% to $215 million, a 
6.2% operating margin. Excluding the unfavorable impact for foreign 
exchange, international segment operating income increased 20%.
 
CSOI g
rew 15% to $401 million or 5.3% of revenue down a 112 basis points 
year
-
over
-
year. Excluding the $15 million unfavorable impact from foreign 
exchange, CSOI grew 19%. Unlike CSOI, our GAAP operating income 
includes stock
-
based compensation expense and other
 
operating expense. 
GAAP operating income grew 7% to $268 million or 3.5% of net sales.
 
Our income tax expense was $79 million in Q3 or a 27% rate for the 
quarter. GAAP net income was $231 million or $0.51 per diluted share 
compared with $199 million and $
0.45 per diluted share.
 
Turning to the balance sheet, cash and marketable securities increased 
$1.88 billion year
-
over
-
year to $5.88 billion. Inventory increased 56% to 
$2.52 billion and inventory turns were 11.8 down from 12.1 turns a year 
ago, as we exte
nded selection, improved in
-
stock levels and introduced new 
product categories.
 
Accounts payable increased 38%, $4.61 billion and accounts payable days 
increased to 73 from 72 in the prior year. Our Q3 2010 capital expenditures 
were $315 million. The incre
ase in capital expenditure reflects additional 
investments and support of continued business growth, including investment 
in technology infrastructure including Amazon Web Services, capacity to 
support our Fulfillment operations and investments in corporat
e office space. 
We expect this trend to continue throughout 2010.
 
I'll conclude my portion of today's call with guidance. Incorporated into the 
guidance of the order trends that we seen to
-
date and what we believe 
today to be appropriately conservative ass
umptions. Our results are 
inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, 
including a high level of uncertainty surrounding exchange rate fluctuations, 
as well as the global economy and consumer spending. It's not possible to 
accur
ately predict demand, and therefore our actual results could differ 
materially from our guidance.
 
As we described in more detail in our public filings, issues such as settling 
intercompany balances and foreign currencies amongst our subsidiaries, 
unfavorab
le resolution of legal matters and changes to our effective tax 
rates can all have a material effect on guidance. Our guidance further 
assumes that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions or 
investments, record any further revisions to stock
-
based compensation 
estimates and net foreign exchange rates remain approximately where they 
have been recently.
 
For Q4, we expect net sales of between $12 and $13.3 billion a growth 
between 26% and 48%. This guidance anticipates approximately 70 basis 
poi
nt of unfavorable impact from foreign exchange. GAAP operating income 
to be between $360 and $560 million between 24% decline and 18% 
growth. This includes approximately $140 million for stock
-
based 
compensation and amortization of intangible assets.
 
We an
ticipate consolidated segment
-
operating income, which excludes

One question please, the growth rates for the business on our segment sales 
basis described between North America and in international is about 10 

I was just wondering if you could comment on the respective unit sales 

 
Thomas Szkutak
 


 
we are not breaking out the unit growth by segment, but we 
are seeing, very st


difference between North America revenue growth and international, we do 
have the impact of Zappos included in the North Ameri
can numbers this

And for our next question from Mark Mahaney with Citi, please go ahead.
 
Mark Mahaney 

 
Citi
 
Thanks. I just wanted to ask a little bit mo
re about the Q4 guidance, 
particularly on the CSOI line. Typically, you are able to generate in flattish 

that because some of the investments you wanted to rollout in the 
Septembe
r quarter are being delayed? Are there new levels of investments 
that you are looking for in the December quarter? Are you rolling out more 
distribution centers there? Anymore color on why the sequential decline in 
margins is a little bit out of the norm? 
Thanks.
 
Thomas Szkutak
 
Thanks Mark. Yes, we have launched or opened about 10 performance 
centers right now. We have a couple more that are coming over the coming 

we are seeing in
 
Q4, obviously we have been incurring some cost on those 
three as well prior to Q4, but again you will see that ramping up.
 
The other thing too is we will continue to add capacity for infrastructure as 

 
as well as our very fast 
growing AWS business, so those are impacting the guidance which you see 
there.

Great, thank you for taking the question. You are offering a range of free 
pass by to Amazon Prime such as Amazon Prime for students and Amazon 
Prime for mothers, how do you persuade the consumers to receive Prime for 
free

to

value and make full use of t
he service by purchasing more products 
as those consumers who are paying for Prime typically do?
 
Thomas Szkutak
 


 
offered free 
trials for Prime members going back to few years now, and the reason why 

Mom right now.
 
The reason why we were doing that was we wanted to make sure that 
customers co
uld see the experience real time and we find that when 

consistently and so the other two programs that you mentioned, the Student 
and Mom, still very early and we are happy with what we se
e but we are still 
very early.

Your next question is from Brian Pitz with UBS.
 
Brian Pitz 

 
UBS
 
Thanks. What percent of the increase in fulfillment was due to the shift of 
third
-
party fulfillment from COGS that you highlighted the last quarter? And 
then more a longer term question, can you talk about your strategy in online 
video distribution, does i
t make sense for be it a rollout of subscription 

 
Thomas Szkutak
 
We are not breaking out the change that you mentioned, but you can 

 
the 
way you should think about it is would be a similar amount 
last year in Q3, 
as it was in Q2 in terms of basis points. In terms of the second, can you 
repeat the second part of your question on..?
 
Brian Pitz 

 
UBS
 
Just in terms of your online video distribution, obviously you have VOD with 
over 65,000 titles, but m
igrating to a subscription streaming product, can 
you just give us a little thought on that given the success of some of your 
competitors?

Our next question comes from Douglas Anmuth with Barclays Capital, please

Barclays Capital
 
Thanks for taking the question. Thomas, I wanted to ask you about the 
media business and hoping you could give us a little bit more co
lor in terms 
of the sub
-
segments, in particular I think you commented last quarter that 
physical books were still growing in a double
-
digit phase, if you could let us 

equity inc

quarters, can you provide a little bit of color there and how we should think 
about that going forward? Thanks.
 
Thomas Szkutak
 
Sure. First, the media, in terms of 

 

ica, maybe 

that we have there. As it relates to books, we saw very strong revenue 
growth in the quarter, in fact from the unit perspective we saw accelerated 
growth in both physical 
and Kindle books in Q3 relative to Q2, so very strong 
growth during the quarter.
 
We did see in a couple of our categories some softness, particularly music 
and video as we overlap some higher revenue in last year Q3 specifically. In 
the music side, we had 
very strong growth last year with some of the 
Michael Jackson titles. We also had very strong growth with the Beatles Box 
and video games, specifically video game consoles.
 
There was very strong price reductions from the manufactures and which 
caused great
 

North America media never succeed, but again we are very pleased with 
overall categories in media.
 
In terms of the equity income and in terms of how you should think about it, 
we did have included
 
in our guidance and I will give you the total numbers, 
but excluded from the guidance that we gave approximately 90 days ago, 
we did not include Woot acquisition and the impact from the quarter is 
roughly 30 million in revenue. From a CSOI perspective, we
 
had a few 
million dollar loss for the quarter.
 
And then because we had an investment in Woot, we had to step up that

Hey, good afternoon. If you can talk a little bit about your efforts in China, 

they are best picking up some traction. Is there any data points you can 
share with us in terms of numb
er of distribution centers, just general 
outlook, at what point do you think China particularly can start moving the 
wheels for Amazon? Thanks.
 
Thomas Szkutak
 
Well, China is a very interesting long
-
term potential and we have businesses 
growing very fast th
ere. We continue to add capacity there, we continue to 
work on trying to make sure we have a great experience of customers and 


all of our geography. So 

very interesting long

Our next question comes from Colin Sebastian with Lazard Capital Markets.
 
Greg O'Shara 

 
La
zard Capital Markets
 
Yes, hi. Greg O'Shara
 
for Colin Sebastian. I was hoping maybe you could 
help provide some more color on the widening disparity between the 
electronics, the EGM sectors for North America and international.
 
I know Zappos and Woot are not
 
included, but surely the widening disparity 


sector internationally versus the US?
 
Thomas Szkutak
 
Well, again,
 
you did call out couple items that are rather sizable, particularly 
the Zappos piece is rather sizable, so that certainly is impacting the size and 


 

 
very, very pleased with EGM in both segments, they are 
both growing very fast and as you can see that even in Q3 for international 

added a lot of new categories over the past two 
years there and they have 

growth in EGM and very excited about the future there.

Hi, thank you very much. Tom, you guys launched grocery delivery in the 

some of the local competitors, can you speak the
 
strategy there and any 
plans to launch a similar service in the U.S.
 
I know you are testing it in a couple of places, but maybe talk about more 
nationwide rollout? And then just a housekeeping item, how much revenue is 
baked in your Q4 guidance from the B
uyVIP acquisition that you did this 
quarter? Thank you.
 
Thomas Szkutak
 

reflected in the guidance that we have given today. In terms of the first 
question, we think that grocery

Our next question comes from Jeetil Patel with Deutsche Bank Securities, 
please go ahead.
 
Jeetil Patel 

 
Deutsche Bank Securities
 
Great, couple of questions. I guess, on the Prime side of the business, do 
you think you you've built great 
--
 
you've buil
t great brand affinity with the 
Prime service as a whole.
 
Do you think there are opportunities to bundle or offer additional free 
products, programs and services within that Prime program? Will the 
consumer adopt it, and is there maybe different tierings t
hat you can create 
off of that, in terms of $79 and $89 or $99 with additional products and 
services folder then?
 
Then second, around the Kindle side of the business, are there opportunities 
to leverage Whispersync across other forms of content, such as 
music and 
gaming or is there any sort of technical limitations around that? Thanks.
 
Thomas Szkutak
 
In terms of the opportunity for Prime, we like what we see in Prime, the way 
that we would try to expand the benefit to customers to
-
date has been to try 
to 
make sure that we have more selection available for Prime customers. We 
do that in a number of different ways, one is we add retail offerings, 
additional retail selection.
 

Amazon and whe
n you list with fulfilled by Amazon and have availability and 
stock
 
those products available for our free shipping programs, which is 
Super Saver Shipping in the US as well as Prime. So those are the things 
that we have been doing to try to make Prime better. We will continue to 
look at ways to make Prime even better for c
ustomers over time and we will 
have to wait and see on that. In terms of the second part of your question, I 
apologize not a lot I can add to answer that question. I apologize in terms of 
this technology and its use outside of Kindle.

dle of next year. How should we think about modeling that 
business for next year? Any color you can give us into how it may impact the 

 
Thomas Szkutak
 
Yeah, it is, we as you can probably appreciate Jim,
 

anything about any specific, our partnership that we have and this will be no 
exception. I guess one way to think about it though is with something like 
this, we continue to grow like we are growing, we will likely need more 
capacity 
going forward and so we will be able to use capacity for, in this type 
of an event.

Our next question is Imran Khan with JP Morgan, please go ahead.
 
Imran Khan

JP Morgan
 

Imran. Thank you very much for taking my questions. Two quick 
questions; one, international gross margins were down 80 basis point year
-
over
-
year. Just trying to get a sense like where you stand in terms of 
ramping up the third party business or some of th
e new category launch, 

down and how should we think about it?
 
And then secondly, the marketing costs were up 63% year
-
over
-
year basis. 
I start to think is it a new normal or is that
 
like more of a one
-
time kindle 
marketing going on? If you can shed any light that would be very helpful? 
Thank you.
 
Thomas Szkutak
 
Sure. In terms of international gross margins, there is a number of dynamics 
there, certainly pricing is impacting it. We ar
e getting very good traction in 
third party, continue to get good traction in third party within international.
 


at are 
growing, those categories growing very well as I mentioned the growth is up 
60% year
-
over
-
year on local currency basis in total and what ends up 
happening when you launch new categories is many of those are low gross 
margins at the start and then we
 
worked very hard overtime to be more 
efficient to buy better and so those categories improve over time. So again 
those are the things that are impacting gross margins.
 
In terms of marketing, a couple of things to think about; one, you are right 
we are a l
ittle over 3%, very similar to what we were in increase year
-
over
-
year last quarter, the primary area that we spend in marketing is web page 
search and associates still. Keep in mind that when you look at year
-
over
-

 
we continue to support the 
marketing efforts for Zappos which is included in that cost.
 
As you mentioned also, we are also doing some ads from a television 
standpoint for Kindle included in those numbers as well.

Sandeep Aggarwal 

 
Caris & Company
 
Alright, Tom, in your prepared remarks you did update us on the spending 
on procurement center et cetera. I guess the 
question is that you are 
spending on fulfillment and centers and as well as IT capacity. If Q4 will take 
care of most of the higher than norm spending or will you go beyond that? 
And secondly now that you have three years of history on selling Kindle, in 
l
ong run will you think the 999 price plan will prevail or a $15? Thank you.
 
Thomas Szkutak
 
In terms of the capacity, again we are adding additional capacity in Q4, both 
from our fulfillment center and infrastructure standpoint, and beyond Q4 we 
are not commenting but certainly if we continue to grow you should expect 
like we are growing expect t
hat we will add capacity next year. In terms of 
Kindle, we are trying to make selection available from a content perspective 

that we offer to customers, we think it should be very
 
economic to 
customers and we will continue to work very hard on behalf of customers in 
that area.

And our next question comes from Spencer Wang with Credit Suisse, please

Thanks, good afternoon. First questi
on, I guess, Tom, can you just go back 
to your earlier comment about video on demand and I think you used a 

terms of how you are thinking about it, is it innovation in terms of pr
icing or 
selection or revenue model or UI? And then secondly just real quick any 
stats or data point you could give us in terms of sizing mobile commerce for 
you. Thank you.
 
Thomas Szkutak
 
In terms of video in demand, there is not a lot more I can add to t
hat. I 
would say that I guess that where I would think about it is not a lot different 
than a lot of the things that we do on Amazon, we have a foundation of 
innovation everything that we do and we try to find creative ways and 
innovative ways to serve cus

the culture, you have seen that in a lot of different ways in our various 
offerings and we will continue to do that as best we can on behalf of the 
customers over long term which includes Video On Demand. An
d then 

 
Spencer Wang 

 
Credit Suisse
 
So any data point on mobile, sizing mobile for you guys commerce?
 
Thomas Szkutak
 

interesting area for 
us, and if you think about just a growth in connected 
devices anytime, you can have a very fast growth in adoption of connected 
devices in around the world where customers can get easy access to 

o what we are 
trying to do is try to make that as easy for customers with APIs and another 
ways so that we can serve customers well, so they get a great experience 

are working and w
e find it interesting.

Thank you. First on the Kindle, a lot of language in your press release about 
it, can you h

margin line when you think about the hardware and software or not and 
then secondly you are making a lot of infrastructure investments, a lot of 
headcount investments in the course of Fulfillme
nt, can you give us any 

spending last year or this is something that no idea of kind of wind, when 
you are kind of going to be caught up with what you need to be? Thank you.

of our products or categories from a possibility standpoint and so we have a 
[Inaudible] doing that and so the details that we provided, to
-
data is just the 
North American In
ternational segment from a possibility standpoint.
 

sort of 
-
 

capacity to date, we have some more that we are 

the serve on demand that we think is in front of us and we will have to see, 
wait and see what happens over the coming quarters to see what capacity 
we need to have.
 
But what I can say is from our regional perspective; you can see o
ur overall 
growth rates are very strong. And if they continue to be strong, we will have 
to add additional capacity. We are seeing very good traction fulfilled by 
Amazon which is also why we are also adding capacity for and we like that 
part of the busines
s from a seller perspective a lot.
 
From an infrastructure standpoint, again just with the growth that we are 
seeing from a retail perspective, we are adding capacity to support the retail 
websites that we have around the world. In addition to that, we have
 
a very 
fast growing web services business that has great traction, continues to 
grow well and certainly should expect that we will add capacity there over 
time to serves that growth.

based compensation or other 
operating expense line item. In the North America
 
segment, revenue grew 
26% to $11.86 billion. Media revenue grew 12% to $2.82 billion or 13% 
excluding foreign exchange. EGM revenue grew 28% to $7.83 billion, 
representing 66% of North America revenues, up from 65%. Other revenue 
grew 60% to $1.2 billion.
 
North America segment operating income 
increased 23% to $562 million, a 4.7% operating margin.
 
In the International segment, revenue grew 18% to $7.88 billion. Adjusting 
for the $24 million year
-
over
-
year favorable foreign exchange impact, 
revenue growth 
was 18%.
 
Media revenue grew 4% to $2.64 billion, or 4% excluding foreign exchange 
and EGM revenue grew 27% to $5.19 billion or 26% excluding foreign 
exchange. EGM now represents 66% of International revenues, up from 
61%. International segment operating lo
ss was $60 million, compared with 
$16 million loss in the prior period.
 
CSOI increased 14% to $502 million or 2.5% of revenue, down 
approximately 20 basis points year
-
over
-
year. Excluding the favorable 
impact from foreign exchange, CSOI increased 10%.
 
Unli
ke CSOI, our GAAP operating income includes stock
-
based compensation 
expense and other operating expense. GAAP operating income decreased 
19% to $146 million or 0.7% of net sales.
 
Our income tax expense was $73 million. GAAP net income was $108 million 
or 
$0.23 per diluted share, compared with $82 million and $0.18 per diluted 
share.
 
Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and marketable securities increased 
$771 million year
-
over
-
year to $8.67 billion. Inventory increased 24% to 
$6.72 billion and inventory turn
s were 9.1, down from 9.5 turns a year ago 
as we expanded selection, improved in
-
stock levels and introduced new 
product categories.
 
Accounts payable increased 19% to $10.59 billion and accounts payable 
days were 68 consistent with the prior year.

date and what we believe 
today to be appropriately conservative assumptions. Our results are 
inherently unpredictable and maybe materiall
y affected by many factors, 
including a high level of uncertainty surrounding exchange rate fluctuations 

accurately predict demand and therefore our actual results could differ 
mater
ially from our guidance.
 
As we describe in more detail in our public filings, issues such as settling 
intercompany balances and foreign currencies amongst our subsidiaries, 
unfavorable resolution of legal matters and changes to our effective tax 
rates can 
all have a material effect on guidance.
 

business acquisitions, investments, restructurings or legal settlements, 
record any further revisions to stock
-
based compensation estimates and that 
foreign exchange rates remain approximately where they have been 
recently.
 
For Q2 2014, we expect net sales of between $18.1 billion and $19.8 billion 
or growth of between 15% and 26%. This guidance anticipates 
approximately 160 basis points of favorable impact from foreign exchange 
rates. GAAP operating income or loss to be betw
een $455 million loss and 
$55 million loss, compared to $79 million in income in the second quarter of 
2013. This includes approximately $455 million for stock
-
based 
compensation and amortization of intangible assets.
 
We anticipate consolidated segment ope
rating income, which excludes stock
-
based compensation and other operating expense to be between zero and 
$400 million, compared to $409 million in the second quarter of 2013.
 
We remain heads down focused on driving a better customer experience 
through pri
ce, selection and convenience. We believe putting customers first 
is the only reliable way to create lasting value for shareholders.

Hi T
om. I was hoping you could maybe just layout first, what do you think 
the main reasons are for the acceleration and growth here in the first 
quarter versus the fourth quarter. And then a specific question on Prime 
Pantry, it is one of motivations to get th
e customer on that program it might 
make get easier to convert them to Amazon Fresh. And if so, would you 
want to run this operation as a breakeven like you do with Kindle, to enable 
a bigger business, thanks.

In terms of growth, we saw v
ery solid growth, very good growth in Q1, up 
23% on a local currency basis. North
-
America we saw a similar growth rates 
in Q1 as we saw in Q4 of last year as well as Q1 of last year all at 26%. And 
then international we saw the growth accelerate a little b
it on a exchange 
adjusted basis from 15% to 18% from Q4 to Q1. But we really seen is we 
are pleased with the overall fundamentals we continue to add new 
customers and stocks continues to be healthy, third party unit is a 
percentage of units are above 40% s
till very strong FBA adoption, that 
continues to be strong around the world, continued to add new selection.
 
We saw strong growth in many different areas including Web Services, and 
so again a lot of different areas contributed to growth rate that we saw i
n 


everyday non

s great way that we can add the selection and have 
the selections for those customers.

Hi, thank you. I have two quick questions about AWS. First, I think everyone 
would agree that AWS is a vast opportunity. So given how large the 
opportunity is, why is it that y
ou are not hiring more people, launching more 
products, and growing faster? What are the limiting factors for growth of 
AWS?
 
Second, you have a long history of cutting prices for a few specific AWS 
products, but you did something somewhat unusual in 
late March when you 
cut prices across EC2 and S3 products in one shot. Why did you only cut 
your prices after Google cut theirs? Thank you.
 
Thomas J. Szkutak
 
In terms of AWS, the team is doing a fantastic job. We are adding a lot of

we continued the pace of acceleration in terms of new 


 
In terms of pricing, we think this is our 42nd pricing increase that we had in 

customers to be able
 
to do that. The team works very hard to able to afford

times and that happened to come in the presentation tha

In terms of video content, the team does a very nice job

been selling both in

decoupling here as revenue and gross profit reaccelerated, but units 
obviously (indiscernible) as media came down. Can you talk a little bit about 
that? Thank you.

Sure as you mentioned unit growth was actually decelerated a little bit from 
Q4 and also from last year with 23% year

over

year in Q1. One thing to 
keep in mind is that our web services business is growing at a faster rate. 


right we continue to 

 
from a growth standpoint we had a small acceleration 
of growth from Q4 to Q1 from a revenue standpoint, again on local currency 
basis going from 22% to 23%, we are very pleased with the fun

Thanks. I have two. The first one, just Tom to go back to the unit question, 
even if we 
exclude North America and international other from gross profit. 
Gross profit growth held in there pretty steady at 28%. Just kind of curious, 
is there anything that we should think about of why gross profit growth and 
unit growth is decoupling? And is uni
t growth a really good way to measure 
the health of the business? And then the second one is on international 
media. One of the factors you guys have flagged in the past holding down 
international media is more limited local language content. Can you just 
help 
us better quantify the difference in English language digital content 
compared to foreign language? And what steps are you taking to improve 
that?

In terms of the 

 

International 


we see a conversion from physical to digital. And for example in North

print 
we have from a fulfillment capacity standpoint enables us to be closer to

from a geographic standpoint, we continue to invest in new geographies,

commentary on the quarter. Please note, unless otherwise stated, all 
comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period 
of 2017.
 
Our comments and responses to your questions reflect management's views 
as of today, April 26, 201
8 only, and will include forward
-
looking 
statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information 
about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in 
today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including
 
our most recent 
annual report on Form 10
-
K and subsequent filings.
 
During this call, we may discuss certain non
-
GAAP financial measures. In our 
press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the 
SEC, each of which is posted on our IR
 
website, you will find additional 
disclosures regarding these non
-
GAAP measures, including reconciliations of 
these measures with comparable GAAP measures.
 
Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we've seen to date and 
what we believe today to be 
appropriate assumptions. Our results are 
inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, 
including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic 
conditions and customer spending, world events, the rate of growt
h of the 
Internet, online commerce and cloud services and the various factors 
detailed in our filings with the SEC.
 
Our guidance also assumes, among other things, that we don't conclude any 
additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings or l
egal 
settlements. It's not possible to accurately predict the demand for our goods 
and services, and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from 
our guidance.
 
With that, we'll move to Q&A. Operator, please remind our listeners how to 
initiat

Answer Session

At this time, we will now open up the call for questions. Our first question 
comes from line of Eric Sheridan with UBS. Please proceed with your 
question.
 
Eric J. Sheridan

UBS Securities LLC
 
Thanks so mu
ch for taking the question. Wanted to ask if you had any 
update on the state of the advertising business, sort of the state of 
conversations with advertisers? What product uptake you're seeing out in 
the marketplace? And sort of how that's looking now as w
e move out of 
2017 and into 2018 broadly for the platform? Thanks so much.
 
Brian T. Olsavsky 
-
 
Amazon.com, Inc.
 
Yes, sure, Eric. I would say advertising continues to be a bright spot both 
from a product standpoint and also financially. It continued to be a
 
strong 
contributor to profitability in Q1. It's now a multibillion
-
dollar program. You 
can see the 

 
in our supplemental revenue disclosure, it's in other revenue, 
and it's the majority of the other revenue in that line item.
 
So our philosophy there again
 
is we're continuing to focus on finding 
valuable ways to make our advertising opportunities better for customers, 
showing them new products that they may not have seen otherwise and also 
for emerging and established brands, helping them to reach customers
. I 
think the advertisers generally are all shapes and sizes, and their common 
theme is they all want to reach our customers generally to drive brand 
awareness, discovery and eventually purchase.
 
Before I go into the second question, I want to make a comme
nt about the 
Prime program. The Prime program continues to drive great strength in our 
top line, as you've seen over the last few years actually. We continue to 
increase the value of Prime, including speed selection and digital 
entertainment options. We've
 
been expanding FREE Same
-
Day Shipping and 
One
-
Day options. And our Two
-
Day shipping, it's now available on over 100 
million items, up from 20 million as recently as 2014. And we continue to 
add digital benefits like Prime Video.
 
The value of Prime to cust
omers has never been greater. And the cost is also 
high, as we pointed out especially with shipping options and digital benefits, 
we continue to see rises in costs. So effective May 11, we're going to 
increase the price of our U.S. annual plan from $99 to 
$119 for new 
members. The new price will apply to renewals starting on June 16.
 
Prime provides a unique combination of benefits, and we continue to invest 
in making this Prime program even more valuable for our members. As a 
reminder, we haven't increased 
the U.S. annual price of Prime since our 
single increase, which was in March of 2014.
 
Dave Fildes 
-
 
Amazon.com, Inc.
 
Yeah. And, Eric, sorry to just go back to your initial question too, just to hop 
back on that, just wanted to remind folks that we mentione
d this last 
quarter on the call. But on January 1, we adopted an accounting standard 
update that amended our revenue recognition policies.
 
So the net impact to revenue in the first quarter was not material, but I do 
want to highlight a few areas. As part o
f the adoption beginning in Q1, 
certain advertising services were classified as revenue rather than a 
reduction of costs of sales. So the impact of this change was an increase of 
$560 million to other revenue in Q1, which is 

 
the other revenue is, of 
cour
se, part of our supplemental sales disclosure.
 
So you'll see that other revenue, in total, increased 132% ex
-
FX year
-
over
-
year to about $2 billion in the first quarter. Again, $560 million is included in 
there, and the majority of that is 

 
would be includ
ed in the North America 
segment.
 
As you look at the other supplemental line item, just a few items of note. 
The line item online stores revenue increased about 13%, ex
-
FX. Beginning 
in the first quarter, sales of apps, in
-
app content, and certain digital m
edia 
content are now presented on a net revenue basis and included in third
-
party seller services revenue, rather than that online stores revenue. So in 
the first quarter, online stores revenue would have been higher, but for this 
new standard.
 
And then th
e line item, subscription services revenue, that increased about 
56% ex
-
FX year
-
over
-
year. Prime memberships are included in that line. 
Again, beginning in the first quarter, we now recognize annual Prime 
membership revenue straight line over the 12
-
month 
period. Prior to 2018, 
we recognized this revenue over the 12
-
month period with more revenue 
allocated to the fourth quarter each year. So in Q1 of this year, subscription 
services revenue would have been lower, but for this new standard.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Nowak with Morgan 
Stanley. Please proceed with your question.
 
Brian Nowak

Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
 
Thanks for taking my questions. So the first one on Prime, let me ask you 
this. As you think about your U.S. 
Prime penetration, there's some data that 
shows you're doing a very good job at capturing a lot of the middle to higher 
income households and now you're raising price. Talk about the tension 
point you need to solve to sort of reach some of the lower income
 
households and even households that are not yet Prime. What are the main 
reasons why people in the U.S. are not signing on for Prime at this point?
 
And the second one on early learnings from the integration of Prime Now 
and Whole Foods, recognizing it's o
nly in a few cities, what can you share 
about what you're seeing about purchase behavior, early learnings? And 
what are the main signposts you're watching as you determine how quickly 
to roll that out to more cities in the U.S. and hopefully, New York soon
?
 
Brian T. Olsavsky 
-
 
Amazon.com, Inc.
 
Sure. On your first question about Prime penetration, without getting into 
any statistics on penetration and by country, I would say we do have other 
options for, if you'll notice, there's the monthly option, obviousl
y provides 
more flexibility for people who want to try out Prime before committing to 
the annual plan. There's discounted student plans. There's also discounts for 
other groups. So, we do feel it's still the best deal in retail, and we just work 
to make it
 
better and better each day.
 
The second thing you mentioned is a good example. So, the ability in 10 
cities to get Prime Now deliveries of Whole Foods groceries is an added 
benefit for people in that market using Prime 

 
those markets using Prime 
Now. So a
s far as the Whole Foods, specifically on the question of what we'll 
look at as far as expanding that grocery delivery, we're going to use the 10 
cities as a test and see how customers respond, just like we always do, and 
make sure that our deliveries are 
great for those people, and then we'll 
announce expansion plans once we digest that, the feedback we get from 
customers.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Heath Terry with 
Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.
 
Heath T
erry

Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
 
Great. Thank you. I was just wondering if you could give us a sense, the 
accelerating growth that we saw in the U.S. business in Q1, how much of 
that or how would you sort of segment that in terms of specific categories? 
Are 
there any specific categories that you would call out in terms of driving 
that?
 
And then, as we look at the like acceleration in the AWS business, any sense 
that you can give us in terms of what volumes or customer, you specifically 
call out sort of custom
er additions in some of your comments, what 
customer additions have looked like in terms of driving that business, 
particularly against sort of the comp against last year's price cuts?
 
Brian T. Olsavsky 
-
 
Amazon.com, Inc.
 
Sure. So first, with the 

 
you've 
mentioned North America revenue growth, 
and you can calculate that with and without the impact of Whole Foods, I'm 
sure. But the general drivers continues to be Prime and the Prime flywheel. 
So we see strong customer demand, not only for the benefits that 
we 
associate with Prime, we're seeing better engagement with Prime benefits, 
especially digital benefits, and that is always good news for eventual sales of 
other things.
 
We're also selling more subscriptions, Amazon Music Unlimited, multiple 
Kindle Unlimi
ted, there's a number of services. So there's different revenue 
streams that we see. So, not much more I can add by product line to North 
America. And I talk about AWS revenue, again, we're 

 
we are accelerating. 
We've accelerated for the last two quarters
. The FX
-
neutral growth was 48% 
in Q1, up from 44% on the same basis in Q4 and 42% in Q3. And now 
nearly a $22 billion run rate.
 
So what we're saying is just continued strong usage both by existing 
customers and signing new customers for 

 
see increased pa
ce of enterprise 
migrations as customers are having success with AWS and increasingly 
trying new services. We are seeing people move more and more of their 
workflows to AWS and at a faster pace. And customers are moving 
databases to AWS as Aurora continues
 
to grow at a very rapid clip.
 
So stepping back, I would say, what is driving the growth, we believe, again, 
it's the value that we create for AWS customers. We have the functionality 
and pace of innovation that others don't. We have partner and ecosystem 
that others don't. And we have proven operational capability and security 
expertise that's highly valued to the AWS customer base.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark May with Citi. 
Please proceed with your question.
 
Mark A. M
ay

Citi Investment Research
 
Thank you. Some of the data that we've seen suggests that this year, the 
rate of growth in the build out of fulfillment centers and other parts of the 
retail logistics network as well as data centers, but more on the former, t
hat 
rate of growth is slowing this year relative to last year and even the year 
before. I know that you guys go through periods of kind of heavy 
investment, then you grow into that capacity. But I just wonder if you could 
comment a little bit about where w
e are kind of in that ebb and flow of that 
cycle right now.
 
And in terms of the accounting change that Dave referenced earlier with 
regard to revenue going from cost of revenue to the other line, can you 
comment if that particular type of advertising, that
 
trade dollars type of 
marketing, is that growing at a meaningfully different rate than the ad 
revenue that's already booked as revenue? Thanks.
 
Dave Fildes 
-
 
Amazon.com, Inc.
 
Yeah, Mark, this is Dave. On that second question, we've not commented on 
the gr
owth rate or given the prior year period, so not much we can say 
there. As I said, the $560 million, if you were to back that out and look at 
the sort of pre
-
existing advertised 

 
or other revenue rather that was 
included in that line item, we'd be growing
 
about 72%. But again, that's not 
in relation to the COGS portion.
 
Brian T. Olsavsky 
-
 
Amazon.com, Inc.
 
And on the question on capacity, 

 
excuse me, cap 

 
I'll address it as CapEx 
and capital leases, we're still seeing strong investment there. If I look a
t the 
quarterly trends, you're right, that this quarter was up 33% in isolation 
versus last year. I look back to last year's first quarter and we grew 82% 
year
-
over
-
year. So it was a particularly heavy quarter, particularly for 
investment in warehouses.
 
So
 
if I step back on the trailing 12 months though, CapEx, which is 
predominantly tied to our fulfillment center network, is up 47%. That is 
above the Amazon fulfilled unit growth rate, but we combined the strength 
of the FBA program and the space requiremen
ts as we get into bigger and 
bigger products. That's a representative number for that period.
 
On the capital leases, which is a good proxy for the spend to support the 
AWS business, that's up 49% year
-
over
-
year on the trailing 12 months.
 
So again, 
usage rates continue to exceed the revenue growth rates. Usage 
rates are strong, but we also have a number of projects underway that seek 
to increase our efficiency of our data centers. So have a couple things at 
play there that hopefully keep that number 
closer to the revenue growth 
rate.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Doug Anmuth with 
JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.
 
Douglas T. Anmuth 
-
 
JPMorgan Securities LLC
 
Thanks for taking the question. Brian, you had signifi
cant operating income 
upside in 1Q and I think a better outlook for the second quarter than many 
expected. Can you just talk about the biggest factors that drove the delta 
relative to your 1Q guide? And is there any reason to think that you couldn't 
see si
milar leverage in the back half of the year? Thanks.
 
Brian T. Olsavsky 
-
 
Amazon.com, Inc.
 
Sure. Yes, we came in well above our range that we had given of $300 
million to $1 billion. I would attribute it primarily to a few things. First, the 
top
-
line growth
 
was 

 
continued to be strong coming out of Q4. We had 
great consumer business strength. We also had strong AWS revenue 
strength, where I already mentioned that we accelerated into the quarter, 
which is a different trend that we've seen recently. So custom
er adoption in 
AWS remained strong.
 
And when we hit the higher end of our range or just above our range on 

 
with FX included, we generally see really good drop through on the 
incremental sales, given the fixed costs we have in fulfillment centers and 
data
 
centers and quite frankly, people. So we saw great efficiencies at the 
higher level of revenue, and we're able to handle it. So that was generally 
very good financially.
 
We 

 
at the time of guidance, we were concerned a bit about the high 

 
relatively hig
h inventory we had at year
-
end in space utilization. So we're 
still very full in our fulfillment centers. But we were able to correct that due 
to the high sales without having additional handling and transportation cost 
that you would normally see the reco
nfigure inventory locations. So that also 
helped and probably differential versus the guidance estimate.
 
And then, lastly, I would say, advertising continues to be a strong 
contributor to profitability and had strong results this quarter. As far as what 
th
at portends for future quarters, for now, I want to focus on Q2 and it's 
incorporated into our Q2 guidance. So we expect a lot of the strength areas 
to continue, consumer demand, AWS and advertising. We will definitely see 
higher investments as we move thr
ough the year. For example, video 
content spend will increase year
-
over
-
year, and we'll continue to hire, in 
particular, software engineers.
 
We'll have some costs in Q2 ahead of what's anticipated to be a Prime Day 
in early Q3. So 

 
and then as you know, Q
3 is generally a lower quarter due 
to all the work to get ready for holiday and the hiring of people and building 
teams. So, I won't go beyond Q2 at this point, but again, we're very happy 
with the customer reception we had in Q1 and then the income that, 
that 
drove.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital 
Markets. Please proceed with your question.
 
Mark Mahaney 
-
 
RBC Capital Markets LLC
 
Okay. Great. Thanks. Two questions. The $239 million in other income, what 
was tha
t? And then could you just wax a little bit eloquently hopefully, on 
advertising revenue? And like how do you balance what are 

 
what should 
be a monstrous amount of ad revenue opportunities, especially high profit, 
high margin ad revenue opportunities aga
inst an ideal or optimal consumer 
experience? These sponsored units I see in every search I do on Amazon 
seems great from an advertising perspective, but I sometimes wonder if it 
doesn't dilute the consumer experience. So just talk about how you balance 
th
at.
 
And then finally, as part of advertising, you've got also a heck of a lot 
inventory around all of that video, that Prime Video that you have that you 
don't allow 

 
that you don't directly charge for, how do you think about that 
as an advertising revenu
e opportunity? Thank you.
 
Brian T. Olsavsky 
-
 
Amazon.com, Inc.
 
Sure. Let me wax eloquently. Try to anyway. So let's start with the $239 
million; that is essentially where attributable to warrants that we have in 
companies that we partnered with. We have tr
ansportation companies that 
we partnered with and other technology companies. As the stock market 
increased in Q1, a lot of these companies also went up. So that's where we 
book the gain on warrants that we have with 

 
on investments. It's also 

 
there was
 
a good bit of FX gain due to the shift in currency and the 
weakening of the dollar. That showed up on a lot of lines on the P&L, but 
that one was positive.
 
On advertising, so let's step back a bit. It's now a multibillion
-
dollar program 
and growing very q
uickly. Our main goal here is to help customers discover 
new brands and products. So we show the sponsored products, we're trying 
to show people things they had maybe wouldn't have seen otherwise in their 
normal search results. So we're looking for a good 
balance here, as we said.
 
We want customers to get the benefit of the new brand and product 
discovery, and then we want to let sellers for both emerging and established 
brands, reach those customers. Those advertisers are of all shapes and sizes 
with the m
ain goal of, again, trying to reach our customers whether it's to 
drive brand awareness, discovery or hopefully purchase.
 
So, we take the responsibility for that very seriously and are always 
balancing helpfulness of the advertising and try not to make it 
disruptive. 
But you're right, there are always pressures in that. We will come down on 
the side of the customer.
 
On your question on video advertising, yes, there may be opportunities over 
time to have more advertising in our Video, but we choose not to do
 
that 
right now.
 
Dave Fildes 
-
 
Amazon.com, Inc.
 
Yeah, I think the only thing I'd add to on that just related to Prime Video, as 
you may have seen in the announcement earlier today about the renewed 
agreement for the streaming partnership with Thursday Nigh
t Football. So 
we'll have 11 games in 2018 and 2019, be able to deliver that to over 100 
million Prime members globally, which is a great continuation of the 
partnership we've had with the NFL.
 
We've done some things like the Prime Original Series All or N
othing; the 
third season's coming up soon, focused on the Dallas Cowboys. So that was 
one of our first forays in the live format that 

 
one of the first forays in the 
live format where we had live ads and kind of, we're not only learning the 
technology, bu
t learning to 

 
learning that business. And I think we've been 
pleased with what we've seen so far obviously and look forward to the next 
few seasons with the NFL.

Thank you. So I think, Brian, I had a question on your international shopping 
rollout, so I think this was recently 
announced. Where do you think you 
measure up versus some of the more local players where you might not 
have a direct presence in the country? And where do you think your value 
proposition lies? And presumably this is informed by users coming in from 
those 
regions where you don't really have an official site for people come in 
to buy stuff from you anyway. So, which regions or countries are accounting 
for most of the demand that you are seeing? Thank you.

No, I'm just wondering, you already have a direct presence in some
 
of the 
countries like China, Japan, et cetera, and the international shopping rollout 
presumably expands all that selection to most of the globe. So just 
wondering if you are seeing incremental demand, and where you might be 
seeing demand coming in from c
ountries where you might not have a direct 
presence?
 
Brian T. Olsavsky

Yeah. Sorry, I thought you meant some of our expansion countries. So, 
yeah, I don't have a lot to share on that today, but I think you hit on the 
main poi
nt, is selection and opportunities for sellers in 

 
who are with us in 
different countries to reach buyers outside of their home country. So it's a 
great benefit for sellers, and it only works if it's a great benefit for customers 
on the other side.

Please proceed with your question.
 
Justin Post

Merrill Lynch
 
Yeah, thank you. I'd like to maybe dive into a couple of local recent 
overhangs. First, on shipping pa
rtners, just wondering how dependent are 
you on any shipping partner? And can you talk about any initiatives you've 
had to build out your own shipping network? I know in some countries that 
you might be over 50% of the stuff you're delivering. Could talk a
 
little bit 
about dependency there?
 
And then secondly, on taxes, can you remind us what happened when 
Amazon started collecting taxes on your own items in various states? And 
just kind of overview of your view on collecting third
-
party sales 

 
taxes 
from t
hird parties in other states if that were to pass? Thank you.
 
Brian T. Olsavsky 
-
 
Amazon.com, Inc.
 
Sure. Let me start with transportation. We have a great group of carriers 
that we use globally and you know who they are. But we're also growing our 
teams an
d capabilities to ensure that we can keep up with increased volume 
on our own, particularly around the holiday season. So that's driven a lot of 
our expansion of Amazon Logistics. It's driven the creation of sort centers. 
It's driven the purchase of airpla
nes to move product between points within 
our delivery network.
 
So we will continue to operate with this combination of external partners and 
internal capability. We like what we see so far with our Amazon Logistics 
capability. It's well over 50% in some c
ountries, particularly the UK. It helps 
with again Prime Now and AmazonFresh and a lot of initiatives that we'll see, 
which again we mentioned the Prime Now is tied in with Whole Foods, now 
in 10 cities. So we think it's a core competency that we have and 
we need to 
have, and we'll continue to invest in that.
 
Dave Fildes 
-
 
Amazon.com, Inc.
 
Yeah, and Justin, this is Dave, just on the sales tax piece. Today, on the 
first
-
party sales, we collect on our own products in all 45 states that have a 
state
-
imposed sa
les tax. On the 3T piece, we do collect on behalf of our 
sellers in two states, Washington State as of the first of this year, and then 
Pennsylvania turned on here on April 1.
 
So in terms of your question of sort of impact from the first
-
party piece 
that's
 
been coming online, many of those states came on over a period of 
time to get to that 45 total, going back over many years. So yeah, nothing 
really more to add on that.
 
I think I would say we do continue to believe that the sales tax issue needs 
to be res
olved at the federal level, and we're actively working with the 
states, with retailers and Congress to get federal legislation passed. We're 
not opposed to collecting sales tax within a constitution and permissible 
system that is both simple and applied ev
enhandedly.

Hi. Thanks. So I want to follow up on Prime a little bit. The fee increase, why 
n
ow? I mean, we've been adding value for a long time, obviously shipping 
costs are going up. Why is now the right time to have that fee hike, 
especially since membership looks like the growth numbers are starting to 
slow?
 
And tied into that, there's a lot o
f Alexa mentioning in the release. Could you 
give us some uptake on the importance of Alexa and basically voice 
commerce, and so the metrics you get in terms of usage there and the 
flywheel? Thanks.
 
Brian T. Olsavsky 
-
 
Amazon.com, Inc.
 
Sure. We 
always evaluate the price of Prime in all the countries we're in, and 
we're looking for creative ways to reach the customer. As I mentioned 
earlier, creation 

 
or excuse me, monthly plans, student plans, et cetera.
 
So it's really nothing more than looking 
at the state of the program, the high 
benefits it's delivering. I mentioned that four years ago when we last 
increased the price of Prime, you could get 20 million products within two 
days. Today you could get over 100 million products within two days, and
 
many, many, many products within one day, same day or two hours.
 
So there's all kinds of new features that we've continually added to the 
Prime program. It's much different than it was in 2014. This is a reflection of 
that, that's a better reflection of t
he cost value of the program.

Sure. Yeah I don't want to project relative proportions of the different 
segments, but what I can say is the interna
tional continues to see the same 
level of investment as we're seeing in North America or have seen in North 
America.
 
So when we add benefits, Prime benefits, we're probably adding them at an 
earlier stage of life in the Prime program internationally than w
e did in the 
U.S. So, they have different dynamics. We think at the end of the day 
customers behave the same globally and that they value low prices selection 
and great customer experience.
 
So, we'll continue to make these investments in Prime. We'll conti
nue to 
expand selection, continue to build FBA programs so that it increases 
selection even more and builds great partnerships with sellers. We'll 
continue to accelerate shipping. We'll continue to lower prices.
 
And sorry, I cut out the last person [Techni

including Alexa, which we think has great stickiness with, in the home and I 
think creates a lot of value in the home and also allows you to access over 
time Amazon products better.
 
We'll continue to invest in India where we'r
e seeing great progress with both 
sellers and also customers. And we like the momentum we've seen there. 
The Prime program started in the first year in India grew faster than any 
Prime program we've seen in other countries. We're adding local content in 
In
dia, video content, excuse me. We're also adding other benefits, Prime 
benefits. We're rolling out devices there, and we're seeing Indian developers 
developing skills for Alexa, and Alexa is up, as you saw in the press release, 
to 40,000 [Technical Difficu

it is important 
to us that they all are still delighting customers and growing to the best of 
their ability.

Thank you for standing by. Good day, everyone, and welcome to the 
Amazon.com Q4 2016 Financial Results Teleconference. At this time, all 
participants are in a listen
-
only mode. After the presentation, we will 
conduct a 
question
-
and
-
answer session. Today's call is being recorded.
 
For opening remarks, I will be turning the call over to the Director of 
Investor relations, Darin Manney. Please, go ahead.

Hello, and welcome to our Q4 2016 finan
cial results conference call. Joining 
us today to answer your questions is Brian Olsavsky, our CFO. As you listen 
to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in 
front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metric
s and 
commentary on the quarter. Please note, unless otherwise stated, all 
comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period 
of 2015.
 
Our comments and responses to your questions reflect management's views 
as of today, February
 
2, 2017 only and will include forward
-
looking 
statements. Actual results may differ materially.
 
Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our 
financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the 
SEC, inc
luding our most recent Annual Report on Form 10
-
K and subsequent 
filings.
 
During this call, we may discuss certain non
-
GAAP financial measures. In our 
press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the 
SEC, each of which is posted on 
our IR website, you will find additional 
disclosures regarding these non
-
GAAP measures including reconciliations of 
these measures with comparable GAAP measures.
 
Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we've seen to
-
date and 
what we believe today t
o be appropriate assumptions. Our results are 
inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, 
including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic 
conditions and customer spending, world events, the rate of 
growth of the 
Internet, online commerce and cloud services, and the various factors 
detailed in our filings with the SEC.
 
Our guidance also assumes among other things that we don't conclude 
additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings or l
egal 
settlements. It is not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods 
and services and therefore our actual results could differ materially from our 
guidance.
 
And just briefly before we move to questions, I'd like to address our Form 
10
-
K that we
'll be filing with the SEC. We received a comment letter from 
the SEC's Division of Corporate Finance regarding our 2015 Form 10
-
K and 
have subsequently been engaged with the SEC staff regarding our 
disclosures. We will be revising the disclosures of net, 
product and service 
sales in our Form 10
-
K. As a result, we expect to file our 2016 Form 10
-
K 
later than we typically have, but before the SEC's due date of March 1. 
These changes relate to our entity
-
wide disclosures and do not impact the 
financial result
s that we report for the company or our segments.
 
With that, we will move to Q&A. Operator, please remind our listeners how 
to initiate a question.

Answer Session
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our first question is coming from John Blackledge with Cowan
. 
Please proceed with your question.
 
John Blackledge 
-
 
Cowen & Co. LLC
 
Great. Thanks for the question. So, the first quarter GAAP operating income 
guide essentially implies negative incremental margins kind of at the low, 
mid and high end of guidance. So, 
just wondering if you could frame in 
order, if possible, the investment areas that are driving the negative 
incremental margins and then just generally how should we think about the 
margin profile in 2017? Thank you.
 
Brian T. Olsavsky 
-
 
Amazon.com, Inc.
 
Su
re. Thank you, John. First, let me talk about revenue just to get that out 
there as well. We are guiding to 17% to 25% growth on an FX
-
neutral basis. 
That includes approximately 

 
excuse me, yes, on top of that is 
approximately 250 basis points or $730 mil
lion of FX negative impact which 
brings the non
-
FX adjusted rate down to 

 
excuse me, range down to 14% 
to 23%. I will also point out that we have the leap year comp from last year. 
Last year, the extra day of leap year was worth 150 basis points to us in 
our 
Q1 revenue. This year, that reverses. So we have 150
-
basis point headwind 
to growth. And that's been factored into our guidance range.
 
But your question was on bottom line. So yes, what you are seeing, John, is 
the continuation of the step
-
up investmen
t that we saw in the second half of 
last year. I talked about, in prior calls, about the fulfillment center step
-
up. 
We had 26 warehouses we added last year. 23 of them were in the second 
half of the year. Digital content, digital video content and marketi
ng stepped 
up quite a bit in the second half of the year. We continue to invest heavily in 
those two areas. We also have investments in other Prime benefits from 
Prime Now to AmazonFresh and of course we are continuing to invest in 
Alexa and our Echo devic
es. And finally, I guess, I'd point out India which 
continues to be a rather large investment for us.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question comes from Scott Devitt with Stifel.

Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.
 
Hi. Thank you. Questions on video. 
I was wondering if you could just give 
any quantification in terms of the magnitude of video spend in 2017 as well 
as the lumpiness from an expensing standpoint quarterly.
 
And then separately as it relates to just the video service, from a positioning 
stan
dpoint in the market, how do you think about the unique aspects of the 
product that Amazon has relative to others in the market in terms of the 
aggregation tools that are being provided now where some of the value is 
being perceived longer
-
term? Is it the 
uniqueness of the content or is it 
other things? If you could provide a little bit of color on that, that would be 
helpful. Thank you.
 
Brian T. Olsavsky 
-
 
Amazon.com, Inc.
 
Sure. Well, ultimately, I'll step back and say one of the main things we look 
out on
 
Prime Video is customer usage patterns and in 2016 we had a 
doubling of Prime hours for video, music and reading. So we're happy with 
the engagement that customers have. We're also happy with the 

 
especially 
on the Studios side, the people we've been abl
e to work with, some of the 
most talented people in the entertainment industry. And our customers have 
responded really well to the shows that we've created. We've garnered 
awards, of course, but mainly that what we're focused on is good content 
that is at
tractive to customers.
 
I'll also point out that we rolled out the global Prime Video offer in the 
second half of last 

 
or, excuse me, in Q4. And what we see there is again, 
original content is a fixed cost expense. The more we can amortize it over a 
large
 
base, the better off we'll be. But more importantly, we have great 
content that we want to share with people outside of our primary retail 
countries. And this takes us to over 200 more countries. So we're very 
happy with the results in video. Yes, the inv
estment did step up in the 
second half of last year, including marketing. And that will continue in 2017 
and likely beyond.

Can you discuss what you're doing to help merchants in China sell and ship 
directly to consumers in the U.S. and other developed economies and how 
that business has been evol
ving over time? Thanks.
 
Darin Manney 
-
 
Amazon.com, Inc.
 
Yes, hi, Ben. This is Darin. Yes. We're very pleased with our FBA offering, 
and that's really helpful to sellers around the world. Certainly, our 
international sellers have access to more and more cus
tomers through that 
offering and that doesn't exclude sellers in China as well. The offering in 
China that we have for consumers is also a great, trusted customer 
engagement. And we have a very strong and trusted venue for Chinese 
customers to access inter
national brands there as we continue to focus on 
great offerings through the AmazonGlobal Store, which offers great brands 
from outside of China to customers. And so there's a mix of things going on 
in China and we're happy with what we're seeing in both o
f those.

Thank you. Your next question comes from Justin Post with Bank of America 
Merrill Lynch. Please state your question.
 
Justin Post

Bank of America Merrill Lynch
 
Thank you. Just a follow
-
up on India and China. I know you are investing a 
lo
t. I'd love to hear how much, but you probably won't tell us. But can you 
tell us why you think the market is worth investment and what really 
attracts you to the market as you think out longer
-
term? And then China, 
can you give us any updates there on how
 
financial performance is doing 
and if you've changed your strategy and if anything has gotten better there 
this year? Thank you.
 
Brian T. Olsavsky 
-
 
Amazon.com, Inc.
 
Sure. Let me start with India. So, it's still very early. We continue to say 
that, but we
 
are very encouraged with what we've created with customers 
and sellers alike in India over the last few years. We continue to develop 
new functionality for that country, whether it's delivery, whether it's seller 
features. We rolled out Prime last summer 
if you'll remember, and we 
recently launched Prime Video there. So we've had success with [technical 
difficulty] (10:55) we've been in. We don't expect India to be any different. 
We will continue to build our business there and continue to do a great job 
f
or both customers and sellers. We're bullish on India longer
-
term and it's 
early. But we like the initial engagement we're seeing and the response 
from, again, both customers and sellers.
 
Darin Manney 
-
 
Amazon.com, Inc.
 
Yes, and this is Darin. On China, li
ke I said, we're very pleased with our 
offering in China. Our strategy there has been one of bringing a trusted and 
authentic product to customers in China, both domestically and from 
international offers. So we'll continue to focus on the Global Store the
re. As 
you may know, we've launched the Prime program that's focused around the 
availability of international goods in China and that we're pleased with what 
we're seeing there.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Your next question comes from Heath Terry with Goldman 
Sac
hs. Please go ahead.
 
Heath Terry 
-
 
Goldman Sachs & Co.
 
Great. Two primary questions. Can you give us a sense of what the best way 
to think about the impact that the shift to third
-
party and within that, the 
growth in FBA is having on these sequential growt
h rates? To the extent that 
there's 150
-
basis point impact from leap year on a year
-
over
-
year basis, is 
there a way to quantify the impact that that shift to third
-
party is having on 
the growth rate for the first quarter for what you've reported in the fou
rth 
quarter?
 
And then on the AWS side of the business, with the price cut in November, 
can you give us some sense of what impact the price cut had on the 
deceleration in growth compared to the impact that presumably it had in 
driving incremental volume to 
the platform?
 
Brian T. Olsavsky 
-
 
Amazon.com, Inc.
 
Sure. Let me start with that second question first. So more basically, on 
AWS, very happy with the response from customers. I feel we've got a very 
broad base of customers from startups to small
-
medium bus
inesses to large 
enterprises to the public sector. And we're continuing to see strong growth 
across all those sectors. The business is now a $14 billion annualized 

 
running at a $14 billion run rate. You are right that we had seven price cuts 
in Q4, essen
tially timed for December 1, so about 1/3 of the impact was 
seen in Q4.
 
But that's going to be constant in this business. We've been pretty clear that 
this business is all about creating new functionality for customers, giving 
price cuts and then working o
n the operating efficiencies. So, very pleased 
with Q4 and the pace of the business. The new services and features last 
year were over 1,000 versus 700 or so the 

 
excuse me, in 2015. So we 
continue to innovate on behalf of customers. We're working with so
me very 
large customers in each industry. You've seen probably press releases on 
companies like Capital One, Workday, Salesforce and others. So, again, 
widespread usage and new customer adoption, which is great.
 
Your second question on FBA, I can't break o
ut the year
-
over
-
year difference 
there. What I will say the impact of FBA on our business is and first that's 
one of the things that we look at is how well are we attracting new FBA 
sellers, because again, FBA reinforces Prime, Prime reinforces FBA. It's a
 
good flywheel and we added active sellers in FBA grew 70% year
-
over
-
year 
in 2016. So we're very happy with the continued adoption of FBA and what 
that does to Prime, eligible selection for Prime members.
 
The other data point I'll give you that affects our
 
cost structure is our 
Amazon Fulfilled units, which is the combination of retail plus FBA, grew 
nearly 40% last year and that compares to our paid unit growth of 24% in 
Q4. I'm giving you a Q4, not a full year number, but they're similar in 
relative propo
rtion. The fulfillment center expenses and a lot of our shipping 
costs are tied to the increase in that FBA percentage and that growth of 
Amazon Fulfilled units.
 
So that is certainly a factor that we consider a positive from a customer 
standpoint and it's 
one from a cost standpoint that we certainly continue to 
work on every day. But that's about 

 
I think that's the most I can give you 
on FBA at this point.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question comes from Colin Sebastian with Robert W. 
Baird. Please procee
d with your question.
 
Colin Alan Sebastian 
-
 
Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.
 
Thanks very much. Maybe as a quick follow
-
up on the quarter, we've heard 
from other e
-
commerce companies and retailers about a higher degree of 
promotional activity during Q4. So I wonder if there was any conscious 
decision on your part to pull back from s
ome of the more aggressive 
discounting.
 
And then my whether question is whether you can shed any more light on 
the motivation to build out the air cargo hub in Cincinnati, understanding the 
need to support the growth of the core retail business, but also i
f this gives 
you more of an opportunity to build out direct connections to suppliers, for 
example, or a longer
-
term offer excess capacity or logistics as a service. 
Thank you very much.
 
Brian T. Olsavsky 
-
 
Amazon.com, Inc.
 
Sure, Colin. On your first questi
on, holidays are always a very promotional 
period. So we don't see 

 
I can't really comment on the year
-
over
-
year 
differential in promotional activities to us. We are always looking to not be 
beat on price. We want to offer the best options to customers an
d we saw a 
lot of great response from customers this holiday season. I think we would 
be a very trusted holiday partner particularly as you get closer to the 
holiday. So, on the promotion side, we don't consider it a huge factor either 
way. It's pretty muc
h a cost of doing business 12 months a year for us.
 
And, sorry, the second question is on the hub in Cincinnati 

 
or excuse me, 
in Kentucky. Yes, that is 

 
I saw the announcement on that. That is a 
partnership we have to build out the facility at the Hebro
n, Kentucky airport. 
I think it'll create thousands of jobs over time. What it does for us is it gives 
us a base for future growth. It's all about supplementing our existing 
capacity both our partners and ourselves and essentially building capacity 
that ca
n handle this top line growth and also the growth in AFN or Amazon 
Fulfilled Network units which as I just mentioned is even higher than our 
paid unit growth.
 
So same as some of the investments you saw in airplanes last year, our 
partnerships with companie
s that do air cargo. This is about supplying our 
need for our customers and our sellers. We value the partnership with 
external, the external providers as well and I think we're all dealing with the 
problem of having lots of incremental volume year

Thank you. The next question comes from Mark May with Citi. Please 
proceed with your question.
 
Mark A. May 
-
 
Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
 
Thank you. Just a question on paid unit growth. For the last several quarters 
here, it's been accelerat
ing on a year
-
on
-
year basis and I think this quarter 
24%, it was below the 26% that you reported in Q4 of 2015. Just kind of 
curious what had been driving the acceleration over the past few quarters 
and what may be changed this quarter?
 
And then in terms o
f the Q1 revenue guidance, wondering if you could 
provide a little bit of color in terms of the impact that maybe the recent AWS 
price adjustments are having on your Q1 guidance. Thanks.
 
Brian T. Olsavsky 
-
 
Amazon.com, Inc.
 
Let me start with the second one
. So we factored it in, obviously, into the 
numbers I gave through guidance, the timing of it was again closer to 
December 1. So there'll be an incremental differential in Q1 on those price 
cuts, but this is something that we again have quite frequently an
d I don't 
think it's a large factor in Q1. The bigger one is more mechanical that leap 
day comp I would say. And just if you're looking on a non
-
FX adjusted basis, 
the foreign exchange exposure, which I mentioned was $730 million or 250 
basis points expect
ed in this guidance.
 
Darin Manney 
-
 
Amazon.com, Inc.
 
Hi, Mark. This is Darin. On the unit growth, we're very happy with the 24% 
unit growth that we saw in Q4 like you mentioned. Our unit growth has been 
strong and that's primarily attributable to our Prime
 
program and the 
customers and members that enjoy that program. As Brian mentioned, that 
28% is only part of the story. Our Amazon Fulfilled units, the amount going 
through our fulfillment centers and which essentially includes our first
-
party 
retail and o
ur FBA sales and it grew nearly 40% over 2016. So we're very 
pleased with those results and happy with the fundamentals of the business 
from that perspective.
 
Customers continue to respond very well to the low prices. The vast 
selection which is helped by 
the FBA sellers and the strong convenience that 
we can offer through FREE Two
-
Day Shipping and the multitude of other 
faster shipping options such as Same
-
Day, Next
-
Day and in some cases with 
Prime Now, the 1
-
Hour Delivery to 2
-
Hour Delivery. So Prime memb
ership 
and selection continues to drive growth and you'll see that in our unit growth 
numbers.

Thank you. Your next question comes from Douglas Anmuth with JPMorgan. 
Please proceed with your question.
 
Douglas T. Anmuth

JPMorgan Securities LLC
 
Th
anks for taking the question. I wanted to talk obviously about border tax. 
I was hoping that you could give us some of your initial thoughts there and 
how you might think about some of the key considerations around a 
potential border tax.
 
And then secondly
, can you just talk a little bit about fulfillment centers. You 
mentioned the 26 fulfillment center buildout in 2016. Any color that you can 
give us in terms of how you're thinking about that for 2017? Thanks.
 
Brian T. Olsavsky 
-
 
Amazon.com, Inc.
 
Sure. On 
the first one, we have a long
-
standing practice of not commenting 
on regulatory or tax matter. So I'm not going to comment on any proposed 
issues out there. We certainly keep an eye on external issues and weigh in 
when we think it's going to impact our bus
iness. But, your 

 
sorry. Your 
second question was on FCs. We will continue to invest in FCs. The 
comparable I'll give you is that I won't forecast 2017, but the 20% growth in 
square footage that we saw in 2015 was followed by 30% square footage 
increase i
n 2016. That generally went to service that 40% growth in units, in 
AFN units. It also included some of the additional logistics delivery stations 
and all, too. So it's not all FC capacity, that's square footage. But I would 
say that we are going to contin
ue to invest in fulfillment centers as long as 
our AFN growth rate maintains high, and we certainly want to keep that high 
and growing.

Thanks. Two questions, please. First, any comment on customer growth 
qualitatively, how that's trended, how that trended throughout the year, 
accelerated, consistent, decelerated? And then, would you be willing to 
give 
any commentary on the engagement impact you're seeing from all of these 
Echo devices that are getting into households? Are you seeing people shop 
more? Are they engaging more with other parts of Amazon? Just any sort of 
impact on what people with thes
e Echo devices do that's different than 
Amazon customers that don't have them. Thank you.

Sure. Let me start with the Echo. So I don't think I'm going to answer your 
exact question there on quantifying the retail sales through Echo devices. 
It's still very early days on that, so that's not material. But the engagement 
is just like any other Pri
me benefit or investment that we have. We do look 
at engagement and we like the engagement of customers who have Echoes. 
But let me step back a minute and give some highlights on that, Alexa and 
Echo together. As we mentioned in our press release, the unit
 
sales of 
Echoes grew nine times, 9x, year
-
over
-
year during the holiday period. So, 
great customer adoption. We're really glad to see that and that creates a 
great base of Echo and Alexa fans out there.
 
We've added 4,000 skills to Alexa since I last spoke 
to you in October and 
we're working with a lot of major companies as they add abilities, too, for 
our customer base to use the Alexa or the Echo to reach them. Tens of 
thousands of developers are building new skills for Alexa. So, the skills 
addition shoul
d continue. And just as importantly, tens of thousands of 
developers are also using the Alexa Voice Service to help integrate Alexa 
into their products, which then creates a great network effect. We're doing 
that ourselves. If you've seen in the quarter, w
e added Alexa capabilities to 
our tablets and Fire TV devices, making them better. So it's a great, again, 
part of the flywheel in that, Echo and Alexa make the devices better and it 
builds engagement, not only with Echo and Alexa, but also with Amazon.

Hi, Mark. This is Darin. On the customer count, no absolute number to give 
this quarter. As you know, back in Q1 we gave an active customer count 
that exceeded 300 million and I can say it's still growing and we're pleased 
wit
h the number there. What we do like is the engagement with Prime. We 
continue to add Prime members and similar to the flywheel that Brian was 
just mentioning, that the FBA selection helps us with engaging customers 
and in particular the Prime program. So w
e're very pleased with our 
customer engagement this year.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Nowak with Morgan 
Stanley. Please proceed with your question.

Thanks for taking my questions. I have two
. The first one is just on the last 
mile, the logistics build. Can you help us at all on what you're seeing in 
some of these markets like the UK where you have more of the last mile 
buildout done on your own? Is there anything you're seeing about Prime 
beh
avior? What are the advantages and even the challenges you're facing as 
you're building out the last mile?
 
And then secondly, on the brick
-
and
-
mortar stores, any learnings, and 
strategically, just talk to the strategic advantage of having a bigger Amazon 
s
torefront. Thanks.
 
Brian T. Olsavsky

Sure. Let me start with your first question. So as you point out, we've had 
Amazon Logistics deliveries in the UK for more years than some of our other 
countries and what we see is it gives us control
 
of the shipment for a lot 
longer. We can, again, shift order cutoff times out and time is valuable to us 
because, again, we can avoid split shipments, we can avoid other costs of 
acceleration. And so having control later in the process is very valuable to
 
us 
especially as we're working across multiple nodes in a network.
 
But I've driven with drivers in Downtown London and it's a very interesting 
experience. I think it's a great value to our customers. It's interesting to see 
the route density that we see i
n the high cities 

 
or, excuse me, in some 
cities and the challenges and the upside of that. But I would say essentially, 
in a nutshell, our logistics deliveries allow us to have better control of the 
end delivery in markets where we use it. The challenge 
is always going to be 
cost and as we get better at this and get economies of scale, we lower those 
costs over time. So that's essentially my overview of Amazon Logistics.
 
Sorry, your second question was on 

 
oh, the stores, sorry. Yes, you 
probably noticed
 
we launched the 

 
we opened the Amazon Go Store in 
Seattle in the fourth quarter. We think that is very interesting. It's only one 
store at this time. But it's using some of the same technologies you would 
see in self
-
driving cars; computer vision, sensor
, fusion, deep learning. So 
it's a great accomplishment by that team. It's in beta right now and we like 
the promise of that.
 
Probably more advanced and further along are the Amazon Bookstores. We 
have three physical stores; Seattle, San Diego, and Portlan
d right now. We 
see adding five more this year. So we're still in that phase where we're 
testing and learning and getting better, even on the bookstore. I would say 
there's other things that are physical in nature, the pop
-
up stores and 
college pickup poin
ts that we learn from as well, and think creates a great 
value particularly at the college pickup points.
 
So not much projection beyond where we are today except for the fact that 
we will be adding more bookstores. But we test, we innovate, we think the 
bo
okstores for instance are a really great way for customers to engage with 
our devices and see them, touch them, play with them and become fans. So 
we see a lot of value in that as well.

Oppenheimer.

Thanks. Two questions. As we think about investment in the first quarter in 
2017, any color how to think about domestic versus international. You did 
give some comme
nts about India, but just any other color or how to think 
about it?
 
And then on AWS, you announced both new products that reinvent at the 
low end and at the high end. Any commentary on if that impacted the types 
of customers who you've been adding on AWS w
ith those new products. 
Thank you.

Sure. I can't give an exact split of the investments by geography, but I 
would say most of the fulfillment expansion was in North America last year. 
Most of those 26 warehouses we talk
ed about. We see that being more 
balanced over time and being more global as we move forward. Video 
content is with the new global program, global Prime Video is becoming 
more global with the launch in India as well. And, of course, we had Prime 
Video in s
ome of our existing countries prior to that. So that is going more 
global and will be more balanced. As we see devices roll out to other 
countries, same thing.
 
So I would say over time it will become more balanced and probably what 
you've seen in the short
 
run tended to be more North America focused. But I 
can't give you a great split of 

 
I'm not giving you the absolutes anyway, so 
I can't give you a great split of the two. And I will also say that we are 

 
not 
all of our investments are on the consumer si
de. AWS continues to expand 
their global footprint. Last year, we added regions in the UK and Canada. We 
now have 42 availability zones in 16 geographic regions and we will continue 
to grow that business globally. And India, again, we've mentioned, but tha
t 
is, obviously, an international investment.

On the customer split, we serve 

 
in AWS, we serve millions of active 
customers along the spectrum of large enterprise companies as well as small 
startups and the public company 

 
or public environment as well. The 
multitude of launches that we had in reinvent was great for all sizes of 
customers, really, both large and small; both companies starting 

 
just 
getting their start with AWS, but also companies that have been engaged 
wi
th AWS for many years.
 
And so we're really happy about the engagement of reinvent and the 
participation in that conference as well as the engagement of the new 
services that we've launched in Q4 and all of 2016, really.

Thank you. Our next questio
n comes from Eric Sheridan with UBS. Please 
proceed with your question.

Thanks for taking the question. Maybe two, if I can ask. One, the other 
North America revenue line in our view has a lot of advertising 
revenue in it 
and that line continues to sort of show a lot of momentum, come in better 
than expected. Can you talk holistically sort of short
-
term, medium
-
term, 
long
-
term about how you think you're approaching an advertising business 
across your broad pro
perties, what that might become longer
-
term and how 
that might impact the P&L?
 
And then one housekeeping item, anything to call out as an impact from 
demonetization efforts in India in either Q4 or Q1? Thanks so much.
 
Brian T. Olsavsky 
-
 
Amazon.com, Inc.
 
Y
es, sure. I'll take the advertising question. So yes, it's very early in the 
advertising space. But what our goals there are to be helpful to customers 
and enhance their shopping and viewing experiences, mostly with targeted 
recommendations. We think that 
is a good strategy rather than invasive 
things that take away from the shopping experience. I would say Sponsored 
Products is off to a great start. I find it a very effective way for advertisers 
to reach interested customers. We also, on video, have not ad
ded much in 
the way of advertising yet. There's some pre
-
roll as we call it. But for the 
most part, we like the progression. We are balancing customer experience 
with advertising at all times and we like the team that's working on it.
 
Darin Manney

And on other revenue, I just want to call out, there's a number of things 
going into that particular line. These things include revenue from our co
-
branded credit card arrangements and certain advertising, particularly 
display advertising. We ha
ve other types of advertising that's spread out 
throughout the P&L, whether that's a kind of shared marketing investment 
from our vendors which goes into contra COGS and lowers the cost of sales, 
or it's related to other seller advertising which is general
ly within the EGM 
and media categories. And so I'd say other revenue incorporates a number 
of things, not just advertising. And on India demonetization, nothing 
particular to call out today on that.

with Nomura Instinet. Please proceed with your question.

Thanks for taking my questions. It's about Prime Video. You said you were 
pleased with the hours of engagement. My q
uestion is do you think that the 
hours of video stream need to accelerate from here to get to an adequate 
return on the invested capital in video? Or are you happy with those returns 
with the current levels of engagement?
 
And then relatively on Prime Video
, could you just talk about your ambitions 
to potentially extend the video offering beyond on
-
demand and into possibly 
a virtual cable bundle? And then finally, just a question of do you need to 
aggressively partner with distributors, whether they be cable
 
distributors or 
hardware device companies in order to get better distribution of the Amazon 
Prime Instant Video app and content to your customers? Thanks.
 
Brian T. Olsavsky 
-
 
Amazon.com, Inc.
 
Yes, I can't add too much or won't add too much on the last two
 
questions. 
But I will say on 

 
you're talking about the levels of engagement now that 
we're seeing versus what would be the long
-
term model over time. We're 
certainly spending ahead of the value of the engagement right now, but it's 
a good sign that it's 
building. And an important step was that global Prime 
program that we launched in the fall 

 
excuse me, in Q4. As I said, it's very 
much a fixed expense game, especially with original content. That fixed 
amount can go up or down, but the ability to amortiz
e it over a large 
population is what we're looking for.
 
So, we see a double benefit of the global Prime Video program, again both to 
amortize the investment in original content but also to show that original 
content to more and more people, because we thin
k it's done really well. We 
think it's won a lot of awards and we've worked with some 

 
again some 
great, talented people. And it's our ability to scale that and to amortize it 
over a much larger customer base, which will help us in the future.

Good day and welcome to the Amazon.com Q2 2014 Financial Results 
Teleconference. At this time, all participants are in a listen
-
only mode. After 
the presentation, we will conduct a question
-
and
-
answer session. Also, 
today's call is being 
recorded.
 
For opening remarks, I'll be turning the conference over to the Director of 
Investor Relations, Phil Hardin. Please go ahead, sir.
 
Phil Hardin
 
Hello and welcome to our Q2 2014 financial results conference call. Joining 
us today is Tom Szkutak, ou
r CFO. We will be available for questions after 
our prepared remarks.
 
The following discussion and responses to your questions reflect 
management's views as of today, July 24, 2014 only and will include 
forward
-
looking statements. Actual results may differ
 
materially. Additional 
information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is 
included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our 
most recent Annual Report on Form 10
-
K. As you listen to today's 
conferen
ce call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, 
which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on 
the quarter.
 
During this call, we will discuss certain non
-
GAAP financial measures. In our 
press release, slides 
accompanying this webcast and our filings with the 
SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional 
disclosures regarding these non
-
GAAP measures, including reconciliations of 
these measures with comparable GAAP measures.
 
Finally, u
nless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against 
our results for the comparable period of 2013.
 
Now, I'll turn the call over to Tom.
 
Tom Szkutak
 
Thanks, Phil. I'll begin with comments on our second quarter financial 
results. Trailing 12
-
month operating cash flow increased 18% to $5.33 
billion. Trailing 12
-
month free cash flow increased to $1.04 billion. Trailing 
12
-
month capital expenditures were $4.29 billion. The increase in capital 
expenditures reflects additional investments in suppo
rt of continued business 
growth consisting of additional capacity to support our fulfillment operations 
and investments in technology infrastructure including Amazon Web 
Services.
 
Return on invested capital was 6%, up from 2%, ROIC is TTM free cash flow 
di
vided by average total assets minus current liabilities excluding the current 
portion of long
-
term debt over five quarter
-
ends. The combination of 
common stock and stock
-
based awards outstanding was 480 million shares 
compared with 474 million one year ago
.
 
Worldwide revenue grew 23% to $19.34 billion or 22% excluding the $237 
million favorable impact from year
-
over
-
year changes in foreign exchange 
rates. Media revenue increased to $4.84 billion, up 10% or 9% excluding 
foreign exchange. EGM revenue increase
d to $13.28 billion, up 27% or 26% 
excluding foreign exchange. Worldwide EGM increased to 69% of worldwide 
sales, up from 66%. Worldwide paid unit growth was 23%. Active customer 
accounts exceeded 250 million. Worldwide active seller accounts were more 
tha
n 2 million. Seller units represented 41% of paid units.
 
Now I'll discuss operating expenses, excluding stock
-
based compensation. 
Cost of sales was $13.4 billion or 69.3% of revenue compared with 71.4%. 
Fulfillment, marketing, tech and content and G&A comb
ined was $5.54 
billion or 28.6% of sales, up approximately 260 basis points year
-
over
-
year. 
Fulfillment was $2.28 billion or 11.8% of revenue compared with 11.2%. 
Tech and content was $2.02 billion or 10.4% of revenue compared with 
9.1%. Marketing was $911
 
million or 4.7% of revenue compared with 4.1%.
 
Now I'll talk about our segment results. And consistent with prior periods, 
we do not allocate to segments our stock
-
based compensation or other 
operating expense line item. In the North America segment, reve
nue grew 
26% to $12 billion. Media revenue grew 13% to $2.46 billion or 14% 
excluding foreign exchange. EGM revenue grew 29% to $8.37 billion, 
representing 70% of North America revenues, up from 68%. Other revenue 
grew 38% to $1.17 billion. North America s
egment operating income 
increased 7% to $438 million, a 3.7% operating margin.
 
In the international segment, revenue grew 18% to $7.34 billion. Excluding 
the $246 million year
-
over
-
year favorable foreign exchange impact, revenue 
growth was 14%. Media reven
ue grew 7% to $2.38 billion or 4% excluding 
foreign exchange, and EGM revenue grew 25% to $4.91 billion or 20% 
excluding foreign exchange. EGM now represents 67% of international 
revenues, up from 63%. International segment operating loss was $34 
million c
ompared to zero in the prior period.
 
CSOI decreased 1% to $404 million or 2.1% of revenue, down 
approximately 50 basis points year
-
over
-
year. Excluding the favorable 
impact from foreign exchange rate, CSOI decreased 9%. Unlike CSOI, our 
GAAP operating inco
me or loss includes stock
-
based compensation expense 
and other operating expense. GAAP operating loss was $15 million compared 
to operating income of $79 million in the prior
-
year period. Our income tax 
expense was $94 million, and this includes approximat
ely $90 million of 
discrete tax items primarily attributable to audit
-
related developments. 
GAAP net loss was $126 million or $0.27 per diluted share compared with a 
net loss of $7 million and $0.02 per diluted share.
 
Turning to the balance sheet, cash and
 
marketable securities increased $523 
million year
-
over
-
year to $7.99 billion. Inventory increased 23% to $6.64 
billion, and inventory turns were 9.1, down from 9.4 turns a year ago, as we 
expanded selection, improved in
-
stock levels and introduced new pro
duct 
categories. Accounts payable increased 16% to $10.46 billion and accounts 
payable days decreased to 71 from 73 in the prior year.
 
I'll conclude my portion of today's call with guidance. Incorporated into our 
guidance are the order trends that we've se
en to date and what we believe 
today to be appropriately conservative assumptions. Our results are 
inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, 
including a high level of uncertainty surrounding exchange rate fluctuations 
as well
 
as the global economy and consumer spending. It's not possible to 
accurately predict demand, and therefore our actual results could differ 
materially from our guidance.
 
As we described in more detail in our public filings, issues such as settling 
intercom
pany balances and foreign currencies amongst our subsidiaries, 
unfavorable resolution of legal matters and changes to our effective tax 
rates can all have a material effect on guidance. Our guidance further 
assumes that we don't conclude any additional bus
iness acquisitions,

remain approximately where they have been recently.
 
For Q3 2014, we expect net sales of
 
between $19.7 billion and $21.5 billion 
or growth of between 15% and 26%. This guidance anticipates 
approximately 120 basis points of favorable impact from foreign exchange 
rates. GAAP operating loss to be between $810 million loss and a $410

amortization of intangible assets.
 
We anticipate consolidated segment operating income or loss, which 
excludes stock

between $400 million loss and zero compared to $267 million of income in 
the third quarter of 2013.

(Operator Instructions) We'll hear first today from Carlos Kirjner with

Tom, you mentioned in the past that China is an 
area of investments. Can 
you say a little bit about what are the main drivers of investment there, 
whether it's marketing pricing fulfillment? And how do you decide on any 
given year how much we invest in China, just given the size of the potential 
market 
and opportunity? And secondly, we saw a material deceleration in 
the North America other revenues. Was this primarily driven by AWS 
deceleration, and is this deceleration a meaningful contributor to the losses 
implied in your next quarter guidance?
 
Tom Szk
utak
 
Yes, North America other includes a number of things including Amazon Web 
Services. Amazon Web Services is the largest part of North America other. 
As we talked about on last call, we had very substantial price reductions for 
customers starting in sec
ond quarter. They ranged from 28% to 51% 
depending on the service. But AWS continues to grow very strongly. In Q2, 
we had usage growth close to 90% year
-
over
-
year for the quarter. So the 
team is doing a fantastic job. And we put in some price reductions th
at were 
very substantial that are saving customers hundreds and millions of dollars 
over the next several months, as we mentioned 90 days ago.
 
But again, we love that business. It's doing great and we're very pleased to 
have the opportunity to invest in it
. The team is innovating very quickly. In 
fact, so far year
-
to
-
date, they've released 250 significant service and 
features and that's at a pace that's much, much faster than last year's pace, 
which was faster than the year before. So again, they're continu
ing to 
innovate on behalf of customers. And so we're investing. And so that's 
certainly impacting both the pricing decisions we've made. They're certainly 
impacting the guidance. Also, the large amount of CapEx in infrastructure for 
that business is certai
nly impacting the guidance along with a number of 
other things across the business that we're investing in. But we're very 
pleased to do that.
 
In terms of China, we're continuing to invest on behalf of customers there, 
obviously trying to make the experien
ce even better for customers in terms 
of improved in
-
stock levels. We've certainly added a lot of fulfillment 
capacity over time in China, and we're doing a lot of interesting things to 
better serve customers in China.
 
In terms of some of the other parts o
f your question, there's not much more 
I can add to that.

Tom, can you talk a little bit about the deceleration in the units? And then 
also, in terms of the third
-
party dol
lar, it looks like you're trending around 
40%. For a while, it ticked up a little bit to 41%. And so if we adjust for 
digital, how should that trend be looking?
 
Tom Szkutak
 
In terms of unit growth, we had 23% unit growth year
-
over
-
year. It is down 
from las
t year's growth rate, but it's consistent with what we've seen 
recently including the last quarter. And in terms of the third
-
party units as a 
percentage of total units, you're right that's 41% this quarter. It's up about 
100 basis points. And we're not br
eaking out the digital versus physical on 
that. But again, very strong third
-
party growth, a number of factors, but 
certainly FBA is helping third
-
party growth.
 
Operator
 
And we'll go next to Eric Sheridan with UBS.
 
Eric Sheridan

UBS
 
Looking through the e
xpense lines, tech and content seem to have an 
upward pressure in the quarter. Why don't you maybe give a little more 
granularity on what was driving that upward pressure and whether that's 
sort of a new run rate of expense as we saw in the first half of t
his year?
 
Tom Szkutak
 
There's a number of things that are going into the tech and content line. But 
you're right we're the ones that I just mentioned, we are investing in various 
parts of the business, but certainly for Amazon Web Services, that's both 
fro
m an infrastructure standpoint to support the very fast usage growth that 
we're experiencing. Again, we have usage growth close to 90% year
-
over
-
year in the second quarter for Web Services. In addition to that, over the 
past year, we've added thousands of 
people in Web Services. So again, 
ramping that up. And then across a number of different other investment 
areas, we continue to add great technical resources to do the things we're 
doing in digital and many other parts of the company. So again, we have a 
l
ot of opportunities to invest in, as you can see from a lot of the releases 
that we've had over the past 12 months, and you're certainly seeing that 
reflected in our actual results as well.
 
Operator
 
And next from JPMorgan, we'll go to Douglas Anmuth.
 
Kaiza

JPMorgan
 
This is Kaizad Gotla for Doug. I was wondering if you could just talk about 
the deceleration in your international EGM line. And then separately, now 
that you've had Prime price increases in effect for about three months, 
wondering if yo
u could just talk about any changes you've seen in sign
-
ups 
or conversions there.
 
Tom Szkutak
 
In terms of international EGM, and this would really related to total 
international growth as well, we saw 18% growth on a dollar basis, 14% 
growth on a local cur
rency growth basis. We're just down a little bit 
sequentially from what we saw in Q1. Obviously there's variability from 
quarter
-
to
-
quarter in each of the geographies that we operate in. One call
-
out which impacted certainly EGM and our total international
 
growth rate is 
Japan. We saw on April 1st, the consumption tax was increased from 5% to 
8%.
 
Leading up to that in the latter part of Q1, we certainly saw accelerated 
growth, so that was reflected in the Q1 results. In Q2, we saw some 
corresponding softnes
s in Q2 following that. Hard to know how much was 
related to consumption growth, but certainly as you've probably read 
elsewhere that others are seeing that too. So it probably reflects the 
consumption tax increase. But if you take out Japan out of both Q1
 
and Q2, 
the growth rates on a local currency basis were very similar within 
approximately 100 basis points of each other.
 
In terms of Prime, Prime subscribers are growing very nicely year
-
over
-
year. 
In fact, we had more Prime subscribers in Q2 of this yea
r than in Q2 of last 
year. So we're very pleased and we continue to get new subscribers as well 
as existing customers responding to the great value they're getting out of 
Prime.
 
Operator
 
And from Citi, we'll go to Mark May.
 
Mark May 
-
 
Citi
 
Based on 
sort of what you've talked about in the disclosures around the 
price, the amount of the price decreases, the common sense would suggest 
that all if not most of the CSOI margin decline that you posted in Q2 year
-
on
-
year is related to the AWS price changes. 
And the common sense would 
also suggest that given the significant volume gains that you're seeing in 
that business that Q2 might be the most impacted quarter from that yet. 
The third quarter guidance suggests that it's having an even greater impact 
on Q3.
 
Just wondering if you could help us think through that. Is there some 
timing issue related to the impact of that, or is there something else going 
on within the core retail business or maybe some other one
-
time items that 
might be impacting your Q3 outloo
k?
 
Tom Szkutak
 
We're not quantifying the impact of the price changes on our Q2 and Q3, but 
it is fair to say that it certainly did impact our Q2 results in a meaningful 
way. And that's reflected in the results that you're seeing. Another thing to 
keep in m
ind as you look out related to AWS is we're continuing to invest in 
that business. And with the great strong usage growth rates that we're 
seeing, we're also investing in CapEx and infrastructure to support that 
growth. So again, the team has done a fantas
tic job innovating on behalf of 
customers. And as I mentioned earlier, the new releases both from a service 
and feature perspective was about 250 year
-
to
-
date, which is at a pace 
that's much faster than we've seen over the last few years with very high 
bar
, given all the innovation that's happened from that team in that space.
 
So again, there are certainly things that are impacting Q3 guidance. There's 
a number of other things. When you look at Q3, keep in mind if you look 
back over the last several years, 
we're getting ready for Q4 seasonal 
quarter. And when that happens, if you look back, certainly you've seen our 
CSOI usually has been at the lowest point for the year during Q3, 
particularly during these high growth years. And so we've announced that 
we're
 
adding six net new fulfillment centers. And we've also announced that 
we'll have 15 or more sortation centers. The sortation centers help us get 
closer to customers, so that we can have fastest delivery speed as well as 
deliver on Sundays, which is a big 
deal for us in the US. So we're very 
pleased to be able to do that.
 
On top of that, other investment areas that are certainly impacting our Q3 
guidance is we like what we see on the content side. So video content, for 
example, we're ramping up the spend fr
om Q2 to Q3 significantly. And so 
it'll be also a significant growth year
-
over
-
year. Keep in mind we have two 
types of content. We have license content. We also have original content. A 
lot of you have probably seen a lot of the announcements that we've gr
een
-
lighted a number of pilots. We're going to be in heavy production in those 
series that have been green
-
lit during Q3. We've also announced a number 
of pilots that will be in production on. And so that original content, it's a 
portion of our total conte
nt, will be over $100 million in Q3.
 
Just as a reminder, we do not capitalize that portion of our original content. 
Its expense is incurred. So that's over $100 million in Q3. And again, that's 
ramped up considerably both on a sequential and on a year
-
over
-
year basis.
 
Other areas that we're investing in, certainly with the launch of some new 
devices more recently over the past couple of quarters between Fire Phone 
and Fire TV and others, over time we've invested in devices. So that's 
certainly an area we're
 
investing in. We're investing in a lot of different 
areas including geographic expansion. We talked about China on one of the 
earlier questions. But certainly India, we're investing very heavily. We're 
seeing some very positive results there. The team is 
doing a fantastic job. 
We're also investing in other geographies as well, Italy and Spain and 
others. So again, we're encouraged by just the sheer magnitude of 
opportunities we have and we're investing in those opportunities.

First question on FBA. Any insights on the penetration of third
-
party sellers 
using FBA. Maybe you could comment just directionally? Is the number 
trending up or down? And separately, it's been less than a we
ek, but can 
you comment on early feedback to Kindle Unlimited by customers and 
publishers? Do you expect this to be the model for digital book consumption 
in the future?
 
Tom Szkutak
 
In terms of FBA, it's doing great. I can't provide a specific percent. But
 
it's 
really since the time we've launched continued to increase as a percentage 
of total third
-
party units. And so the service has done very well. The team 
continues to work on making it even better on behalf of sellers and 
customers.
 
In terms of Kindle U
nlimited, it's very early, but we're extremely pleased 
with what we see. There's been a great reaction to it. And we're pleased to 
offer that to customers.

Moving next to Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs.
 
Heath Terry

Goldman Sachs
 
You mentioned th
at you were happy with the results that you're seeing from 
the video content. I was wondering if you could give us a sense of sort of 
how that manifests itself, whether it's more Prime subscribers, whether it's 
more consumption of downloadable video conten
t within the ecosystem. And 
then, Tom, to the extent that you're talking about sort of AWS volume 
increases on a year
-
over
-
year basis, can you give us a sense of how that 
may have trended over the course of the quarter as your AWS customers 
were able to so
rt of adapt to the price reduction in March?
 
Tom Szkutak
 
In terms of content, we've seen just more and more customers are 
streaming, more and more Prime members are streaming free content. 
We're seeing through our pipeline as customers join Prime, we're se
eing that 
we have more and more customers taking free trials and then converting. 
Those customers are great customers. In addition to streaming free content, 
they have great purchasing patterns, doing a lot of cross
-
shopping on 
physical products as well as
 
converting to paid digital video and other digital 
products as well. So we're very pleased with what we're seeing there. And 
when you look at the service that we have today, it's improved dramatically 
over the past 12 to 24 months. And we really think it'
s a great service and 
that's why we're investing in it.
 
In terms of AWS, there's not much I can help you with on that. But again, 
just to reiterate, we saw very strong growth during Q2 with usage growth 
rates close to 90% year
-
over
-
year for the quarter. An
d we're extremely 
happy with what we see there, and the team has done a fantastic job, 
continue to innovate on behalf of customers.

We'll hear next from John Blackledge with Cowen & Company.
 
John Blackledge

Cowen & Company
 
Just a couple of quest
ion, first on AWS. Just wondering your take on the 
competitive environment in public cloud, has it intensified over the past six 
to 12 months, just given the investments in AWS? How do you view AWS's 
competitive positioning? And then if you could just touc
h on the key drivers 
of EGM growth in North America, and are those the same drivers of growth 
internationally or are there different drivers North America versus 
international?
 
Tom Szkutak
 
They work hard to be able to afford lower prices for 
customers. That's 
something that is instilled in all of Amazon and something certainly is 
instilled in our Web Services team. And their folks on what they do best, 
which is innovating on behalf of customers, operating these services at the 
highest quality 
levels, and they continue to work on getting more efficient, 
so that we can have great prices for customers. And so that's a team that's 
focused and they're doing a great job.
 
In terms of EGM growth between North America and international, there's 
not a lo
t I can call out there. It has many different categories across many 
different geographies, many different ASINs both first party and third party. 
So it's hard to comment. The only thing I would call for attention is the 
comment I made earlier around inter
national growth rates related to EGM, 
and that was the consumption tax increase in Japan that we saw a lead in 
Q1 where we saw very strong growth leading up to that point and it softened 
after the rates went into effect. But other than that, there's not a 
lot to call 
out.
 
Operator
 
We'll now go to Macquarie's Ben Schachter.
 
Ben Schachter

Macquarie
 
When you mentioned that AWS is growing 90% year
-
over
-
year, what exactly 
is growing 90%? Is it storage? Is it something else? And then on the phone 
itself, are th
ere any key differences in how we should be thinking about that 
piece of hardware versus other hardware you've done in the past where Jeff 
has discussed the notion of potentially one to breakeven? And then just a 
follow
-
up on that. How are you modeling the
 
impact of the phone on the P&L 
in 3Q? Is it going to be more or less than the original content initiative?
 
Tom Szkutak
 
In terms of AWS, it's really aggregation of usage across all of our services 
year
-
over
-
year. Think of it as almost a proxy similar to un
it growth on our 
retail business. It's a proxy to say how fast the physical volume is growing. 
And so that's what it's a proxy for.
 
In terms of the phone, there's not a lot I can help you with on that. We're 
extremely pleased to get it in customers' hands.
 
We think it's a premium 
product. You get a 32 gigabyte phone, premium product, one
-
year free 
subscription to Prime along with all the other features that I'm sure you've 
read about. So again, we're very pleased to get it to customers and start 
shipping. A

Many investments, it looks like where you are getting a return is in the gross 
margin. If I take out AWS, it looks like 
you're up nearly 200 basis points. 
What are the drivers of that e
-
commerce margin increase? Are you seeing it 
primarily on the first
-
party margin expansion? And if so, why? And how 
much is coming from third
-
party unit increase?
 
Tom Szkutak
 
We don't actuall
y focus on total company gross margins because of the mix 
of the business. We focus more on operating profit and obviously ultimately 
free cash flow dollars. But in terms of things that would be impacting COGS 
as a percentage of revenue and that change, to
 
be helpful, you mentioned 
AWS is certainly having an impact there. Our third
-
party business continues 
to have an impact there. We have offsets as we lower prices to customers, 
having an impact there. Just mix of various products and geographies has an 
imp
act on those results. Again, a large number of items that are impacting 
that.
 
Operator
 
And Justin Post with Bank of America
-
Merrill Lynch has our next question.
 
Justin Post 
-
 
Bank of America
-
Merrill Lynch
 
Tom, there might be a little bit of a disconnect. W
hen we see prior 
investment cycles such as distribution builds out or devices with, say, the 
Kindle reader, we did see an impact on units and accelerating growth in 
some of the categories. This time around, even investing for a couple of 
years and I guess 
we're not really seeing the acceleration. So maybe you 
could talk about what gives you confidence in investing in devices like the 
Fire TV and the phone and all the content you're doing? And are you seeing 
some underlying signs, let's say, activities picki
ng up? Maybe you could walk 
through that.
 
Tom Szkutak
 
Just a couple of things to call out. One is when we look at our unit growth, 
you hear the 23% unit growth, keep in mind that there're parts of our 
business that are not included in that unit growth. So 
when we talk about 
investing in Web Services and the usage growing close to 90%, that number 
is not included in the 23%. So that's obviously a large investment area for 
us that we're excited about that is not included in that.
 
The other is think about the 
base of business that we have versus where we 
were just a few years ago. And so you've seen very strong growth on the 
base that we have. And we're excited to see that. When we look at the 
opportunities that we're investing in, in terms of video, you mentio
ned, 
we're seeing that certainly in the number of Prime members that are 
subscribing. And so that has some short
-
term impact, the great long
-
term 
impact as we retain those Prime members and as they start to do more 
cross
-
shopping over time. We have a lot o
f investment in front of that 
demand, if you will. So those are some of the things that I would call out to 
be try to be helpful.

Going back to $100 millio
n spend on the original content, you mentioned 
earlier as that part of the business grows, is there any reason to believe that 
the amount of spend on the originals will go down? The assumption here is 
it'll only go up. So is that $100 million a good level 
to work off of? And then 
going back to the Fire Phone, just trying to understand the strategy around 
the product longer term. Is it again just to try to further build the Amazon 
ecosystem with all the benefits or do you think this could be a cell phone of 
the business?
 
Tom Szkutak
 
In terms of the original content, we're not giving guidance on the numbers 
going forward and beyond Q3. We're very excited about what we see and 
the pilots we had and the series we had. And so we're very happy to 
green
-
light the series that we've talked about and released over the past few 
months. We're also happy you'll be seeing many new pilots. And so that's 
reflected in the over $100 million that I mentioned earlier. So we're 
extremely excited on behalf of cust
omers to be able to do that, and we think 
that's a great thing to do. But in terms of what we do in terms of spend 
beyond Q3, can't comment on today.
 
In terms of the Fire Phone, we're very excited about it. You mentioned two 
different areas. One is can it 
exist on its own and whether it's part of our 
family, if you will, to help drive other usage. And the answer is we certainly 
think it can be both. So we think it could be a great product on its own. 
We're very excited to offer it to customers. It's very in
tegrated into our 
various digital services including video and games and our app store and 
ebooks and certainly Prime music. So those are all very interesting things on 
behalf of customers. It's also a great way to do physical shopping as well. So 
again, i
t's certainly integrated into our business as well.

SIG
 
The first one is around CPG, consumer packaged goods, I was wondering, 
Tom, can you talk to us some learnings in CPG so far, what
's working and 
what you think is still holding back faster CPG adoption? Do you think you 
need a same
-
day delivering offering at this point for CPG kind of given 
Google and even the traditional retailers push into that category? And then 
the second one, th
e close to 90% AWS usage growth, just help us 
understand a bit more, what did that number look like in 2013?
 
Tom Szkutak
 
Yeah, in terms of the usage growth, the business is growing very, very fast 
beyond the data point. There's not a lot I can help you wit
h. In terms of 
CPG, and this really relates to many of our categories, we're working on 
behalf of customers to provide fast delivery. It's something that we've 
improved on over the years and we're going to continue to work on. There's 
a number of different
 
things we're working on. One of the things that I 
mentioned early in the call is certainly sortation centers. That's an attempt 
on our side. We have in a small way and tested it and we've seen that it's a 
way to get product to customers even faster. So we
're excited about that. It 
also helps deliver on Sunday, which we think is great too. So again, those 
are the things that we're working on as well as others to help customers get 
product faster. And we think that benefits CPG products as well other 
product
s.

I wanted to follow up on that William Blair question about gross margins 
only because I know you don't focus on and there're a lot of mix 
factors that 
you correctly pointed out. But that's a record high gross margin for you, 
30.7%, ever. And it's in the context of a quarter in which AWS clearly came 
in because of the price cuts. And so there's something else that happened 
there that really c
aused that gross margin to gap up. Could you give us any 
color? I understand there're a lot of puts and takes in there. But something 
must have happened that was unusual to have that kind of result with a 
slowing down AWS contribution.
 
Tom Szkutak
 
We don't
 
focus a lot on gross margin of the business. Obviously unusual 
product lines, we would look at gross margin. But across the business, we 
don't for the very reason you mentioned. There's a large mix impact. You 
have our Web Services business. You have our 
third
-
party business. You 
have the retail business. You have categories within retail. There's a whole 
host of things that would impact that. And so that's why we don't focus on a 
total company basis. Certainly on individual SKUs or ASINs, as we call them,
 
we certainly would look at it. Individual sub
-
categories, we would certainly 
look at it internally. But from a total company perspective, given the mix 
effects, we think it's much more appropriate to look at operating profit and 
free cash flow.

Looked like revenue per active customer accelerated again this quarter, up 
over 5%. It was running closer to 2% to 3% last year. Could you help us 
understand what's driving that, whether i
t's Prime particularly, or any color 
on that? And when you gave the Prime numbers second quarter more sign
-
ups whether that was a grosser in that number?
 
Tom Szkutak
 
The Prime, it was a net number. So that's the net additions to total 
members. So again, we
 
added net more Prime members in Q2 of this year 
versus Q2 last year, even with the price change. In terms of revenue per 
active customer, there's not a lot I can say there. A few things to think 
about, one is certainly Prime customers buy more than non
-
Pr
ime 
customers. And we're seeing great growth on Prime. That's certainly having 
an impact on that number. And certainly there'll be other factors too. Our 
Web Services business would be included in the numerator that you're 
talking about as well. And so tho
se are factors you should be thinking about. 
But again, the biggest factor would certainly be in terms of looking at our 
retail business, Prime is becoming much more meaningful. And that's also 
why we think about how do we make Prime better on behalf of th
ose 
customers. We just like the long
-
term benefits that we see for those 
customers.

One of your executives in the UK re
cently mentioned the company's goal of 
reaching 1 billion different products available for sale on the site. I wonder if 
there is an expansion in selection beyond what we've seen recently that 
could help accelerate growth. And related to that, are you stil
l relatively 
agnostic in terms of the split between first and third
-
party unit sales?
 
Tom Szkutak
 
In terms of selection, I would say nothing is new here. We're going to 
continue to add unique selection. That's something that we've been working 
extremely ha
rd day
-
in and day
-
out over many years. We have a great team 
of people working on that and trying to make sure we get a vast selection. 
So that's something that we're pleased about. In terms of the margins, they 
do approximate each other. Obviously there's 
some differences. Some of the 
third
-
party will be used products. And you shouldn't assume that a used 
product necessarily has the same contribution profit per unit as a new unit, 
things like that. But they're close approximates of those.

Thank you for standing by. Good day, everyone, and welcome to the 
Amazon.com Q2 2018 Financial Results Teleconference. At this time, all 
participants are in a listen
-
only mode. After the presentation, we will 
conduct a 
question
-
and
-
answer session. Today's call is being recorded.
 
For opening remarks, I'll be turning the call over to the Director of Investor 
Relations, Dave Fildes. Please go ahead?

Hello, and welcome to our Q2 2018 financial 
results conference call. Joining 
us today to answer your questions is Brian Olsavsky, our CFO. As you listen 
to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in 
front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and
 
commentary on the quarter. Please note, unless otherwise stated, all 
comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period 
of 2017.
 
Our comments and responses to your questions reflect management's views 
as of today, July 26, 2018
 
only, and will include forward
-
looking statements. 
Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that 
could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press 
release and our filings with the SEC, including 
our most recent annual report 
on Form 10
-
K and subsequent filings.
 
During this call, we may discuss certain non
-
GAAP financial measures. In our 
press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the 
SEC, each of which is posted on our IR 
website, you will find additional 
disclosures regarding these non
-
GAAP measures, including reconciliations of 
these measures with comparable GAAP measures.
 
Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we've seen to
-
date and 
what we believe today to be a
ppropriate assumptions. Our results are 
inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, 
including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic 
conditions and customer spending, world events, the rate of growth
 
of the 
Internet, online commerce and cloud services, and the various factors 
detailed in our filings with the SEC.
 
Our guidance also assumes, among other things, that we don't conclude any 
additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings or l
egal 
settlements. It's not possible to accurately predict the demand for our goods 
and services, and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from 
our guidance.
 
With that, we'll move to Q&A. Operator, please remind our listeners how to 
initiat
e a question.
 
Question
-
and
-
Answer Session
 
Operator
 
At this time, we will now open the call up for questions. Our first question 
comes from the line of Justin Post from Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with 
your question.
 
Justin Post 
-
 
Bank of America/Merrill 
Lynch
 
Great. Thank you. I guess, the standout metric of the quarter was the 
profitability and the margins. Both U.S. and International have improved 
year
-
over
-
year. Could you talk about (03:04) was it better than your 
expectations for the quarter? And then
 
maybe reasons for the ad business to 
accelerate within the other line? Thank you.
 
Brian T. Olsavsky 
-
 
Amazon.com, Inc.
 
Sure, yeah. Thanks, Justin. Yeah, for the quarter, so it was a strong quarter. 
We had 

 
what I attribute it to is continued strength in 
our 

 
some of our 
most profitable areas. AWS had its third consecutive quarter of accelerating 
growth, 49% FX
-
neutral growth. Advertising also had strong growth. 
Elsewhere we saw probably better than expected efficiencies in operations, 
our infrastructure 
costs, and generally all of our fixed costs.
 
You'll note that in the first half of the year capital leases were flat year
-
over
-
year, although we're up 20% for the full trailing 12 months, in the last 6 
months it's been pretty flat as the team has really wo
rked well to plan our 
data centers run our data centers more efficiently, even to meet again 
increasing usage at our customers; usage rates are exceeding our growth 
rate.
 
So that's what I would point to. Internationally, a lot of the same factors 
hold. I w
ould say that, in addition to the operating efficiencies, advertising is 
also starting to make an impact on gross profit, although advertising is 
smaller in International segment than it's in North America, it's growing at a 
same rapid clip year
-
over
-
year.
 
Even while in International, we're continuing to invest in a lot of areas, we 
continue to frontload Prime benefits for the newer geographies, we continue 
to launch new countries as we launch Prime in Australia recently. We've 
launched devices in multiple 
countries, Echo and Alexa were launched in 
France. Echo Spot was launched in India and Japan in the last quarter. So 
continued 

 
it's a mix of operating efficiencies as we grow, and then also 
continuing to invest on a lot of fronts.

Our next quest
ion comes from Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets. 
Please proceed with your question.
 
Mark Mahaney

Okay. Hey, maybe two things. Just a little bit of color on that unit growth, I 
think, it was 17%, any particular things to call 
out there as that would have 
stunted that growth or negatively limited? Or is that just kind of the new, 
new normal?
 
And then Brian, I'm sorry, you just talked better than expected efficiencies 
in operations, could I ask you to tease that out a little bit 
more, and a little 
more color particularly on the retail side of the business? Are there particular 
newfound efficiencies that are sustainable? Thanks a lot.
 
Brian T. Olsavsky 
-
 
Amazon.com, Inc.
 
Sure. Let's start with unit growth. So I will note, we did a 
very strong unit 
growth rate last year in Q2, with 27%, so we're comping against that. As we 
look back on that, there were number of factors. I mean, in any quarter 
there can be product mix or ASP differentials which shift the unit growth 
figure, but if yo
u also remember, we dropped our Super Saver Shipping 
threshold twice, the early part of last year from $49 to $35; and then down 
to $25.
 
So
 
there was a bit of growth, particularly in lower ASP items from that, that 
we saw last year. So we're comping that. Another factor is digital content 
that moves to subscription. So Amazon Music and Kindle Unlimited, while 
they're very successful and it's 
a good transition, they just 

 
the units do not 
count in this unit calculation.
 
So there's some things like that, that maybe obfuscate the numbers a bit, 
but we're really pleased with the retail growth. We think it's driven by again 
Prime, the Prime progra
m, the engagement of Prime customers as well as 
increased selection, and particularly third
-
party selection.
 
On operations, if you look at probably the last 18 months, you're going to 
see a lot of different pace of increase in both infrastructure costs and
 
capital 
costs, and the addition of fixed cost heads. So one thing that you'll notice is 
that, we've grown 

 
we've stepped down our rate of growth of fixed head 
count, excluding the acquisitions we've grown 26% year
-
over
-
year at the 
end of June, on a trail
ing 12 month basis.
 
But 23% of that was in the second half of last year. So we are continuing to 
look at where we're investing head count. We're seeing a lot of our growth 
areas being fueled by head count that's moving within the company. There's 
a lot of 
movement of tech head count. And so there was less external hiring 
in the first half of this year. We don't think that, that's necessarily the long
-
term trend, but it certainly created a lot of operating efficiencies, and now 
we'll reset and evaluate where
 
we need to still add people.
 
So I think the first half of the year could be a good test of where our cost 
structure is, coming off of the investment that leads up to the holiday. Last 
year, there was a lot of first half investment. If you look back on 
inf
rastructure and fixed head count that may be made that less pronounced. 
But this year it's a little more apparent.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Douglas Anmuth with 
JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.
 
Douglas T. Anmu

JPMorgan Securities LLC
 
Thanks for taking the question. Wanted to ask two, if I could. First, 3Q is 
typically a heavy fulfillment center build out period ahead of the holidays, 
and then lower utilization, but obviously your profit outlook is good. Can
 
you 
just give us a sense of how you're thinking about FC build out and square 
footage increases this year?
 
And then, secondly a lot of excitement around the pharmacy opportunity 
with the acquisition of PillPack. Can you frame some of the strategic 
rationa
le there around the acquisition, and how that helps advance your 
efforts, and how we should think about integration going forward? Thanks.
 
Brian T. Olsavsky 
-
 
Amazon.com, Inc.
 
Sure. On the fulfillment center capacity, I don't have a number for you, 
today. 
I'll probably clarify that at the end of next quarter as we head into 
holiday, but if you think back, the last two years, we've added square 
footage that's exceeded 30% growth, both in 2016 and 2017.
 
We anticipate it's going to be lower this year as we get
 
some efficiencies off 
what we've built over the last few years, but I don't have a number for you 
today. I will say that, the majority of it is being put in service in the back
-
end of the year, just like in the last two years. But I'll 

 
we'll clarify tha
t next 
quarter.
 
On PillPack, yes, the deal of course hasn't closed, yet. We expect to close it 
in the second half of the year, so I'll limit my comments right now. But we're 
excited. I think the company has a really highly differentiated customer 
experienc
e, and they've done a great job getting to the size and scale that 
they're at today. We think that, working together with them we can expand 
on that in the future.
 
They're like a lot of the other acquisitions we've done. Recently, we're 
looking for well
-
ru
n companies with highly
-
differentiated customer 
experience, and a real sense of customer obsession that matches ours. So 
we think PillPack has got all those traits, and we look forward to the deal 
closing and working with them.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next
 
question comes from Mark May with Citi. Please 
proceed with your question.
 
Mark A. May 
-
 
Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
 
Thanks. On AWS, does the backlog there give you confidence in the ability 
for this business to continue to post the type of robust grow
th that you've 
seen of late? And on Alexa, now that you're reaching a meaningful number 
of Alexa users, I wondered if you could discuss a bit more about how Alexa 
is impacting retail business?
 
Brian T. Olsavsky 
-
 
Amazon.com, Inc.
 
Sure. Let me start with AW
S. Yeah, we're very happy with the results we're 
seeing, and the backlog that we see, and the new contracts and new 
customers and the expansion of existing customer business that we see. 
Again, the business has accelerated the last three quarters, and we'r
e seeing 
great signs in a number of areas.
 
We've added 800 new services and features so far this year; that's an 
accelerated pace from last year, which was a record year. We see customers 
have migrated more than 80,000 databases using the AWS Database 
Migr
ation Service.
 
And customers are just branching out to a lot of new products from us. 
There are new areas like machine learning, artificial intelligence, Internet of 
Things, serverless computing and database and analytics are really big. So 
we think that, 
when you look at it, why do people come to us? It's 
essentially set functionality and pace of innovation that we've demonstrated 
for multiple years. We've built a very strong partner and customer 
ecosystem. And frankly we've the most proven reliability of 
security and 
performance, and we've been at this longer than anyone else.
 
So again, we continue to deliver for customers. We continue to use feedback 
from customers to develop new services and features. The operating margin 
itself will fluctuate quarter
-
to
-
quarter, a very strong performance this 
quarter. Obviously, part of that was in the capital leases being flat year
-
over
-
year, and the team's ability to really run the data centers at a higher 
efficiency.
 
Dave Fildes 
-
 
Amazon.com, Inc.
 
Yeah. And I think, t
he second question was just related to how is Alexa 
impacting the business, overall. And 

 
hey, this is Dave. I mean, I think, 
we're having a lot of success with devices and customers are enjoying those. 
We talked to coming out of Prime Day, had some good 
success and happy 
customers enjoying some of the devices there. So I think, that's a lot of 

 
the focus now is really having a good and exciting roadmap of recent revises 
and more to come ahead, and getting those into customers' hands.

Thank 
you. Our next question comes from the line of Heath Terry with 
Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.
 
Heath Terry 
-
 
Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
 
Great. Thank you. Just on the AWS point, as you're seeing customers to 
AWS, you're adding new customers t
o AWS, can you give us a sense of sort 
of where you're seeing customers spend focus. How successful 

 
you 
mentioned database, but what other areas you're potentially seeing as 
customers move up the stack with you and grow?
 
And then, you flagged the flat ca
pital lease growth on a year
-
over
-
year 
basis. In the past when you've talked about the growth in CapEx and capital 
lease, you generally referred to trying to grow those numbers or that 
infrastructure growth overall more or less with the business. Is there 
some 
level of efficiency breakthrough that you've gotten there where that's no 
longer the case? Or is it a function of timing? How should we think about 
what that CapEx and capital lease spend signals about your expectations for 
growth?
 
Brian T. Olsavsky 
-
 
Amazon.com, Inc.
 
Sure. I would say it's just a demonstration of the very tight period where we 

 
we've still added a lot, I mean, $4.6 billion is a lot of capital leases, but 
the rate of growth over last year is flat. So what I would say is, I'm not sure 
about the breakthrough element of it. We do spend a lot of time driving 
better efficiency in our data centers. We do see it; sometimes it is higher 
than other quarters. The starting point for our expectation would be, the 
usage growth would be very 

 
that 
our growth in infrastructure costs would 
start with the growth in usage, which has been exceeding the revenue 
growth rate.
 
But we can drive more efficiently and we can sometimes bank the 
efficiencies of prior investments that we've made in other periods. S
o it will 
fluctuate quarter
-
to
-
quarter. I would say last year in the first half was a 
pretty large investment area. I'll lump it in with capital expenditures, but in 
the first two quarters, Q1 of last year, it was 82% growth year
-
over
-
year in 
capital expen
ditures, Q2 was 67%.
 
This year, those numbers are 33% in Q1, and 1% in Q2. So it's a 

 
there's a 
bit of timing at play here, but I think overall, in the longer
-
term, we certainly 
work to drive efficiency in both AWS infrastructure capability, and also in o
ur 
warehouse networks.
 
I don't have on the other piece, on product detail, I don't have anything 
more for you. I would just say that, our growth is coming from customers 
that span from start
-
ups to enterprise customers to government agencies, 
and they star
t small and then they continue to build and shift their 
businesses to us, and many of them have gone 

 
a large number have gone 
all
-
in on AWS, and have had a chance to lower their cost structures as a 
result. I'd count Amazon in that category, because on t
he consumer side of 
the business, we increasingly see infrastructure savings due to the 
conversion to AWS resources.

Thanks for taking my questions, I have two. The first one on the ad 
business, Brian, I was just wondering, could you give us some examples of 
some products you've had particular success with on the ad side? And I 
know you guys are always f
ocused on removing customer friction points and 
solving pain points for customers, maybe talk to us about some of the still 
existing pain points for your advertiser customers you're looking to address 
with the advertising product?
 
And the second one, I kno
w it's an accounting question, but we're going to 
be asked it a lot. On revenue accounting, can you just sort of walk us 
through any of the accounting changes that any of the revenue lines had in 
the current quarter because of the multiple accounting movin
g pieces? 
Thanks.

Yeah, let me give Dave a chance afterwards to talk about that piece, but I'll 
start with advertising. So conceptually stepping back, it's now a multi
-
billion 
dollar business for us. We're seeing strong
 
adoption across a number of 
fronts. Amazon vendors, sellers, authors as well as third
-
party advertisers 
who want to reach Amazon customers.
 
So we have hundreds of thousands of emerging and established advertisers. 
And they're using our services to achieve
 
their marketing goals to 

 
whether 
that's to drive new brand awareness, discovery or ultimately purchase 
decisions on our site.
 
Pain points and improvements, I would say, our priorities include improving 
the usability of our tools for advertisers, helping
 
make smarter 
recommendations for customers. Automating, we're doing a lot of work on 
automating the activities that the advertisers need to do, and continue to 
invent new products for those advertisers.
 
We also think measurement is going to be important s
o we're focused on our 
measurement capabilities, so advertisers understand what outcomes they're 
driving on our properties. And we think that we're uniquely positioned to 
show them the direct benefit of their advertising.

Yea
h. And Brian, this is Dave. Just on the accounting piece, specifically to 
Q2, the impact of the Accounting Standards Update, revenue recognition 
changes we did starting in the first part of year, it's a $640 million increase 
to other revenue, specifically 
related to how we treat some of the advertising 
service.
 
So you remember as part of the adoption beginning in 2018, certainly the 
advertising services were classified as revenue rather than cost of sales. So 
$640 million more is in other revenue this secon
d quarter. You'd see that in 
that line item, which is about $2.2 billion here in the second quarter.
 
In addition to that, some of the other factors I talked about last quarter, 
some of the treatment of gross to net changes in some sales of apps and 
app con
tent, digital media costs, some of that shift created a headwind for 
online stores revenue. So that year
-
over
-
year growth rate for that line item 
would have been higher, but for that change.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Eric Sheridan wi
th UBS. Please 
proceed with your question.

Thanks so much. Two questions if I can. On Whole Foods, any update on the 
integration of Whole Foods within the broader Prime ecosystem, the way in 
which you're tying those as
sets and customer bases together to sort of 
promote the flywheel that you've talked about a fair bit?
 
And Prime Now, any update on the scale of markets globally, and what 
you're learning as Prime Now continues to scale in terms of how users adopt 
the 
service, putting SKUs closer to prem what that does to the velocity of 
purchasing? Thank you so much.
 
Brian T. Olsavsky

Amazon.com, Inc.
 
Sure. So, it was a big quarter for Whole Foods and Prime. We launched 
additional savings for Prime members at Whole F
oods. If you go to Whole 
Foods store or Whole Foods Market 365 store, you see a lot of yellow 
stickers for 10% discounts of hundreds of sale items. You also see deep 
discounts on selected popular products. So Prime members have adopted 
this benefit, it's o
ne of the fastest rates we've ever seen for a Prime benefit, 
and they've already saved millions of dollars on everything from seasonal 
favorites to as I said popular daily sales.
 
So in addition, we've expanded grocery delivery to 20 cities so that's pickin
g 
up steam. During the Prime Day, we had some unique deals for Prime 
customers at Whole Foods. Actually, the deals lasted for a week at Whole 
Foods. And people had, again the ability to see the benefit that Prime 
membership save incremental dollars, becaus
e of it at Whole Foods. And the 
Prime Rewards Visa Card, which gives you 5% off on all purchases has been 
applied to Whole Foods' purchases as well.
 
So that is the second wave, probably after the first wave where we talked in 
previous calls about initial p
rice drops, putting lockers in the stores, selling 
some of the Whole Foods' products on the Amazon site, and other things. So 
the invention level is still really high. We think it's a big milestone this 
quarter to launch Prime benefits with Whole Foods, an
d we'll keep going, 
we'll see how that develops.
 
Prime Now, I guess, my comments are that, it's in 50 cities worldwide, it's 
across 9 countries. It is different than 

 
we have multiple options for you in 
grocery delivery. We have the delivery services 

 
so
 
AmazonFresh and Prime 
Now which serve a certain need. We have a traditional grocery store now 
with Whole Foods, and then we have the combination of those two with 
home delivery, and we're using Prime Now or Whole Foods products through 
Prime Now to make t
hose deliveries as well as the new kind of stores with 
Amazon Go that we're experimenting with. So lots of innovation, invention 
on that front as well.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Ross Sandler with Barclays. 
Please proceed with your qu
estion.

Good evening. Hey guys, I had two questions. First is on the Music business. 
So I think, you said recently you had tens of millions of paying subscribers. 
So are those paying music listeners coming from Prime, 
and using the 
mobile app, or they coming in from Echo? Any color on what's driving that 
uptake and converting users into paid members?
 
Then the second question is, you mentioned efficiency gains in retail and the 
improvement in retail operating margin. If 
we look at International, it's still 
negative, but it's also improving pretty meaningfully, so can you parse 
where that improvement's coming from between India and the other 
emerging markets versus some of the more mature markets in Western 
Europe?
 
Brian T
. Olsavsky 
-
 
Amazon.com, Inc.
 
Sure, let me start with that second question. So, yes, we have seen over the 
last few quarters, improved operating margins internationally. I would say in 
places like Europe and Japan, we're seeing many of the efficiencies I t
alked 
about earlier on fixed head count, operations costs, infrastructure costs, and 
also things like marketing working to be very efficient. I would also say that, 
although it's smaller internationally the impact of advertising is starting to 
show up more
 
and more internationally. It's growing quite quickly just as it 
is in North America.
 
But you're right. We continue to invest. We're investing in India obviously, 
and have seen good traction there. We just passed our Fifth Year 
Anniversary 

 
celebrated our
 
Fifth Year Anniversary, as the most visited site 
in India. So we think there's a lot of great innovation that has continued to 
occur for Indian consumers and sellers, and that will continue.
 
But you're also seeing additional expansion. So we launched Prim
e in 
Australia; we're rolling devices out. We launched Echo and Alexa in France. 
The Echo Spot in India and Japan, and we announced that we're going to 
expand Echo and Alexa soon to Italy, Mexico and Spain. So I would say that 
we're continuing to frontload
 
Prime benefits in the newer geographies. So 
that's one of the issues that we see with operating margin.
 
But we think it's the right thing to do. We are seeing strong traction in that 
front as well. We also like that the 

 
on Prime Day, we were able to exp
and 
our list of countries that experience Prime Day; this year to Australia, 
Singapore, the Netherlands and Luxembourg. So we're very bullish on our 
International business. We do realize it's a period of investment and we're in 
different stages of growth i
n different countries.
 
Dave Fildes

Amazon.com, Inc.
 
Yeah, and this is Dave. Just quickly on Music, as you mentioned, tens of 
millions of paid customers are enjoying Amazon Music. When you look at the 
Amazon Music Unlimited subscription, it continues to g
row very quickly. 
We've got those offerings in more than 30 countries now and the catalog 
there's tens of millions of songs, and a lot of rich playlists, personalized 
stations, those kinds of things.
 
Of course we started in Music with Prime Music, a little
 
bit earlier in that 
space, and I think that's been a great way for Prime members to enjoy some 
of that catalog for free, and then as they enjoy that, be able to move into 
the Amazon Music Unlimited skill.
 
One of the great things that's also part of that, 
I think, you alluded to it is 
just Alexa, and one of the most popular features we see as you probably 
imagine for using those devices are just interacting with Alexa, wherever 
you may be is being able to listen to music. So that's proven to be a, I think, 
a good skill for folks to be able to enjoy in addition to a really kind of rich 
and growing Amazon skill set. We now have more than 45,000 skills 
available to customers.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Youssef Squali with SunTrust 
Robinson
 
Humphrey. Please proceed with your question.

SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.
 
Thank you very much. On the new Supreme Court decision, you guys have 
been collecting state taxes in all 45 states where it's applicable for a 1P. And 
for a 3P,
 
I think, it was in two states. Have you seen any slowdown to 
growth in these two states since you began collecting taxes? I think, you 
started maybe last 12 months or so.
 
When will you start collecting taxes in the rest of the country, and will you 
charge
 
for it? Because my understanding is that, in those two states you do 
not collect or you do not charge to help these 3P sellers file taxes or collect 
state taxes. Thank you.
 
Dave Fildes 
-
 
Amazon.com, Inc.
 
Yeah. Hey, Youssef this is Dave. So right now, as y
ou mentioned 45 states 
that have state
-
imposed sales tax, first
-
party products we do our own 
collection on that. For 3P sellers right now, it's three states. So Washington 
State started as of January 1, Pennsylvania as of April 1, and most recently 
Oklahom
a on July 1. So those are the ones where we're collecting and 
remitting. We haven't said 

 
and to your second point we've not talked 
about any kind of trends. As you could imagine some of these are still really 
early days.

Thank you. Our 
final question comes from Jason Helfstein with Oppenheimer 
& Company. Please proceed with your question.
 
Jason Helfstein

Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.
 
Thanks. Given the focus in the press release about Alexa Voice Services, any 
thoughts about how you would mon
etize on third
-
party devices? And then 
just a follow up on Amazon Prime Video Channels, any plans to offer 
standard skinny bundles to become a cable replacement? Thanks.
 
Brian T. Olsavsky 
-
 
Amazon.com, Inc.
 
Yeah, let me start with Alexa. So right now, our 
emphasis is around 
expanding the reach of Alexa and the usefulness. So as Dave mentioned, 
we're now up over 45,000 skills. We have a developer network of 

 
that's 
expanded and we have over 13,000 smart home devices from 2,500 unique 
brands. You're seeing t
hings like expansion into the hotel space where we're 
partnering with hotels to allow you to experience Alexa while you're 
traveling.
 
And you saw from the quote that was in our press release from Jeff, the 
number of Alexa
-
enabled devices has tripled in the
 
past year, so 

 
including 
some really large companies like Polk, Sonos, Acer, Hewlett
-
Packard, 
Lenovo, BMW, Ford, Toyota to name a few. So that's the biggest emphasis, 
is getting the expansion of Alexa to places where it can be useful. We also 
are develop
ing new machine learning tools to help developers more easily 
build Alexa skills. We feel like we're getting great traction there.
 
So I think your original question was about monetization of Alexa, but right 
now the biggest thing we can do is to make it as
 
useful as possible, and 
make devices that can use the skills.
 
Dave Fildes 
-
 
Amazon.com, Inc.
 
Yeah, and then just on the second question. I mean, I can't speculate on 
what we might do in the future, but I'd say today, with Prime Channels, I 
think, we're re
ally pleased with the growth we're seeing. We've seen some 
good channels come online over the last few quarters, and seen some good 
traction there. So we'll keep focusing on building out even better selection, 
because it's clear to us that customers want t
hat option to be able to add 
that content as part of their Prime memberships.

Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Amazon.com Q3 2018 Financial 
Results Teleconference. At this time, all participants are in a listen
-
only 
mode. After the presentation, we will conduct a question
-
and
-
answer 
session. Today's call is 
being recorded.
 
For opening remarks, I will be turning the call over to the Director of 
Investor Relations, Dave Fildes. Please go ahead.

Hello, and welcome to our Q3 2018 financial results conference call. Joining 
us today t
o answer your questions is Brian Olsavsky, our CFO. As you listen 
to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in 
front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and 
commentary on the quarter. Please note, un
less otherwise stated, all 
comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period 
of 2017.
 
Our comments and responses to your questions reflect management's views 
as of today, October 25, 2018 only, and will include forward
-
looking 
statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information 
about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in 
today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent 
annual report on Form 10
-
K and subsequent filings.
 
During this call, we may discuss certain non
-
GAAP financial measures. In our 
press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the 
SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional 
disclo
sures regarding these non
-
GAAP measures, including reconciliations of 
these measures with comparable GAAP measures.
 
Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we've seen to date and 
what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are 
inherently unpredictable and maybe materially affected by many factors, 
including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic 
conditions and customer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the 
Internet, online commerce and clo
ud services, and the various factors 
detailed in our filings with the SEC.
 
Our guidance also assumes, among other things, that we don't conclude any 
additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings or legal 
settlements. It's not possible to ac
curately predict demand for our goods and 
services, and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our 
guidance.
 
With that, we'll move to Q&A. Operator, please remind our listeners how to 
initiate a question.

At this time, we will now open the call up for questions. Thank you. Our first 
question comes from the line of Justin Post with Merrill Lynch. Please 
proceed.
 
Justin Post

Bank of America Merrill Lynch
 
Great. Thank you for taking my question. I gues
s the big one is the 
deceleration in unit growth or online stores, which are probably related to 
that. I know it's a tough 3Q comp, but could you comment a little bit about 
that? And then kind of what initiatives could be most interesting to maybe 
reaccele
rate that over the next couple of years? What categories? Thank 
you.
 
Brian T. Olsavsky

Amazon.com, Inc.
 
Thank you, Justin. Yeah, let me just remind you a couple of things from last 
year. We had two reactions on our Super Saver Shipping threshold in the 
f
irst half of the year between February and May. That did spur a lot of unit 
growth in the second and third quarter. We also have issue with digital 
content, not an issue, but the fact that digital content is moving to 
subscriptions, Amazon Music Unlimited 
and Kindle Unlimited in particular. 
It's been really popular.
 
I'll just remind you that the units 

 
those do not count in our unit totals nor 
do the units from Whole Foods Market. So, yeah, I would say essentially 
with that backdrop, we're still very, very
 
encouraged by the demand and the 
reception from customers on the consumer side. We have Amazon fulfilled 
units are still growing faster than paid units. 3P is now up to 53% of total 
paid units.
 
In
-
stock is very strong, especially as we head into the holid
ay period. I think 
we're well positioned for the holiday. We have over 100 million Prime eligible 
items that are available for FREE Two
-
Day Shipping for Prime members. And 
again, when we're talking about the unit deceleration, a lot of the fastest 
growing 
areas, things like subscription services, AWS and advertising are not 
caught in that metric.
 
Dave Fildes

Amazon.com, Inc.
 
And, Justin, this is Dave. Just to add on to that. You mentioned the online 
stores. Just a reminder, there is a little bit of impact
 
from the revenue 
recognition. So you see the online stores revenue growing about 11% ex
-
FX, 
to be higher than that, but for the adoption ad standard. So there's a little 
bit of a headwind there as well.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question comes from lin
e of Mark Mahaney with RBC 
Capital Markets. Please proceed.
 
Mark Mahaney

RBC Capital Markets LLC
 
Okay. I was going to also then ask you to drill down a little bit on the 
international retail business. That seemed to slow down, I guess that 
whatever, 15% 
or something year
-
over
-
year. Any particularly color? Any 
markets that would have led to that? Though the comp was tougher, but 
anything else you'd call out there? Thanks a lot.
 
Brian T. Olsavsky 
-
 
Amazon.com, Inc.
 
Sure. On a year
-
over
-
year basis, I think y
ou have to look at two things. We 
did the Souq acquisition last year in May. So the full pickup on that year
-
over
-
year was in 2017 and now we're lapping that. There's also material 
change in the Diwali calendar in India. About half of our Diwali sales last
 
year were in Q3. This year they'll be fully in Q4. So those are a couple 
factors that hit the international growth area in particularly.
 
But I also point out that we launched Turkey in the quarter and now we have 
17 Amazon websites globally. So we're stil
l very pleased again with the 
international business, continue to invest in Prime benefits, international 
expansion as I just mentioned, and we're still seeing very good pickup. Story 
is different country
-
by
-
country obviously. Some are much further along t
han 
others, but overall we're very happy. India, although Diwali moved into Q4, 
so far that's going really well. We've seen great response from customers. 
We've had 60% growth in new customers during the period. Orders are 
coming in from 99% of the pin cod
es in the country. So, great first wave of 
the, what we call the Amazon's Great Indian Festival, which lead into Diwali.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question comes from line of Douglas Anmuth with 
JPMorgan. Please proceed.
 
Douglas T. Anmuth

JPMorgan Securities LLC
 
Thanks for taking the question. You had significant operating income upside 
in 3Q relative to your guide. Can you just talk about the biggest drivers 
there in terms of outperformance? And then when you think about your 4Q 
outlook, h
ow should we think about the minimum wage increase that you've 
talked about? And then any other one
-
time or special items that might be 
weighing on that operating income outlook? Thanks.
 
Brian T. Olsavsky 
-
 
Amazon.com, Inc.
 
Sure. Let me start with Q3 and t
his will be commentary pretty much on the 
whole year that was especially true in Q4. So, first of all, we've had very 
strong growth in some very profitable businesses that we have, most 
notably AWS and advertising. But we've also had great cost performance
 
this year in three specific areas I'll call out. So, first on head count. If you'll 
remember, we grew head count 48% in 2016 and 38% last year, if you 
adjust for Whole Foods. With Whole Foods, it was 66%, but without Whole 
Foods we still grew 38%.
 
We have
 
looked to really leverage our investment from the last couple years 
and as we've funded and moved, invested in a lot of new areas as we've 
talked about, AWS, devices, digital content, we've had a lot of movement 
within the company that has filled a lot of
 
those roles. So we're only up 13% 
on head count through nine months year
-
over
-
year. So a real step down in 
that. Again, the theme here is going to be banking some of the investments 
from prior years and looking to gain greater control.
 
In our fulfillment 
center world, we had grown square footage for our 
fulfillment center and shipping areas by over 30% the last two years, 2016 
and 2017. I've talked about that in prior calls. Making that investment to 
match up with very strong Fulfilled by Amazon demand and
 
AFN or Amazon 
Fulfilled Network units that are growing at a faster rate than our paid units.
 
This year we're only adding about 15% to our square footage. So again, 
getting better efficiencies on what we have and banking the multi
-
year 
investment that we'v
e been making. And the last one, which is really 
significant, is on the infrastructure side. You see the operating margin for 
AWS is up to 31% this quarter. A lot of that is based on efficiencies of our 
data centers, not only for the AWS business, they're 
also for our Amazon 
consumer businesses, who is AWS' biggest customer.
 
If you look at capital leases, which is where we spend money for the data 
centers, it's up only 9% year
-
over
-
year, trailing 12 months, and it was up 
69% last year, at the end of the yea
r. So those three areas have driven a lot 
of the cost performance and a lot of the deviation from probably the 
estimates that I've come up with this year. So we are really happy that 
again we're seeing great cost performance in a number of areas across the
 
business.

Thank you. Question on AWS. Obviously in the last few quarters, you've 
seen accelerating revenue growth
. This quarter, 46%, still quite strong, but 
dollar and percentage growth did slow. I'm just kind of curious are you just 
reaching a point in terms of a lot of large numbers where it will be more 
difficult to sustain not only accelerating growth, but susta
in kind of the 40
-
plus
-
percent growth levels where we've been recently? Or was there 
something also going on kind of in the quarter that maybe drove that? 
Thanks.
 
Brian T. Olsavsky

Yeah, thanks for your question. This growth rate is goin
g to bounce around. 
We've had sequential increase in growth rate the prior three quarters, I 
believe, it was. This quarter is slightly down, but still 46% growth is very 
strong. We are at an annualized run rate above $26 billion and that was 
about $18 bill
ion this time last year. So we're very happy with the growth in 
the business, the momentum that we're seeing with enterprise customers. 
And we just mentioned on the cost side, it's been a very good year from 
gaining greater efficiencies in our infrastructu
re costs.

Thank you. Our next question comes from line of Brian Nowak with Morgan 
Stanley. Please proceed.

Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. The first one, the fourth quarter 
revenue guide and the f
ourth quarter revenue deceleration. Maybe can you 
just help us understand a little bit any of the specific categories or countries 
that have been the largest contributors to revenue growth throughout the 
course of this year? And which of those are really s
lowing down sort of 
driving this potential deceleration that you're guiding to?
 
Then the second one, you've applied robotics to the warehouses now around 
Kiva. Curious for your thoughts about the need or desire to invest in 
autonomous driving technologies 
to think about some of the other retailers 
partnering with Waymo and other players, et cetera.
 
Brian T. Olsavsky 
-
 
Amazon.com, Inc.
 
Sure. Let me talk about guidance. So our guidance for the fourth quarter 
implies 10% to 20% growth and includes an 80
-
basis 
point unfavorable 
impact from foreign exchange. I wouldn't point to any specific country. Once 
you adjust for the fact that Whole Foods, it was purchased in August of last 
year and that has impacted every quarter since then, Q4 will be the first 
solid non
-
Whole Foods comp since before we bought them since Q2 of last 
year.
 
So if you, even factoring that, and we're looking at Q4 and we have very 
high error bars on the quarter. Much of our, not only our revenue for the 
quarter, but also for the year comes in t
hat very tight window between 
middle of November and the end of the year. So it's always a very difficult 
period for us to estimate. What I would say is that we feel like we're in great 
shape for the holiday. The warehouses are very clean. We feel like we'
re 
going to have great capacity not only for retail products but also for FBA. 
We're going to have great capacity for shipping to our customers. So we're 
very ready to go. Selection should be at its highest point, especially for 
Prime members. So we're ver
y bullish on the fourth quarter. And we'll just 
have to see how revenue comes in.
 
I will say there's one housekeeping item on Prime revenue recognition that 
you should be aware of and may remember from prior quarters. This year, 
we took Prime subscription 
revenue and amortized it over the quarters on a 
straight line method. Previously, we had done it on a, is tilted more to Q4. 
It's based more on shipping units. So what you've seen is a push of revenue 
and income from Q4 into Q1, 2 and 3 that we've mentione
d on each call.
 
This is the quarter where that will reverse. That is to scale it for you. Under 
the old methodology we would have had $300 million more of both revenue 
and operating income in the quarter. That has again been caught up for in 
prior quarters
, but again not a huge factor on the growth rate for revenue, 
but just another item to consider.
 
On the Robotics, I don't have much to say on autonomous driving. We are 
putting most of our efforts right now, continue to into our Robotics program. 
We think 
it's been a great addition to our fulfillment capacity. It makes the 
jobs in our warehouse that much better. It makes the people around the 
robots that much more productive. It allows us to have much greater density 
of product storage and a number of other
 
benefits. It has some additional 
capital intensity, but it has good return on invested capital from our 
standpoint.

Thanks for taking the question. With a lot of offline retailers talking more 
about omni
-
channel, wanted to understand sort of the investments you 
might be making around unifying the efforts with Whole Foods and Amazon 
Prime Now, speeding up 
delivery, giving consumers as much choice as 
possible and moving SKUs closer to households. How should we be thinking 
about that push in 2019 and 2020 and how that might open up new areas of 
wallet share for the company? Thanks guys.
 
Brian T. Olsavsky

Am
azon.com, Inc.
 
Sure. Yeah, I think we've started to show our strategy on the Whole Foods 
side. You'll see even this quarter we started to have greater expansion of 
our grocery delivery out of Whole Foods using Prime Now. We're now in 60 
cities in the U.S.,
 
giving customers delivery in as fast as an hour on 
thousands of great organic products from Whole Foods.
 
We've also expanded grocery pickup and that's available in 10 cities. So the 
customers can pick up at the Whole Foods store. You'll see that we've 
sta
rted to tie Whole Foods into Alexa. You can build your cart using Alexa 
and then check out using the Prime Now app. So there's going to be a lot of, 
as you say, omni
-
channel overlap, especially in the grocery business.
 
On the storefront, we're also, as you
 
can see, experimenting with numerous 
store formats. Amazon Go is now up to six stores. We opened five in the 
quarter. We're getting great feedback on that. Customers love the ability to 
quickly walk in, select items they want and leave without waiting in 
a 
checkout line. We opened up a Amazon four
-
star location in New York City 
where we're going to test the concept of a highly curated selection of top 
categories across Amazon. We of course have Amazon bookstores, 18 
bookstores in the U.S. So we're going to
 
experiment with multiple ways of 
reaching the customer, wherever they happen to be.

Thank you. Our next question comes from line of Ross Sandler with 
Barclays. Please proceed.
 
Ross Sandler

Barclays Capital, Inc.
 
Great. I guess two questions. An
y color on, it looks like shipping costs and 
maybe labor costs might see some inflation in 2019. So do you agree with 
that? Or what are some of the things you can do to potentially offset some 
of that pressure?
 
And then, the 15% fulfillment square
-
footage 
growth, you're obviously 
deploying a lot of automation and there's a lot more efficiency gains in the 
current generation of fulfillment centers than maybe the older ones. So how 
should we think about a 15%? Is that not a good reading indicator on 
growth in
to 2019? Or is it 

 
any color there would be helpful. Thanks.
 
Brian T. Olsavsky 
-
 
Amazon.com, Inc.
 
Sure. I think it's comparable to 

 
last question first. I think the 15% is 
comparable to the 30%
-
plus that I mentioned in 2016 and 2017. We are 
debating whet
her the dynamics of the warehouse are changing so that 
square footage may not be the main indicator, might be cubic feet, but if we 
switch to that way of looking at it, we'll make sure that we bridge the gap on 
the difference between the two.
 
But the other
 
comment about cost, I believe you're probably referring to the 
U.S. rumored USPS rate hikes in transportation cost. We're not expecting a 
material impact from these rate changes in 2019. Annual rate increases from 
our transportation partners is a really r
egular occurrence and we negotiate 
hard and we'll always work hard internally to get even more efficient on our 
own shipping method. So, we don't see that as being a huge issue.
 
On wages, of course, we did raise wages and starting November 1 just under 
400
,000 employees, both full
-
time and part
-
time in the U.S. and UK will be 
getting a substantial wage increase. So that is factored 

 
I'm not quantifying 
that today, but it's factored into our Q4 guidance and it will be obviously 
factored into guidance into 2
019.

Great. Thank you very much. Two quick questions. First, can you quantify 
the
 
contribution of PillPack acquisition in the quarter? Maybe help us 
understand the strategy there.
 
And then there is some news, reports suggesting that you guys were 
working on an ad supported video streaming service under the IMDb brand. 
Can you just help
 
shed any more light on that, is that especially relative to 
your Prime Video offering? Thank you very much.
 
Brian T. Olsavsky

Let me start with PillPack. The deal closed in September. So it wasn't a 
material impact on the quarter, but w
e're excited, really excited to start 
working with the management team there. They're very strong. They've 
done a great job building a highly differentiated customer experience, just 
customer

them and innovating with them on how best to meet customer needs over 
time. I'll let Dave handle the second question.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jason Helfstein with 
Oppenheimer & Company. Please proceed.
 
Jason Helfstein 
-
 
Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.
 
Thanks. Two questions. First, I think I may have missed earlier. You gave 
out the 
impact of ASC 606.
 
And then maybe second question, I think what one of the things people are 
trying to think through is you obviously guide to revenue and operating 
income, but as the business is more than 3P and advertising, gross profit is 
now much more 
important and just the way you kind of capture the value 
you provide. So maybe if you can 

 
is there a way to just kind of help us 
kind of foot the perhaps slower revenue growth we're seeing versus what's 
obviously you extracting kind of more value for you
r partners and customers 
and for yourself? Thanks.
 
Dave Fildes 
-
 
Amazon.com, Inc.
 
Yeah. Thanks, Jason. This is Dave. Just quickly on the ASC impact, Brian 
mentioned earlier that of course we've been talking about it all year the 
changing, and the subscript
ion revenue recognition is now straight line. So 
on a comp basis you'd expect to see subscription revenue be about $300 
million lower due to that accounting change.
 
The other piece that we hadn't talked about is the reclass that we gave in 
the past few qua
rters, specifically around the advertising services that have 
moved from Contra COGS into other revenue beginning in 2018. That was 
about $750 million increase to that other sales revenue category here in the 
third quarter.
 
Brian T. Olsavsky 
-
 
Amazon.com, 
Inc.
 
Yeah. And your comment on revenue versus operating income versus 
potentially gross profit, I would say the impact of third
-
party growth and 
we're now 

 
up to 53% of our paid units in the quarter were third
-
party. It's 
steadily been going up. It's up 3
00 basis points year
-
over
-
year. So I think 
the impact on revenue growth rate, since the revenue component of that is 
not as large, is probably something to consider on a year
-
over
-
year period. I 
think it tends to not be as big a factor, sequentially quarte
r
-
over
-
quarter is 
the gradual growth in it. But again, we'll continue to give revenue guidance 
and also operating income to an appropriately conservative level that we've 
tried to maintain over time.

Thanks very much. Just wanted to dig in a little bit on advertising and the 
growth opportunity there. If you can help us on the potential for higher ad 
prici
ng in terms of the ROI for your marketers hopefully being reflected in 
higher price per ad. And then what about the ad load? So are we kind of 
close to being at a full ad load? Is there a long runway there? Just trying to 
get a sense for pricing and volume
 
underneath advertising.
 
And then also along the lines of advertising, heading into the holiday season, 
should we expect any increase in your efforts around Alexa 
commercialization, voice keyword ads let's say, and does that fit into your 
broader advertisi
ng growth strategy? Thanks.
 
Brian T. Olsavsky 
-
 
Amazon.com, Inc.
 
Yeah, let me talk a little bit more broadly about advertising. So yeah, we are 
seeing really strong adoption across a number of groups, Amazon vendors 
and sellers for sure, authors, as well a
s third
-
party advertisers who want to 
reach Amazon customers.
 
As far as penetration, we don't have that quantified for you, but we still 
believe that there is a lot of room to continue to improve the presentation of 
and bringing to our customers new and mo
re relevant purchase options. So 
we're continuing to invent both on the product side, the tools side with our 
goal being improve the usability of the tools for advertisers, make smarter 
recommendations for customers, automate activities so that advertisers
 
don't have to work as hard, and invent new products for advertisers.
 
If we do this right, we think we'll both help advertisers and help Amazon 
consumers at the same time. So I know it doesn't answer the question about 
specific rate increases or capacity, 
but that is the general strategy that we're 
seeing in advertising.
 
Dave Fildes 
-
 
Amazon.com, Inc.
 
Yeah, and this is Dave. Just jumping on the Alexa point, I mean, I think the 
short answer is we don't have any plans to add paid advertising to Alexa. I 
think
 
we clearly had a lot of exciting things happen in the last month or two 
in terms of new announcements in devices out there. And I mean really 
looking at that, the goal is to make customers' lives easier and make it more 
convenient and a lot of that is you
're seeing that in the homes and to some 
extent on the Go. So I think if you look at the recent announcements, you're 
seeing a few things. I mean, one, we're bringing a lot of cool hardware 
options to customers.
 
Second thing, I mean, making the Alexa servi
ce smarter. It's getting 
smarter and more capable. And then also delivering tools for developers, 
helping them build for and really with Alexa. So I think making her smarter 
and seeing that she gets smarter with all the skills, leveraging the cloud and 
AI,
 
becoming more knowledgeable and introducing a lot of really new cool 
new features. So really excited about the customer response with those 
devices and those tools so far and looking forward to doing even more.

Thanks. Wanted to just follow up on the advertising side and get a sense for 
how much you guys feel like you're demand 
constrained versus supply 
constrained, either in the ability to put more ads on your property and/or 
just provide the tools to advertisers and do you feel like there's more 
demand than you can satisfy? Any color you can share there?

Hey, this is Dave. I mean nothing specific. I mean I think so much of what 
we're focused on is making sure that there's a high degree of relevancy and 
usefulness for customers when you look at advertisements that you see on 
the site in particular a
nd how we position those. And so we spent a lot of 
time looking at the data to make sure that customer behavior and feedback 
is telling us that it's useful and helpful and customers making those 
purchase decisions. And so, we're always testing different le
vels of that and 
trying to understand, and the various features, whether it's display or some 
of the sponsored elements that are out there, what kind of feedback is out 
there, but certainly keep that in mind as we roll out new things.

Great. Thanks. I guess two quick ones. Any change in the trajectory of Prime 
membership growth since the June 
price increase? And then, how would you 
describe the pricing environments for the core AWS services? And is this still 
a key lever that you use for business development? Thank you.
 
Brian T. Olsavsky 
-
 
Amazon.com, Inc.
 
Yeah. Sure. Let me start with the Amaz
on Prime price increase. Of course, 
that went into effect earlier the year in May. We're very pleased with the 
renewal data and annual sign up data that we've seen. Since then, program 
remains very strong, both in membership and engagement, and a lot of ou
r 
video content, music and shipping definitely as well as other Prime Benefits. 
We just continue to see that ramp up, not only in the U.S., but in other 
countries.
 
So we do continue to make the Prime offer better as well. I mentioned 
earlier the linkage wi
th Prime member savings at Whole Foods market that 
we set up in Q2, the expansion of grocery delivery to more than 60 cities in 
the U.S. using Prime Now and Whole Foods stores, the ability to pick up 
groceries from Whole Foods. Adding content, we have a gr
eat slate of 
content coming out in the fourth quarter here.
 
Hopefully, you've seen already Jack Ryan and The Romanoffs and pretty 
soon you'll see the follow
-
up season to The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel and also a 
couple other things, and hopefully you'll see Thu
rsday Night Football tonight 
when you get home.
 
Dave Fildes

Amazon.com, Inc.
 
This is Dave. Just on the AWS pricing philosophy. I mean, just a reminder. 
When we look at this, our pricing philosophy has worked relentlessly, take 
cost out of our own cost st
ructure and where we can pass savings on to the 
web services customers in the form of lower prices. So it's easy to lower 
prices, but it's much harder to be able to afford the lower prices and that's 
something we work very hard in all our businesses, inclu
ding AWS to do 
that. So when you look at AWS now, we've lowered prices 67 times since we 
launched, including a few more in the last few months. So those pre
-
OC 
price reductions are a normal part of our business for us.

Tom Szkutak
 
Thanks, Phil.
 
I'll begin with comments on our t
hird quarter financial results. Trailing 12
-
month operating cash flow increased 15% to $5.71 billion. Trailing 12
-
month 
free cash flow increased to $1.08 billion. Trailing 12
-
month capital 
expenditures were $4.63 billion.
 
The increase in capital expenditur
es reflects additional investments in 
support of continued business growth due to investments in technology 
infrastructure including Amazon Web Services and additional capacity to 
support our fulfillment operation.
 
Return on invested capital was 6%, up fro
m 3%. ROIC is trailing 12
-
month 
free cash flow divided by average total assets minus current liabilities 
excluding the current portion of long
-
term debt over five quarter
-
ends. The 
combination of common stock and stock
-
based awards outstanding was 481 
mill
ion shares compared with 475 million one year ago.
 
Worldwide revenue grew 20% to $20.58 billion or 20% excluding the $13 
million favorable impact from year
-
over
-
year changes in foreign exchange.
 
Media revenue increased to $5.24 billion, up 4% or 4% excludi
ng exchange. 
EGM revenue increased to $13.95 billion, up 26% or 26% excluding foreign 
exchange. Worldwide EGM increased to 68% of worldwide sales, up from 
65%. Worldwide paid unit growth was 21%. Active customer accounts was 
approximately 260 million. Worl
dwide active seller accounts were more than 
2 million. Seller units represented 42% of paid units.
 
Now I'll discuss our operating expenses, excluding stock
-
based 
compensation. Cost of sales was $14.63 billion or 71.1% of revenue 
compared with 72.3%. Fulfil
lment, marketing, tech and content and G&A 
combined was $6.09 billion or 29.6% of sales, up approximately 350 basis 
points year
-
over
-
year. Fulfillment was $2.55 billion or 12.4% of revenue 
compared with 11.5%. Tech and content was $2.22 billion or 10.8% of
 
revenue compared with 9.2%. Marketing was $961 million or 4.7% of 
revenue compared with 3.9%.
 
Now I'll talk about our segment results. And consistent with prior periods, 
we do not allocate to segments our stock
-
based compensation or other 
operating expens
e line item.
 
In the North America segment, revenue grew 25% to $12.87 billion. Media 
revenue grew 5% to $2.73 billion. EGM revenue grew 31% to $8.79 billion, 
representing 68% of North America revenues, up from 65%. Other revenue 
grew 40% to $1.34 billion. 
North America segment operating income 
decreased 70% to $88 million, a 0.7% operating margin.
 
In the international segment, revenue grew 14% to $7.71 billion. Excluding 
the $21 million year
-
over
-
year favorable foreign exchange impact, revenue 
growth was 13
%.
 
Media revenue grew 4% to $2.51 billion or 3% excluding foreign exchange 
and EGM revenue grew 20% to $5.16 billion or 19% excluding foreign 
exchange. EGM now represents 67% of international revenues, up from 
64%. International segment operating loss was 
$224 million compared to 
international segment operating loss of $28 million in the prior period.
 
Consolidated segment operating loss was $136 million compared to 
consolidated segment operating income of $267 million in the prior period. 
Consolidated segme
nt operating loss includes charges of approximately $170 
million, primarily related to the Fire phone inventory evaluation and supplier 
commitment cost.
 
Unlike CSOI, GAAP operating income or loss includes stock
-
based 
compensation expense and other operatin
g expense. GAAP operating loss 
was $544 million compared to operating loss of $25 million in the prior 
period.
 
Our income tax benefit was $205 million, GAAP net loss was $437 million or 
$0.95 per diluted share compared with a net loss of $41 million and $0
.09 
per diluted share.
 
Turning to the balance sheet, cash and marketable securities decreased 
$806 million year
-
over
-
year to $6.88 billion. Inventory increased 21% to 
$7.32 billion and inventory turns were 8.9, down from 9.2 turns a year ago, 
as we expande
d selection, improved in
-
stock levels and introduced new 
product categories. Accounts payable increased 18% to $11.81 billion and 
accounts payable days decreased to 74 from 75 in the prior year.
 
I'll conclude my portion of today's call with guidance. Incor
porated into our 
guidance are the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe 
today to be appropriately conservative assumptions.
 
Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by 
many factors, including a high level o
f uncertainty surrounding exchange 
rate fluctuations as well as the global economy and consumer spending. It's 
not possible to accurately predict demand, and therefore our actual results 
could differ materially from our guidance.
 
As we described in more de
tail in our public filings, issues such as settling 
intercompany balances and foreign currencies amongst our subsidiaries, 
unfavorable resolution of legal matters and changes to our effective tax 
rates can all have a material effect on guidance.
 
Our 
guidance further assumes that we don't conclude any additional 
business acquisitions, investments, restructurings or legal settlement, record 
any further revisions to stock
-
based compensation estimates and that 
foreign exchange rates remain approximately w

 
For Q4 2014, we expect net sales of between $27.3 billion and $30.3 billion 
or growth between 7% and 18%. This guidance anticipates approximately 
250 basis points of unfavorable impact from foreign exchange rates. GAAP 
operating
 
income or loss to be between $570 million loss and $430 million 
income compared to $510 million of income in the fourth quarter of 2013. 
This includes approximately $470 million for stock
-
based compensation and 
amortization of intangible assets.
 
We antici
pate consolidated segment operating income or loss, which 
excludes stock
-
based compensation expense and other operating expense to 
be between $100 million loss and $900 million in income compared to $876 
million in income in the fourth quarter of 2013.
 
We 
remain heads
-
down focused on driving a better customer experience 
through price, selection and convenience. We believe putting customers first 
is the only reliable way to create lasting value for shareowners.
 
Thanks. And with that, Phil, let's move to ques
tions.
 
Phil Hardin
 
Great. Thanks, Tom. Let's move on to the Q&A portion of the call.
 
Operator, will you please remind our listeners how to initiate a question?
 
Question

and

Answer Session
 
Operator
 
(Operator Instructions) Thank you. Our first question comes
 
from analyst 
Brian Pitz with Jefferies and Company.
 
Brian Pitz

Jefferies
 
Great thanks. Two quick questions. Can you provide any color on the 
consumer over this year's back
-
to
-
school season and how do you view the 
outlook for the consumer as we head into
 
the holidays?
 
And then separately you recently closed the acquisition of Twitch last month. 
Can you help us understand where does Twitch fit into your overall digital 
content strategy? Thanks.
 
Tom Szkutak
 
Sure, in terms of back
-
to
-
school, certainly the re
sults are reflected in the Q3 
results that you see today. There's a number of different impacts back
-
to
-
school has.
 
One thing I would like to call out, as you look at our North American media 
growth rates one thing that we are seeing is certainly a shift f
rom a text 
book standpoint from purchase to rental and so we see a lot more customers 
renting. So you see that impacting the growth rate a bit the North American 
media.
 
But in terms of Q4 as in any Q4, when we look at it, there is a wide range of 
outcomes.
 
We're giving a wide range of guidance. What we feel good about 
is we have a team that's been improving customer experience over the past 
twelve months.
 
We're very excited to serve customers. We've had a lot of unique selection. 
We've got inventory closer 
to the customers. Many, many different things 
that we're doing on behalf of customers. So we are very excited about the 
holiday season and look forward to serving customers.
 
In terms of Twitch, we're very excited to have Twitch as part of our overall 
team.
 
We've been in video games for quite some time and we think that it's 
a very creative team.
 
They're doing some very innovative things on behalf of their customers and 
our customers and so we're excited to have them, be part of Amazon and 
look forward to wo
rking together with that team.

Thank you. Our next question will come from Carlos Kirjner analyst with 
Bernstein.
 
Carlos Kirjner

Bernstein
 
Thank you for taking my question. Two if I may. International CSOI m
argin 

know. We know you have been investing internationally but has something 
changed fundamentally and if yes, what?
 
Secondly, I wanted to ask you about vast difference in revenue g
rowth rate 
between your international and domestic business. What is fundamentally 
different between the U.S. and your main international markets and is this 
difference fundamental or temporary? Thank you.
 
Tom Szkutak
 
Thank you. Thanks for the 
question. In terms of the consolidated segment or 
the segment operating income, excuse me, for international, certainly versus 
what you'd have seen last quarter some notable changes, one is we're 
certainly getting ready for the holiday season, so as to get
 
ready for the 
holiday season.
 
We are expanding from a capacity standpoint. We do see 
--
 
we've gotten 
great penetration and Fulfilled by Amazon customers. So you'll see that 
actually our growth rate 
--
 
unit growth rate is actually higher than our 
revenue g
rowth rate and so that's what we've been experiencing so certainly 
adding capacity from a fulfillment perspective, adding capacity from a 
infrastructure standpoint. If you look at our overall operating expenses, we 
are certainly investing and with the slow
er growth rate you're not seeing as 
-
-
 
certainly not seeing as much leverage. We understand that we do have to 
get leverage over time, but we are investing right now. We're also investing 
in newer emerging geographies including India and Italy and Spain an
d 
continue to invest in China.
 
And then one other call out, we 
--
 
mentioned in my opening remarks there 
was approximately $170 million impact related to inventory evaluation and 
supplier commitment costs, a vast majority of that was in North America, 
but t
here was about $25 million in international just to let you know that 
that's there.
 
In terms of the growth rate, it has been softer across a number of 
geographies. If you look back over the past really four quarters, we've seen 
a little bit of volatility b
etween the quarters, but it's been softer.
 
We continue to focus on the inputs and we still think international is a very 
big opportunity for us in terms of growth. More recently if you look at the 
growth rate for Q3 and you see the 13% excluding foreign ex
change, you 
may remember on the last call about 90 days ago, I talked about Q2 what 
had happened was we had seen 
--
 
in late Q1 we had seen a ramp up in 
Japan before the consumption tax increase happened on April 1.
 
We saw a pretty sizable drop off in Japan
 
growth rates from Q1 to Q2, which 
brought that down. The only update again is the number of different puts 
and takes by geographies, but the only other comment I would say is that 

som
ething that's there.
 
But in terms of the fundamentals, long term we're very excited about 
international as well as North America. We think it's a big opportunity. We 
continue to focus on the inputs. Some of those inputs are certainly on the 
media side work
ing on the conversion from physical media to digital media.
 
We continue to work on that in a number of different ways. We continue to 
add new selection in those geographies and work on the retail basics and so 
again we're very excited about the opportunity
.

Thank you.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. And our next call will come from analyst Scott Devitt with Stifel.
 
Scott Devitt

Stifel Nicolaus
 
Hey Tom, thanks. I had a question just broadly. A lot of the capital that's 
been deployed in terms
 
of planting seeds and new businesses have worked 
out very well, but given what's happening right now in terms of the 
deterioration in the margin structure as growth is slowing, I am just 
wondering and I think a lot of investors have this question as well 
and in 
terms of when things don't go as anticipated in some of the bigger projects 
where there is not a revenue stream like areas maybe like some of the 
hardware projects and China and other markets, what's the process for 
determining whether to plough ahe
ad or turn back capital and redeploy in 
another areas. Thanks.
 
Tom Szkutak
 
Thanks for the question Scott. With anything new that we do and obviously 
we've done 
--
 
as you mentioned we've done a lot of new things. There is 
certainly a wide range of outcome a
nd we certainly understand that. We try 
to learn from everything that we do as we launch new opportunities and so 
that's something across things that go great and things that don't go as well 
as others. We try to learn from that.
 
And so the way I will desc
ribe it is from a looking forward standpoint we still 
think that we have a lot of opportunities. That said, we need to be very 
selective about what opportunities we pursue and so that's again the way 
we're thinking about it and probably not much more I can
 
add to it than 
that.
 
Scott Devitt

Stifel Nicolaus
 
Okay. Thank you.
 
Tom Szkutak
 
Sure.
 
Operator
 
And we'll continue on to analyst Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets.
 
Mark Mahaney

RBC Capital Markets
 
Two questions please. That $170 million in charges r
elated to the Fire 
phone, where was that put in the P&L and which are the OpEx lines or was it 
a COGS?
 
And then secondly on the media side, you talked about maybe seeing a 
negative impact or definitely seeing a negative impact from the switch 
towards ownin
g to renting. Do you think that's a broader trend beyond just 
text books that affects all media retailers including Amazon? Could that have 
been 
--
 
could that be one of the issues behind the slow media growth in 
international markets and if so, is there re
ally a solution to that other than 
your own rental 
--
 
your own rental models? Thank you.
 
Tom Szkutak
 
Sure. In terms of the first question, the $170 million, it's predominately in 
COGS and so it's the very vast majority than COGS and then in terms of the 
split about 25 million is in international and the remainder is in North 
America.
 
In terms of the growth, we certainly are seeing that in text books. We do 
see another 
-
 
digital media, we're certainly seeing rentals being part for our 
portfolio more than w
e had probably during 
-
 
certainly with physical, but in 
terms of some of the recent growth rates, the one that I called out related to 
book rentals are certainly impacting North American media.
 

e did had some 
things last year Q3 that were overlapping, that were positive in Q3 last year 
from a demand standpoint. One was certainly in physical books we had very 
heavy discounting, which helped our growth in Q3 last year. We're 
overlapping that in Q3 
this year.

Thanks Mark.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. We'll now go to analyst Aram Rubinson with Wolfe Research.
 
Aram Rubinson

Wolfe Research
 
Hey there and thanks for taking my question. Hoping we can go b
ack to 
square one here if you don't mind, can you tell us or remind us what 
financial measures are important to you guys and which financial measures 
do you hold yourselves and the Board hold you accountable to because it's a 
little hard to see any of them
 
making positive progress, so I just would love 
to get back to basics?
 
Tom Szkutak
 
Sure, we're looking at a number of different metrics over a long period of 
time and certainly where our goal is to maximize free cash flow over the 
long term, we don't focus
 
on individual margins, but we do focus on the 
inputs that are going to help drive free cash flow and operating income.
 
We certainly will look at making sure that we're using our capital wisely so 
that over time we get good returns on invested capital and 
we certainly have 
been in several years now of what I would call an investment mode and 
because of the opportunities that we had in front of us.
 
And as I mentioned earlier there is still lots of opportunity in front of us and 
--
 
but we know that we have to
 
be very selective about which opportunities 
we pursue and 
--
 
but we're encouraged by the opportunities that we have.
 
Aram Rubinson 
-
 
Wolfe Research
 
So cash flow and return on invested capital is where we should keep our 
attention.
 
Tom Szkutak
 
Yes.
 
Aram Ru

Wolfe Research
 
Okay. And are the employees in the recruiting side, is that becoming more 
difficult as the stocks has [faded] [ph] a little bit and those return 
characteristics have [faded] [ph], how are you making sure that you're 
hiring the best 
people?
 
Tom Szkutak
 
We have 
--
 
we have processes in place to make sure that we have a very 
high bar on the hiring that we do, the people that we're hiring are 
extraordinarily talented. We're very fortunate to get to work with so many 
talented people here a
nd we've been fortunate to be able to grow that 
employment base to work on the opportunities that we have.

Thank you. And we'll go to analyst Colin Gillis with BGC 
Financial.
 
Colin Gillis

BGC Financial
 
Great. Thanks for taking my question. So just to get back to that North 
American media sales, what's the lowest growth rate in over 20 years 
--
 
are 
there 

 
or 20 quarters, are there other factors beyond the text book
 
shifts 
and sort of the Q3 strength last year? Are the digital media trends still 
intact?
 
Tom Szkutak
 
In terms of the principal drivers 
--
 
it's the two that I mentioned. So it's the 
text books rentals and also overlapping some of the strong discounting and
 
strong titles that we had in some categories. So it's across a number of 
categories within media, but those are the two principle drivers.
 
Colin Gillis 
-
 
BGC Financial
 
And you don't see this as a broader shift in that number?
 
Tom Szkutak
 
No, we're 
--
 
ther
e's still both in terms of North America and international, 
there is certainly a shift that's going on from physical to digital and that's 
something that we're spending a lot of time on and trying to improve the 
experience for customers and we've been able
 
to do that certainly over a 
period of time and so it's something we'll continue to work on.
 
Colin Gillis 
-
 
BGC Financial
 
Okay. Great. Thank you.
 
Tom Szkutak
 
Sure.

Great. Thanks for taking the question. Two please. If you could update us on 
this rotation center rollout, are all 15 online, and I would love to know 

delivery.
 
And 
then the second question, sort of switching gears and just focusing on 
advertising, I believe a pilot was launched or beta was launched for 
Amazon's ad network called CPM Ads I think maybe last August. I am 
wondering if you can provide some commentary ther
e. Thank you.
 
Tom Szkutak
 
Sure, in terms of the sort centers, we'll have over 15 sort centers in the U.S. 
by the end of the year. It's certainly helping us a lot. We have same day 
delivery in 12 cities. We'll have Sunday delivery in approximately 50% of th
e 
population and so we're pleased to do that.
 
And in terms of the ad network, there is a not a lot I can say there.
 
Ron Josey

JMP Securities
 
Okay. Thank you very much.
 
Tom Szkutak
 
Sure.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question will come from analyst Aaron K
essler with 
Raymond James.
 
Aaron Kessler 
-
 
Raymond James
 
Great. Thanks for taking my question. Can you just give us an update 
maybe on your views on original programming? It looked like Transparents 
had some good success. Also just from an 
international standpoint your 
views or may be the growth in China, India as well, are you seeing any 
--
 
signs of any increasing competition in the international, your key 
international markets today? Thank you.
 
Tom Szkutak
 
Sure. In terms of our original co
ntent, we're excited about it. We're investing 
as we talked about. Last quarter we spent approximately $100 million in the 
quarter. Keep in mind that that's expensed in the quarter and so that's 
included in the results that you see in Q3.
 
We're very excite
d about it. We have a number of pilots as well as a number 
of series launched. Transparent you mentioned is one of them. It's gotten 
very good reviews. The streaming on that series has been great. So we're 
very excited about it and we think it's an interes
ting area for customers.
 
We continue to invest heavily in video content including originals and there 
is a number of different metrics we're looking at certainly from a prime 
standpoint, but what we're seeing so far are those customers who are 
streaming ar
e renewing at considerably higher rates at considerably higher 
rates at a rate that's already high.
 
So we like what we see there. When customers come in for new trials and 
they 
--
 
free trials and they engage from a video content standpoint, we see 
the conv
ersion being higher. So we see that we're adding new prime 
members as a result of that and when those prime members, when those 
new prime members become prime members, the other thing we're seeing is 
they're buying physical product, which is a great impact
 
for us.
 
We see very similar patterns in terms of how much physical product that 
they're purchasing from us and so we're still certainly in investment mode 
there, but we like what we see and we have a long way to go there, but 
we're concentrating on buildi
ng great service and we see that customers are 
rewarding us with engagement on the content, both original and licensed 
and they're buying more from us on the physical side and becoming prime 
members when they do and have been doing at higher rates.
 
So thos
e are the some of the early signs and we will continue to monitor 
very closely, but we're excited about what we're seeing there.
 
In terms of some of the international comments and I would say this for not 
just international, but I would say it for the U.S.
 
as well, one thing that's not 
new is it's a very competitive environment. We have a lot of competitors 
both online and offline. That's not anything that's new. We used to operate 
in that environment.
 
We've been in that environment for really for 19 years 
and so 
--
 
but we're 
seeing a lot of competition and again that's not new.

Goldman Sachs
 
Gre
at. Thanks. Last quarter you mentioned that the AWS business saw a 
90% increase in volume. I was wondering if you could give us a sense of 

 
And then in the highlight section of the release, the first six bullet points o
r 
so that you have there are all related to the hardware side of the business. if 
you can just sort of give us now that you have a little bit more time on the 
hardware side of the business, but behind if you can give us a sense of what 
you're learning in t
his category and where you think Amazon's long term 
position in hardware is ultimately going to be.
 
Tom Szkutak
 
In terms of AWS, we're 
--
 
we saw a very good growth in Q3 as well. From a 
usage standpoint it's very similar to Q2, close to 90% and so the team
 
is 
doing just a fantastic job.
 
You can see our other revenue in North America went up a little bit 
sequentially and AWS is certainly the largest piece of that and is the vast 
majority of it and they're growing at a faster rate than that other line item.
 
S
o again the team is doing a fantastic job and not only serving customers, 
but launching many, many new features and services and you can see some 
of the detail on that in the Highlight section of our release today. So we're 
very excited about it.
 
In terms 
of devices, I can't speculate what we would do going forward, but 
we just launched a number of new tablets and e
-
readers that were excited 
about and there is some really great price point for customers on the tablet 
side.
 
We also launched a kid's tablet wh
ich is the first time we've launched. We've 
launched some new kindles including our premium kindle and it's a terrific 
product. We think it's the best kindle we've made to date for sure and so 
we're very excited about that. And we're excited to have these 
offerings for 
customers.

Hi Tom. You mentioned that you need to get leverage at 
some point. In the 
last call you also said something similar, but can you help us quantify the 
timing that in your internal modeling when do you expect to see more 
meaningful leverage and when you look at your three to five year's outlook, 
what does your l
everage picture look like there and then also can you 
remind us of what your philosophy of stock buybacks is and what would it 
take to get you back in the market, thanks?
 
Tom Szkutak
 
In terms of leverage, beyond the guidance that we're giving today, there 
is 
not a lot of certainly I can give you, but again what I had mentioned earlier 
is we do have a lot of opportunities, but our job is to be judicious and 
selective about what opportunities we pursue.
 
And so that's the way we're thinking about it and I apol
ogize I can't give you 
any more certainty in terms of timing, but certainly that's the way we're 
thinking about it.
 

authorization to do that. I certainly can't comment on what price po
ints we

Thank you. We'll continue on to analyst Justin Post with Merrill Lynch.
 
Justin Post

Merrill Lynch
 
Great. Thank you. If you look at the phone impact in Q3, it seems to explain 
some of the differ
ence versus the Street, but when you look forward to Q4, 

profits maybe below some expectations.
 
Is the phone having an impact on profits in Q4 as well? And also when you 
think about th
e Q4 guidance are there any events or things you want to call 
out? Are you being especially conservative in Q4 giving recent trends? 
Anything different this year on holiday? Thank you.
 
Tom Szkutak
 
Yes. In terms of the holiday season just and if you look ba
ck the last several 

quarter, always challenging to predict precisely where we're going to be. So 
in terms of a dollar range I gave us $3 billion range last year.
 
I am giving a $3 billio
n range again this year from a revenue perspective 
again wide range. At the higher end of the range, excluding foreign 
exchange, it's approximately 21%. So it's a little bit higher than what we 
saw in Q3 and then you can see we're on the low end of the ran
ge.
 
In terms of 
--
 
but in terms of the season itself, we're very excited about it. 
And in terms of to serve customers, we feel great about the selection that 
we have added and are continuing to add for the holiday season.
 
We think from an operations standp
oint each year we try to get better and 
we believe we'll be even better this year than we have had in previous 
years. And so we are super excited to serve customers.
 
In terms of the phone, the only other thing that I can comment on is at the 
end of Q3, we 
had approximately $83 million worth of inventory on hand. 
And so I can't comment on how that would impact guidance or not, but 
that's the amount of inventory we had on hand at the end of Q3.

Great. Thanks. Just a couple of questions. We saw that Amazon Fresh 
expanded into Brooklyn recently. Just wondering if we can discu
ss your 
decision to expand into New York City and how we should think about 
timings for expansion into other markets and then if you can update us on 
the number of fulfillment centers globally and in the year that would be 
great. Thank you.
 
Tom Szkutak
 
Sur
e, in terms of the number of fulfillment centers it's 13 net for the year 
and then on as I mentioned earlier in the U.S. we'll have 15 sort centers by 
the end of more than 14, excuse me, more than 15 sort centers by the end 
of the year.
 
In terms of, 
sorry the other part of the question was on Fresh, the team is 
doing a great job from a customer experience standpoint. As you can see 
we're in a few cities. Today, the team is just heads down focused on making 
sure that experience is great for customers. 
We continue 
--
 
customers like 
the service.
 
So we're seeing good pick up there and as you mentioned, we're expanding 
in the Brooklyn. I can't speculate on what we do beyond the cities that we 
have launched today, but we're excited about what we're seeing so
 
far 
there.

Thanks for taking the question. Tom you guys put thorough a price increase 
on the prime services here. Was curious what you were seeing in 
terms of 
the impact of that price increase on both the rate of adding people into 
Prime and the ability to control churn inside the Prime subscription base in 
general.
 

done this year
 

maybe put in another price increase through next year. Thanks.
 
Tom Szkutak
 

a price point since our initiation of, excuse me,
 
since the launch of Prime. Its 
$79 and so it took us long time and we were very careful with that to 
increase it to $99.
 
But since we've increased to $99 we've had 
--
 
we've had great retention. 
We're very pleased with the 
--
 
the retention we've had from c
ustomers. The 
program is growing very fast. We're very excited about it and so we do think 

over the long term.
 
You're correct in that we're investing in Prime in a number of differe
nt ways 
including video content as I talked about earlier that is certainly the way 
we'll get a return on that investment. Principally will be customers buying 
more including and especially physical products.
 
So again we're very excited about Prime globall
y.

Thanks for taking my questions. I have two please. The first one, fulfillment 
ex stock based comp was the highest it's ever been as a percentage of gross 
profit in the 
third quarter, can you just talk about the drivers of that? Is that 
for rotations centers or international growth, what's driving that?
 
And then as we think about this rotation centers, what's the impact of those 
over the next few quarters to fulfillment? 
Are they do they take a while to 
kind of get the inefficiencies out of the system like a standard DC would?
 
Tom Szkutak
 
Yes, in terms of fulfillment cost, you're right. Again we're adding 13 net 
fulfillment centers where we added 
--
 
we'll have over 15 sort
 
centers at the 
end of the year. certainly one of the drivers for that is certainly the growth 
that we are experiencing, but in addition to that, what we're seeing is the 
FBA adoption continues to get better and if we get further penetrated with 
sellers ad
opting full by Amazon, we think that's really good for sellers and 
for us and for customers over the long term.
 
And what you're seeing is we're several years ago in terms of performance 
center planning we were adding less of them and it was much closer to 
the 
holiday season. With the sheer amount of capacity that we're adding, you're 
seeing more of that come in even before Q4.
 
So you're seeing that impacting us earlier and the benefit of coming in 
earlier is we get to serve customer and get up to the produc
tivity rates that 
we want to, to serve customers in Q4, by having that capacity in a bit earlier 
than in the past.
 

in earlier than certainly historically we've been able to do.

Thanks so much for taking my questions. First Prime launched a referral fee 
recently and I am wondering if we should take t
hat as any indication that the 
membership growth has slowed or you're seeing some higher churn and how 
does that referral fee get accounted for.
 
And then secondly, Target launched free shipping with no hurdle for the 
holidays versus your $35 hurdle, I am 
just wondering what your willingness 
is to leave that competitive gap during the holidays, thanks.
 
Tom Szkutak
 
Yes, can't comment from a competitive standpoint what we might or might 
do there, but in terms of the Prime referral fee, no, you should not read
 
into 

 

because they like Prime to be able to refer others we think is great for us 
and so I can't actually maybe offline
 
you can follow
-
up with Phil or Dave on 
the accounting. Top of my head, I can't remember how that's working, but I 
know they will be able to answer it for you.

Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, our
 
final question will come from 
Colin Sebastian with Robert W. Baird.
 
Colin Sebastian

Robert W. Baird
 
Great. Thanks. Good afternoon. A couple of follow
-
ups. First off in terms of 
the Q4 revenue guide, are you giving any consideration to that forecast to 
s
ome of the shipping issues that happened last holiday and the ability of 
your shipping partners to manage your growth.
 
And then secondly on paid units, can you provide a splits or color between 
physical and digital unit growth. Thanks.
 
Tom Szkutak
 
In terms
 
of 
--
 
in terms of the guidance it reflects all of the assumptions that 
we think could happen for the quarter. So again it's a wide range to speak 
specifically to some of the issues last year. The team again 
--
 
we continue 
trying to learn from everything t
hat we do and the team has done a great 
job learning from our experiences, coming out of Q4 last year as we do 
every year and are excited to serve customers.
 
In terms of the unit growth, there is not I can add in terms of split other 
than the overall 
--
 
ot
her than the overall growth rate, but we are 
--
 
we are 
pleased with certainly we're seeing good customer growth, sellers are 
--
 
we're doing we think a great job for sellers. We continue to add a lot of 
unique selection throughout the year in terms of and w
e have customers.
 
We see FBA four sellers getting further, further penetrated. We've launched 
some interest in products for our customers. We think our web services 
team is doing a great job.
 
We realize that we have a lot of opportunities, but we need to b
e selective 
on which opportunities we pursue and I think beyond that, we're just overall 
excited and again ready for the holiday season.
 
So anyway thanks everybody for calling in today.
 
Phil Hardin
 
Thank you for joining us today on the call and for your qu
estions. A replay 
will be available on our Investor Relations website at least through the end 
of the quarter. We appreciate your interest in Amazon.com and look forward 
to talking with you again next quarter.
 
Operator
 
And again, ladies and gentlemen, that
 
does conclude today's conference. 
Thank you all again for your participation. You may now disconnect.

enior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
 
Thanks, Darin. I'll begin with comments on our second quarter financial 
results. Trailing 12
-
month operating cash flow increased 42% to $12.7 
billion. Trailing 12
-
month free cash flow increased to $7.3 billi
on, up from 
$4.4 billion. Trailing 12
-
month free cash flow less lease principal repayments 
increased to $3.9 billion, up from $2.4 billion. Trailing 12
-
month free cash 
flow less finance lease principal repayments and assets acquired under 
capital leases in
creased to $2.5 billion, up from an outflow of $492 million. 
Worldwide revenue increased 31% to $30.4 billion or 30%, excluding the 
$166 million favorable impact from year
-
over
-
year changes in foreign 
exchange. Worldwide paid unit growth was 28%. Worldwide
 
seller units 
represented 49% of paid units.
 
Now I'll talk about our segment results. North America revenue grew 28% to 
$17.7 billion. North America operating income was $702 million, a 4% 
operating margin compared with $348 million in the prior year. This
 
includes 
$5 million of favorable impact from foreign exchange. International revenue 
grew 30% to $9.8 billion. Excluding the $184 million year
-
over
-
year 
favorable foreign exchange impact, revenue growth was 28%.
 
International operating loss was $135 milli
on compared with the loss of $189 
million in the prior year. This includes $40 million of favorable impact from 
foreign exchange.
 
Amazon Web Services' revenue grew 58% to $2.9 billion. Amazon Web 
Services' operating income was $718 million, a 24.9% operati
ng margin 
compared with $305 million in the prior year.
 
Our operating income was $1.3 billion or 4.2% of revenue, up approximately 
220 basis points year
-
over
-
year. This includes $45 million of favorable 
impact from foreign exchange. Net income was $857 mil
lion or $1.78 per 
diluted share compared with a net income of $92 million or $0.19 per diluted 
share.
 
I'll conclude my portion of today's call with guidance. For Q3 2016, we 
expect net sales of between $31 billion and $33.5 billion or growth of 
between 22%
 
and 32%. This guidance anticipates approximately 30 basis 
points of favorable impact from foreign exchange rates.
 
Operating income to be between $50 million and $650 million compared with 
$406 million in third quarter 2015. We're grateful to our customers
 
and 
remain heads
-
down focused on driving a better customer experience. We 
believe putting customers first is the only reliable way to create lasting value 
for shareholders. Thanks.
 
And with that, I'll hand it back to Darin.

Director, Head o
f Investor Relations, Amazon
 
Thank you, Brian. Before we move to questions, I need to remind you that 
our guidance incorporates the order trends that we've seen to date and what 
we believe to be appropriate assumption. Our results are inherently 
unpredicta
ble and may be materially affected many factors, including 
fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions 
and customer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, 
online commerce and cloud services and the var
ious factors detailed in our 
filings with the SEC.
 
Our guidance also assumes that we don't conclude any additional business 
acquisitions, investments, restructurings or legal settlements and that 
foreign exchange rates remain approximately where they have 
been 
recently. It is not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and 
services and, therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our 
guidance.
 
With that, let's move to the Q&A portion of the call. Operator, please remind 
our listen
ers how to initiate a question.

Answer Session
 
Operator
 
At this time, we will now open the call up for questions. In the interest of 
time, we ask that you limit yourself to one question. [Operation Instructions] 
Thank you. Our first question i
s from Mark May of Citi. Please proceed.

Thanks for taking my question. We've noticed some data points out there 
that suggest that you're kind of accelerating your build
-
out of fulfillment 
capacity in N
orth America and obviously also in India. Can you give us a 
sense of what sort of impact that, that might have in the near to mid
-
term 
on your CapEx, depreciation and ultimately CSOI, especially as it relates to 
your Q3 guidance? And then just kind of a ma
intenance question, how much 
is FX impacting your Q3 guidance? Thanks.
 
Brian T. Olsavsky 
-
 
Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
 
Okay. Thanks, Mark. Yeah, let me talk a little bit about guidance and I'll 
incorporate the answer to the 
fulfillment question. So, you'll notice on the 
top line guidance of $31 billion to $33.5 billion or 22% to 32% growth 
incorporates the Prime Day results and I can talk more about that later. But 
Prime Day was very successful for us. It was up 60% on a worl
dwide basis 
over the prior year, and it was also a record day for our Amazon devices, as 
well as sellers and customers alike.
 
In the bottom line, you'll need to remember that Q3 is a typically a lower 
operating income quarter as we prepare for Q4, the holi
day peak. It's a little 
bit more exaggerated this year in that we're opening 18 fulfillment centers 
this quarter. To put that in perspective, we launched six in Q3 of last year. 
This will bring us up to 21 net FCs for the year by the end of Q3 and that 
com
pares with 10 fulfillment centers for the first three quarters of last year 
on a net basis. So, why are we expanding so much? If you remember back 
to Q4 and the capacity constraints we had in Q4, primarily due to really 
strong FBA growth, we talked a lot i
n the Q4 call about the operational cost 
of that in Q4. Customers well taken care of, but we had additional fulfillment 
costs from being so tight on capacity.
 
This year, with that in mind and then knowing that our growth rate is 
actually accelerating on a 
unit basis, we are 

 
Q2 was 28% unit growth for 
paid units, but fulfilled by 

 
units Fulfilled by Amazon is much higher than 
that due to the growth of Prime and FBA. That compares with last year in Q2 
when we saw 22% unit growth, so we're 600 basis points 
faster growth in 
Q2 this year than last year and that 22% last year turned into 26% in Q4. 
So it ramped up in the back end of the year.
 
So a lot of data points there, but the bottom line is that there's a large step 
up in the amount of fulfillment capacity
 
in Q2 

 
excuse me, Q3 versus Q2. 
There's a couple of other factors while I'm at it for guidance. We are also 
nearly doubling our content spend in the second half of this year versus the 
second half of 2015. We have a great slate of new Amazon Originals co
ming 
out later this year, both in the U.S. and internationally. And we're nearly 
tripling our number of new Amazon Original shows 

 
TV shows and movies 
compared with the second half of last year.
 
There are other investments certainly that are increasing se
quentially. I'd 
point to India and AWS, but primarily the two biggest issues in Q3 guidance 
I would say are the operational ramp and also the increase in digital content 
spend.

And, Mark, to follo
w up on the other question, our net sales guidance 
anticipates approximately 30 basis points of favorable impact from foreign 
exchange rates.

And, Brian, where does that bring your video content spend t
o with the 
doubling in the second half if we look at it on an annualized basis?

Thanks for taking the questions. I just want to go back to Prime Day for a 
minute. I didn't hear any commentary around n
ew Prime members in 
particular. Obviously a lot of other metrics that you gave but hoping you 
could provide a little bit more color around that. And then also, is there 
anything else that kind of stood out in terms of what you learned around 
operations and
 
systems ahead of the holiday season? And then just going 
back to the 3Q guide, what's the right way for us to think about stock
-
based 
comp in the third quarter? And if we looked at your 2Q numbers, is that kind 
of a fair assumption for what you're thinkin
g about? Thanks.

Sure. Let me circle back on Prime Day. So again, it was the biggest global 
day ever for Amazon and was up 60% on a order product sales basis versus 
Prime Day 2015. It wa
s a record day for Amazon devices. It was a great day 
for small businesses and sellers who saw great year
-
over improvement in 
their sales. And more importantly, it was a great day for customers. Globally 
they saved over double what they had saved in Prime 
Day 2015. So we're 
very pleased with the results of Prime Day, and the impact of Prime Day is 
factored into this guidance. As far as new customers and new Prime 
members, we're not disclosing that, but suffice to say that it was a great day 
for both existin
g Prime members and also new customers who were trying 
us out for the first time.

year, we began allocating stock

based comp
ensation and other operating 
expense to our North America, international and AWS segments. So we're 
including that in our guidance on operating income and have not separately 
guided to stock

Hey. Good afternoon. First, love the conference call format here. Get right to 
it. In terms of questions, the customer count, can you give us a little bit of 
guidanc
e on that? And then also talk about the theme of automated 
consumption and separately, the importance of Prime Now and how you can 
kind of grow those SKUs. Thanks.
 
Darin Manney

Director, Head of Investor Relations, Amazon
 
Hi, Gene. This is Darin. I'll st
art with the customer accounts. As we noted 
again in our Q1 release, our active customer accounts exceeded 300 million. 
However, today we're not going to update that number.
 
Brian T. Olsavsky

Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
 
To your question on Prime Now, so I will point out Prime Now is now in more 
than 40 metro areas worldwide. In the past quarter we expanded further 
internationally to Germany, Spain and France, so it's a global program, 
again, offering free two
-
hour deliver
y on tens of thousands of items. We also 
have in the same vein of, I think what you called maybe automated 
consumption, the same day has expanded. Now we've added 11 metro 
areas, bringing the total to 27 metro areas that are qualified for same day. 
So, yea
h, we think this is an important part of our Prime offering. We know 
customers love it. We're very happy with their order patterns from Prime 
Now, and very happy with it. Of course, we do always talk about 

 
we 
always usually get asked about profitability 
and it is a very hard service to 
deliver and make money on, but we know customers love it and we're in a 
great position to do this because of our long
-
term approach, our drive of 
greater efficiencies and our proximity to the customer with our vast global 
F
C network.

Our next question comes from Heath Terry from Goldman Sachs.
 
Heath Terry

Goldman Sachs & Co.
 
Great. Thanks. I was wondering as it relates to the Q3 guidance, can you 
give us a bit of a sense of just how we should think about margins i
n the 
AWS business, especially as the next eight availability zones roll out? 
Presumably that kind of increase in capacity likely has an impact on margins, 
but would appreciate sort of any direction you can share on how to think 
about that.
 
Brian T. Olsavs
ky 
-
 
Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
 
Sure. We don't give 

 
obviously we don't give segment
-
based guidance. But 
to your question about AWS, we actually see nine availability zones in four 
regions coming out in the next 

 
in the coming year
. The impact on short
-
term is pretty much indistinguishable from the growth that we're seeing in 
our expansion of our base customers in our existing regions, so we don't see 
a large step
-
up from the addition of new regions relative to the large and 
rapid g
rowth in the business itself.
 
We do think that it does pay benefits both for ourselves and for our 
customers because of the expansion, and we're happy to have added the 
region in Mumbai this past quarter. We think when we expand 
geographically, existing cu
stomers will run more of their workloads on AWS. 
Sometimes they have local latency concerns or security issues that require 
them to run things in their country, so that helps. And we also open up to 
new customers when we add these regions. So not a large i
mpact on Q3 
guidance, but certainly an exciting investment for our customer base.

Our next question comes from Carlos Kirjner with Bernstein.
 
Carlos Kirjner

Neto

Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC
 
Thank you. Two questions if I may. As I look at your
 
tech and content 
expense as a percentage of revenues, we see year
-
on
-
year decline for the 
last two quarters, which is something we hadn't seen since mid
-
2010, and of 
course it's reflected in the AWS margins. Can you help us understand what 
has driven this
 
significant change in relative trajectory in tech and content 
expenses? And the second question is, why is it that the rate at which you 
are deploying Prime Now is so much greater or faster than the rate at which 
you are deploying Fresh? What's different 
between them and how is it that 
you are deploying Fresh in new markets but not as fast as Prime Now, and 
what drives the difference? Thank you.
 
Brian T. Olsavsky 
-
 
Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
 
Sure. On tech and content, that's going to
 
be a combination of our people 
cost related to many areas of the website and also the infrastructure cost to 
run it, at both the Amazon Web Services and also the Amazon site. We've 
been seeing some great efficiencies in our infrastructure, both internally
 
as 
Amazon and also as part of AWS. We have great people working on not only 
better efficiency, but also driving cost out of our acquisition prices. So, 
there's a lot of great work going on there and I think that's what you're 
seeing reflected in the tech 
and content line. Again, this can fluctuate 
quarter
-
to
-
quarter, but we're happy with the current trend and you see it in 
the AWS margins.
 
On Prime Now versus Fresh, they are separate 

 
sorry. The 

 
we'll point out 
in Q2 that we added London and Boston as t
wo new sites in London for 
AmazonFresh, and that was the first international location. But we've been 
running AmazonFresh for seven years, or excuse me, since 2007 in Seattle 
and what you've seen as we've been testing the model, we've been 
expanding in Nor
th America and more so we've been expanding within the 
cities that we're in, adding zip codes, adding additional customers. So, the 
move into Boston and also now into London give us some really good data 
points and as 

 
it's a great customer feature for th
e Prime offering.
 
Prime Now is a little bit easier to build up from scratch, I would say. The 

 
it 
has a different purpose, although some of the products overlap. Again, this 
is more about immediacy of one
-
hour and two
-
hour delivery of a curated list 
of im
portant products that people need in a short period of time. So, they 
have different roles. Some of the products overlap, of course, but we're 
happy with both, and we think that customers like both of them.

Brian Nowak

Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. The first one is on the Echo. 
Anything you could share at all on some of the most commonly used 
searches? How are consumers using the Echo as of now most 
commonly? 
And then anything on uplift in purchase behavior from Echo households? And 
the second one on Prime, on AWS margins, can you just walk us through 
some of the puts and takes that have been driving the AWS margin 
expansion we've seen in the first ha
lf of this year? Is it utilization, product 
mixes? What's been driving the margin expansion? Thanks.
 
Brian T. Olsavsky 
-
 
Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
 
Sure. Well, in Echo, again, we continue to build out the list of devices, 
launching t
he Dot and Tab and Fire TV skills this past year. And now we 
have 1,900 third
-
party skills for the Alexa, including new skills from Kayak, 
Lyft, NBC, Honeywell and more. So there's a lot of uses that we're seeing for 
Echo. A lot ties into our Prime Music o
ffering. It's just a great way to access 
Prime Music and more and more the Amazon site. We don't have anything to 
disclose on physical orders from 

 
through 

 
excuse me, orders through 
Echo.
 
On Amazon Web Services margin, again, this is primarily due to ef
ficiencies 
gained on our infrastructure, better utilization, better cost out. There is a 

 
certainly a mix of products and services. I don't have a bridge for you on 
whether that's helpful or hurtful, but the 

 
these margins in AWS will 
fluctuate from quar
ter
-
to
-
quarter, and that's what you're seeing. But we're 
very happy with the year

over

year improvement.

Next question is from Mark Mahaney from RBC Capital Markets.
 
Mark Mahaney

RBC Capital Markets LLC
 
Okay. Hey, Brian, could you give us 
some wise as to the revenue growth 
acceleration that you're seeing, a little more color about the revenue growth 
acceleration in North American retail and in international retail? I remember 
last quarter you called out really starting to see, kind of I don
't know, critical 
mass tipping point, whatever the buzzword is, from Prime and from FBA in 
international markets. Is that what's continuing, I assume, to kind of drive 
that re
-
acceleration? And any geographic country comments behind that? 
Thanks a lot.
 
Bri
an T. Olsavsky 
-
 
Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
 
Sure. Yeah, I have the same buzzwords for you, Mark. It's really the 
flywheel of Prime is definitely working. It's simple as that. The low prices, 
vast selection and convenience continue to
 
resonate with customers. Prime 
membership increases and selection through FBA makes Prime more 
valuable. So it's a bit as simple as that in the consumer business in North 
America and international, we are seeing great acceptance of Prime and 
usage of Prim
e benefits. We continue to expand the list of Prime benefits for 
customers to make it more valuable, and none is more valuable than FBA, 
which we've talked a lot about the value of Prime to FBA and vice
-
versa.
 
FBA is bringing more Prime
-
eligible selection 
to Prime and then the growth 
of Prime and the type of customers that utilize Prime and their buying 
behavior is a great traction for other FBA sellers. So that is essentially what 
we're seeing, and we're certainly pleased with the customer response to 
thos
e offers globally.

Our next question comes from Youssef Squali from Cantor Fitzgerald.
 
Youssef Squali

Cantor Fitzgerald Securities
 
Thank you. Two questions, please. Brian, your operating income has been 
come in stronger than expectations, but mo
re importantly, stronger than 
your own guidance, at least in the last couple of quarters. I was just 
wondering as you look back at where you guided relative to actual, where do 
you think that delta was most pronounced? Why wouldn't we assume that 
maybe, at
 
least on the margin, the investment intensity in the business has 
maybe decelerated a bit?
 
And second, on Prime Video, just was wondering, considering what the main 
competitor there is doing, i.e., expanding aggressively around the world, you 
guys have be
en growing in a more measured manner, is that still the plan or 
are you guys interested in maybe instead of moving into a few countries, 
kind of expand globally in one fell swoop? That's it. Thanks.
 
Brian T. Olsavsky 
-
 
Senior Vice President and Chief Finan
cial Officer
 
Sure. Let me start with the second question first. So on Prime Video, again 
we're very happy with the customer adoption of Prime Video, and we know 
the customers love it. We like the results that we see, particularly with the 
free trial conver
sion, the renewal rates for subscriptions. So it's clearly 
working. I mentioned earlier how we're doubling the investment rate in the 
second half of the year versus last year's second half, and we're tripling the 
Amazon Originals content.
 
That Originals co
ntent for TV and movies, that content can be used globally. 
We've talked a bit about our Prime launch in India, and alluded to the fact 
that we'll be having video soon in India, but local content and also Amazon 
Originals. So, stay tuned for that. I don't 
have any more to announce on 
that today. On the variance to guidance, what I'll say is, we came in the 
very high end of our revenue guidance. I would say that our business model 
usually reacts well to high volume as we get a really good leverage on our 
fix
ed expenses. So that's part of what we saw, very strong operating 
efficiencies as we hit essentially the highest end of our revenue guidance.
 
But we do have a lot of diverse profit streams here at Amazon and a lot of 
investments going on at any point in ti
me. I think I heard a question there 
about level of investment. We continue to invest heavily. In fact, I just called 
out a few things that are going to be stepping up in investment levels in Q3, 
mostly ops and digital content. So we continue to invest on 
behalf of 
customers. But we also work very hard at efficiencies and scaling the 
businesses that we have. So we take both roles very seriously around here, 
investing on the right 

 
in the right things, seeing results on behalf of 
customers, and also driving
 
efficiencies. And there can be timing, quarter
-
to
-
quarter, the operating margin and levels of investment can fluctuate, but 
certainly continue to expand.

Helfstein, your line is l

Ray Mcdonough

Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)
 
Hi. Sorry about that. This is Ray McDonough on for Jason Helfstein. Just on 
the AWS side, we've been hearing a lot of talk and especially a lot of media 
reports that larger customers tend to use AWS, th
ey might use Google and 
Microsoft Azure in tandem in sort of a multi
-
cloud kind of architecture. Just 
wondering your thoughts on how you see AWS fitting in the overall 
ecosystem and kind of your place longer term in the ecosystem.
 
Brian T. Olsavsky 
-
 
Senio
r Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
 
Sure. Well, first of all, we believe customers will choose AWS primarily for 
three factors, the functionality and pace of innovation that we bring to the 
table, our partner and customer ecosystem and our experie
nce. We've been 
in this business longer than anyone. Having said that, there are room 

 
there's plenty of room for multiple vendors in this business. What we focus 
on is innovating on behalf of customers and expanding the geographic 
footprint to make our s
ervices more widely available.
 
You can see us continue to invest in things like new application services, 
higher up the stack, additional technologies that will make integrating with 
AWS seamless for those companies that have a hybrid IT environment and 
th
en continuing to add functionality for data analytics, mobile, Internet of 
things, machine learning offerings, things like that, that will add greater and 
greater value for AWS customers. And I would say the rapid pace of 
innovation continues to stretch ou
r lead in that dimension. We have had 422 
new significant services and features added in the first half of this year. 
That's a faster pace than last year when we added 722 services and 
features. So we feel good about the business position we're in and our 
position with customers.

Colin A. Sebastian

Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)
 
Okay. Thanks, guys. As another follow up on the margins, I was hoping you 
could comment on any im
pact from the investments and build out of 
enhanced transportation capabilities including the air cargo leases. And then 
secondly, was hoping you could identify any categories within EGM that are 
becoming more meaningful drivers of growth or at least are a
n increasing 
focus on the retail side? Thank you.
 
Brian T. Olsavsky 
-
 
Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
 
Yeah, sure. First, on EGM, I'll just say the growth is across a lot of different 
products, none to exactly call out here, and we think t
hat a lot of it is, of 
course, driven by the growth of Prime itself. EGM in North America grew 
32%, which was higher than the revenue growth rate, and also grew 36% 
internationally. So when people join Prime, they are certainly buying EGM in 
strong quantit
y. So that continues to grow with the growth of the Prime 
program.
 
On transportation, I think your question was about whether that's impacting 
our short
-
term results. No. The answer is no. We are certainly expanding our 
service offerings in the transportat
ion side and we have been for many 
years, things like sortation centers and delivery methods. The plane deal 
that we were talking about is essentially planes that we're going to be 
leasing from other companies, and you'll hear more about that as we go 
forw
ard, but that is to essentially take on the demand for internal flights as 
we move product around. It certainly will be well utilized.

Our next question comes from Brian Pitz from Jefferies.
 
Brian J. Pitz 
-
 
Jefferies LLC
 
Thanks for the questions. First, on FC build out, is the cost of building 
centers scaling over time given the use of Kiva, other technologies or 
general learnings, or are those costs still relatively consistent? And also, we 
noticed some device sellout in 
the next four to five weeks, post
-
Prime Day. 
Was this a bit of a planned inventory reduction for some of the devices or 
did volumes take you by surprise here?
 
Brian T. Olsavsky 
-
 
Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
 
I will start with the secon
d question. So I would just say Prime Day had 
enormous impact on the device business and devices were well featured and 
also well adopted by customers. So it was the largest device sales day that 
we've ever had and essentially pretty much across all of our
 
device types, E
-
readers, tablets, Fire TV and Echo.
 
And I'm sorry. Your first question was around 

 
the cost of fulfillment 
centers. Not disclosing that we do continue to change our fulfillment centers. 
We've changed, again, the automation, the size, the 
scale many times and 
we continue to learn and grow there. So no general trends I can point to on 
cost per fulfillment center to start up because they do vary in size and 
mission and some have fully outfitted in using Amazon Robotics, others 

 
some don't fo
r economic reasons. Maybe the volume is not perfect for robot 
volume. But yeah. But, yes, so I can't give you any real distinct trends 
there.

We've
 
tailored programs to students. We've tailored video programs. We've 
rolled out monthly plans. We have plans with grocery delivery. So there's a 
lot of different flavors of Prime and we are aggressively looking for a perfect

Thanks, guys. I just had two. First as a follow up on the logistics topic. So, in 
addition to the cargo planes you just mentioned for in

network moving 
products around, you guys have registered and received a 
U.S. Maritime 
license to operate as a freight forwarder and you recently announced this 
partnership with the UK for drone delivery that you've been working for a 
couple years. So I guess at a high level, can you just talk about the overall 
logistics strate
gy is evolving from trucks and fulfillment centers to 
incorporate some of these new methods and how that might impact your 
unit costs going forward?
 
And then the second question's on AWS. So you continue to put up really 
strong results. And you guys obviou
sly talk to a lot of customers across lots 
of different verticals. Just a high level, what percent of enterprise workloads 
do you think have shifted to the public cloud at this stage? Is it low

single 
digit to mid

single

digit? And any color there on where
 
we are in terms of 
penetration in the space. Thank you.

So thank you, Ross. This is Darin. Let me take that first question on Prime 
Air in the UK, we've been working with and developing Prime Air
 
for some 
time to develop a rapid delivery system that is safe, environmentally sound 
and it really enhances the services that we provide for millions of customers. 
And we're extremely happy to partner with the UK government to advance 
the safe use of dron

permission to trial new methods in the space, including beyond line
-
of

sight 
operation, sense

avoid technologies and flights where one person 
operates multiple drones.

sure we sort of can understand the trajectory, is there any way to frame it

and the way we're 
approaching China as a way to 

 
a trusted avenue for our Chinese customers 
to access authentic international brands and we'll focus on those global 
brands and bringing those to Chinese customers. Offeri
ngs like the Amazon 
Global Store where Chinese customers can access those international brands 
on the China website and have them shipped directly to their houses is 
something we're focused on. So, yeah, it's still early days and some of those

you is probably a dated one
 
at this point, but we spent $1.3 billion in 2014, 
that's the last number that we disclosed and we continue to add content. 
The best I can give you at this point is that it will be double, nearly double

Thanks for putting me on. Maybe I'll just ask a question about India. You 
called out India was 

 
you had the most visited e
-
commerce site as 
well as 
the most downloaded mobile app, and you also launched Prime. So maybe 
you could just talk about the opportunities and the challenges that you see 
in that market. And second, there was some press reports that you invested 
about $500 million of incre
mental capital in Italy. I was wondering what are 
you seeing in that market that justifies that level of investment.
 
Brian T. Olsavsky

Sure. So India, we're very encouraged by what we've seen so far in In
dia, 
both with customers and also sellers; that's a (40:18) third
-
party seller 
market. You heard that we launched the Prime program this week, which will 
be a whole new experience for Indian customers. In hundreds of cities we'll 
now have unlimited free on
e
-
day and two
-
day delivery, and we also 
mentioned that Prime Video is coming there, both Indian and global content. 
We're also starting to see exclusive online sales partnerships. Recently, 
we've had partnerships with Motorola, Samsung, Lenovo on select ph
ones. 
But more importantly, again, we really like the opportunity in India. We like 
the initial results that we see from customers and also sellers. We really like 
our team there. We have a great team of Amazonian's who've been very 
inventive in India.
 
Eve
ry time there's an obstacle or something that's different from the U.S. or 
another major business they'll invent around it, whether it's a shipping 
method or a payment method or whatever. So, very creative and the 
customer response has been really strong. 
So we are very excited about the 
Prime program. We think it'll enter into a new chapter in India, and we've 
seen great success every country in the world that we've launched Prime, 
and we feel India is going to be no different. So we're looking forward to

mer demand we 

created 1,700 jobs in Italy, and this increased investment will be to add 
future FC near Rome and other infrastructure assets. So, yes, this is really to 
support both the 
customers that we have there in Italy and throughout 
Europe, and we'll continue to invest in the coming years.

Good day everyone and welcome to the Amazon.com Q3 2016 Financial 
Results Teleconference. At this time, all participants are in a listen
-
only 
mode. After the presentation we will conduct a question
-
and
-
answer session. 
Today's call is being 
recorded. For opening remarks, I will be turning the call 
over to the Director of Investor Relations, Darin Manney. Please go ahead.

Hello, and welcome to our Q3 2016 financial results conference call. Joining 
us today to an
swer your questions is Brian Olsavsky, our CFO. As you listen 
to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in 
front of you which includes our financial results as well as metric and 
commentary on the quarter. Please note, unless o
therwise stated, all 
comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period 
of 2015.
 
Our comments and responses to your questions reflect management's view 
as of today, October 27, 2016, only and will include forward
-
looking 
stateme
nts. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information 
about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in 
today's press release and our filings with the SEC including our most recent 
annual report on Form 10
-
K and s
ubsequent filings.
 
During this call, we may discuss certain non
-
GAAP financial measures. In our 
press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the 
SEC, each of which are posted on our IR website. You will find additional 
disclosures r
egarding these non
-
GAAP measures including reconciliations of 
these measures with comparable GAAP measures.
 
Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we've seen to
-
date and 
what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are 
inherent
ly unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors 
including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic 
conditions and customer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the 
Internet online commerce and cloud servic
es and the various factors detailed 
in our filings with the SEC. Our guidance also assumes, among other things, 
that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, 
restructurings or legal segments. It is not possible to accurately pre
dict 
demand for our goods and services and therefore our actual results could 
differ materially from our guidance.
 
With that, we will move to Q&A. Operator, please remind our listeners how 
to initiate a question.

At thi
s time, we will now open up the call for questions. Thank you. Our first 
question comes from Douglas Anmuth with JPMorgan. Please state your 
question.

Thanks for taking the question. The International retail segm
ent margin was 
the lowest we've seen in quite a while. I was hoping you could provide some 
of the key drivers there in terms of the drag and any color on how to think 
about the incremental international investment that might be impacting the 
4Q guide. Than
ks.
 
Brian T. Olsavsky 
-
 
Amazon.com, Inc.
 
Sure. Thanks, Doug. Yes, specifically to International, we are seeing 
expansion to support selection, expansion at fulfillment network increases. 
We're also investing in digital content and additional Prime benefits
, fresh 
location Prime Now. But by far the biggest individual thing is the investment 
in India that we continue to make and very excited about it, the initial 
reaction in India from both the customers and also sellers. So that is 
essentially the Internatio
nal margin guidance in Q4.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Gene Munster with Piper Jaffray. 
Please proceed with your question.
 
Eugene Charles Munster

Piper Jaffray & Co.
 
Great. Thank
s. I guess when we think about the progression of margins in 
the second half versus the second half of 2015 and kind of the flat
-
lining of 
overall margin at this point excluding AWS, I guess should we think about 
this as being a temporary kind of plateau t
hat will at some point resume 
once you start leveraging the fulfillment build
-
out? Or is there something 
structurally or philosophically changing with the way that you operate your 
business? Thanks.
 
Brian T. Olsavsky 
-
 
Amazon.com, Inc.
 
Yes. Thanks, Gene. W
ell we will continue to invest in the business where we 
are seeing significant customer traction. And the things I'm about to mention 
fall into that category. But the largest individual reasons for the ramp
-
up in 
investment between first half and second ha
lf of this year and also second 
half of this year versus second half of last year are the things I mentioned 
on the call last quarter.
 
First, video content and marketing associated with that is nearly doubling 
year
-
over
-
year in the second half of the year.
 
And it continues to be a large 
increase both Q3 and Q4. In the quarter, in Q3 we added 18 fulfillment 
centers and we've added five more in October. For the year we'll add 26. 
Most of those are in North America but that compares to 14 last year and I 
would
 
look, looking back the last time we had double
-
digit increase in 
fulfillment centers was in 2012 when we added 11 in the third quarter.
 
So it was a rare aggregation of startups in Q3 and into Q4 that's helping us 
position better for Q4 volumes. Because pa
id unit growth continues to be 
strong and Amazon fulfilled unit growth which includes what we ship, 
includes FBA, is significantly higher than even that. So we continue to build 
for high AFN, or Amazon Fulfilled Network demand, including both retail and 
FB
A. The number of warehouses that we added represents a 30% increase 
in square footage year
-
over
-
year. Last year we increased square footage by 
just under 20%. The definition of square footage in this case is all of our 
warehouses plus our sortation and del
ivery centers. So it's pretty much our 
customer service centers. So it's pretty much our full square footage that 
supports operation.
 
So those will dissipate as as they burn in. We've talked about fulfillment 
centers' initial startup costs include increase
 
in fixed costs but also variable 
cost as we train workers and also bring in inventory. And there's a number 
of transportation costs also related to the startup of a new fulfillment center, 
both inbound and outbound. And they're inherently less efficient t
han more 
established mature buildings, so there will be a cycle where those will be 
more productive next year than they are this year and more productive in 
2018 than they are in 2017.
 
So what you're seeing essentially in the second half of this year is a 
step
-
up 
investment primarily around digital content and also the fulfillment center 
investment, but also things like Echo and Alexa which we're adding a lot of 
resources to, India and AWS as we add people there to support additional 
service, think (7:54) r
apid growth in that business.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Nowak with 
Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.
 
Brian Nowak

Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
 
Thanks for taking my question and I have two. The 
first one, just to go back, 
Brian, to the fulfillment build. In the past, I think you've talked about how it 
takes time to kind of get the fulfillment centers to peak efficiencies, so with 
these new FCs opening, could you just talk about it? Have you becom
e more 
efficient so if you get into a lower volume quarter next year, there's less risk 
of deleverage? Or should we still kind of think about it's going to take time 
to get to up to peak efficiency?
 
And then the second one, AWS. Amazon is a company that is
 
very good at 
removing friction in the purchase process. Could you just talk about some of 
the main hurdles you still have to overcome for large enterprises to really 
start using AWS more? Thanks.
 
Brian T. Olsavsky 
-
 
Amazon.com, Inc.
 
Sure. So the fulfillme
nt network as we built it, yes, they'll be more 
productive next year than they are this holiday peak and probably even 
more productive in 2018. So I can't forecast it for you into next year quite 
yet, but we certainly had productivity add additional cost t
o Q3 and even 
into Q4 of this year as we build the additional capacity. Again, the underlying 
reason for that capacity build is the strength in paid units and even more so 
in the units that we're fulfilling driven by our FBA program. The FBA program 
is a k
ey pillar of our Prime offering. It adds selection. It makes Prime 
stronger and then that's a self
-
reinforcing where Prime then 

 
the Prime 
success attract mores sellers. So we're glad to have that problem. We are 
just working very hard to get capacity in 
place and in productive use for Q4 
and beyond.

Hi Brian. This is Darin. On the AWS question, yeah, we continue to invest in 
AWS on behalf of our customers in addition to the technologies that make 
integrations easier that he
lps companies move from an on
-
prem or a hybrid 
IT environment into AWS. So we're going to continue to do that, specifically 
things like the database migration tool that are helpful for customers when 
they move production databases from on premises to the c
loud with virtually 
no downtime.
 
And also many of our AWS customers are beginning to choose and continue 
to choose the AWS Schema Conversion Tool which really switches database 
engines to get out of old guard proprietary databases and onto AWS. And so 
we'l
l continue to react to customer needs and that will include opening up 
new regions. We've opened up Ohio this past quarter and we've highlighted 
that we'll have another number of regions coming online in a few months. So 
yeah, were doing a lot of things to
 
help make it easier for all customers to 
migrate to AWS.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney with 
RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.

Okay. Hey, Brian. Would 
you give us any commentary on two categories, in 
particular groceries and fashion and apparel? And particularly on groceries, I 
know in the release there's a couple of data points about Fresh rolling out 
into newer areas like Maryland, great to see that. B
ut could you just talk 
about that in the investment horizon? Is that moving the needle for you? 
And how big that, any way to help us quantify how big that already is to the 
revenue growth that you're seeing, particularly on groceries and any 
particular com
ments on fashion and apparel, same line of thinking? Thanks.
 
Brian T. Olsavsky 
-
 
Amazon.com, Inc.
 
Okay. Sure. Thanks, Mark. I will start with Fresh and groceries in general. 
So yes, this quarter we launched in Northern Virginia, Maryland, Dallas and 
Chicag
o. We also launched a new pricing plan which is a monthly $14.99 
add
-
on to Prime in the U.S. and we've expanded, as you know, previously 
into London. We're very happy with the progression, both in the geographies 
that we've been in for a long time where we
're at, continuing to add zip 
codes and additional neighborhoods and also in these new cities. Certainly a 
business where we continue to work on costs and profitability, but we are 
finding it's a very attractive service to our customers, which is what we'r
e 
after.
 
Similarly, but not exactly the same is the Prime Now business, which has 
similar overlap on things besides groceries. It's a slightly different model 
obviously where we're more about immediacy and a smaller list of items 
available in one to two ho
urs. But there's certainly a lot of people who are 
using that for groceries and consumable items. And that is now up to 40 
cities across seven countries versus 17 this time last year. We're also adding 
restaurant, Amazon Restaurant Delivery to the Prime No
w offer in 19 
metropolitan cities in the U.S. and that's up from two last year.
 
So we continue to believe consumables, groceries are a key part of the offer 
to customers and we are playing with very different models to see which 
works and for what needs. S
o we're very happy with the AmazonFresh and 
we've now expanded quite a bit as you see in this year. And Prime Now, 
we're also very happy with, although obviously the economics in that 
business are even tougher, but we do feel that our scale makes that poss
ible 
because of the geographic footprint and how close we already are to 
customers.

Hi, Mark. This is Darin. On fashion, yeah, fashion and apparel continue to be 
a large part of our EGM business and one that we're very excit
ed about. We 
continue to make it easier for brands and manufacturers to come on board 
in that category. We continue to work with brands to come on board and 
we're happy with the traction we're seeing with those brands. And as we get 
more and more selection
, we're really pleased with the customer 
engagement that we have there, both from the discoverability, the

Sorry. To answer your question about was that part of investment. Yes, this 
is certainly part of our investment but the large ramp, if you will, in 
investment that we're seeing from the back end of last year and also 
the 
first half of this year is more related to digital content and the build in our 
fulfillment network, which I've already discussed.

Thanks a lot. In some of these incremental investment areas like 
warehouses, logistics and also content, I know in some cases you expense 
up front. In some cases you amortize over time. Just 
wondering if you could 
give us a sense of how much of the recent step
-
up is kind of being 
expensed. I'm particularly looking at your COGS as a percent of retail 
revenues which was up year
-
on
-
year for the first time in quite a while. How 
much of that was be
cause of content that was expensed in the period? Just 
trying to kind of better understand that.
 
And I think also you've been changing around, and this is happening here 
shortly, FBA pricing including increasing your storage fees but also reducing 
your han
dling fees. I guess the question is, are these changes designed to 
just pass through kind of increasing shipping costs? Or is this more of a net
-
neutral change where really the goal is to try to free up capacity in some of 
your facilities? Thanks.
 
Brian T.
 
Olsavsky

Amazon.com, Inc.
 
Let me start with your second question on FBA. So yes, we did make some 
changes to the pricing formula for this holiday season. They're essentially 
meant to incent the right behavior among sellers around holiday. And the 
bigges
t issue you're trying to get at is having the most valuable products for 
holiday in the warehouse in the Prime space and not having the warehouse 
filled with things that may not sell until after the New Year. So we are trying 
to incentivize that behavior. 
We're also trying to incentivize getting inventory 
into the warehouse quicker. So yes, the formulas were, or excuse me, the 
changing to the pricing formulas were really with that in mind to help the 
flow and the base utilization in Q4.

Amazo
n.com, Inc.
 
Yeah, hi Mark. This is Darin. On the capitalization point, I'd say the things 
we capitalized are the core buildings and leasehold improvements in the 
buildings. But the things that we're seeing hit the P&L are the fixed and 
variable expenses th
at it takes to run the building and I think that's what 
Brian's pointing out most pointedly in terms of what is impacting the 
profitability of the second half. So yeah, the capitalization's relatively small 
in terms of, other than in the building itself.

Cantor Fitzgerald. Please proceed with your question.
 
Youssef Squali

Cantor Fitzgerald Securities
 
Yes. Thank you very much. Two quick questions. With the step
-
up in 
investmen
ts in content from Prime Video that you mentioned before, would 
you also be stepping up the international expansion? Maybe you can just 
remind us how many countries you're in with Prime Video and whether there 
is a potential chance of maybe stripping Prime
 
Video from Prime to allow it 
to be extended to other countries.
 
And then I know you're not guiding to 2017. But just looking at the capacity 
increases that you've had for FCs for 2016, should we expect kind of that as 
an ongoing expense going forward? Or 
is the current buildup enough to 
maybe give you some spare capacity to cool that down for 2017? Thanks.
 
Brian T. Olsavsky 
-
 
Amazon.com, Inc.
 
Sure. So first on your video comment. We're in four countries right now, the 
U.S., UK, Germany and Japan. And we ha
ve stated that we will be in India 
soon. So the content that we are creating, especially through Amazon 
Studios, we are generally holding the worldwide rights to and can use that in 
other countries as well. And the cost of that then gets amortized to those
 
countries. It becomes part of the International segment results. So yes, and 
we consider that to be very valuable as opposed to, versus licensing many 
times by country, the third
-
party rights to content that we don't create 
ourselves.
 
Your question on ful
fillment expenses, I can't extend the guidance into next 
year. We will do that obviously at the end of next quarter. But I would say 
this was an extraordinary step up, as I mentioned, in Q3 that is tied to very 
rapid growth in not only paid units but Amazo
n fulfilled units. So really, our 
forecast for additional capacity additions and the rate of additions will be tied 
to those growth factors as well. So we'll have to see. We right now are 
working on getting the capacity in. It was very lumpy this time with
 
18 
warehouses in one quarter and another five in the first three weeks of the 
next quarter. So ,and obviously we'll be working on the efficiencies of all the 
warehouses we have, including the ones we just started up this year.

Baird Equity Research. Please proceed with your question.
 
Colin A. Sebastian

Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)
 
Great. Thanks. A follow
-
up on the FC question, and I guess more specifically 
it sounds
 
like you have enough capacity in terms of fulfillment centers for 
the holidays, but also wondering what your comfort level is in terms of your 
shipping partners to manage those deliveries. And then secondly, was 
wondering how you would characterize the pr
icing environment for AWS, in 
particular with more deep
-
pocketed competitors in the space now. Google in 
fact highlighted this on their conference call today. Thank you.
 
Brian T. Olsavsky 
-
 
Amazon.com, Inc.
 
Sure. Let me start with transportation. So yeah, 
we looking forward to a 
great holiday and that includes working with our shipping partners both in 
the U.S. and globally. We've worked very closely with them to line up 
capacity, share capacity plans. We certainly have additional delivery 
capability of our
 
own. But with all of our partners, we work well in advance 
of the holiday to get our plans in place. And we feel very confident. We're 
looking forward to a great holiday not only for customers but also for sellers.
 
On your question on AWS, I didn't listen
 
to the Google call, but you'll have to 
fill me in on that later. The thing I can tell you about pricing is that our 
pricing is, price reductions are a core part of our philosophy, of course. We 
had a price decrease in Q3, and that was our 52nd since we st
arted this 
business. So we are comfortable with price decreases. Not only did we lower 
the prices of our products but we also create new services that are cheaper 
that customers can switch to. So they can also benefit from that as well.
 
So if you step back
 
and say why do people choose AWS, I'll give you the 
points I said last quarter. Basically what we hear are the functionality and 
pace of innovation is greater than our competition. We have added more 
new significant features and services this year already
 
than we had all of last 
year when we added 722. We have a partner and customer ecosystem. 
You've read about the VMware deal that we signed this quarter. So we 
continue to extend with partners and build ecosystems that better can 
support customers. And fin
ally experience. We've been in this business a 
long time, longer than anyone else, and we've used that time to make our 
products and services better. So there was going to be a lot of winners in 
this space as we said, but we are very happy with our positio
n and the 
customer reception to our products.

Justin Post

Bank of America Merrill Lynch
 
Great. Thank you. I guess when you loo
k at fourth quarter guidance and you 
back out AWS, it suggests that margins are, on the core business, are going 
to be pretty down versus last year. Do you view this as a abnormal 
investment cycle, or just part of the overall kind of ebbs and flows of the 
business? And then long
-
term, I know several years ago you talked about 
maybe high single digit, low double digit margins long term. I wonder if you 
could refresh us on that, and also just let us know if you think International 
has structural margin differ
ences than the U.S. in the core retail business. 
Thank you.
 
Brian T. Olsavsky 
-
 
Amazon.com, Inc.
 
Sure. Yes. As far as the continuation of the investment into next year, I 
cannot give you much color on that today. What I can tell you again is that 
we've ramped up considerably. We've been investing quite openly in a lot of 
areas and continue to do so. We are experiencing a ramp
-
up, if you will, in 
the second half of this year particularly tied again to AWS, or excuse me, the 
fulfillment center spend 
and also the video content spend.
 
So we will continue to invest in video content. We'll continue to invest in 
fulfillment space to handle higher and higher paid unit volumes and shipped 
unit volumes. We'll continue to invest in things that we believe enhan
ce the 
customer experience, particularly the Prime experience. Devices, we'll 
continue to invest in as particularly Alexa and the Echo products. We'll 
continue to invest in getting faster and faster shipping methods for our 
consumers. We believe that's wor
king. We're very happy with the results. 
We're very happy with all the customers we have but particularly the Prime 
customers that we have.
 
As far as long
-
term operating margins, I can't forecast that right now. I can't 
forecast that for our AWS business e
ither. We are again working on two 
fronts. We are honing the businesses that we're in and making them as 
efficient, as profitable as possible while also investing very pointedly and 
very wisely, we believe, in things that will enhance customer experience a
nd 
create lasting businesses for us down the line. We've said we want things 
that customers will love, can grow to be large, will have strong financial 
returns and durable and can last for decades. So that's still our mission. We 
have pillars of the busine
ss right now with Marketplace, AWS and Prime and 
we're actively looking for a fourth and fifth pillar.

Great. I was just wondering, there have obviously been some headlines 
since the call that you did earlier with the press on the scale of this 
investment cycle relative to other investment cycles that you've been 
through. With the 2014 cycle sort o
f being the most recent, could you 
quantify a little bit more how you would compare this investment cycle to 
that most recent one? And to the extent that we are in the midst of this 
investment cycle, would you say we're in sort of the earlier or later stag
es? 
Any sort of clarity around that would be useful. Thank you.
 
Brian T. Olsavsky 
-
 
Amazon.com, Inc.
 
Sure. Yes. The word cycle, if I mentioned that, was a omission. It was a mis
-
speak. The investment that we are seeing is a step
-
up versus what we have 
expe
rienced in particularly the first half of this year and the last half, the 
second half of last year which I mentioned. But we have said investments 
are going to be lumpy. They are going to be high sometimes and they'll be 
moderated at other times. We are r
ight now, the second half of this year 
looks like a big step
-
up compared to the first half and it is. But again, it's all 
areas that we will continue to invest in, some of which I just actually went 
through the laundry list. So I would not characterize it 
as a cycle. I would 
characterize it as continued investments. We make investments with the 
idea that they are going to pay off and they pay off in either directly in the 
business they're in or in their contribution to the total business many times 
as a par
t of the Prime program.

Great. Thanks, just two questions. It seems you're increasing yo
ur efforts in 
the auto vertical with the recent launch of Amazon Vehicles. Just wondering 
if you could discuss some of the dynamics of the auto industry that make it 
attractive and maybe how it aligns with the Prime value prop. And also 
wondering if you ha
d any plans to work directly with auto shops just given 
your ability to service most areas in one to two days. And then just the 
second question, on grocery would you consider physical locations in an 
effort to kind of expand and/or accelerate the growth i
n that vertical? Thank 
you.
 
Darin Manney

Amazon.com, Inc.
 
Yeah, hi John. This is Darin. On vehicles, Amazon Vehicles is really a car 
research destination and really builds the automotive community for 
customers and gets information they need when shoppin
g for vehicles offsite 
or shopping for parts and accessories onsite. The features include research 
tools, community engagement where you can talk to other customers, and 
certainly we'll try to build a one
-
stop shop for vehicles as an extension to the 
autom
otive store which engages customers to add information about their 
cars in their garage and which makes it actually easier to shop for parts and 
accessories for your particular vehicle. And so we think there's a lot of 
opportunity there to add convenience 
for customers. On the B2B side, 
certainly we do have a Amazon business offering. Businesses of all shapes 
and sizes can sign up to be a B2B customer and the selection that we have 
in our parts and in automotive categories are certainly open to that channel
, 
but I wouldn't speculate on anything we might do in a particular vertical for 
those business customers.
 
Brian T. Olsavsky 
-
 
Amazon.com, Inc.
 
Sure. And your comment on, or question on grocery and physical stores, I 
can't comment on any rumors or speculati
ons there might be regarding that. 
But what I will tell you is we have experimented with physical stores. As you 
may know, we have three physical bookstores, one Seattle, one in San 
Diego and one in Portland and two more coming, one in Boston and one in 
Ch
icago. And what we're finding is they're great places for customers to 
browse what ends up being a curated selection of books and they also get to 
try out our devices, which is very beneficial. So they get to touch and try our 
eReaders, tablets, Fire TV an
d Echo. So we like what we see with that 
connection and we also have pop
-
up stores that you may see and also 
college pick
-
up points. So we will try different delivery methods or pick
-
up 
points or ways of getting product to customers, but nothing specific t
o point 
out on the grocery side right now.

Given the low unemployment rates that you're seeing in the U.S., do you 
expect any unusual impact on wages for seasonal workers this year? And are 
you seeing overall wage pressure in the fulfillment centers? And then 
separately, if you could ju
st talk about trend lines you're seeing in paid units 
versus shipping units. Are they diverging meaningfully versus the past? 
Thanks.
 
Brian T. Olsavsky 
-
 
Amazon.com, Inc.
 
Yeah, so on wages, nothing to point out for this holiday. Our challenge 
generally is 
the volume of head count that we're looking to hire and we work 
well in advance with agencies to help to get seasonal employees and many 
of them turn into full
-
time employees after the holiday. So nothing specific 
on the wage pressure front. As you probabl
y saw, head count is up 38% 
year
-
over
-
year in Q3 and that is a continuation of a lot of ops roles they're 
supporting this high demand, the opening of the fulfillment centers we 
talked about, new Fresh locations, Prime Now. But also a lot of hiring in our 
t
ech areas particularly around AWS and also the Echo, Alexa areas.

Great. Thanks. Can you just provide a little more color into the investments 
that you're making in India? What's 
driving that growth and what stage is 
India in today relative to some of the other large international markets that 
you've launched in the past?
 
Brian T. Olsavsky 
-
 
Amazon.com, Inc.
 
Yeah, sure. So we are very encouraged by what we're seeing in India but it
 
is certainly very early on still. Most recent highlights would be the launch of 
the Prime program in India this past quarter. It's now one of the top selling 
units based on Amazon.in. And so it's very been very well received by 
customers. It's hard to com
pare India to any other country. It's very 
different in its stage and structure. Being a third
-
party market has caused a 
lot of invention on our side. We're being creative. The team there in India 
has been very creative on whenever they find a roadblock or
 
something that 
has not existed in another country, they create it themselves, whether that's 
from delivery stations to working with small merchants to, you name it. So 
we're very happy with both the customer engagement that we're seeing and 
also the selle
r engagement which is very important in India and very pleased 
with the team that runs it over there and the way they work with teams 
throughout the world.

And Brian, to step back to Ben's other question on units. Ben, this 
is Darin. I 
will, so you know, paid units grew at 28% again this year as it did in the 
prior quarter. And as Brian pointed out earlier, our AFN unit, our Amazon 
fulfilled units, which include our first
-
party units as well as FBA units that go 
through our w
arehouses are continuing, are certainly higher than that 28%. 
And that's a result of the traction we're getting with our FBA sellers.

Thank you for standing by. Good day, everyone, and welcome to the 
Amazon.com Q2 2020 Financial Results Teleconference. At this time, all 
participants are in a listen
-
only mode. After the presentation, we will 
conduct a 
question
-
and
-

 
For opening remarks, I will be turning the call over to Director of Investor 
Relations, David Fildes. Please go ahead.
 
David Fildes
 
Hello, and welcome to our Q2 2020 financial results conference 
call. Joining 
us today to answer your questions is Brian Olsavsky, our CFO. As you listen 

front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and 
commentary on the 
quarter. Please note, unless otherwise stated, all 
comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period 
of 2019.
 

as of today, July 30, 2020, only and will inc
lude forward
-
looking statements. 
Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that 

release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent ann
ual report 
on Form 10
-
K and subsequent filings.
 
During the call, we may discuss certain non
-
GAAP financial measures. In our 
press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the 
SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will fi
nd additional 
disclosures regarding these non
-
GAAP measures, including reconciliations of 
these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Our guidance incorporates 

appropriate assumptio
ns.
 
Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by 
many factors, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in 
global economic conditions and customer spending, world events, the rate of 
growth of the Internet, on
line commerce and cloud services and the various 
factors detailed in our filings with the SEC.
 
This guidance also reflects our estimates to date regarding the impact of the 
COVID
-
19 pandemic on our operations, including those discussed in our 
filings with 
the SEC, and is highly dependent on numerous factors that we 
may not be able to predict or control, including: the duration and scope of 
the pandemic, including any recurrence; actions taken by governments, 
businesses and individuals in response to the pan
demic; the impact of the 
pandemic on global and regional economies and economic activity, 
workforce staffing and productivity and our significant and continuing 
spending on employee safety measures; our ability to continue operations in 
affected areas; and
 
consumer demand and spending patterns as well as the 
effects on suppliers, creditors and third
-
party sellers, all of which are 
uncertain.
 

additional business acquisitions, investmen
ts, restructurings or legal 

services, and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our 
guidance.

Thank 

the contributions of hundreds of thousands of Amazon employees and 
delivery partners and hundreds of thousands of small and medium
-
sized 
businesses who are working hard to serve our cu
stomers all around the 
world in these uncertain times.
 

mentioned on our last earnings call, we began to see a significant increase in 
customer demand beginning in early March, and demand rema
ined elevated 
throughout Q2. Strong early demand in groceries and consumable products 
continued into Q2, while demand increased during the quarter in our other 
major product categories like hardlines and softlines.
 
At the same time, we continue to focus on
 
stepped up employee safety, 
particularly in our fulfillment and logistics operations, to help ensure the 
safety and well
-
being of our employees and partners. In Q2, we incurred 
more than $4 billion of COVID
-
related expenses, getting products to 
customers 
and keeping employees safe. The largest portion of these costs 
related to compensation for our frontline employees, including higher hourly 
wages through the end of May and a more than $500 million Thank You 
bonus in June.
 
We also experienced productivity 
headwinds in our facilities. This included 
changes to over 150 of our processes to provide for social distancing as well 
as costs to onboard and train over 175,000 new employees who are hired to 
meet the higher customer demand. This $4 billion also include
d investments 
in personal protective equipment for employees and enhanced cleaning for 
our facilities.
 
Our consolidated revenue and operating income significantly exceeded the 
top end of our guidance range. Strong top line performance was driven by 
increas
ed consumer demand, led by Prime members. We continue to see 
high Prime member engagement throughout the quarter. Prime members

customers with our grocery offerings.
 
Online grocery sales tripled year

over

year. Existing Prime member renewal 
rates improved, and the Prime member growth rate accelerated both in the 
U.S. and worldwide. Our 3P sellers, who are largel
y comprised of small and 
medium

sized businesses, also stepped up to help make more selection 
available for customers. And as a result, these small and medium
-
sized 
businesses have seen significant growth in their sales.
 
Our third

merchant fulfilled or MFN seller sales. Third

party units continue to represent 
more than half of overall unit volume, helped by improved quarter

q
uarter growth in active sellers. We are more committed than ever to 
supporting the success of the hundreds of thousands of small and medium
-
sized businesses to sell their products in Amazon stores.
 
We were able to meet this heightened demand because we wer
e also able to 
open up more fulfillment network capacity as the quarter progressed with 

improvements that have allowed us to enhance throughput. First, our 
regular headcount grew 34% year
-
o
ver
-
year as of the end of Q2 and 
continues to grow. We welcomed more than 175,000 new employees in 
March and April, many of whom were displaced from other jobs in the 
economy.
 

125,000 of t
hese employees into regular full
-
time positions. I would also 
note that Amazon has created more jobs over the last decade than any other 

industry
-
leading wages and great benefits duri
ng this challenging time. Our 
combined number of regular and seasonal employees is currently over 1 


we 
put in place.
 
Additionally, as a reminder, Q2 is typically our lightest volume quarter for 

that we can flex into space normally used for second half peak demand. This 
led to stron
g operating leverage in Q2. As we move towards peak in the 
second half of the year, we will ramp up our space needs even further, and 

the second half of the year.
 
Turning to AWS.
 
This is now a $43 billion annualized run rate business, up 
nearly $10 billion in run rate in the last 12 months. Customer usage remains 
strong, although growth varies across industries as a result of the COVID

dance, which we provided as part of 
our earnings release. A few additional data points on this guidance. We 
expect to incur more than $2 billion in COVID
-
related expenses in Q3 to help 
keep employees safe, including continued investment in social distancin
g, 
PP&E and testing. Costs are expected to be lower than in Q2 primarily due to 
better cost efficiency at the high demand levels we are seeing.
 

the majority of our new fulfillmen

same this year. We continue to invest meaningfully, including $9.4 billion in 
CapEx and finance leases in Q2 alone, an increase of 65% year

over

year, 
primarily driven by investments in our fulfillment and logistics fo
otprint. 
Once these buildings open, they are a headwind to profitability as they ramp 
up and we prepare for Q4 peak.
 
In 2019, we increased network square footage by approximately 15%. This 
year, we expect a meaningfully higher year

year square footage
 
growth 
of approximately 50%. This includes strong growth in new fulfillment center 
space as well as sort centers and delivery stations. We expect the majority 
of this capacity to come online in late Q3 and into Q4.
 
Lastly, we plan to host Prime Day in Q4 
this year rather than Q3 as it has 
been in prior years. The one exception is Amazon India, which will host 
Prime Day on August 6 and August 7. In summary, we know that people are 
relying on online shopping more than ever during this unprecedented time, 
and
 

extremely grateful to our employees across Amazon for continuously 
stepping up to meet the needs of customers.

Operator
 

please limit yourself to one question. [Operator Instructions] Your first 
question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan with UBS. Please proceed with 
your question.
 
Eric Sheridan
 
T
hanks so much for taking the question. Maybe I could just dive in on the 

made a push into essentials and deemphasized non
-
essentials, as we talked 
about in the last earnings call. Wher
e are we in terms of the company 
getting the mix between essentials versus non
-
essentials right in terms of 
offering to customers? Where are you in terms of returning to normal on 
next
-
day and two
-
day shipping initiatives to drive Prime? If there was any 
c
olor on the state of affairs with either of those by geo or region of the 
world, that would be great. Thank you so much.
 
Brian Olsavsky
 
Sure, Eric. Thanks for your question. So first, on the trend. So if you 
remember, we exited Q1 and spoke at the end of A
pril. We had taken a lot 
of steps in March and April to, first, limit the incoming non
-
essential 
products into our warehouses, and then we reversed that or eliminated that 
decision in mid
-
April. So we started to normalize on our channel mix. And I 
would sa
y, as we moved into late April and early May, we expected that 
because a lot of the sellers can toggle between MFN or FBA sales that we 
would see MFN drop as FBA picked up.
 
But to a large extent, MFN remained strong even as FBA picked up. So we 
had a very 
favorable mix, if you will, coming from March on. It started to 
normalize a little bit more to normal levels towards the end of the quarter, 
but MFN still remains high. On the product side, a lot of what we saw in 
March and early April was sales of consuma
bles and groceries and safety 
items. And we talked a lot about the fact that, that was coming at pretty 
much zero cost 

 
or excuse me, zero profit when you factored in the COVID
-
related costs.
 

ore normal 

closer to what we call a more normal mix. Demand is still super high. What 


 


ore often. They have larger basket sizes. 


 
online grocery sales tripled

a li

on that. But again, first priority is definitely keeping employ
ees safe, and 
second is increasing our capacity.
 
David Fildes
 
Yes. And this is just David. I think just from a geographic perspective, 

can see that both the North America and the
 
International segment are 
growing well. So a lot of those kind of trends in category performances and 
first

party and third

party seller growth, whether it be merchant fulfilled or

type broad trends when you think about the U.S. and North America as well 
as our international regions, in particular, our more established international 
regions.

Okay. So two, just a quick follow

high at the company
 
if you ex out the COVID costs. Is Jeff aware of how 

being facetious, obviously, when I asked that.
 
But what I also want to ask really is when you think about new investment 
areas, a
nd at the top of the list, maybe some new international launches are 


 
like India, Brazil and 
Mexico or the business
-
to
-

investment areas, and it seems like t

the same now, would be using this kind of revenue surge and really 
investing aggressively in these new areas. So just talk about that. I know 

 

how do you want to deploy those into some of the newer investment areas? 
Thanks a lot.
 
Brian Olsavsky
 
Sure. Thanks for your questions, Mark. First, on when we get back to par, 
we d

balancing what is going to be very stepped up demand and capacity in Q3 
and Q4. So if you look at our historic run rates and can see how big a 
quarter Q2 was, Q2 was actually higher revenue 
than Q4 of last year, which 
is unheard of. And Q3 is now forecast to be also higher than Q4 of last year.
 

trying to, mainly, like as I said, first priority is getting 

 
is making sur
e our 
employees are safe and that we continue to do social distancing and keep 
everybody safe and healthy. Second priority is getting capacity online 
because we do not have 

 
in Q2, we generally have lower revenue. And in 
Q2, like I mentioned, we were able
 
to use the excess capacity that did exist 
to serve the higher demand.
 


 
we need to build the inventory 


 

probably since late February on this issue. And when you talk about 

gone down in the interim. Marketing, we cut marketing probably by a
bout 
1/3 in Q2 as 

 

 
It started to normalize and get back to somewhat normal levels in 

 
at the 
end of Q2, but 

 

marketing costs were lower. You prob
ably saw it in a lot of companies. 
Travel expenses have almost drawn to a halt. Meeting costs, even medical

time, I would

Yes. This is Dave. Just to add to that, I think Prime is such a big focus, and

saw in the U.S.
 
or worldwide or some of the usage stats like the grocery 


program.

focus
 


 
all 

Indian sellers. A lot of micro, small and medium
-
sized businesses there. We 
launched some new features there to he
lp support the digitization efforts 
with some of those brands and just a lot of work, great work being done by 
that team. They have some goals there around getting more sellers on board 
and hiring many more people as well. So a lot of focus there.

Our next question comes from Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Please 
proceed with your question.
 
Brian Nowak
 
Thanks for taking my question. I have two. The first one, Brian, is going 

investments for 


examples of areas of investment that may have been pushed out this year 
because of shelter in
 

So what were areas where you thought you were going to spend more at the 
start of the year than you actually have now in the current 2020 plan?
 
And then the second one, the international strength, I app
reciate the color 
on Europe and Japan. Nice to see the profitability. Maybe just talk to us sort 
of qualitatively about some puts and takes around your core international 
markets, Europe and Japan? And how to think about whether or not they 
could be more o
r less profitable than the U.S. long
-
term? Thanks.
 
Brian Olsavsky
 


 


is heavily driven by the pickup in
 
demand that we saw, as I mentioned, I 



ushed 
video and devices and music and other things to those countries probably 
earlier in the life cycle than you would have seen in the U.S.
 

countries. But what you also see are i
nvestments in new countries. 
Obviously, India is the biggest one, but also, to a lesser extent, the Middle 


 
good source of profitability. But if you look at what happened in Q2, it was 
essentially just the much higher volumes than we had anticipated or had on 
a run rate.
 
So our fixed costs were leveraged to the hilt. Obviously, we will add some 
capacity and thi
ngs in transportation and fulfillment centers, but all other 
fixed costs were pretty much leveraged on that higher demand. The UK in 

-
at
-
home 
orders and the way the economy was developing in the
 
UK. We had a very, 
very strong quarter there.
 
So I would say that the surge in demand internationally also helped drive 
that profitable, maybe a little earlier than the trajectory would have shown. 

next couple of 

same trends in the U.S. were apparent internationally, higher Prime 

 
more 
frequent Prime purchases and higher basket sizes. So all good signs, and 
perhaps we got a
 
glimpse of the future on the demand curve.
 
Your second question on slowing investments. The list is very short on what 


 


oint to is

And so I think in this time, when people want entertainment, people are

Our next question comes from Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan. Please proceed

ur question.
 
Doug Anmuth
 
Thanks for taking the questions. I have two. Brian, first, just curious about 
your overall thoughts on how the e
-
commerce adoption curve has been 
shifted here over the next few years. And anything you can share around 
behavior for 
new and existing customers. And then separately, on AWS, the 
$43 billion run rate obviously slowed some in the quarter, but hoping you 
could comment just on the pace of IT decision
-
making in this environment, 

ore highly exposed to 
challenged verticals? And due to those factors, is it possible that AWS can 
accelerate growth going forward? Thanks.
 
Brian Olsavsky
 
Yes. Let me start with that second one. Thanks, Doug. So in the AWS 
segment revenue, what we see are c
ompanies are working really hard right 
now to cut expenses, especially in the more challenged businesses like 


lp them 
save money. This includes things like scaling down the usage where it makes 
sense or benchmarking their workloads against our architectural best 
practices.
 

those custom

only for their success and so they can come out of this at a better shape but 
also for the long
-
term health of our relationship with them as an AWS 

anies that are really wishing 

companies that are on the cloud can turn into a variable cost and either 
scale up or scale down depending on their particular situation.
 
They realize the
ir on
-
premise infrastructure is not really flexible to go up or 

them. So we expect 

 

certainly not going to happen overnight, but
 
we see companies moving more 
in that direction. We think that will be a good long

certainly winners in this area right now, things like video conferencing, 
gaming, remote learning and entertainment. All are seeing usage growth. 
And
 

 
So the 

 
on your e

accelerated versus what we would have thought. We certainly are gla
d to be 
there for our Prime members who are shopping more frequently and buying 

limited.
 
I mean there are always retail options out there, especially to go pick up in 
store, but less pe

have to see what is maybe a step
-
up in the curve and getting to a point 
quicker versus what are some onetime sales and things like 

 
hopefully, 
things like masks and gloves and cleaning supplies in
 
the fullness of time 

 
And sorry, your last point was on new customers versus existing customers. 

basket size for new members in Prime as well, c
ertainly not the same as 


accelerated the number of 

 
the growth of Prime members, both in the U.S. 
and internationally. 

hope that, that has long

term ramifications.

Our next question comes from Ross Sandler with Barclays. Please proceed 
with your question.
 
Ross Sandler
 
Yes. Just a follow
-
up to that last comment. 
So the Prime behavior for 
international Prime members, you guys have talked about how like in the 
16, 17 countries, the overall service levels are a little bit behind, selection is 
a little bit behind. So has the last few months in the pandemic closed that
 
gap meaningfully in terms of GMV per Prime member for international versus 
what you see in the U.S.? Any comment there? And then on the 3Q 
guidance, you pushed Prime day for western markets into 4Q. So how much 
of the deceleration 

 

y strong number for 3Q, but the 
growth rate is decelerating a little bit. Is that mostly from Prime Day? Or can 

into 3Q? Thank you.
 
Brian Olsavsky
 
Right. Well, we ramped up throug
h the quarter in Q2 and ended up with 
41% year

year growth in FX

on an FX

neutral basis. A lot of 
those trends are continuing into Q3. You see our revenue range is $87 billion 
to $93 billion coming off of $89 billion quarter. So I would say 
that the 

 
if 
you look at the growth rate, that translates into somewhere in the 24% to 



 

Q2 turns into 24% to 3
3% growth in Q3 on what turns out to be higher 
revenue volume.
 


 

because it is actually a very localized set of staff by country. In international, 
aggregate does not matter that much. A
nd what I would say is, generally, 



 
I would say 

s 
definitely any differences in selection or differences in shipping.

Thank you for standing by. Good day, everyone and welcome to the 
Amazon.com Q4 2014 financial results teleconference. At this time, all 
participants are in a listen
-
only mode. After the presentation, we will 
conduct a 
question
-
and
-
answer session. Today's call is being recorded.
 
For opening remarks, I will be turning the call over to the Director of 
Investor Relations, Phil Hardin. Please go ahead.
 
Phil Hardin
 
Hello and welcome to our Q4 2014 financial results conference
 
call. Joining 
us today is Tom Szkutak, our Chief Financial Officer and Brian Olsavsky, Vice 
President and CFO of our Global Consumer Business. We will be available for 
questions after our prepared remarks.
 
The following discussion and responses to your qu
estions reflect 
management's views as of today, January 29, 2015 only and will include 
forward
-
looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional 
information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is 
included in
 
today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our 
most recent Annual Report on Form 10
-
K. As you listen to today's 
conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, 
which includes our financial results as well as
 
metrics and commentary on 
the quarter.
 
During this call, we will discuss certain non
-
GAAP financial measures. In our 
press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the 
SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find add
itional 
disclosures regarding these non
-
GAAP measures, including reconciliations of 
these measures with comparable GAAP measures.
 
Finally, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against 
our results for the comparable period of 2013.
 
Now, I will turn the call over to Tom.
 
Tom Szkutak
 
Thanks, Phil. I will begin with comments on our fourth quarter financial 
results. Trailing 12
-
month operating cash flow increased 25% to $6.84 
billion. Trailing 12
-
month free cash flow decreased to $1.95 b
illion. In the 
supplemental financial information and business metrics portion of the 
earnings release, we included a few additional free cash flow measures. We 
believe these measures provide additional perspective on the impact of 
acquiring property and e
quipment with capital and finance leases.
 
Trailing 12 month capital expenditures were $4.89 billion. Capital 
expenditures does not include the impact of property and equipment 
acquired under capital and finance lease obligations. Return on invested 
capital
 
is 9%, down from 13%. ROIC is TTM free cash flow divided by the 
average total assets minus current liabilities excluding the current portion of 
long
-
term debt over five quarter
-
ends. The combination of common stock 
and stock
-
based awards outstanding was 4
83 million shares compared with 
476 million one year ago.
 
I will turn the call over to Brian for additional financial highlights.
 
Brian Olsavsky
 
Thanks, Tom. Worldwide revenue increased 15% to $29.33 billion or 18% 
excluding $895 million unfavorable impact
 
from year
-
over
-
year changes in 
foreign exchange. Media revenue decreased to $6.95 billion, down 4%. 
Excluding FX, media revenue was flat year
-
over
-
year. EGM revenue 
increased to $20.64 billion, up 21% or 24% excluding FX. Worldwide EGM 
increased to 70% of
 
worldwide sales, up from 67%. Worldwide paid unit 
growth was 20%. Worldwide active customer accounts were approximately 
270 million. Worldwide paid Prime members increased 53% year
-
over
-
year. 
Worldwide active seller accounts were more than two million. Se
ller units 
represented 43% of paid units, Fulfillment by Amazon or FBA units 
represented more than 40% of seller units. Worldwide active Amazon Web 
Services customers exceeded one million.
 
Now I will discuss operating expenses excluding stock
-
based compens
ation. 
Cost of sales was $20.67 billion or 70.5% of revenue compared with 73.5%. 
Fulfillment, marketing, technology and content and G&A combined was 
$7.62 billion or 25.9% of sales, up approximately 300 basis points year
-
over
-
year. Fulfillment was $3.33 bi
llion or 11.3% of revenue compared with 
11.1%. Tech and content was $2.41 billion or 8.2% of revenue compared 
with 6.6%. Marketing was $1.49 billion or 5.1% of revenue compared with 
4.3%.
 
Now let's talk about our segment results and consistent with prior p
eriods 
we do not allocate to segments our stock
-
based compensation or the other 
operating expense line item. In the North America segment, revenue grew 
22% to $18.75 billion. Media revenue grew 1% to $3.54 billion. EGM 
revenue grew 27% to $13.53 billion, r
epresenting 72% of North America 
revenues, up from 69%. Other revenue grew 43% to $1.67 billion. North 
America segment operating income increased 40% to $1.02 billion, a 5.4% 
operating margin.
 
In the international segment, revenue grew 3% to $10.58 billion
. Excluding 
the $872 million year
-
over
-
year unfavorable foreign exchange impact, 
revenue growth was 12%. Media revenue decreased 8% to $3.41 billion or a 
decrease of 1% excluding foreign exchange and EGM revenue grew 10% to 
$7.11 billion or 19% excluding f
oreign exchange. EGM now represents 67% 
of international revenues, up from 63%.
 
International segment operating income was $20 million, down from $151 
million in prior year. Consolidated segment operating income increased 18% 
to $1.04 billion or 3.5% of re
venue, up approximately 10 basis points year
-
over
-
year. Unlike CSOI, our GAAP operating income includes stock
-
based 
compensation expense and other operating expense. GAAP operating income 
was $591 million compared operating income of $510 million in the pr
ior 
year.
 
Our income tax expense was $205 million. GAAP net income was $214 
million or $0.45 per diluted share compared with a net income of $239 
million or $0.51 per diluted share.
 
Now I will discuss the full year results. Revenue increased 20% to $88.99 
billion or 20%, excluding year
-
over
-
year changes in foreign exchange. North 
America revenue grew 25% to $55.47 billion and international revenue grew 
12% to $33.52 billion or 14%, excluding year
-
over
-
year changes in foreign 
exchange. Consolidated segment o
perating income decreased 9% to $1.81 
billion or 10% excluding the favorable year
-
over
-
year impact from foreign 
exchange and operating margin was 2% compared to 2.7% in the prior
-
year. GAAP operating income decreased 76% to $178 million.
 
Turning to the bal
ance sheet. Cash and marketable securities increased 
$4.97 billion year
-
over
-
year to $17.42 billion. Inventory increased 12% to 
$8.30 billion and inventory turns were 8.6, down from 8.9 turns a year ago 
as we expanded selection, improved in
-
stock levels an
d introduced new 
product categories. Accounts payable increased 9% to $16.46 billion and 
accounts payable days decreased to 73 from 74 in the prior
-
year.
 
And now back to Tom with guidance.
 
Tom Szkutak
 
Thanks, Brian. Incorporated into our guidance are the o
rder trends that we 
have seen to
-
date and what we believe today to be appropriately 
conservative assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may 
be materially affected by many factors, including a high level of uncertainty 
surrounding exchang
e rate fluctuations as well as the global economy and 
consumer spending. It's not possible to accurately predict demand and 
therefore our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.
 
As we describe in more detail in our public filings, issues 
such as settling 
intercompany balances in foreign currencies amongst our subsidiaries, 
unfavorable resolution of legal matters and changes to our effective tax rate 
can all have a material effect on guidance. Our guidance further assumes 
that we don't conc
lude any additional business acquisitions, investments, 
restructurings or legal settlements, record any further revisions to stock
-
based compensation estimates and that foreign exchange rates remain 
approximately where they have been recently.
 
For Q1 2015,
 
we expect net sales of between $20.9 billion and $22.9 billion 
or growth of between 6% and 16%. This guidance anticipates approximately 
460 basis points of unfavorable impact from foreign exchange rates. GAAP 
operating income or loss to be between $450 mi
llion loss and $50 million in 
income, compared to $146 million in income in the first quarter of 2014. This 
includes approximately $450 million for stock
-
based compensation and the 
amortization of intangible assets. We anticipate consolidated segment 
opera
ting income, which excludes stock
-
based compensation and other 
operating expense, to be between zero and $500 million in income compared 
to $502 million income in the first quarter of 2014.
 
I will conclude my portion of today's call with an update on our r
eportable 
segments. We expect to change our reportable segments to report North 
America, international and Amazon Web Services, beginning with first 
quarter of 2015. We remain heads down focused on driving a better 
customer experience through price, select
ion and convenience. We believe 
putting customers first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for our 
shareholders.
 
Thanks and with that, Phil, let's move to questions.
 
Phil Hardin
 
Great. Thanks, Tom. Let's move on to the Q&A portion of the 
call. Operator, 
will you please remind our listeners how to initiate a question.

Answer Session
 
Operator
 
[Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Brian Pitz with 
Jefferies and Company. Please proceed with your question. Your line
 
is live.
 
Brian Pitz
 
Hello. Can you hear me? Hi, guys. Just a quick question. You had a strong 
holiday season. 100 million more items shipped for free this holiday, while 
FBA units was up 50% and fulfillment expense remain relatively flat. How 
did you mana
ge that? Are the new sortation that was essentially the key to 
controlling shipping costs? And what percent of units sold are FBA? Thank 
you.
 
Tom Szkutak
 
Sure. In terms of the last part of your question, the percentage of FBA units 
of third
-
party paid phys
ical units are over 40% and in terms of the 
fulfillment discussion, certainly Q4 is our most seasonal quarter. You can see 
that we get a little bit better leverage, I should say, than we have gotten in 
other quarters. Again, most seasonal quarter. Not a lo
t to add to that but we 
continue to ship on behalf of retail offerings as well as FBA that's included in 
that.
 
Brian Pitz
 
Great. Thanks.
 
Operator
 
And our next question comes from Katie Huberty with Morgan Stanley. 
Please proceed with your question.
 
Katie H
uberty
 
Yes. Thanks. There's a headline on the tape referencing improving 
productivity in 2015. So I just wondered if you could clarify what areas of 
the business you are focused on in terms of productivity? And then what are 
some of the projects or areas t
hat we should be prepared to see a large 
uptick in investment in 2015?
 
Tom Szkutak
 
Yes. I think that you are referring to is, I mentioned on a earlier call, that we 
do an annual planning process. We actually start it in the late
-
summer, early 
fall. We go t
hrough that process. We take a break for the seasonal holidays 
and then we get back to it. We are in the process of finalizing it right now. 
And the teams are putting even more energy and attention on driving what 
we would call fixed expense and variable e
xpense productivity as well as 
other efficiency projects. So there's many, many different pieces that go into 
that. But certainly we have added a lot of people and structure over the last 
several years. And so we have been putting folks on that. But we are
 
just 
putting even more folks on it as we finalize our plans for 2015.
 
Katie Huberty
 
And what areas should we expect big upticks in investment in 2015?
 
Tom Szkutak
 
In terms of investment, certainly we are going to continue to support the 
growth of the busi
ness. You should expect that we will be spending more in 
terms of CapEx to support our web services business which is growing very 
fast. You should expect us to add fulfillment capacity, as we have done in 
prior years. We have updated you a bit as we have 
gone along and so we 
will do that from time
-
to
-
time during the year as well in 2015. So stay tuned 
on that.
 
Katie Huberty
 
Thank you.
 
Operator
 
Our next question comes from Ron Josey with JMP Securities. Please proceed 
you are your question.
 
Ron Josey
 
Great.
 
Thanks for taking the question. Real quickly on fulfillment cost. It 
looks like the overall cost is already quite a bit, around 17% growth in 4Q 
from 30% in 3Q. I am wondering if anything specific led to that improved 
overall growth from, is it maybe the 
key of a rollout? And then quickly, I 
think there was mentioning around breaking out AWS results. Wondering if 
any reason now? Perhaps it's getting to a level that you have to do it? Thank 
you.
 
Tom Szkutak
 
Yes. In terms of the fulfillment piece, it's 
not a lot of callouts on that. We 
had unit growth of 20% year
-
over
-
year. Certainly our FBA is growing at a 
faster rate. The sellers were up 65% over years who did 40% of our units. 
And again, the team continues to work on getting productivity there. In 
ter
ms of AWS, we just think it's an appropriate way to look at our business 
for 2015. And so our plan is to separating it out as of Q1 of this year.
 
Operator
 
Our next question comes from Douglas Anmuth with JPMorgan. Please 
proceed.
 
Kaizad Gotla
 
Thanks. This 
is Kaizad Gotla, in for Doug. I think you noted Prime is growing 
faster internationally than it is in North America. So can you help us 
reconcile that with the difference between your North America and 
international EGM growth rates?
 
Tom Szkutak
 
If you tak
e a look, what I mentioned was, Prime, worldwide is up 53% year
-
over
-
year. so it's growing very fast globally. It's 50% growth in the U.S. and 
even higher in international. And so the reason both are contributing to the 
growth rates that you are seeing. Bu
t we are certainly at a earlier stage in 
international. So it's an opportunity for us, but in terms of the number of 
Prime members relative to the U.S. is smaller. So it's an earlier phase. So 
again, as we continue to grow that, it's an opportunity for us 
and certainly 
something that we are focused on.
 
Operator
 
The next question comes from Carlos Kirjner with Bernstein Research. Please 
proceed with your questions.
 
Carlos Kirjner
 
Hi. I have two questions. Can you comment on your view of the relative 
value pr
oposition of Prime in European markets and Japan? Is it similar to 
the U.S.? Two
-
day shipping and all the other benefits? Or is it different? 
Because we think, for example, that penetration of Prime in the European 
markets is much lower and you have told u
s that the number of Prime SKUs 
is much lower in the U.K., for example. So what's the fundamental cause of 
that? Why is it that Prime in the U.K. is not as developed as in the U.S.? Is it 
timing or is it the proposition?
 
The second question is about AWS. Y
ou have a leadership position now and 
it's a very large market and it's easy to see from the outside that you are 
hiring aggressively, both in engineering and sales. Given the size of the 
opportunity and your position, what specifically prevents you from h
iring 
faster, developing more products, investing more? How do you balance? 
What prevents you from doing that? Why wouldn't you invest twice or three 
times as much in AWS? Thank you.
 
Tom Szkutak
 
In terms of, I will take the AWS one first, we are expanding 
very rapidly. We 
have been hiring a lot of great people over the past few years and several 
years. We do think it's a big opportunity. We are making sure we keep the 
hiring bar really high to make sure we bring in great resources like we do 
across all of A
mazon and we are super excited about the opportunity. So we 
are investing very heavily. You see that certainly in our CapEx numbers and 
the assets we are acquiring with some of the capital leases you see that 
represented. So again we are investing very hea
vily, both in terms of people 
as well as capital for that business and we share your excitement about the 
business.
 
In terms of from the Prime piece, the proposition is a bit different by 
geography and we continue to make it better in all the geographies t
hat we 
have Prime. That's something that we are focused. The shipping speed is 
different by geography a bit, but the focus is all about how we make sure 
that we get a great experience for customers in those geographies. But the 
one thing is different is, y
ou mentioned is that, the proposition or the timing. 
So the proposition is a little bit different, but we will continue to work on 
making it better for all the geographies we have it in. But the timing is 
different. We did launch in the U.S. first. And the
n we launch in other 
geographies following that. So as a result, it's just earlier in these other 
geographies. So we still think it's a very good opportunity and something 
that we are focused on.
 
Operator
 
Our next question comes from Mark May with Citigrou
p.
 
Mark May
 
Thanks for taking my question. One on, I am sorry if I missed this, what's 
your thought or outlook for pricing in the AWS Cloud business for this year? 
It was obviously quite fierce last year. Do you think it will be quite as 
competitive in 201
5?
 
And then in the media business, we have been hearing data points about a 
slowdown in the eBook space. Are you seeing that? And what's your 
outlook? Do you see any hope for the media segment to improve as a result 
of that? Thanks.
 
Tom Szkutak
 
In terms of
 
the first question, we have continued to lower prices for 
customers in web services. Certainly that's something that we have been 
focused on. Since early launch, it's something we continue to focus on. It's 
hard to predict what will happen going forward. 
So I really can't comment on 
what we might or might not do there. But certainly it's something that we 
had, since launch, we have had many, many, it's in the high 40s, I think, in 
terms of pricing actions there. So we are very excited to make sure that we 
have great prices for customers.
 
In terms of the media, you are seeing an overall media growth globally. You 
are seeing some softness in the growth rate there. I just want to point out 
certainly one of the larger factors or largest factor that's in that nu
mber is, 
keep in mind that we have video game consoles that are part of the media 
growth numbers or the media absolute numbers. And last year it was a very 
strong year for new console launches. And so what happens is, when you 
have those launches, you also
 
have video games that are 
--
 
the video game 
sales themselves are also strong. So for example, if you look at North 
American media growth rate in Q4 of this past year, you are seeing that 
impact. So that's what you are seeing there.
 
Operator
 
Our next quest
ion from Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets.
 
Mark Mahaney
 
Great. Thanks. Hi, Tom. Can I ask you a high
-
level question?
 
Tom Szkutak
 
Sure. Go for it, Mark.
 
Mark Mahaney
 
Okay. Amazon has always pitched itself in terms of price, selection and 
convenience to customers. And I saw this great survey work that was done 
by Morgan Stanley in the last couple of weeks about this global survey that 
indicated a little bit of the shift in consumers' interest in online commerce 
more towards convenience. You
 
must have a pretty good feel at Amazon for 
whether that broad value proposition to consumers is shifting. If it's shifting 
to be slightly less sensitive to price over the last couple of years and more 
towards convenience. Are you seeing that kind of shift
? There's a lot of 
implications if that is, in fact, what is happening.
 
Tom Szkutak
 
I would say it this way, in terms of customer reaction, you see it really 
across the fundamental inputs that we have talked about for a long time. So 
in other words, in ter
ms of speed of delivery and convenience, we see that 
with Prime members. Prime members are buying more. It's more 
convenient. They are getting their physical product to them faster versus 
being not a Prime member. So we certainly see that. So that's certai
nly 
speed of delivery helps. We need to make sure and it's something that we 
are always focused on is making sure we have great prices and that's every 
single item across categories, across geographies. So it's something we are 
focused on.
 
We do think that
's important for customers. And we need to have the 
selection, be in stock. When a customer comes to our detail page, it matters. 
And so I don't view it as a shift. I view it as there is certainly a lot of 
visibility and transparency around all of these. T
hat's what shopping and 
operating a business online does. There is just amount of transparency. We 
think we like that world. And that's something that we continue to focus on 
those inputs so that we can be successful in that world and that's not 
something 
new. That's something we have been focusing on for a long time.
 
Operator
 
Our next question comes from Jason Helfstein with Oppenheimer.
 
Jason Helfstein
 
Hi. Thanks. Two questions. One, just if you can clarify any impact of the Fire 
phone in the quarter? And
 
then secondly, can you talk about how fuel prices 
impact your model? And I know the shippers, they use a trailing index to 
calculate fuel, how those savings would show up? Or if you would pass those 
on to third parties, et cetera? Thanks.
 
Tom Szkutak
 
Yes.
 
I don't have really any callout for the Fire phone. We continue to sell. I 
had mentioned, we have a little bit over $80 million of inventory at the end 
of the Q3 and it will continue to sell through that in Q4. In terms of fuel 
prices, not a lot to callou
t there in terms of impact on the quarter. Certainly, 
over a long period of time, if it's sustainable we should see some benefits 
there.
 
Operator
 
Our next question comes from Gene Munster of Piper Jaffray.
 
Gene Munster
 
Good afternoon. Over the past couple of years, it's just been a little bit of a 
roller coaster with margins for investors. There is points of optimism 
followed by points of frustration and there is really some optimism here in 
this report. Is there anythin
g that you can help investors with to understand 
just how you think about different cycles of investing to try to smooth out 
some of this roller coaster mentality that happens with the stock? Thanks.
 
Tom Szkutak
 
Well, in terms of, I would describe it this 
way, Gene, we have a lot of 
opportunities in front of us that we have talked about and we are also being 
selective with those opportunities. We have added lot of resources over the 
past few years. We certainly have been in the heavy investment cycle. I 
men
tioned earlier we are in the process of finalizing our plan for 2015. We 
always put energy into various productivity measures but we are putting, 
the team is putting even more focus on those efforts as we finalize our 2015 
plans. We will have to see where 
that ends up, but we are putting more 
energy and focus around our various fixed productivity or expense 
productivity, efficiency projects and again a wide range of different activities. 
And so that's what we are doing and you will have to stay tuned to see
 
how 
that progresses as we go.
 
Operator
 
Our next question comes from Ross Sandler with Deutsche Bank.
 
Ross Sandler
 
Hi. Thanks, Tom. I have two questions. First on India, can you talk about the 
India opportunity broadly and maybe some advantages you may hav
e 
versus some of the local peers in terms of leveraging your scale? That 
market appears to be just on fire right now. So just a little bit of color on 
India.
 
And then on Prime, can you talk about the Prime member behavior in terms 
of purchasing frequency? 
How it looks today versus may be a Prime member 
that joined two years ago? I know it looks a lot different from those very 
early Prime adopters from six, seven years ago. But just more recently, over 
the last couple of years, is the behavior consistent as 
you grow the base? 
Thanks.
 
Tom Szkutak
 
Sure. In terms of India, we think it's very, very early. We are investing 
certainly in India and we think it's a very interesting opportunity. We have a 
very good team there and we are excited to participate. Again we
 
think it is 
very early and so we like the opportunity there.
 
In terms of Prime, there is not a lot I can help you with on that. But what I 
would say is this, certainly as you think about customers who are not Prime 
that become Prime, we see a very sizable
 
step up their purchasing patterns. 
And so the customers are certainly buying a lot more from us. And one of 
the things that we are seeing, another thing that we are seeing is certainly, 
as Jeff references and I quote, ""Prime has evolved. It is both a phys
ical and 
digital offering. It's unique that way.""
 
We see, for example, although it's still very early and we are learning and 
investing in this area, but I take video content, for example, what we see is 
customers that come in who come in through our Prime
 
pipeline for video for 
free trial, those customers are converting at higher rates than other 
channels. We see that customers that are video streamers, even though we 
have high renewal rates, they are renewing at even higher rates than 
others. We see those
 
people who were customers who were streaming have 
very similar purchase patterns on the physical product side as those who 
don't.
 
And so we view that as a positive. So it's very integrated from a customer 
experience standpoint which we think is 
great. And so those are the things 
that we are seeing in Prime right now. And with Prime being almost 10 years 
old, growing at 53% year
-
over
-
year on a sizable base, tens of millions, we 
think is very interesting. It's something that we are very focused on 
as we 
continue forward.
 
Operator
 
Our next question comes from Eric Sheridan with UBS Investment Research.
 
Eric Sheridan
 
Thanks for taking the question. On the topic of China, I wanted to know if 
you could help us either qualitatively or quantitatively unde
rstand what the 
trajectory or the size of the business is in China? And then maybe the 
trajectory around investments needed to compete in China? And how you 
think about the opportunity there long
-
term, looking through the lens of the 
competitive landscape 
and maybe Amazon's particular skill set on going to 
market in China? Thanks.
 
Tom Szkutak
 
Sure. We haven't broken out the size of the business. I can't help you much 
there, but we continue to work on the customer experience there. The team 
has some interest
ing ideas that you will have to stay tuned on, of how to 
make that experience better. And we continue to work on it. So there is not 
a lot more that I can add to that.
 
Operator
 
Our next question comes from John Blackledge with Cowen and Company.
 
John Black
ledge
 
Great. Thanks. Just a couple of questions. In North American media, aside 
from the video game impact, just wondering if there are any other factors 
driving the low or flattish growth year
-
over
-
year? And then, CapEx was up 
about 40% in 2014. It's kind
 
of bounced around over the years. Just 
wondering if you can give us a sense of the level of growth in 2015? Thanks.
 
Tom Szkutak
 
Sure. In terms of the North American media, a number of different certainly 
puts and takes there, but certainly by far the bigg
est one is the one I called 
out, which is the video game console. So if you look at the growth rate in Q4 
last year, meaning 2013 and Q4 2014, you see a big difference. And the 
biggest, the most sizable difference there is certainly the video game 
consoles
 
portion and the video games associated with those. So another way 
to say it is, the video game consoles and video games portion of that is 
down year
-
over
-
year and obviously years ago we put the videogame 
consoles as part of North American media to keep it
 
with video games and 
they are larger ASP items as well that go in there. So certainly having an 
impact on that one when you look at the growth or when you compare Q4 
2013 growth to Q4 2014 growth there.
 
In terms of CapEx, we are not giving guidance on the
 
2015 spend, but given 
the high usage rates that we have had in web services, you should expect 
that we will be spending CapEx to support that growth and we will certainly 
be adding new fulfillment centers as we go. Also keep in mind that we do 
also financ
e capital. So if you look at our capital lease activity point to that, 
that's also increased in activity over the last few years. Certainly a number 
of different types of CapEx that go into that financing, but the biggest piece 
is certainly infrastructure 
to support our business primarily on the AWS side. 
So again that's also included in that number.
 
Operator
 
Our next question comes from Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs.
 
Heath Terry
 
Great. Thanks. Tom, I was hoping you could give us some kind of sense of 
the 
impact on delivery times and conversion rates that you saw during this 
holiday season from the investments that you made in fulfillment, 
particularly the sortation centers that were added before the holidays? And 
then also, to what degree you have seen som
e leverage, or some of the 
slower growth in fulfillment costs from moving more of the fulfillment 
obligation to first party owned infrastructure?
 
Tom Szkutak
 
Sure. In terms of the sort centers and I would say, just in addition to sort 
centers, what's happe
ned over the course of last several years is, with all 
the fulfillment centers that we have added, we have actually invested gotten 
selection closer to customers. And so that's helped us from a delivery speed 
standpoint. It's helped us from a cost standpoi
nt in terms of transportation 
cost being closer to customers. And so you it's a natural result of the 
footprint that we have added.
 
In terms of sortation centers, there is a lot of different benefits of that. But 
certainly one of them is, as you get closer
 
and closer, certainly throughout 
the year, it's helped us with holiday deliveries, it's helped us with Sunday 
deliveries and as we have closer to, in this case December to the end of 
holidays, it's certainly helped us from a delivery to the customer stand
point. 
So we are very pleased with the performance of those sortation centers. And 
really the global team of fulfillment team around the world, I think they did a 
terrific job during the holiday season as they did throughout the year.

Our next que
stion comes from Mark Miller with William Blair and Company.
 
Mark Miller
 
Hi. Good afternoon. There's quite a disparate performance between North 
America and international in terms of the profit change year
-
on
-
year, up 
nearly $300 million, North America dow
n over $100 million. So could you 
just help us understand why the international performance is so much 
weaker? Perhaps give us some color on the established markets in Europe 
relative to emerging markets. In the past, you have also discussed Japan. 
And the
n, is there an inflection point where international profits we could 
expect to head up again?
 
Tom Szkutak
 
Sure. The first one is, certainly the growth rates are slower in international 
versus North America, certainly would have an impact. The second, as we
 
continue to invest in international in terms of adding capacity for 
infrastructure, for fulfillment capacity, as you know, if you look at our 
international growth rates, the unit growth rates are actually growing at a 
higher rate than revenue. And then em
erging geographies. We talked about 
India earlier. Very excited about India. We are investing in India. We are 
also investing in China. So those are certainly impacting the results as well.

Our next question comes from Justin Post with Bank of 
America Merrill 
Lynch.
 
Justin Post
 
Great. Thank you. I wanted to ask about gross margins. They were up quite 
a bit year
-
over
-
year and it looks like, in our numbers, EGM beat and media 
missed. So any thoughts on the mix shift there helping or hurting gross 
margins? What are the key drivers for that line and can AWS continue to 
drive that in 2015? Thank you.
 
Tom Szkutak
 
Certainly, AWS mix of business is having an impact. AWS is certainly part of 
that and impacting that. Also just to keep in mind, our third
-
pa
rty unit 
growth is growing at a faster rate than retail and so certainly that's having 
an impact. And then obviously, continuing to lower prices for customers as 
well as working with our partners on the vendor side to support those 
activities from a pricin
g standpoint. So those are the dynamics. And in terms 
of 2015 beyond the guidance that we are giving, there is not a lot of callout 
there, but we have had a great success of being able to grow our retail 
offerings. Our marketplace side has grown very nicel
y over the years 
including 2014. The team has done a great job there. Fulfilled by Amazon, in 
terms of number of sellers, continue to grow there. The percentage of paid 
physical units are approximately 40%, a little over 40% of the total there. 
So that's b
ecome much more meaningful over the past several years. So 
very happy about that. So all those contribute to the numbers that you just 
talked about.

Our next question comes from Colin Sebastian with Robert W. Baird.
 
Colin Sebastian
 
Great. Good aft
ernoon. One question as a follow
-
up on AWS and specifically 
some of the announcements related to WorkMail and WorkSpaces. This 
would signal that Amazon is moving up the stack towards a more of a SaaS 
offering. Is that the right interpretation? And if so, s
hould we expect a 
broadening of those SaaS product initiatives? Thank you.
 
Tom Szkutak
 
I am very happy to make a launch that you mentioned, we think it's 
exciting. It's certainly, you know we are excited overall about web services 
offerings. The team has d
one an incredible job in terms of innovation as well 
as operating these large services that scale. So they are doing a terrific job. 
In terms of what we might or might not do in the future, we are not talking

Ben Schachter
 
Tom, can you just give any color on how you are evaluating the 
opportunities to show video advertising against the ever

anks.
 
Tom Szkutak
 
We really aren't using advertising too much in that area. You have seen it a 
little bit on some of our original content but beyond that we really can't 
comment. We think the experience we have is great for customers. We get a 
lot of posit
ive feedback on the content that we have there and the 
uninterrupted content, if you will. And so I wouldn't speculate on what we 
might or might not do there. But we are getting great feedback from

Bri

Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
 
Thanks, Phil. I'll begin with comments on our first quarter financial results. 
Trailing 12
-
month operating cash flow increased 44% to $11.3 billion. 
Trailing 12
-
month free cash flow increas
ed to $6.4 billion, up from $3.2 
billion. Trailing 12
-
month free cash flow less lease principal repayment 
increased to $3.5 billion, up from $1.5 billion. Trailing 12
-
month free cash 
flow less finance lease principal repayment and assets acquired under cap
ital 
leases increased to $1.6 billion, up from an outflow of $1.2 billion. Trailing 
12
-
month capital expenditures were $4.9 billion.
 
Capital expenditures do not include the impact of property and equipment 
acquired under capital and finance lease obligatio
n. These capital 
expenditures and capital leases reflect additional investments in support of 
continued business growth due to investment in technology infrastructure, 
the majority of which is to support AWS, and additional capacity to support 
our fulfillm
ent operations. A combination of common stock and stock
-
based 
awards outstanding was 490 million shares, compared with 483 million one 
year ago.
 
Worldwide revenue increased 28% to $29.1 billion or 29% excluding the 
$210 million unfavorable impact from year
-
over
-
year changes in foreign 
exchange. Worldwide active customer accounts, excluding customers who 
only had preorders in the preceding 12
-
month period, exceeded $285 
million. Worldwide paid unit growth was 27%. Worldwide seller units 
represented 48% of pa
id units.
 
Now, I'll talk about our segment results. In the first quarter of 2016, we 
began to allocate stock
-
based compensation and other operating expense 
net to our segment results. These amounts are combined and titled stock
-
based compensation and other
 
in our segment results and reflect the way 
we now evaluate our business performance and manage our operations. For 
reference, this quarter, I'll also mention segment operating income excluding 
stock
-
based compensation and other.
 
In the North America segme
nt, revenue grew 27% to $17 billion. Media 
revenue grew 8% to $3.2 billion. EGM revenue grew 32% to $13.5 billion. 
North America segment operating income, including stock
-
based 
compensation and other, was $588 million, a 3.5% operating margin 
compared with
 
$254 million in the prior year. This includes $5 million of 
favorable impact from foreign exchange. North America segment operating 
income before stock
-
based compensation and other was $924 million, a 
5.4% operating margin compared with $517 million in th
e prior year.
 
In the International segment, revenue grew 24% to $9.6 billion. Excluding 
the $177 million year
-
over
-
year unfavorable foreign exchange impact, 
revenue growth was 26%. Media revenue increased 7% to $2.5 billion or 9% 
excluding foreign exchange
. EGM revenue grew 31% to $7 billion or 33% 
excluding foreign exchange. International segment operating loss, including 
stock
-
based compensation and other, was $121 million, compared with a 
loss of $194 million in the prior year. This includes $21 million 
of favorable 
impact from foreign exchange. International segment operating income 
before stock
-
based compensation and other was $20 million, compared with 
a loss of $76 million in the prior year.
 
In the Amazon Web Services segment, revenue grew 64% to $2.6
 
billion. 
Amazon Web Services segment operating income, including stock
-
based 
compensation and other, was $604 million, a 23.5% operating margin 
compared with $195 million in the prior year. This includes $24 million of 
favorable impact from foreign exchan
ge. Amazon Web Services segment 
operating income before stock
-
based compensation and other was $716 
million, a 27.9% operating margin compared with $265 million in the prior 
year. Our operating income includes stock
-
based compensation expense and 
other ope
rating expense. Operating income was $1.1 billion or 3.7% of 
revenue, up approximately 260 basis points year
-
over
-
year. This includes 
$50 million of favorable impact from foreign exchange.
 
Consolidated segment operating income before stock
-
based compensati
on 
and other was $1.7 billion or 5.7% of revenue, compared to $706 million in 
the prior year. Our income tax expense was $475 million. Net income was 
$513 million or $1.07 per diluted share, compared with a net loss of $57 
million or a loss of $0.12 per di
luted share.
 
Turning to the balance sheet, cash and marketable securities increased $2.1 
billion year
-
over
-
year to $15.9 billion. Inventory increased 30% to $9.6 
billion and inventory turns were 8.6, down from 8.8 turns a year ago as we 
expand selection, i
mproved in
-
stock levels and introduced new product 
categories. Accounts payable increased 26% to $15 billion, and accounts 
payable days increased to 72 from 70 in the prior year.
 
I'll conclude my portion of today's call with guidance. Incorporated into our
 
guidance are the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe 
today to be appropriately conservative assumptions. Our results are 
inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, 
including a high level of uncertainty su
rrounding exchange rate fluctuations 
as well as changes in global economic conditions and customer spending, 
world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce and cloud 
services, and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC.
 
It's not 
possible to accurately predict demand and therefore, our actual results could 
differ materially from our guidance.
 
As we describe in more detail on our public filings, issues such as settling 
intercompany balances in foreign currencies among our 
subsidiaries, 
unfavorable resolution of legal matters and changes to our effective tax rate 
can all have a material effect on our results. Our guidance further assumes 
that we don't conclude any additional business acquisition, investments, 
restructurings 
or legal settlements, record any further revisions to stock
-
based compensation estimates, and that foreign exchange rates remain 
approximately where they've been recently.
 
For Q2 2016, we expect net sales of between $28 billion and $30.5 billion, or 
growth
 
of between 21% and 32%. This guidance anticipates approximately 
70 basis points of favorable impact from foreign exchange rates. Operating 
income to be between $375 million and $975 million compared with $464 
million in the second quarter of 2015. This in
cludes approximately $825 
million for stock
-
based compensation and other operating expense net. We 
are grateful to our customers and remain heads
-
down focused on driving a 
better customer experience. We believe putting customers first is the only 
reliable 
way to create lasting value for shareholders.
 
Thanks. And with that, Phil, let's move on to questions.
 
Phil Hardin

Director, Investor Relations
 
Great. Thanks, Brian. Let's move on to the Q&A portion of the call. Operator, 
will you please remind our liste
ners how to initiate a question?
 
Question
-
and
-
Answer Session
 
Operator
 
At this time, we will now open the call up for questions. Thank you. Our first 
question is from Mark May of Citi. Please state your question.
 
Mark A. May

Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
 
(Broker)
 
Thanks a lot. Lots here, but international retail revenue 

 
the international 
retail segment really stood out. Revenue accelerated. Seemed like a bit of a 
milestone also that the CSOI turned positive in a non
-
Q4 quarter. Can you 
shed any more 
light in what the key driver there was and how sustainable it 
is? And AWS, just mathematically, the comps get tougher starting in Q2, 
just given what happened in 2014. Is that something that we should be 
taking into account in terms of thinking about how t
he rest of the year may 
progress? Thanks.
 
Brian T. Olsavsky 
-
 
Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
 
Sure. Your first question on international, yes, all three segments had very 
strong growth in the quarter. International's 26% FX
-
neutral growth
 
rate 
was actually the strongest we've seen in three and a half years. I would 
attribute it to the Prime flywheel. As we may have mentioned in the past, we 
feel that Europe and large countries in Europe and Japan are a few years 
behind the U.S. on a lot of
 
the key Prime metrics, but we also said last year 
that Prime subscriptions were up 51% year
-
over
-
year in 2015, 47% in the 
U.S. and a higher rate than that internationally. So certainly, a lot going on 
in international, a lot that's really good, adding Pri
me subscribers at a high 
clip, continuing to add selection at FBA sellers. So you'll see devices, you see 
video content. So it's the whole array of Prime offering, Prime Now, Same
-
Day. Everything is in Europe. It may be getting there a little slower than t
he 
starting point in the U.S. but we see it really showing up in customer 
engagement and customer purchases.
 
On the AWS side, I think the 2016 to 2015 comparison probably stands on 
its own and 2014 falls by the wayside, so I would encourage you to look at 
recent trends. We don't forecast obviously by segment.
 
Operator
 
Our next question comes from Douglas Anmuth, JPMorgan. Please state your 
question.
 
Douglas T. Anmuth 
-
 
JPMorgan Securities LLC
 
Thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to ask you about unit
 
growth 
overall and if we look back over the last three quarters, you've accelerated it 
now to a materially higher level than what we saw in 2014 and the first half 
of 2015, and I realize in 3Q last year you had Prime Day. But I just was 
hoping you could c
omment on the overall acceleration we've seen here and 
key drivers behind that? And if there's something different perhaps than 
what you talked about on international? And then just also on AWS and can 
you just talk about the underlying drivers here of mar
gins and thinking 
about that a little bit going forward primary sources of leverage? And as you 
open up six new regions in coming months, should we expect this to be 
constant build
-
out or something that's more lumpy over time and more in 
waves? Thanks.
 
Phi
l Hardin 
-
 
Director, Investor Relations
 
This is Phil Hardin. I'll take the units question. So really the units are driven 
by very similar trends to what Brian described. I think when we look at the 
bridges for revenue, and obviously units are a key driver 
of revenue, things 
like Prime are key in that bridge. I would also call out selection growth, 
that's been a big area of focus for us. And one important way we drive 
selection is through FBA, and so we continue to be very pleased with the 
progress we're mak
ing in FBA. What that means for our Prime customers is 
there's more for them to choose from, obviously that gives them more they 
can purchase, it makes Prime more valuable. For sellers, it means they sell 
more. And so I would say that FBA is helping drive 
some of the selection 
growth we're seeing here, so selection growth and Prime though are two 
very key drivers of our growth.
 
On the second part, I think that, Brian...
 
Brian T. Olsavsky 
-
 
Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
 
Yeah, one other co
mment I didn't say earlier, I do want to point out that 
because of the leap year there's an extra day in Q1. Every company would 
have seen this obviously, but we estimated it was worth about 150 basis 
points to our growth rate revenue. That would be consis
tent with North 
America and international. Your other comment was on 

 
or question was on 
AWS and a bit about margins and margin outlook. We're very pleased with 
the quarter, we came in at 23.5% operating margin on a 

 
the new basis 
including stock
-
based c
ompensation and other. We're very pleased. But 
stepping back with the 64% growth in AWS which is now a $10 billion 
business, but on the margin side, I would caution you that we're pleased but 
it is very early to start drawing too many conclusions on the lo
ng
-
term 
margins in this business, they'll be bumpy over time. At any point in time 
they're going to reflect the balance of investing including global expansion 
that he's talked about, price reductions we may offer, and also driving cost 
efficiency, which f
or us is a very important driver in not only this business 
but also the North America and international segments.
 
Operator
 
Our next question is from Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs. Please state 
your question.
 
Heath Terry 
-
 
Goldman Sachs & Co.
 
Great. Thanks
. Looking at the active customer account number, it looks like 
growth slowed pretty significantly, about 10 percentage points. Just curious 
if you can give us a sense of anything that might be throwing that number 
off, assuming we're reading it the right w
ay? And then, as you roll out on 
AWS 

 
as you roll out the fixed new Availability Zones over the course of this 
year, is there a way to quantify what kind of an impact that's going to have 
on the capacity at AWS?
 
Phil Hardin 
-
 
Director, Investor Relations
 
So I'll take the first part of your question about active customers. So as we 
look at our metrics and what information we provide each year, we often 
make some changes. So this quarter, we only gave the active customers 
with a paid purchase in the trailing
 
12 months, and so that number was 
more than $285 million. I think that's pretty similar to the trends that we've 
seen in that metric.
 
Now in the past, sometimes we had also given a total active customers 
count, and so that number for this quarter was over
 
$310 million. So that 
may be where you're making the statement about the slowdown in growth, 
but the trajectory was very similar from prior quarters for both of those 
numbers. But we opted just to give the other one, but you now have the 
number for the to
tal number of customers.
 
Brian T. Olsavsky 
-
 
Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
 
And on your AWS footprint question, so we ended the quarter with 33 
Availability Zones in 12 geographic regions, and we have five 

 
11 more 
Availability Zones op
ening in the next year. The impact on capital, yes, there 
will be additional capital investment as we built out those zones. Some of it 
has already taken place. But I will also say that by and large, the largest 
increases in capital leases is to support th
e growth of incremental usage of 
customers we have now and agreements we have now. So 

 
and you should 
expect to see us continue to invest and support this business. We're very, 
very 

 
we have a leadership position, we intend to maintain it and we're 
very 
excited about where we are.
 
Operator
 
Our next question is from Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Please state 
your question.
 
Brian Nowak 
-
 
Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
 
Two, please. The first one is on Prime. You've two straight years of around 
50% Prime subscri
ber growth. Just curious about how you think about keys 
to driving Prime sub
-
growth going forward and the thought process behind 
the reported monthly Prime subscription?
 
And the second one on logistics investments, so there's been a lot about 
truck investm
ents and logistics investments. Any comments at all about 
learnings and what you're seeing from some of the investments in your truck 
fleet and your own delivery network? Thanks.
 
Brian T. Olsavsky 
-
 
Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
 
Yeah, let me start with the Prime. Yes, we have had very strong growth the 
last two years and earlier, obviously on Prime growth of members. I would 
say it's a culmination of a lot of separate investments that we're making. So 
if you look at the success of
 
our devices, we are seeing tablets where we 
sold twice the volume in Q1 year
-
over
-
year. Fire TV Stick, you may have 
read in our press release that it has greater than 100,000 customer reviews, 
the most reviewed product ever, 62,000 or over 62,000 of those
 
reviews are 
five
-
star reviews. We've not only had the Echo, but we have the Echo Dot 
and Tab, so we're branching off that product line and having trouble keeping 
those in stock.
 
And of course we launched the new Kindle Oasis e
-
reader. So that is an 
import
ant part of the story. As it is with digital content, you may have seen 
the recent announcements that we're working on a great amount of new 
content for Prime members. We love the 

 
customers love the content and 
we like the results we see, particularly ar
ound Prime free trial conversion 
and renewal rates for subscribers who use and take advantage of Prime.
 
So beyond the awards that the content is winning and the success we're 
having with Amazon, particularly our Amazon Originals, we feel that 
program is wo
rking. We're going to significantly increase our spend in that 
area. Some of that is in Q2, you'll see that more in the next few quarters. 
But we think that's working and look forward to bringing a lot of new content 
to our Prime subscriber base, both thro
ugh our normal Prime subscription 
and also the monthly plan that you alluded to.

This is Phil Hardin and I'll jump in on the second part of your question. So 
for the trucks, it 

 
really it's trailers. The typical 
use case is running a lag 
between a fulfillment center and a sort center. So we're running enough 
volume there that we're using trucks already. We thought it made sense to 
go ahead and buy some trailers, we're actually still contracting out for the 
truck p
art. And it gives us flexibility, we think the economics will make sense 
over time.
 
Similarly, we've announced an agreement to lease some airplanes with Air 
Transport Services Group, an agreement to lease up to 20 Boeing 767s 
there, and similar use case, i
t's products that are already boxed. And we 
think again, this is activities we've been doing already which need to grow at 
a very rapid rate. This gives us extra capacity and we think it's good to be 
able to deliver to customers, and we think it makes sens
e over the long
-
term.

RBC Capital Markets LLC
 
Great. Two questions related to Prime overseas. Could you talk about the 
status of Prime in 
international markets? How far rolled out it is in most of 
your major markets? And then, you talk about Prime flywheels, and you did 
last year. But it seems likes those flywheels spun faster than you expected 
in the fourth quarter of last year that caused 
some near
-
term expense issues 
for you? Can you talk about how you're thinking about planning against that 
as the Prime flywheels are getting broader for you, how do you try to get 
ahead of that into the peak season later this year? Thank you.
 
Brian T. Olsa
vsky 
-
 
Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
 
Yeah, sure. Let me 

 
this is Brian. Let me start with the second question 
first. It wasn't necessarily the Prime flywheel that was the issue, it was more 
the FBA demand that we had from FBA sellers f
or space in our warehouses. 
We were very full. It was a high
-
class problem to have. But it 

 
as I 
mentioned last quarter, it did result in higher fulfillment costs in the fourth 
quarter as a result, and I think you'll see some of that dissipated now in Q1,
 
so you could tell it was a Q4 issue. We learn from every Q4, this one was no 
exception. We are already making plans for a smoother Q4 next year. We 
will continue to add fulfillment capacity, we will work with FBA sellers on 
inventory stocking and timing a
nd we think that there's things that we can 
do better as we do every year, come out of fourth quarter with immense 
learnings.
 
Phil Hardin

Director, Investor Relations
 
This is Phil. On the Prime question, we launched Prime in the U.S. in 2005, 
followed th
at in 2007 with U.K., Germany, Japan, and then other countries 
after. We have Prime in all of the countries where we have Marketplaces 
with the exception of Mexico, China and India. And Prime is really in varying 
stages in those countries. We have some kin
d of an expedited shipping offer 
in all of them. Here in the U.S., we've been talking quite a bit about Prime 
Now, that's also in Italy and Japan and the U.K. at this point and not others, 
also varying levels of digital benefits as well.
 
So, generally, the
 
international countries are not as far along with selection 
or the fullness of the digital offers. We've got Prime Video in the U.K., in 
Germany and Japan. Music is not fully rolled out yet to all of the others 
there. So that's where we are with Prime.

Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC
 
Thank you. I have two. I think it's the first time since 1Q 2011 that we see 
tech and content as a percentag
e of revenue declining or flat. Is this just a 
sign of your inability to increase investment in line with revenue growth? Or 
is there something else going on and if yes, what?
 
And secondly, Brian, you said that the growth of Prime has been driven by 
invest
ments you have made and are making. And you gave the examples of 
devices that you guys are selling. I think it's a mathematical certainty that 
Prime subscribers will decelerate in North America at some point from 50% 
growth. As penetration increases and gr
owth slows, will we see a 
deceleration in the investment levels? And in other words, how do we think 
about the effect of deceleration in Prime on the North American margin 
structure in the future? Thank you.
 
Brian T. Olsavsky 
-
 
Senior Vice President and Ch
ief Financial Officer
 
Sure. Let me start with that second one. So we think there's a lot of room to 
grow in not only our international countries, but also in the U.S. So we plan 
on continuing to build the benefits of the Prime program from music to 
video, 
to two
-
day shipping, to same
-
day shipping, to Prime Now. So I don't 
see that dissipating. And again, it remains the best deal in retail. So 
hopefully everyone signs up for that.
 
On the tech and content question, I don't have a lot to call out in the 
quarte
r. I would say there's no let
-
up in the pace of invention here, 
particularly on the AWS side. We usually quote the number of new features 
and services to you each quarter, we had 214 in Q1, up from 170 the first 
quarter of last year. So over 26% growth in 
this quarter alone coming off a 
year where I believe the number was 722 significant new features and 
services delivered for AWS customers last year.

Yeah, sure. Thanks. Actually, I just returned from India where I spent a 
week with our teams in Bangalore and Hyderabad. We're breaking ground on 
a new 10

acre campus there. So we are solidifying and increasing our 
investment in India on all fronts. I had 
a chance to see firsthand the level of 
invention going on with both customers and sellers, making deliveries to 
customers, seeing the I Have Space program we have with merchants. It's a 
very exciting time in India and again, the invention is off the charts
. We are 
inventing things in India that do not exist in other parts of the country 

 
excuse me, parts of the world. And the team there is one of our best.
 
You can see it in some of the external commentary as well. For the second 
year in a row customers sel
ected Amazon India as Amazon's most trusted 
online shopping brand. During the quarter, we rolled out a feature called 
Tatkal which is a studio on wheels that we go to the sellers to help them sign 
up. We let them do registration, imaging, catalog, uploads 
and basic seller 
training. So we're taking it to the sellers, taking the business to the sellers. 
We've already reached sellers in 25 cities and we're really helping them 
expand their business not only within their home region, but throughout the 
whole cou

negative. We have, as I said earlier, selection expansion, infrastructure

Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
 
Great. I just had two questions on AWS. First, last fall at re:Inven
t, you guys 
disclosed that data management revenue was at a $1 billion run rate. So can 
you provide an update on that figure? And maybe just talk about how much 
of AWS revenue today is outside of the storage and compute layers.
 
And then the second question
 
is on the AWS margin. So I think everybody is 
trying to learn more about the structural long
-
term margin, and it was down 
a tad quarter
-
on
-
quarter. So is that solely from FX impact? Or was there 
some seasonality of expenses? Any color on what's driving th
e AWS margin 
and how we should think about that over the longer term? Thank you.
 
Brian T. Olsavsky 
-
 
Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
 
I'll take your second question first. So again, we had margin expansion year
-
over
-
year that was quite sig
nificant, from 12.4% to 23.5%. But again, it's 
very early in this business. We're very pleased with the results we're seeing 
on the top and bottom line, but margins are going to be bumpy and affected 
by levels of investing, price reductions and also cost e
fficiencies that we're 
driving. So quarter
-
to
-
quarter, it will vary. We are concerned at this point 
about capital efficiency, returning price to customers periodically with price 
reductions and adding feature sets for them to make the business more 
valuabl
e.
 
Phil Hardin

This is Phil. For your other part of your question, we're not providing an

strong revenue growth across their suite of products. The fast

product in their history is actually Aurora, the new database. So we're very 
excited about what we're seeing in that space but we're not breaking out the

Eric J. Sheridan

UBS Securities LLC
 
Thanks for taking the question. Looking at the gross margin, impressive 
performance in Q1. There were a few headwinds it looked like in gross 
margin in 
Q4. Wanted to understand how we should think about the puts 
and takes in gross margin, it has evolved to be a much higher number over 
the last couple of years, what some of the puts and takes are going forward 
especially with respect to content costs? Than
ks.
 
Brian T. Olsavsky 
-
 
Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
 
Sure. So I don't have a forecast for you on content costs in isolation or really 
forward looks on anything besides the guidance I've given you. But, yes, it 
hits in the gross margin,
 
content costs do show up there. I think the bigger 
issues that you should look at in gross margin, and again starting with the 
comment that we expanded by 300 basis points year
-
over
-
year, that is 
really driven by, first of all, the AWS growth and again, $
10 billion business 
growing 64% is very 

 
we're very pleased with that and that affects gross 
margin as well.
 
The other bigger element though is the third
-
party contribution. Third
-
party 
units are now up to 48% of paid units and that's up 400 basis points 
year
-
over
-
year, so that continues to be a factor in gross margin. Again, we book 
that on a net basis. The third
-
party revenue, it's a positive factor in gross 
margin and can be a negative factor in fulfillment costs and some of the 
other metrics.
 
Phil Hard
in

Director, Investor Relations
 
This is Phil. Also just to jump in. The gross margin is not the primary metric 
we use to measure the business. We are much more focused on free cash 
flow dollars and operating profit dollars. So there are a whole lot of mo
ving 
parts in gross margin, and Brian mentioned a lot of them. But it's not a 
primary metric for us.

So, we're very excited about the advertising business, and we think it's still 
very early days for this opportunity. So it's an offering we've been working 
on. We're trying to take a very customer
-
centric approach. You probably 
noticed some changes in the treatment on the website. And we did move 
away from text ads and product ads in
 
favor of some of the other newer 
products. And we are really excited about the opportunity there is for third
-
party sellers, and for other vendors on the site. But we are not breaking out 
numbers today.
 
Phil Hardin

In Prime 
Now, we are now in 30 metro areas, really from a standing start 16 
months ago when we opened our first Prime Now location and it's now a 
worldwide business in the U.S., U.K., Italy and Japan. So the five cities we 
added in the first quarter were Raleigh, N
orth Carolina, Cincinnati, Tampa, 
Liverpool, England, and Osaka, Japan. So, yeah, how do we feel about that 
business? Again, it offers tens of thousands of daily essential products. We 
think it's a service that customers like, certainly is hard for compani
es to do. 
We think the natural evolution of our operations network and our scale gives 
us a chance to do this and we are happy to invest in it as a service for our 
customers. We are taking a long

Credit Suisse Securities (

Okay. Hi. Thanks. So your capital lease
-
driven property and equipment 
acquis
itions is down again year
-
over
-
year. So, will you help tie this to 
perhaps the overall usage growth at AWS? Or maybe the changing nature of 
how your enterprise customers may be using the platform to be more 
compute versus storage or database
-
heavy? And I t
hink historically on the 
e
-
commerce side, you guys have been price followers as opposed to price 
leaders. AWS, you have been price leaders for the most part for actively 
taking down price. So, now, given your leadership position, do you think 
you'll contin
ue to be price leaders? Or do you think it's now time (35:09)?
 
Brian T. Olsavsky 
-
 
Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
 
Let me start with your CapEx question. So we like to look at both capital 
expenditures and capital leases because they are 
both essentially levels with 
our level of investment. Those totaled $9.5 billion in the trailing 12 months, 
and it was up 7% from the 12
-
month period ending this quarter last year. I 
will point out that the prior year was $6.1 billion. So we have stepped u
p 
investment, although it did not go up as much year
-
over
-
year this quarter, 
we are still spending almost $10 billion on what essentially is fulfillment 
capacity in support of really strong growth, unit growth and FBA, and global 
expansion and then also on
 
AWS, additional capacity for existing customers 
as they grow their business and also new regions.
 
We've been working and continue to work very hard on capital productivity. 
It's very important to us, and I attribute a good piece of the ability to keep 
tha
t at a modest growth rate year
-
over
-
year to our capital efficiency, and 
better purchasing across all capital and capital leases quite frankly. But 
again, we are spending almost $10 billion. So...
 
Phil Hardin 
-
 
Director, Investor Relations
 
And, Stephen, thi
s is Phil. Just to jump on the usage growth comment, we 
continue to see really strong usage growth. We are not in the business of 
raising prices, we lower prices for AWS, so there can be mix for products, 
but by and large, if you see our revenue growth, kn
ow that we are also 
lowering prices which means that by math, we are typically going to be 
growing usage at a very strong rate. So I just wanted to jump on that.

Great. Thanks. So the North American EGM segment outperformed our 
expectations of growth accelerating on a year

s
trong growth at massive scale, can you cite any key verticals that were 
particularly strong?

This is Phil. I'll take the EGM question first. So just to put numbers on that, 
the year
-
over
-
year in the U.S. or in North America was 32% growth, which 
was up from 28% in Q4. And the
re's not any single categories we're calling 
out there. To grow on a base that big, that kind of rate, you really need 
pretty strong performance across the board. So a lot of categories are selling 
a lot. And it's a lot of the drivers we talked about, as B
rian mentioned on the 
revenue growth side, Prime, selection, growth. And we also benefited from 
the extra day in the quarter due to the leap year, but strong performance 
from many of the categories.

Macquarie Capital (

First, congratulations on a great quarter. A couple on Prime and one on 
China. First, a point of 
clarification. You answered a previous question by 
saying that you will significantly increase investment in Prime. Was that in 
reference specifically to video or should we expect new types of offerings 
beyond video and music?
 
And then, secondly on 
Prime, membership is likely hitting some saturation 
levels for certain demographics in the U.S.? Do you intend to focus on more 
lower income households for growth there? And then finally, quickly on 
China, anything notable to call out there that's been dif
ferent over the recent 
past driving results, the free trade zone, et cetera?
 
Brian T. Olsavsky 
-
 
Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
 
I'll take the first question on content. Yes. My comment on Prime benefits 
was essentially one about video co
ntent and our investment there, not 
saying other investments may not go up as well, but that is the one that we 
are focusing on and that I called out.
 
On the comment about Prime, I guess what I'll call availability or...
 
Phil Hardin 
-
 
Director, Investor Re
lations
 
Saturation.
 
Brian T. Olsavsky 
-
 
Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
 
...saturation, yeah, I think that's one of the thoughts behind our monthly 
plan. We want to create flexibility for consumers to try Prime in a low
-
cost 
way, if that's
 
how they choose. We've always had our free trial program, but 
it is a hurdle for many people or there's a hesitancy to put up a full year's 
payment for a year of Prime. Annual is still going to be a better deal but we 
know that customers may try it more f
requently if it's a monthly plan, and 
that's what we're looking for. We know that once customers try it, generally, 
they'll really like it. So we think that will purge (40:38) some other 
demographic groups as well.
 
Phil Hardin 
-
 
Director, Investor Relation
s
 
This is Phil. Another comment on Prime. On your saturation question, keep 
in mind that even in the U.S., which is our most mature by years of launch, 
we still grew last year at 47% year
-
over
-
year membership growth, and we 
continue to make the program bet
ter and better. I think the monthly offers 
are great for flexibility, give people a chance to try new ways. And we 
continue to add content. We continue to add selection. Prime Now is a huge 
benefit that didn't even exist two years ago. So all these things 
are making 
the program better and we're still out trying to meet as many customers as 
possible. We're obviously very committed to driving Prime and it's important 
to the company.
 
Your question on China, probably the biggest thing to point to is more 
progre
ss and selection on the Amazon global store. So this is our website. 
This is the offer that allows Chinese customers to shop from the U.S. 
website, Amazon.com, with prices in RMB and with Chinese
-
language pages. 
So it's focused on really items that may be 
hard to get, and Amazon's really 
trying to become the trusted source for many of these goods. So really 
that's a big part of the focus. And if you've been tracking that number over 
time, we're now up over $10 million, which is good progress on that front.

Great. Thanks for taking the question. I want to go back to North America 
but this time just focus on margins. 5.5%, 5.4% m
argins, I think that's the 
highest level since maybe 2Q 2010 and resumes the margin expansion we 
saw really for most of last year. So just hoping we can understand 

 
help us 
understand a little bit more what's driving that? I'm sure the more mature 
Prime f
lywheel you mentioned that's happening in Europe. But is there 
anything else that's going on besides Prime flywheel, maybe more efficient 
shipping or things along those lines? Thanks.
 
Brian T. Olsavsky 
-
 
Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
 
I'
ll start. I think you see the growth rate of the segment at 27%. It's 
showing the success we're having with customers. When we grow at that 
clip, we can do a lot of good things it. We can 

 
on the cost side, we run our 
facilities more efficiently, we can b
uy better, we can look to in
-
source some 
things that we may have paid externally for. So, there's a number of things 
that we can do that I think will show up on the bottom line. But principally, 
what we're trying to do now is 

 
again, make the Prime experi
ences as 
strong as possible for consumers.
 
Phil Hardin

This is Phil. The other thing I would add to that is that the margin you see in 
any quarter is really the output of our rate of investment at some places and 
drive for ef
ficiencies in others. And we're not really trying to optimize for any 
particular number in a given quarter. We're just trying to make the best 
decisions we can to grow long
-
term free cash flow per share. And so, again, 
we're juggling the investment in the 
places where we feel like we have long
-
term opportunities where we need to invest with making sure we're getting 
continuously better in all our other processes at the same time.

Thank you for standing by. Good day, everyone, and welcome to the 
Amazon.com Q4 2018 Financial Results Teleconference. At this time, all 
participants are in a listen
-
only mode. After the presentation, we will 
conduct a 
question
-
and
-
answer session. Today's call is being recorded.
 
For opening remarks, I will be turning the call over to the Director of 
Investor Relations, Dave Fildes. Please go ahead.
 
Dave Fildes
 
Hello, and welcome to our Q4 2018 financial results conferenc
e call. Joining 
us today to answer your questions is Brian Olsavsky, our CFO. As you listen 
to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in 
front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and 
commentary on th
e quarter. Please note, unless otherwise stated, all 
comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period 
of 2017.
 
Our comments and responses to your questions reflect management's views 
as of today, January 31, 2019 only, and wil
l include forward
-
looking 
statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information 
about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in 
today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recen
t 
annual report on Form 10
-
K and subsequent filings.
 
During this call, we may discuss certain non
-
GAAP financial measures. In our 
press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the 
SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you w
ill find additional 
disclosures regarding these non
-
GAAP measures, including reconciliations of 
these measures with comparable GAAP measures.
 
Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we've seen to date and 
what we believe today to be appropriate ass
umptions. Our results are 
inherently unpredictable and maybe materially affected by many factors, 
including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic 
conditions and customer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the 
Interne
t, online commerce and cloud services, and the various factors 
detailed in our filings with the SEC.
 
Our guidance also assumes, among other things, that we don't conclude any 
additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings or legal 
settlement
s. It's not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and 
services, and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our 
guidance.
 
With that, we'll move to Q&A. Operator, please remind our listeners how to 
initiate a question.

Answer Session
 
Operator
 
[Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of 
Justin Post with Merrill Lynch.
 
Justin Post
 
Great. Thank you. I guess I'll ask about units, 14% in the quarter, just, how 
do you feel about the ove
rall unit growth here, given that the growth was 
higher last year in the 20s and do you think there are some investments you 
can make in other areas to kind of reaccelerate that going forward?
 
And then secondly, just if you could remind us or help us under
stand the 
Prime accounting change impact on subscription revenues in Q4? Thank you.
 
Brian Olsavsky
 
Take the subscription first.
 
Dave Fildes
 
Yeah. Hey, Justin, this is Dave. Just on the second question on the 

l, you probably remember, 
related to the adoption of the accounting standards update and revenue 
recognition policies that was impacting our results in a number of areas in 

subscr
iption services revenue due to the accounting change. So that's where 
we came out for the quarter. So you'll see that, we reported subscription 
services revenue increased 26% when you exclude FX. So the 300 million is 
certainly part of that decelerate 
--
 
t
he sequential deceleration in the growth 
rate in that line item.
 
Brian Olsavsky
 
Yeah. And on unit deceleration, I think the unit numbers more and more 
require some interpretation, because it doesn't include the 
--
 
some of our 
fastest growing areas, the thi
ngs like, as Dave mentioned, subscription 
services, AWS, advertising, Whole Foods units are not in that number. So we 
don't focus as much on the number and we direct you more to the 
supplemental revenue guidance that breaks out the component parts. But in 
general, we feel good about the growth in the quarter.
 
We think it was a, Q4 in particular was a great quarter for customers that 
retail, there is a lot of strength in the retail part of the businesses, the teams 
here had done a great job, planning, prepar
ing and then executing on the 
quarter. AWS maintained a very strong growth rate and continued to deliver 
for customers. We had a great Reinvent Conference in the quarter. So we 
feel good about the growth in the quarter and also the total revenue and 
income
.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney with 
RBC Capital Markets.
 
Mark Mahaney
 
Thanks. Just comment a little bit on the international revenue outlook and 
any commentary on India and whether you think there's a material i
mpact 
on your business?
 
Secondly, could you talk about advertising revenue, just qualitatively or 
quantitatively, how that's doing? And third, if I could, you spent a lot on 
marketing in the quarter, it's a real step up. Do you just want to talk about 
the 
ROI that you think you're getting on that marketing spend?
 
Brian Olsavsky
 
Sure, Mark. The first question is on India. Let me start with that. So we have 
incorporated into our guidance estimate, the best estimate we have for Q1 in 
India, however, there is 
much uncertainty as to what the impact of the 
government rule change is going to have on the e
-
commerce sector there. 
We remain committed to complying with all laws and regulations, we will, 
but we're evaluating the situation. Our main issue and our main c
oncern is 
trying to minimize the impact to our customers and sellers in India. We've 
built our business around price selection and convenience. We don't think 
the changes help in those dimensions for both the customers in India and 
also the sellers.
 
Dave, 

 
Dave Fildes
 
Yeah, yeah. I think I mean, we're continuing to 
--
 
there's a lot of focus on 
serving that customer set. One of the things we're trying to do is continually 
evolve our tools and the products to he
lp that customer set agencies, 
advertisers, make sure they've got a variety of ways to meet their goals. 
Some of the things we've done more recently over the last few months or so 
is expanded sponsor brands, placements, some rolled out new campaign 
reports
, so improved campaign manager features. So a number of 
--
 
there's 
a number of things beyond that, but features out there that are just going 
to, I think, make it easier for companies to grow with the ad tools and the 
ad services that we offer and we're co
ntinually excited about the opportunity 
there.
 
Brian Olsavsky
 
And then on your question of marketing, yes, the marketing percent of 
revenue was up 110 basis points year
-
over
-
year. This category also includes 
AWS sales and marketing and keep that in mind, b
ecause that's where a lot 
of our headcount investment is going. Headcount only grew 14% year
-
over
-
year, but the areas that were growing in that mix were things like 
technology teams, device areas, AWS, especially sales and marketing. So 
variable marketing 
was pretty consistent with prior periods and we feel good 
about our return on investment on the marketing, the variable marketing.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Doug Anmuth with 
JPMorgan.
 
Doug Anmuth
 
Great. Thank you. I just 
wanted to follow up on India, just bigger picture, 
Brian, do the new policies change your view at all of the attractiveness or 
the potential of operating in India and how do you think about your 
investment strategy there in the near term? And then also jus
t hoping you 
could talk about some of the impact in the US and UK from free shipping 
during the fourth quarter holidays?
 
Brian Olsavsky
 
Yeah. Really, we're still evaluating the situation in India. We feel very good 
about the long term prospects in India an
d doing a good job for both Indian 
customers and Indian sellers. The new regulations need to be interpreted, 
need to be 
--
 
need to make sure they don't have unintended consequences. 
And again, I don't think it's necessarily consistent with better price, be
tter 
selection and better convenience for the Indian customer. So it's not all we 
can say on that topic right now.
 
Dave Fildes
 
Yeah. And I think Doug, your second point was just around shipping, some 
of the shipping offers in the holiday. We did lower the 
free shipping 
threshold ahead in to the fourth quarter, so customers took advantage of 
that and that was a great offer for them in the holidays. Brian talked a little 
bit about it before, but pleased with the holiday season, both from sort of a 
first party
 
side, but also sellers continuing to do well. As part of the holiday 
offering, we sold a number of record breaking number of Alexa devices as 
well and I think just in that shipping vein, really pleased with the continued 
engagement from Prime members, we 
had the most ever number of Prime 
members sign up this quarter than any quarter we've had. So really pleased 
with that.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark May with Citi.
 
Mark May
 
Thank you. When I try to back out the impact f
actors like Whole Foods, the 
advertising accounting change and other factors, what I see is stable and 
pretty healthy revenue growth for the retail segment, but a slowdown in Q4 
from what seems to have been, in more recent quarters, meaningful gross 
margin
 
expansion in the retail segment. Can you discuss what may have 
driven that and how to think about retail gross margins going forward?
 
And then somewhat separately, retail margins last year benefited from 
several factors, including more modest hiring and m
ore modest growth in 
fulfillment center capacity, do you see these factors persisting this year? 
Thanks.
 
Dave Fildes
 
Yeah. Thank you. Let me start with that last part, because I think if we step 
back and put 2018 in perspective, there are some clear trends
 
regarding our 
cost structure. Starting with fulfillment costs, so in the prior two years, 
2016, and 2017, we had grown our square footage tied to fulfilment and 
shipping by greater than 30%. In 2018, that number grew by 15%. 
Certainly, unit demand was low
er, but AFN or Amazon Fulfilled demand 

banking, if you will, of some large expansions in the prior two years. 
Similarly on headcount, we grew headcount by 48% in 2016, 38% in 2017, 
if you ex
clude the acquisitions of Whole Foods and Souq, which drove the 
number up to closer to 68% I believe. Last year, we were at 14% growth. 
And so, there was a lot of leverage and a lot of, in a way, there was a lot of 
pre hiring in 2017 that we digested in 20
18, while we still continue, in some 
areas, especially things like our core retail business and also G&A functions, 
but then we continue to invest again in the technology tied to AWS sales 
team to an AWS device area. So their groups are growing considerabl
y 
higher than that 14%, but on total, the company grew 14%.
 
And then on capital, especially infrastructure capital, if you use the capital 
lease slide as maybe an indicator for what we have invested into our AWS 
business to support infrastructure and globa
l expansion, that number grew 
10% last year, when it had grown 69% in 2017. So in a lot of ways, 2018 
was about banking the efficiencies of investments in people, warehouses, 

continue 
to concurrently drive growth and customer offering and Prime 
benefits, we certainly do take costs seriously and we will continue to work on 
operational efficiencies. I would expect these investments to increase 
relative to 2018 and we've reflected what we 
see so far in Q1 in our 
guidance.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Heath Terry with 
Goldman Sachs.
 
Heath Terry
 
Great. Thank you. A little bit 
--
 
to dig a little bit deeper into the CapEx 
capital lease side of things, you guys ha
ve said in the past that generally you 
work to build in line with your expectations for guidance, so that you are 
trying not to over build or under build when thinking about your fulfilment in 
data center capacity. We saw that investment re
-
accelerate in t
he fourth 
quarter, after hitting the lows that you referenced in Q3. Anything to read 
into that about sort of what your expectations are for growth in those 
businesses, seeing that reacceleration after the deceleration that we saw 
over the course of at lea
st the first three quarters of last year.
 
Brian Olsavsky
 
Yeah. I see total CapEx that was 
--
 
grew 33% in Q1, 1% in Q2, negative 1% 
in Q3 and then positive 17% in Q4, just the quarter itself. So there was, as 
you say, a bit of investment in Q4 
relative to Q2 and Q3. I still think the 
17% is a low number for us, when you talk about the 
--
 
supporting the AWS 
business that's still growing in a very high clip and a very strong and healthy 
growth in FBA and customer demand and our expansion into new 
countries, 
both with AWS and also with our core consumer business. So I am not 
prepared to give you the forecast for the year right now. I would say that, I 
would consider 2018 to be a lighter investment year and the lighter year for 
adding fixed headcount
 
certainly compared to 2016 and 2017 we'll reveal 
that as we go through the year, but we've built into the first quarter what we 
expect in the first three months.
 
Operator
 
Our next question comes from the line of Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley.
 
Brian Nowa
k
 
Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. Just 
--
 
the first one is to go 
back to the fourth quarter gross margins. I think if we try to back out AWS, 
it looks like there was a little more gross margin pressure. Can you just talk 
to any of the puts and 
takes we should know about from a gross margin 
perspective in the fourth quarter and then that other line that I think 
includes the advertising business, can you just help us, any help at all on the 
growth of the advertising business or the impact of any o
f the accounting 
changes in the quarter? Thanks.
 
Brian Olsavsky
 

yeah, gross margins were well up 180 basis points year
-
over
-
year, were not 
up as much as prior quarters. I would say
 
the positive tailwinds still remain, 
AWS has strong growth of 46% on an FX neutral basis. Third party units 
continue to grow, advertising dollars continue to grow very well. Some of the 
headwinds, I would say, were outbound shipping cost, including the fr
ee 
shipping that we did, but mostly, it was the higher Amazon fulfilled units and 
the greater use of Amazon logistics. And I would also say retail was very 
strong.
 
We had a, as I think Dave mentioned, the Echo Dot was the highest selling 
unit globally, so 
devices had very strong sales in the quarter. We discussed 
how we don't price devices to make money. We usually will expand our 
content, expanding our device and usage. There are a group of customers 
who use our devices and then we monetize that in differe
nt ways to 
commitment to Amazon and the video and everything else. So a bit of it was 
mix, but I would say this retail, which has a lower gross margin more 
because of the revenue treatment was stronger in Q4.
 
Dave Fildes
 
Yeah. And just on the other revenue
 
piece, Brian, just to get back to the 
accounting side. We did adopt that revenue recognition standard in 2018 as 
I mentioned. As part of the adoption, certain advertising services were 
classified as revenue rather than a reduction of cost of sales. So spe
cific to 
Q4, the impact of that change was an increase of approximately $1 billion to 
other revenue, so you will see that in the other revenue in total.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Colin Sebastian with 
Robert W. Baird.
 
Coli
n Sebastian
 
Thanks. I guess two for me as well. In the quarter, looking backwards, not 
considering India and the impact going forward, but the international growth 
accelerated, so I was curious any particular regions or product categories to 
call out, espe
cially given some of the weakness in the UK? And then 
marketplace fees are changing in several categories, including Home 
Furnishings, health and beauty, curious what the strategy is there, I assume 
to expand selection, but is it also an indication of an i
ncreasing focus on 
those retail categories? Thanks.
 
Brian Olsavsky
 
Sure. Let me start with your second question. Obviously, third party sellers 

success on our site, the 
--
 
more than ha
lf of our units sold are from third 
party sellers. So it's very important to us that we have the right business 
profile, both for Amazon and for the sellers. So we will always be evolving 
that, part of that involves changing fee structures, sometimes, addi
ng new 
fees or subtracting old ones, part of it involves raising or lowering fees that 
sellers pay. So you're going to see this continually from us. We generally 
work to change the fees to make sure that the incentives are strong on both 
sides and we conti
nue to have a healthy growth in third party.
 
On the international, on an FX neutral basis, the growth was 15% in Q3 and 
19% in Q4. But last call, if you remember, I talked about the timing of 
Diwali and the impact that had on our growth rates. If we adjust
 
for that and 
again Diwali had, took place primarily in Q4 this year and it was split 
between Q3 and Q4 last year. If we adjust for that, international growth is 
pretty flat Q3 to Q4.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Lloyd Walms
ley with 
Deutsche Bank.
 
Lloyd Walmsley
 
Thanks. Two if I can. First, just on the advertising side, we hear a lot of 
positive feedback from customers, but also we hear suggestions of their 
supply constraints. So, how do you guys see inventory growth versus p
ricing 
growth as a driver in that business and are there things you can do to grow 
inventory?
 
And then secondly, there have been some reports, your Amazon shipping 
effort is kind of expanding beyond some test markets. So wondering if you 
can give us a sens
e for what you've seen in this test markets and how you 
think about expanding your shipping efforts on that productized basis going 
forward? Thanks.
 
Brian Olsavsky
 
Yeah. Lloyd, thanks for the questions. I'll take the advertising piece first. I 
mean, I thin
k as I talked before, we're working on the improving usability of 
tools. I mean, our priorities in the space, that's certainly one of them looking 
for ways to make smarter recommendations, addressing the needs of 
brands, automating activities, incenting ne
w products and I think in all those 
regards in those priorities, we think there's some good growth to continue to 
come both in advertising for on our own properties, but also potentially 
beyond, over the longer term, so, but even as we look for advertising
 
opportunities on places like Amazon.com, we think there's a lot of 
opportunity and a lot of experimentation. I think we're learning and are a 
very data interested company and working with a lot of great brands to be 
able to develop better toolkits for the
m, understand what types of metrics 
they want to make them more successful based on what they're telling us.
 
Dave Fildes
 
Yeah. And on transportation, I assume you're just talking about our 
expansion of Amazon deliveries and Amazon logistics. Again, we have
 
great 
partners in place for our business and support globally, what we do is add 
capacity where we feel we need to speed up service or ensure demand, 
particularly at peak. So we will continue to build out our DSP and flex and 
chip with Amazon programs. So
 
during the quarter, it was a much bigger 
presence obviously year
-
over
-
year, so we're happy with that, both from a 
performance standpoint, the delivery estimate accuracy as we call it was 
very strong on our self
-
delivered products and also the cost profile
 
is very 
good as well.
 
Operator
 
Our next question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan with UBS.
 
Eric Sheridan
 
Thanks for taking the question. Maybe two if I can. One on the media side, 
has there been any step
-
up in terms of investments around media content 
to support your ambition with respect to Prime and the video. It's been a 
couple of years now since we got an
 
update on rate of spend or how it might 
impact either historical periods or going forward periods, that would be 
number one.
 
And then number two, going back to Lloyd's question on the advertising 
front, how do you think about the video opportunity, you're
 
moving beyond 
just branded opportunities or sponsored products search on your own 
properties and thinking about experimenting with over the top video or 
connected TV opportunities [indiscernible] going forward. Thanks so much.
 
Brian Olsavsky
 
Yeah. Let me 
start with video. We're not quantifying the Prime video spend 
today, but we do 

 
it has been increasing. We expect it to increase even 
further in 2019. We're seeing a lot of again continued strong adoption and 
the usage and viewing and hours watched of our
 
--
 
both our music and our 
seasoned video and music. And as a step back, it builds stronger Prime 
connectivity with our Prime members, at least, the higher membership 
renewal rates and higher overall engagement. And as we like, we see 
--
 
we 
continue to see
 
that engagement growing. I would say that we've had some 
particular success in 
--
 
recently with 10 Golden Globe nominations and 3 
Oscar nominations and Jack Ryan homecoming in season two of the 
[indiscernible] in particular, were very well received during
 
the quarter.
 
Dave Fildes
 
Yeah. And then on your second question, just around advertising 
opportunities and around video, you may have seen it not that long ago, 
IMDB or Internet Movie Database, one of our subsidiaries, launched 
FreeDive, which is an ad su
pported free streaming video channel that's 
available in the US and it enables customers to watch TV shows and movies 
without purchasing a subscription. So ad supported, so that's available on 
the IMDB website with your laptop or personal computer on. I th
ink it's 
definitely on the Fire TV devices as well is a great way to consume content.
 
So I think excited about that, other opportunities we've been working with in 
ads, video for a bit longer period of time have been things like our sports 
offering, some o
f the live sports that we've done, things like Thursday Night 
Football, really like the success that we've seen on those and been learning 
from that and looking forward to pursuing more opportunities to engage and 
serve with customers with those types of v
ideo offers, but also take some 
opportunity to monetize with the advertising.
 
Operator
 
Our next question comes from the line of Jason Helfstein with Oppenheimer.
 
Jason Helfstein
 
Thanks. Just two, so just can you comment, did advertising slow down 
relative to third quarter. One, you kind of adjusting for 606 and then 
secondly, was there any reallocation in segments between online and 
physical stores and if not any commentary why physical stores was down 
year
-
over
-
year? Thanks.
 
Brian Olsavsky
 
Yeah. T
hanks, Jason for your questions. Let me start with the physical stores 
revenues. So physical stores decreased 3% year
-
over
-
year and this is 
primarily Whole Foods, but also includes our other stores, the Amazon Books 
stores, Amazon Go, Amazon 4 star. What h
appened in the quarter was we 
were lapping a period last year when we 

 
we had purchased Whole Foods in 
Q3, as you remember of 2017. In Q4, we adjusted their fiscal calendar to 
link it up with Amazon's and it added about 5 days of revenue into Q4 of last 
y
ear. So we're comping that year
-
over
-
year.
 
The second piece is that, the 
--
 
as you said, the online orders where people 
go to the Prime Now app and then order for delivery or pick up at Whole 
Foods stores does count or is counted in the online stores compo
nent of 
revenues. So if you adjust for those, with the Whole Foods growth year
-
over
-
year on an apples
-
to
-
apples basis was approximately 6%. Because of 
some of those, again, mostly the year
-
over
-
year accounting days, true up 
issue, it's showing up as negati
ve 3% in physical stores.
 
Dave Fildes
 
Yeah. And then just on your second question around advertising, if you look 
at the other revenue, the growth rate decelerated some. So it's at 97%, still 
very strong, year
-
over
-
year growth in the fourth quarter in othe
r revenue as 
I think you're aware, there are a number of components, but the largest by 
a good margin is the advertising revenue and we are comping a period of 
rapid growth in the prior year, so that is part of the factor there as you 

st reiterate, we're continuing to see quite strong 

that are utilizing that.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Dan Salmon with BMO 
Capital Markets.
 
Dan S
almon
 
Good afternoon, everyone. Brian, can we just return to your comment earlier 
about the increased use of Amazon logistics, not a surprise there, but just 
curious through the holiday season, any particular learnings that you can 
offer some color on and 
how you view the balance between using your own 
proprietary logistics versus third parties as you go into 2019?
 
And then just a quick follow
-
up, obviously the HQ2 news came out during 
the quarter, what would you highlight as maybe the most important next 
s
teps there and maybe some color on the feedback from that process, I 
would be interested to hear that as well? Thank you.
 
Brian Olsavsky
 

selected New York City and Northern Virginia
 
and between the two cities, we 
will be investing $5 billion and creating more than 50000 jobs. We also 
announced a Operations Center of Excellence to be opened up in Nashville, 
which is about 
--
 
estimated to be about 5000 jobs. So right now, we're 
working
 

investing in New York and Northern Virginia and being a good community 
partner as well as Nashville. So not really much else to report at this time on 
that.
 
On your comment or question on t
ransportation, we do continue to expand 
our Amazon logistics and delivery capability and it also matches up with our 
faster ship speed that we're seeing for Prime members as well. We added, of 
course, we have over 100 million items that customers would get
 
within two 
days, but there's now over 3 million that will be delivered within one day or 
faster in 10,000 cities in town. So Amazon deliveries are a big part of that. 
Again, we have great third party partners as well in the transportation 
space. What we l
ike about our ability to participate in transportation is that a 
lot of times, we can do it at the same cost or better and we like the cost 
profile of the two.
 
We can also invest selectively because we have more perfect information we 
know where our demand
 
is, we know where we're moving things between 
warehouses and sort centers and by not involving third parties all the time, 
we can find that we can extend our ship cut offs, or excuse me, our order 
cutoffs and we've done that over the last few years. So th
at's also another 
helpful side benefit for consumers when we are doing our own logistics, 
excuse me, transportation final delivery.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our final question comes from the line of Ross Sandler with 
Barclays.
 
Ross Sandler
 
So the AWS 
operating margins historically kind of move around a bit. Any 
color on what drove the decline sequentially from 3Q to 4Q? And then I 
guess going back to the investment catch up theme, it sounds like 2019 will 
be a little bit more aggressive push from you g
uys. Can you parse out 
whether you expect the pace of retail margin expansion that we're seeing in 
North America right now, is that going to continue and most of these 
investments are going to be in international and some of the stuff going on 
in India and
 
any color on the North America operating margin trajectory? 
Thanks.
 
Brian Olsavsky
 
Yeah. Sure. Let me start with the AWS operating margin, as you called it 
out. That number will move around, we're very pleased with the 29.3% that 
we saw during the quarter
. Of course, at any point in time, this business is 
going to be a combination of lowering prices, expanding geographically, 
adding people to build, especially tech teams and sales teams to build new 
and innovative products and staying very relevant and ahe
ad of our 

quarters a bit.
 
Our capital lease expenditure in Q4 was a bit higher than the prior three 
quarters. That had slight impact on the operating margin, but again year
-
over
-
year
, operating margins were up and were almost 280 basis points. 
We've said quite openly that this is going to bounce around. What we do is 
to create great value for the customer on one end and then work to 
minimize our cost of infrastructure and we're gettin
g more and more 
creative around getting efficiency up and getting our cost of acquisition 
down.
 
Dave Fildes
 
Thanks for joining us on the call today and for your questions. A replay will 
be available on our Investor Relations site at least through the end o
f the 
quarter. We appreciate your interest in Amazon and look forward to talking 
with you again next quarter.

Good day everyone and welcome to the Amazon.com Q1 2020 financial 
results teleconference. At this time, all participants are in a listen
-
only 
mode. After the presentation we will conduct a question and answer session. 
Today's call is being 
recorded.
 
For opening remarks, I will be turning the call over to Director of Investor 
Relations, Shelly Kay Pfeiffer. Please go ahead.
 
Shelly Kay Pfeiffer
 
Hello and welcome to our Q1 2020 financial results conference call. Joining 
us today to answer your 
questions are Brian Olsavsky, our CFO, Dave Fildes, 
Director of Investor Relations. As you listen to today's conference call, we 
encourage you to have our press release in front of you. It includes our 
financial results as well as metrics and commentary on
 
the quarter.
 
Please note, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be 
against our results for the comparable period of 2019. Our comments and 
responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, April 
30, 2020 only, and wi
ll include forward
-
looking statements. Actual results 
may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could 
potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release 
and our filings with the SEC. Including our most rece
nt annual report on 
Form 10
-
K and subsequent filings. During this call, we may discuss certain 
non
-
GAAP financial measures. In our press release slides accompanying this 
webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR 
website, you w
ill find additional disclosures regarding these non
-
GAAP 
measures including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP 
measures.
 
Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we've seen to date and 
what we believe today to be appropriate assu
mptions. Our results are 
inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, 
including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic 
conditions and customer spending, world events rate of growth of the 
internet onl
ine commerce and cloud services, and the various factors 
detailed in our filings with the SEC.
 
This guidance also reflects our estimates to date regarding the impact of the 
COVID
-
19 pandemic on our operations, including those discussed in our 
filings with 
the SEC and is highly dependent on numerous factors that we 
may not be able to predict or control, including the duration of the spread of 
the pandemic, actions taken by governments, businesses and individuals in 
response to the pandemic, the impact of the
 
pandemic on global and 
regional economies and economic activity, work force staffing and 
productivity, and our significant and continuing spending on employee safety 
measures, our ability to continue operations in affected areas, and consumer 
demand and c
onsumer spending patterns as well as the impact on suppliers 
creditors and third party sellers all of which are uncertain.
 
Our guidance also assumes, among other things, we don't conclude any 
additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings or
 
legal 
settlements. It's not possible to accurately predict demand for our business 
services and therefore, our actual results to differ materially from our 
guidance.
 
And now I will turn the call over to Brian.
 
Brian Olsavsky
 
Before we move on to the Q&A, 
I'd like to lead off with a few comments. 
What we've all seen transpire in the past two months has been gut
-
wrenching and unprecedented. But it has also been a time of heroic action 
by healthcare workers, government officials, police and emergency 
personne
l and all essential workers in our communities.
 
This includes frontline Amazonians, including our Whole Foods team and our 
partners around the world. They've provided a lifeline of groceries and other 
critical supplies to the doorsteps of all of us at this
 
critical time. I'd like to 
give you some insight into what we have seen at Amazon and how we are 
responding to this crisis.
 
Beginning in early March, we experienced a major surge in customer 
demand. Particularly for household staples and other essential p
roducts, 
across categories such as health, and personal care, groceries and even 
home office supplies. At the same time we saw lower demand for 
discretionary items such as apparel, shoes, and wireless products. This large 
demand spike created major challen
ges in our operations network.
 
And with our seller community and our suppliers, what we generally have 
experienced getting ready for spikes in demand for known events, like the 
holiday season and Prime Day, we also generally spend months ramping up 
for the
se periods.
 
The COVID crisis allowed for no such preparation. We took quick action to 
react to the higher order levels, while continuing to provide for the safety of 
our workforce. We established rigorous safety and cleaning protocols, 
including maintainin
g six foot social distancing, procuring 100 million masks, 
tens of millions of gloves and wipes and other cleaning supplies.
 
We began requiring temperature checks across our operations network. In 
our Whole Foods stores, we added plexiglass barriers betwee
n cashiers and 
customers, and reserve special hours for senior customers to shop. We 
temporarily raised wages and overtime premiums, we funded a new Amazon 
relief fund, and we allowed employees to take unpaid time off at their 
discretion. To deal with the 
unprecedented demand, we hired an additional 
175,000 new employees, many of whom were displaced from other jobs in 
the economy.
 
We took steps to dampen demand for non
-
essential products, including 
reducing our marketing spend. Our network pivoted to shippi
ng priority 
products within one to four days and extending promises on non
-
priority 
items. Our independent third
-
party sellers, most of whom are small and 
medium
-
sized businesses worked tremendously hard to serve our 
customers, and we are grateful for thei
r efforts.
 
Third
-
party sellers continue to see strong growth in our stores, with more 
than half of our units sold or from third
-
party sellers. We increased grocery 
delivery capacity by more than 60%, and expanded in store pickup at Whole 
Foods stores from 
80 stores to more than 150 stores. And other Amazon 
teams shifted their focus to directly helping customers and the overall effort 
to fight the COVID virus.
 
AWS has created data lake to assist healthcare workers, researchers, 
scientists and public health o
fficials working to understand and fight the 
coronavirus. Many of our AWS products are helping in the government 
response to the crisis, and are there for customers who are seeing their own 
demand spikes, companies enabling video conferencing, remote learn
ing and 
online health services, for example.
 
Amazon Flex is supporting food banks by donating delivery services of 
groceries to serve 6 million meals in Los Angeles, Miami, Nashville, Orlando, 
San Francisco, Seattle and Washington DC, with plans to ramp th
is up to 25 
cities across the U.S. And Alexa is helping customers access important CDC 
guidance, and help them evaluate their own COVID
-
19 risk levels.
 
How is all this impacting our business? While customer demand remains high 
the incremental revenue we ar
e seeing on many of the lower ASP essential 
products is basically coming at cost. We've invested more than $600 million 
in COVID related costs in Q1, and expect these costs could grow to $4 billion 
or more in Q2. These include productivity headwinds in our
 
facilities as we 
provide for social distancing and allow for the ramp up of new employees.
 
Investments in personal protective equipment for employees, enhanced 
cleaning of our facilities, our wages for our hourly teams and hundreds of 
millions of dollars 
to develop COVID
-
19 testing capabilities. In Q1, we also 
had another $400 million of costs related to increased reserves for doubtful 
accounts. On the flip side, we did see a drop in travel, entertainment and 
meeting costs, as well as lower marketing as a 
way to dampen our demand 
for non
-
essential items.
 
While we can't have great certainty about what the next few quarters will 
look like, I'm humbled by the efforts of my fellow Amazonians in delivering 
essential goods and services to so many people. We take 
this responsibility 
seriously and we're proud of the work our teams are doing to help customers 
through this difficult time.
 
With that, let's open up for questions.
 
Question

Answer Session
 
Operator
 
[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from
 
the line of Doug 
Anmuth with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.
 
Douglas Anmuth
 
First, I just wanted to ask, within the $4 billion of COVID related incremental 
costs in Q2, you talk about spending hundreds of millions on your own 
testing 
capabilities. Can you just talk about the strategic thinking there 
underlying trying to build this in
-
house versus sourcing from elsewhere? And 
does this potentially take you into a new business path over time? And then 
how do you think about the spending 
here in Q2 and whether over time does 
that change your margin structure for an extended period of time beyond 
just the next quarter? Thanks.
 
Brian Olsavsky
 
Sure. Doug, first on testing. So, we estimate the testing will be about $300 
million in Q2 if we're 
successful. We put some of our best people on it. I 
think everyone is trying to get testing. It's not readily available on the scale 
that we needed to test our scale of employees.
 
So we are working to do that ourselves and to build protocols and to 
-
 
and t
o 
again, we'll see how we do that differently and I don't know, you know 
again, about future business opportunities. Our main concern is, is getting 
testing in the hands of our employees and then potentially as we have 
excess capacity, perhaps we can help 
in other areas.
 
On the spending, a lot of the costs that we're seeing are tied to this COVID 
response. Most of it is hitting in people cost, both in productivity and also in 
wages and relief funds and all. So can't really tell how long that will last. It's
 
probably good that I am only 
-
 

point. We're going to probably learn a lot more in the next few weeks, next 
few months. And we'll continue to update this, but for now, most of what we 
see are temporary cost in the 
scheme of things, but certainly very expensive 
temporary costs. And also ones that we're not sure how long they'll last.
 
Operator
 
Your next question comes from the line of Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. 
Please proceed with your question.
 
Brian Nowak
 
I ha
ve two, Brian. The first one, is the current situation is, sort of I think, in 
many ways sort of showcase the ability of your network to provide goods for 
people and the value of Prime and Amazon to customers. So I guess in light 
of that, can you talk to u
s at all about the impact you've seen on the Prime 
customer account from the current situation? And any color on how you've 
been able to expand Prime's reach into new customers or demographics 
from this?
 
Then the second one, I know there's a lot of changes
 
going on in logistics 
and things, but Amazon is always a learning company. So any learnings 
you've had so far in the logistics side about how you actually may be able to 
learn some new best practices to run more efficiently post
-
COVID from the 
current [in
discernible] you've been going through?
 
Brian Olsavsky
 
Well, I think we've learned that it's easier to get ready for a holiday or a 
Prime Day then it is to be ready for something like this when everything hits 
at once. High demand and also a need to restoc
k automatically and prepare 
for it. So that's not something that we want to keep learning, but we're 
doing our best to maintain and provide key services for, and essential items 
for our Prime customers and all our Amazon customers.
 
On the Prime program, wh
at we're seeing is, again, you're seeing a lot of 
pickup in Prime shopping benefits. We see our prime customers are 
shopping more often and they have larger basket sizes. We're also seeing a 
lot more use of our video benefits and our digital benefits.
 
So i
n March, for the first time viewers nearly doubled, which is I think a 
good time for people to when they're, a lot of them are staying at home to 
stay entertained. And you'll see our video collection. It's also beyond kind of 
Prime Video. It's also our cha
nnels and video rentals also went up, as I'm 
sure others in the entertainment business saw that as well.
 
I think people are finding more benefit from Alexa when they're at home. 
They're listening to more music, asking questions, particularly questions 
rela
ted to COVID and issues around it. They're using it in education with 
their children. And I think we're seeing a lot more on the communication 
side using people using Alexa calling and drop in.
 
So I think the Prime story is that shopping is, you know, real
ly important for 
people now, especially when they, those people can't leave their houses. I 
think the digital benefits are scaling well. I think they are handling the 
additional demand, and it gives it gives people a good time and reason to 
use all of thei
r Prime benefits that maybe they hadn't used as much in the 
past.
 
Operator
 
Your next question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney with RBC. Please 
proceed with your question.
 
Mark Mahaney
 
First, could you just talk about where you are in terms of fulfillme
nt 
efficiencies? The way you track it pre
-
COVID, Amazon was able to, had some 
sort of level of standard of meeting demand with within a certain period of 
time, how low that got given the surge in demand, and where you are in 
terms of the recovery? In other
 
words, when are you going to be 
-
 
how long 
will it take for Amazon to get back to a point where you'd have the same 
sort of service efficiency levels on the retail side that you had pre
-
COVID? 
How far are you away from that?
 
And then the second one was, c
ould you talk about the AWS business? And I 
guess I would have expected maybe the growth rates were really robust, but 
maybe even a kick up in the growth rate? What are you seeing there in 
terms of, I assume there is much greater usage of AWS now? Is that 
something that would show up in the P&L, maybe on a delayed basis? Just 
talk about what's happening to that side of the business in this crisis. Thank 
you.
 
Brian Olsavsky
 
Sure. Well, we're happy with the growth in Q1on such a large base, again, 
we're, now 
it's $41 billion run rate, and that's 33% year
-
over
-
year. But what 
we're seeing post
-
COVID is, it varies by industry. I think what is probably 
where we're a bit well positioned is that we have such a breadth of 
customers, there's millions of active custome
rs from start
-
ups, to 
enterprises, to public sector. So there's a lot of variance.
 
And again, in what individual industries are seeing right now, things like 
videoconferencing, gaming, remote learning, entertainment all are seeing 
much higher growth and us
age. And things like hospitality and travel 
certainly have contracted very severely, very quickly. So, I think there's 
going to be a mixed bag on industries, and of course this is will be tied to 
general economic conditions for the country and the world, q
uite frankly.
 
So right now where we want to be there for our customers. We want to be 
able to scale up when they need us. We want to be there and support them 
regionally around the world. And we've been doing a good job at that, I 
believe.
 
On the fulfillme
nt efficiency, I think you were talking about one day, 
probably is the heart of your question, when we will get back to what we 
have seen and levels of one day. So a little bit on that. So again, as I 
mentioned in my introductory comments, we had to kind o
f absorb this 
shock of top line demand and also ability to stabilize our operations.
 
We had to take the step to focus on essential items, extend the shipping 
period from one to four days, and then further on non
-
essential items. I had 
restrict things that 
were coming into the warehouses, and focus on the 
essential products. So we think that is still was the right course of action. 
And as we add capacity, we're trying to resume more normal operations as 
far as the shipping of non
-
essential items and the spee
ding up of one
-
day 
shipments.
 
I will explain a bit on the one
-
day shipping cost, because it's aligned with 
this. So we originally thought we would spend $1 billion roughly on one
-
day 
shipping in Q1. And what we're seeing is, we pretty much spent about 
that 
same amount because it's 
-
 
in the old days, we would have perhaps had the 
option to ship things two
-
day, three
-
day, four
-
day and seen a break on rates 
for the actual shipment.
 
But most of our one
-
day costs are really what we've done to our logistics 
n
etworks to allow for one
-
day shipping. Things like putting inventory closer 
to the customer, things like building up our AMZL network and delivery 
network and also having multiple pull times and shipping windows during the 
day.
 
So those are actually coming
 
in, all those things are coming in very handy to 
us to help get more capacity out of what we currently have. And we're glad 
we've made that investment, but we don't actually see a savings because 
we're still shipping things once they're available very qui
ckly to customers.
 
So it's really a combination of how long it takes to get things in stock, 
picked, packed and shipped. The shipping is still pretty fast and is still 
coming quickly. It's taking longer to get things into our warehouse and out 
of our wareh
ouse. So that's really the challenge right now is to speed that 
up, and that will, when we do that we'll see a resumption of more one
-
day 
service.
 
But, right now things are still so up in the air that I can't really project when 
that day will be or what po
int in Q2 or Q3 or beyond.

Your next question comes from the line of Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs. 
Please proceed with your question.
 
Heath Terry
 
I did want to dig just a little bit deeper into your comments on AWS. 
Yesterday, during Microsoft's
 
call they had mentioned that they had seen 
two years worth of digital transformation in the cloud in two months. I'm 
curious if you, how you would characterize sort of what you have seen as 
we've gone into April in terms of cloud adoption and what this ha
s meant for 
AWS, and the rate of adoption or acceleration in that business, maybe more 
broadly?
 
And then as we look at the guidance, the $4 billion for the expenses in the 
second quarter. If we adjust for that implies a pretty material increase in 
profitab
ility quarter over quarter. Any sense of, or any sense that you can 
sort of share with us just what the drivers behind that profitability is? How 
much of that is annualizing the one
-
day investments in the efficiencies that 
you're seeing there, versus anyth
ing else in particular that you would that 
you would call out?
 
Brian Olsavsky
 
Yes, so first on AWS. I mean I don't have comments. You may have heard 
us talk about digital transformation. I think what I would say is, we've 
continue to see a healthy adoption
 
of our business and healthy usage not 
only in the United States but globally.
 
Our backlog of future contracts continues to build, and I still think the basic 
value proposition of AWS that we've always pointed to, things like having 
the most functionality,
 
largest vibrant community of customers and partners 
having really proven operational and security experience. And building what 
customers need in the areas of machine learning and artificial intelligence, 
and other really key areas has not been impeded by
 
this COVID crisis yet.
 
And yes, we are seeing different performance in different industries. But our 
sales force is still there to help, help not only with current capacity, but also 
the transition to new, as people make that journey onto to the cloud. An
d 
then expand their use of the cloud.
 
On the $4 billion, or sorry, on the Q2 guidance. I think the question is 
perhaps if how do we have a range that's above zero, if we have $4 billion of 
cost? Is that pretty much the essence of your question? I think the
re is 
-
 
there are some efficiencies that would leverage that we get on fixed cost on 
higher volumes, even if they are somewhat breakeven on a contribution 
profit basis. There's some improvement in our cost structure when we have 
high volumes.
 
There's also 
been a resumption of seller volume, especially from third parties 
using direct shipments to customers as companies are 
-
 
you get more 
capability both in this country and other countries. We will continue to 
moderate our marketing in the time period when we
 
have, again, very much 
the demand we are trying to fulfill is there and there's some products that 
are still out of stock.
 
So it doesn't make sense to always do marketing, especially variable 
marketing in those situations. And we continue to, we believe w
e'll be saving 
travel and entertainment costs through the quarter. That's in, I would say in 
a couple of hundred million dollar size ranges on the cost.
 
So there's a lot of moving parts here, but certainly the investment we're 
making in the COVID response 
is pretty significant. On the one
-
day, I would 
remind you that the one
-
day started in earnest Q2 of last year. So we're 
starting to lap that investment. It's not as large on a year
-
over
-
year basis as 
it's been in the past four quarters.
 
And then the other 
thing that I would just point out is the 
-
 
remember the 
impact of a change in the useful life of our servers, mostly hitting in the AWS 
business that was a $800 million benefit year
-
over
-
year in Q1. And that will 
continue into the rest of the year. And tha
t that again is the benefit we're 
seeing from being able to use our server and infrastructure assets for a 
longer time period. We've been working on the ability to run them longer, 
it's a hardware and a software challenge.
 
And as we have had success there 
operating at scale for over 13 years now, 
we've been able to extend our useful life for assets, or recognized that we 
have been extending the life. So that's a benefit that we've seen in Q1, and 
we'll see it the remaining from here on out.
 
Dave Fildes
 
Yes,
 
just to add to that too, is I think about $800 million or nearly $100 
million benefit in the first quarter, we do expect the change to the decrease 
as the year progresses some. Keep in mind.
 
Operator
 
Our next question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan 
with UBS. Please 
proceed with your question.
 
Eric Sheridan
 
Maybe two, if I can. One, on the demand of the revenue side, any difference 
in behavior you saw in various shelter in place geographies across the world, 
whether it be Europe versus in U.S. or Asia
 
in the U.S. or India, in terms of 
consumer behavior or certain elements of adoption of certain product 
categories as we went through the month of March? Be curious for what 
differences you saw on a global scale, including on Prime adoption in 
response to 
COVID
-
19.
 
And one quick one on the cost side of the equation, the cost of energy and 
oil have come down dramatically. Wanted to know if there was any way you 
would be able to call that out or an element of that in the overall cost 
structure as you do more 
of your own logistics over time. Thanks so much.
 
Brian Olsavsky
 
Sure. Sorry, Eric, I don't have much for you on the second point. Certainly 
we would look to see lower shipping costs. Although I would, but a lot of, I 
mean there's certainly things that we 
do long haul. There's things that we 
reposition, the airplanes. There's things that we do on long haul trucking, 
and that's where probably the fuel component would be larger. But we 
haven't quantified that, not for our guidance. I can't break it out for yo
u 
right now.
 
On how this may have played out differently in different geographies, we're 
actually seeing a lot of consistency, I would say in the types of products that 
people are buying in the state home restrictions. So it's been pretty 
consistent. There
's obviously timing differences between countries, on one 
certain countries and when it's maybe ones where they are in their curve, 
and flattening the curve and all that.
 
I think the biggest impact internationally has been in India, where of course, 
we sim
ilar to other companies in India, we're now only fulfilling our essential 
goods such as grocery. So that's cut back a lot on our offering, and we will 
further expand when the Indian government announces that were allowed to 
resume operations. So we're in a
 
bit of a holding pattern except for grocery 
in India.
 
And in France, there's been restrictions placed on us by the French courts. 
They did not impact Q1 business because essentially led to the closure of our 
French fulfillment centers in the middle of Apr
il. French customers are still 
able to order many millions of products from the selling partners we have 
who can ship directly to customers and through our global fulfillment. And 
we're continuing to appeal this court decision, but that's also different 
ex
perience than the other countries internationally.
 
Operator
 
Our next question comes from the line of Justin Post with Bank of America. 
Please proceed with your question.
 
Justin Post
 
A couple, just wondering if you're seeing any sustainable changes in 
consu
mer habits you could call out, such as people converting to Prime at a 
more rapid rate, adding more products in the consumable categories to their 
subscribe and save, anything you see that could really signal a longer
-
term 
change in consumer habits, faster
 
adoption of certain categories.
 
And the second thing for the revenue guidance for 2Q, does that assume a 
slowdown in growth in May and June related to the crisis? Thank you.
 
Dave Fildes
 
Justin, it's David. I think on some of the consumer behavior, I certa
inly point 
to grocery. If you look at the remainder of the online grocery is up in our 
online sales. So it's not isolated like you can see for physical stores, but we 
have seen an increased demand in online grocery shopping and we have a 
number of ways for
 
customers to do that.
 
Prime Now, Fresh and then of course Whole Foods online for delivery or pick 
up. And really beginning in March and continuing now through April, seeing 
that increased demand so, that's continued. And a lot of our focus is on 
working a
round the clock and offering as much delivery as possible.
 
We've increased delivery order capacity more than 60%, and our stores 
have gone up. Whole Foods stores that offer pick up capability has gone 
from roughly 80 stores before the events to more than 1
50, so a lot of work 
being done there.
 
On the physical stores, which you can see the growth there. It increased 
year
-
over
-
year at about 8%. That is predominantly Whole Foods, but it's the 
Whole Foods in
-
store shopping experience, rather than the online ord
er. So 
that's up quite a bit from the run rate you've seen in some recent quarters. 
It's again similar, saw lot of folks that were a stay at home measures were 
not yet in place where shopping in large volumes and stocking up at our 
stores.
 
Since that time 
more recently, we have seen some of those growth rates for 
the in
-
store shopping moderate some. So a lot of work being done there, 
both in for the workers that are doing to delivery in the workers that are in 
the stores.
 
A lot of focus on our part to make 
sure that they're safe and healthy, and 
able to accommodate customers make sure customers are comfortable, 
however they choose to shop.
 
Brian Olsavsky
 
And I'd add to that. Justin, I think the changes we've seen in the digital 
offerings will make people cus
tomer to those benefits and maybe advance 
their knowledge of what's available through 
-
 
music, video, Alexa, certainly 
communication features on our devices.
 
We launched Prime Video Cinema in U.S., U.K. and Germany where movies 
are going direct to pay
-
per
-
view because of lack of theaters. And that was a 
good move by the team and that's been very well received. We've also made 
a lot of kids and family content available free to watch on Prime Video. So I 
think people are getting a better look at what's availa
ble with the Prime 
membership.
 
Justin Post
 
And then, second half of the quarter, are you assuming, kind of, we go back 
to normal as the quarter progresses and some deceleration?
 
Dave Fildes
 
Well we are heavily constrained, again it's an odd quarter because
 
generally 
the biggest uncertainty we have this customer demand, and with the order 
and how much of it they'll order. Demand has been strong, the biggest 
questions we have in Q2 are more about ability to service that demand and 
that is the products that pe
ople are ordering in a full way, not blocking or 
making it hard to find non
-
essential items, increasing marketing, and 
everything else.
 
So I think the challenge is really on everything besides the top line. And top 
line is certainly not to be taken for gra
nted. There's always the importance 
of having attractive offerings in stock for customers.
 
But usually things you can count on, the cost structure, the ability to get 
products, yes, your capacity for shipping and delivering, those are usually 
things that y
ou can take for granted, and in this quarter, you can't. That's 
really where the uncertainty is driven.

Your next question comes from Stephen Ju with Credit Suisse. Please 
proceed with your question.
 
Stephen Ju
 
So, Brian, I think the 
third
-
party unit mix de
-
indexed a little bit as a 
percentage of the total this quarter. I know that number jumps around a 
little bit, but is this primarily a matter of constrained delivery resources? 
And, I guess, the heightened demand? And any sort of ong
oing supply chain 
concerns that remain worrisome for you from either a first
-
party perspective 
or from what the third
-
party sellers may be calling out. Thanks.
 
Brian Olsavsky
 
Sure. I think there's still supply chain concerns on a lot of PPE, not only that 
we use, but also that we sell to customers, things like masks. There's 
general availability, but still outages of things like cleaning wipes, masks, 
talk about testing, but that's not something that we sell.
 
So there are a lot of supply chain concerns are 
mostly in those areas right 
now. I'm sorry, I forgot the other part of your question. Can you remind me 

 
Stephen Ju
 
The third
-
party unit mix de
-
indexing a little bit as a percentage of total this 
quarter. I'm just wondering if that's just nor
mal fluctuations, or are you just 
prioritizing the first
-
party delivery against what's probably limited resources 
on the heightened demand.
 
Brian Olsavsky
 
Yes. Thanks, Stephen. I would say that, yes, it's a little off during this 
period, because it's not s
o much we're restricting and favoring 1P or 
anything. It's we're prioritizing essential items, and a lot of those tend to be, 
especially in the consumable area tend to be retail supplied items from 
vendors.
 
So I would say that is the reason that FBA would 
have not have been as high 
as it normally would be. MFN is picking up a lot of the opportunity, and 
sellers are taking that opportunity ship direct because then it doesn't have to 
come into our warehouse obviously. So it's a bit of a different type of 3P m
ix 
right now. We're trying to minimize the impact on FBA sellers as we open up 
our warehouse as well.
 
Many of them are also MFN or direct shippers to our customers. So it's the 
ability to satisfy demand of our customers from our seller community has 
never 
been more important and we're very grateful to our third
-
party 
sellers. They've been through a lot as well.
 
Operator
 
Our final question comes from the line of John Blackledge with Cowen. 
Please proceed with your question.
 
John Blackledge
 
On advertising, th
e other revenue growth line accelerated. Could you just 
discuss how the advertising business performed in the first quarter? And any 
color on how it's trending in the second quarter if possible. And then in the 
release you indicated more, potentially more,
 
hiring above the 175,000 
headcount additions, any way to quantify and does this hiring replace kind of 
the seasonal hiring that you typically do at the end of the third quarter? 
Thanks.
 
Dave Fildes
 
Yes, sure. Let me start that second one, I don't have mor
e for you on that. I 
think we'll announce as we change thresholds on hiring, we'll announce that 
at the time. Right now we've fully hired 175,000 people that we had 
discussed prior. 80,000 of them were in place at the end of the quarter. So 
the other 95,00
0 have been hired in April.
 
On advertising what we've seen is it's been a very strong quarter in ad 
revenue. On your comment about other revenue accelerating, there's some 
other things going on in that other revenue account, the majority is revenue. 
But th
ere's other, some other things, but I can tell you underneath that is 
that advertising growth rate has stayed consistent with last quarter. And 
we're very happy with the progression of that that offering for not only 
sellers, authors, vendors and positive 
impact it's had on customer selection.
 
But we did start to see some impact. Yes. In March, some pullback from 
advertisers and some downward pressure on price, but how but advertising 
continues to advertise at a high cliff. It wasn't as noticeable maybe as 
with 
what some others are seeing, and it's probably offset a bit by the continued 
strong traffic we have to the site. So it's a bit of a mixed bag. We have 
again, as I said, downward pressure a bit on pricing.
 
But I think we have a the large portion of our
 
advertising relates to Amazon 
sales, not things like travel and auto which offsite which may have been 
disproportionately impacted at least early on here in the COVID crisis. And I 
think our advertising will prove to be very efficient as well. And it can 
be 
directly measured. So even as people are cutting back perhaps on 
advertising, or are their costs, I think this will be one area that will prove its 
value. It has in the past.

Good day everyone, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Amazon.com 
First Quarter 2013 Financial Results Teleconference. At this time, all 
participants are in a listen
-
only mode. After the presentation, we will 
conduct a 
question
-
and
-
answer session. Today's call is being recorded.
 
For opening remarks, I will be turning the call over to the Vice President of 
Investor Relations, Mr. Sean Boyle. Mr. Boyle, please go ahead.
 
Sean Boyle
 
Hello and welcome to our Q1 2013 financial
 
results conference call. Joining 
us today is Tom Szkutak, our CFO. We will be available for questions after 
our prepared remarks.
 
The following discussion and responses to your questions reflect 
management's views as of today, April 25, 2013 only and will
 
include 
forward
-
looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional 
information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is 
included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our 
most recent
 
annual report on Form 10
-
K.
 
As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press 
release in front of you, which includes our financial results, as well as 
metrics and commentary on the quarter. During this call, we will discuss 
cer
tain non
-
GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides 
accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is 
posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these 
non
-
GAAP measures, including reconciliati
ons of these measures with 
comparable GAAP measures.
 
Finally, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against 
our results for the comparable period of 2012.
 

 
Tom Szkutak
 

 
comments on our first quarter financial results. 
Trailing 12
-
month operating cash flow increased 39% to $4.25 billion. 
Trailing 12
-
month free cash flow decreased 85% to $177 million. Trailing
-
12 
month capital expenditures were $4.07 billion.
 
This amount i
ncludes $1.4 billion in purchases of our previously leased 
corporate office space, as well as property for development of additional 
corporate office space located in Seattle, Washington which we purchased in 
the fourth quarter 2012.
 
The increase in capita
l expenditures reflects additional investments in 
support of continued business growth consisting of investments in 
technology, infrastructure including Amazon Web Services and additional 
capacity to support our fulfillment operations.
 
Return on invested c
apital was 1%, down from 12%. ROIC is TTM free cash 
flow divided by average total assets minus current liabilities excluding the 
current portion of long
-
term debt over five quarter ends. The combination of 
common stock and stock
-
based awards outstanding wa
s 471 million shares 
compared with 464 million one year ago.
 
Worldwide revenue grew 22% to $16.07 billion or 24% excluding the $302 
million unfavorable impact from year
-
over
-
year changes in foreign exchange 
rate. We are grateful to our customers who contin
ue to take advantage of 
our low prices, vast selection and shipping offers.
 
Media revenue increased to $5.06 billion, up 7% or 10% excluding foreign 
exchange. EGM revenue increased to $10.21 billion, up 28% or 30% 
excluding foreign exchange. Worldwide EGM 
increased to 64% of worldwide 
sales, up from 60%.
 
Worldwide paid unit growth was 30%. Active customer accounts exceeded 
209 million. Worldwide active seller accounts were more than 2 million. 
Seller units represented 40% of paid units.
 
Now, I will discuss 
operating expenses excluding stock
-
based compensation. 
Cost of sales was $11.8 billion, or 73.4% of revenue, compared with 76.1%. 
Fulfillment, marketing, technology and content and G&A combined was 
$3.83 billion, or 23.8% of sales, up approximately 289 bas
is points year
-
over
-
year. Fulfillment was $1.74 billion, or 10.8% of revenue compared with 
9.5%. Tech and content was $1.26 billion, or 7.9% of revenue, compared 
with 6.5%. Marketing was $616 million, or 3.8% of revenue compared with 
3.6%.
 

about our segment results and consistent with prior periods, 
we do not allocate the segments, our stock
-
based compensation or other 
operating expense line item.
 
In the North America segment, revenue grew 26% to $9.39 billion. Media 
revenue grew 14% to $2.5
1 billion. EGM revenue grew 28% to $6.13 billion, 
representing 65% of North America revenues, up from 64%. North America 
segment operating income increased 31% to $457 million, a 4.9% operating 
margin.
 
In the international segment, revenue grew 16% to $6.6
8 billion. Adjusting 
for the $301 million year
-
over
-
year unfavorable foreign exchange impact, 
revenue growth was 21%. Media revenue grew 1% to $2.54 billion, or 7% 
excluding foreign exchange and EGM revenue grew 28% to $4.09 billion, or 
32% excluding forei
gn exchange. EGM now represents 61% of international 
revenues, up from 56%.
 
International segment operating loss was $16 million, a 0.2% negative 
operating margin compared with income of $49 million.
 
CSOI increased 11% to $441 million, or 2.7% of revenue, 
down 
approximately 27 basis points year
-
over
-
year. Unlike CSOI, our GAAP 
operating income includes stock
-
based compensation expense and other 
operating expense. GAAP operating income decreased 6% to $181 million, 
or 1.1% of net sales.
 
Our income tax benefi
t was $18 million it includes $46 million of discrete tax 
benefits primarily resulting from the retroactive reinstatement of the federal 
research and development credit that was enacted in January 2013. GAAP 
net income was $82 million or $0.18 per diluted 
share compared with $130 
million and $0.28 per diluted share.
 
Turning to the balance sheet, cash and marketable securities increased 
$2.18 billion year over year to $7.89 billion. Inventory increased 27% to 
$5.4 billion and inventory turns were 9.5, down f
rom 10.4 turns a year ago 
as we expanded selection, improved in stock levels and introduced new 
product categories. Accounts payable increased 29% to $8.92 billion and 
accounts payable days increased to 68 from 62 in the prior year.
 
I will conclude my port


believe today to be appropriately conservative assumption. Our results are 
inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by
 
many factors, 
including a high
-
level of uncertainty surrounding exchange rate fluctuations 
as well as the global economy and consumer spending. It's not possible to 
accurately predict demand and therefore our actual results could differ 
materially from ou

filings issues such as settling intercompany balances in foreign currencies 
among such subsidiaries, unfavorable resolution of legal matters and 
changes to our effective tax rates can all have a m
aterial effect on guidance.
 
Our guidance further assumes that we don't conclude any additional 
business acquisitions, investments or settlements, record any further 
revisions to stock
-
based compensation estimates and that foreign exchange 
rates remain appr
oximately where they have been recently.
 
For Q2, 2013 we expect net sales of between $14.5 billion and $16.2 billion, 
a growth of between 13% and 26%. This guidance anticipates approximately 
275 basis points of unfavourable impact on foreign exchange rates
. GAAP 
operating income or loss to be between a $340 million loss and $10 million 
income compared to $107 million income in the prior year period. This 
includes approximately $340 million for stock
-
based compensation, 
amortization of intangible assets.
 
We anticipate consolidated segment operating income, which excludes stock
-
based compensation and, other operating expense to be between zero and 
$350 million compared to $360 million in the prior year period. We remain 
heads down focused on driving a bette
r customer experience through price, 
selection, and convenience. We believe putting customers first is the only 
reliable way to create lasting value for shareholders.
 
Thanks. With that, Sean, let's move to questions.
 
Sean Boyle
 
Great. Thanks Tom. Let's mov
e on to the Q&A portion of the call. Operator, 
will you please remind our listeners how to initiate a question?

Tom, the international segment sales growth of 21% continues 
to show

in the past. Are there any other factors you 
would want to call out or 
specifically not call out?
 
Do you think that things like imposition of state sales tax are having in near

term drag on growth rates. Last quarter, I think you talked about consumer 
electronics at the high

end. Are there any partic

would want to call out as maybe driving that low

Our next question today will come from Ben Schachter of Macquarie.
 
Ben Schachter

Macquarie
 
Are there any factors that are impacting the unit gro
wth, particularly the 
shift from physical to digital, for instance rented video versus purchasing of 
video. Are there any other factors that you would highlight that are 
impacting the unit growth?
 
Tom Szkutak
 
The one factor, I would call out, first of all 
in terms of overall unit growth. 
Overall unit growth is 30% year
-
over
-
year. Again, very solid growth, 

--
 

certainly overlapping a pretty strong growth of last Q1.
 
In terms of the phys

certainly digital growing at a much faster rate. And when you do see that, a 
little bit is in our third
-
party units as a percentage of total units. You will see 

quarter. That compares to last year up 

digital units are growing at a faster rate and that mostly first party you're 
seeing that number impacted where that percentage as a percentag
e of our 
total is not growing as fast as it has last few quarter. Again that's largely 
driven by the digital units growth that you are seeing.
 

--
 
if you were to back out, for example, and just look at our 
physical units, our physical units 
as a percentage of total units this year 

percentage of total units.
 
Operator
 
Our next question today comes from Ross Sandler, Deutsche Bank.
 
Ross Sandler

Deutsche Bank
 
Question on 
the 
--
 
follow
-
up question on the shipping, so just your net 
shipping costs, not your shipping margin, but just shipping costs relative to 
gross profit declined about 300 basis points, similar to what you have seen 
over the past four quarters. So as you sta
rt to comp some of these efficiency 
gains that you are seeing in shipping, do you think that line will continue to 
show leverage or is it going to start to level out from here?
 
Tom Szkutak
 
We are not giving 
--
 

cific line 
item but certainly over a long period of time we think there is opportunity to 
be more productive there, and there are certainly efficiency gains to be had 

 
Operator
 
Next, we w
ill hear from Colin Sebastian of Robert W. Baird & Company.
 
Colin Sebastian

Robert W. Baird
 
Just a question on what services 
--
 
wonder if you can comment on 
enterprise level adoption, whether there are any meaningful barriers to that 
happening over time.
 

enterprise
-
level sales people?
 
Tom Szkutak
 

terms of developing services that are great for many different customer 
types, inclu
ding enterprises. And the team is heads down focused on making 
sure we have a great operational of these services that are great from an 
operational standpoint and security standpoint and they are doing a terrific 

for enterprises to adopt our services 
and the team is certainly focused on that along with other customers. So 
other customers that took in, it's a great opportunity for those customers 
and for us.
 
Operator
 
Our next question comes from Douglas Anmuth of JP
Morgan.
 
Douglas Anmuth

JPMorgan
 

you are sort of leading, was it more in the release tonight in terms of the 
business content. I was hoping you could just add some more color 
here on 

purchase patterns?
 
Tom Szkutak
 


 
of our 
prime offer that we have a lot of free content of the customers. We think 
that's a great service to customers along with our express shipping offers as 
well as other content that we have free, for example, our Kindle owners 
lending library for book

--
 
finds a great 


fast and certainly customers like it. We are seei
ng that reflected in the result 
that you see today.
 
Operator
 
Moving on, we will hear from Justin Post with Merrill Lynch. Mr. Post, your 
line is open. Please go ahead with your question.
 
Justin Post 
-
 
Merrill Lynch
 
Sorry about that. I was on mute. I was wo
ndering if you can help us little bit 
about the Kindle ecosystem. On prior calls a few years ago, you singled it 
out as a fast growth area and you were very happy with the performance. 
We haven't heard as much about it lately. Kind of the impact 
--
 
sort of
 
how 

prime subs and also your growth in operating margins? Thank you.
 
Tom Szkutak
 
We are very pleased with Kindle and digital business. And we are 
superexcited in terms of the eco
system. You're certainly seeing that in our 
results that you see today. For example, if you look at our media growth, we 
are certainly 
--
 
that ecosystem is more penetrated there than it is in 
international and you see that reflected in those associated gro
wth rates.
 
Another way you see it is, if you take a look at our top 10 best
-
selling items 
worldwide in Q1. The top 10 are all either digital or Kindle related. 
Paperweight is our best selling product worldwide. But again, all 10 spots in 
the Q1 were either
 
Kindle or digital items. And I believe that that's the first 

 
We've been looking at that from a quarterly results standpoint for some 

maybe the first quarter
 

digital related. So again, we are very pleased with what we were doing there 
and we are going to continue to innovate on behalf of customers.
 
Justin Post 
-
 
Merrill Lynch
 
And any impact on your gross or o
perating margins you recall?
 
Tom Szkutak
 
One thing I would say is we certainly are investing, certainly in area of 
investment and you're seeing that reflected. We are making a number of 
investments across the business and certainly we are investing in Kind
le and 
our digital offerings. We are investing in some of the things I mentioned 
earlier like China or some of the emerging geographies. So those are 
certainly some of the larger key investments we are making.

Afternoon. We are hearing reports that there is refrigeration equipment 
going in some of your fulfillment centers outside of Seattle area. Just 
wonderi
ng if you can update us on plans to expand AmazonFresh. Thanks.
 
Tom Szkutak
 
Nothing to announce here. We are very pleased with what we've seen in the 


 
something that we see that customers love the 
experience. The challenge has always been in making sure we get the 
economics right and that is something we will continued to focus on.
 
Operator
 
And up next, we will take a question from Steven Ju of Credit S
uisse.

Hey. Tom, anything you can say in terms of how much Amazon has done 
video as well as potentially your own in

house produced content currently 
helps and will 
--
 
should in the future help reduce churn in Amazon Prime? 
Thanks.
 
Tom Szkutak
 



What we 
are seeing is great traction. We see a lot of usage of the service.
 
Customers love it and we think it is very interesting part of Prime offering. 

announcement including some of the stuff in
cluded in the earnings release 

interesting and we are excited about it.
 
Operator
 
And we will go next to Ken Sena of Evercore Partners with our next question.
 
Ken Sena

Evercore Part
ners
 
Hi. I was just hoping you can maybe provide a little more color on the unit 
growth deceleration. And looking back over the last four quarters, it seems 
like about 500 basis points or so each quarter of deceleration. You had about 
200 basis points here
, which is an improvement. But anything you could say 
just to any signs of maturity in some of the business anywhere that 
deceleration is specifically coming?
 
Tom Szkutak
 
No, there is not a lot I can add. I mean I think the 30% book, very strong 
growth rat

20%, revenue at local currency growth of 24%, a very strong third
-
party 
growth continues to be very strong. Retail growth is strong. So again there 
is not a lot I can provide you there. But ag
ain keep in mind that we are 
overlapping 49% growth last year Q1, which is certainly little bit of a difficult 
compare but again fees would be 30% growth rate.
 
Operator

Just a question on the Amazon advertising platform, given the immense 
amount of purchase ad you have on Amazon customers, how is that being 
used as a competitive advantage and maybe you just provide an overall 
view on the direction of t
he Amazon ad platform over time?

In terms of the platform itself, we think it's a very sizable, very good long

I am just wondering what you are seeing in terms of the attach rate of your 
transactional video on demand business versus usage of PrimeInstant Video. 
I am wondering just if your consumers tend to choose between the two, 
when they are mak

does the Prime subscriber have a higher transactional VOD attach rates than 
non

Prime? So would be helpful to see

to hear what you're seeing there in 
terms of usage?
 
Tom Szkutak
 
Yeah, I think th
e thing that can help with this, we see

of Prime customers, 
for example, we certainly see adoption of the service in terms of free 
content but those same customers are purchasing content as well. So there 
is a good attachment to it which we like. And we
 
see Prime members doing 
not just within video content but we see them doing a lot of cross

shopping. 

been traditionally purchasing them pre

Prime, in a few categories, we find 
that 
they do a lot more cross

They use the service, they might start with free content and then they will

Two quick questions please. Going back to the international, a question, 

 
year Q1 
I think it was up 22%, FX adjusted this quarter was up 7%. Is that all macro 
or are there any maybe other factors that you can talk about, maybe specific 
to SKUs or something? And the other is more of a clarification. I know last 
quarter you gave 
the unit growth in aggregate versus the unit growth of the 
retail, just wondering if you could give that to us as well?
 
Tom Szkutak
 
In terms of the international media growth, this quarter it was 1% on a 
dollar basis, 7% on a local currency basis, which yo
u 
--
 
in terms of the 



you compare
 

meaningful differences that you see between the two as you see that both 
are growing digital content very fast.
 
It is just the ecosystem is more build out in North America. But again, 
certainly we see 


 
In terms of the unit growth, we said that our overall unit growth was 30% 
for the quarter. Our 3P unit growth I do

And our next question today will come from Jordan Rohan of Stifel.

Yeah. I was hoping you could comment on the market entry and 
expansion 
strategy for Amazon in Brazil. There seemed to be tremendous amount of 
press last year about it and it seems to have died to some degree. I know 
the company may already be there with Amazon Web Services and some 
Kindle offerings. But when do you 
think that might get a little bit broader?
 
And secondly, there's been some stories recently about an Internet 
streaming device or box or set
-
top box, something of those sorts. Can you 
comment on any new hardware form factors including apps as of some sort 
of a cell phone or handset that might be coming down the pipe, anything to 
look forward to in the Kindle family or related? Thanks.
 
Tom Szkutak
 
In terms of geographic expansion, there is not a lot I can say specifically 
about Brazil. We think we are in the
 

expanded into a number of geographies over the past few years. That is 
certainly something always we look at and you should expect us to expand 
to additional geographies over time.
 
In terms of any questions related to ou

a longstanding practices of not talking about what we might, or might not do 
there. But we are certainly excited about the product roadmap that we have 

ng details 
until closer at launch.

And ladies and gentlemen, we do have time for one final question today. 
That question will come from Jason Helfstein of Oppenheimer & Company.

Thanks. Can you give us a lit
tle more color around customer growth? I 
mean, that number has been slowing not dramatically, but that is a slowing 
trend. Are you focused more on higher value customers to drive the 
business and any color around the quarter would be helpful? Thanks.
 
Tom S
zkutak
 
We're actually pleased with the growth from a customer standpoint. We've 
seen very good growth and we continue to 
--
 
we have many, many teams 
across Amazon that are just heads down focused on trying to improve the 
customer experience and inventing o
n behalf of customers. So, we couldn't 
be more pleased with what they are doing, and you see that reflected in our 
overall growth rate this quarter with revenue up 24% on a local currency 
basis and units growing at 30%, on top of strong growth quarter last
 
year

Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Amazon.com Fourth Quarter 2011 
Financial Results Teleconference. [Operator Instructions] Today's call is 
being recorded. For opening remarks, I would like to turn the call over to 
Vice President of 
Investor Relations, Sean Boyle. Please go ahead, sir.
 
Sean Boyle
 
Hello, and welcome to our Q4 2011 Financial Results Conference Call. Joining 
us today is Tom Szkutak, our CFO; and John Felton, our Director of Investor 
Relations. We will be available for qu
estions after our prepared remarks.
 
The following discussion and responses to your questions reflect 
management's views as of today, January 31, 2012, only and will include 
forward
-
looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional 
inform
ation about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is 
included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our 
most recent annual report on Form 10
-
K.
 
As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to h
ave our press 
release in front of you, which includes our financial results, as well as 
metrics and commentary on the quarter.
 
During this call, we will discuss certain non
-
GAAP financial measures. In our 
press release, slides accompanying this webcast and
 
our filings with the 
SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional 
disclosures regarding these non
-
GAAP measures, including reconciliation of 
these measures with comparable GAAP measures.
 
Finally, unless otherwise stated, all co
mparisons in this call will be against 
our results for the comparable period of 2010. Now I'll turn the call over to 
Tom.
 
Thomas J. Szkutak
 
Thanks, Sean. I'll begin with comments on our fourth quarter financial 
results. Trailing 12
-
month operating cash flo
w increased 12% to $3.9 billion. 
Trailing 12
-
month free cash flow decreased 17% to $2.09 billion. Return on 
invested capital is 22%, down from 34%. Return on invested capital is TTM 
free cash flow divided by average total assets minus current liabilities, 
excluding the current portion of long
-
term debt over 5 quarter ends.
 
The combination of common stock and stock
-
based awards outstanding was 
468 million shares compared with 465 million shares. During the quarter, we 
repurchased 1.5 million shares of our co
mmon stock for $277 million.
 
Worldwide revenue grew 35% to $17.43 billion, or 34% excluding the $101 
million favorable impact from year
-
over
-
year changes in foreign exchange 
rates. We're grateful to our customers, who continue to take advantage of 
our low 
prices, vast selection and shipping offers.
 
Media revenue increased to $6.01 billion, up 15% or 14% excluding foreign 
exchange. EGM revenue increased to $10.91 billion, up 48%, or 47% 
excluding foreign exchange. Worldwide EGM increased to 63% of worldwide 
sales, up from 57%.
 
Worldwide paid unit growth was 46%. Active customer accounts exceeded 
$164 million. Worldwide active seller accounts were more than $2 million. 
Seller units were 36% of paid units compared to 32% of paid units in Q4 
2010.
 
Now I'll discu
ss our operating expenses, excluding stock
-
based 
compensation. Cost of sales was $13.83 billion, or 79.3% of revenue 
compared with 79.7%. Fulfillment, marketing, technology and content and 
G&A combined was $3.14 billion or 18% of sales, up approximately 25
0 
basis points year
-
over
-
year.
 
Fulfillment was $1.62 billion or 9.3% of revenue compared with 8.2%. Tech 
and content was $782 million or 4.5% of revenue compared with 3.5%. 
Marketing was $581 million or 3.3% of revenue compared with 2.8%.
 
Now I'll talk abo
ut our segment results. And consistent with prior periods, 
we do not allocate the segments or stock
-
based compensation or other 
operating expense line item.
 
In the North America segment, revenue grew 37% to $9.9 billion. Media 
revenue grew 8% to $2.56 bill
ion. EGM revenue grew 51% to $6.88 billion, 
representing 69% of North America revenues, up from 63%.
 
North America segment operating income decreased 4% to $285 million, a 
2.9% operating margin. In the International segment, revenue grew 31% to 
$7.53 billi
on. Adjusting for the $102 million year
-
over
-
year favorable foreign 
exchange impact, revenue growth was 29%.
 
Media revenue grew 20% to $3.45 billion, or 18% excluding foreign 
exchange rates. And EGM revenue grew 42% to $4.03 billion, or 41% 
excluding forei
gn exchange. EGM now represents 54% of international 
revenues, up from 49%.
 
International segment operating income decreased 46% to $177 million, a 
2.4% operating margin. Excluding the favorable impact from foreign 
exchange rates, International segment ope
rating income decreased 46%.
 
CSOI decreased 26% to $462 million, or 2.7% of revenue, down 
approximately 216 basis points year
-
over
-
year. Excluding the favorable 
impact from foreign exchange, CSOI decreased 27%. Unlike CSOI, our GAAP 
operating income includ
es stock
-
based compensation expense and other 
operating expense.
 
GAAP operating income decreased 45% to $260 million, or 1.5% of net 
sales. Our income tax expense was $86 million in Q4, resulting in a 32% 
rate for the quarter and a 31% rate for the full ye
ar 2011. GAAP net income 
was $177 million, or $0.38 per diluted share, compared with $416 million 
and $0.91 per diluted share.
 
Now I'll discuss the full year results. Revenue grew 41% to $48.08 billion. 
North America revenue grew 43% to $26.71 billion, and
 
International grew 
38% to $21.37 billion, 31% growth excluding year
-
over
-
year changes in 
foreign exchange rates.
 
Consolidated Segment Operating Income, or CSOI, decreased 19% to $1.57 
billion, or 21% excluding the favorable year
-
over
-
year impact from fore
ign 
exchange. And operating margin decreased 239 basis points to 3.3%. GAAP 
operating income decreased 39% to $862 million, or 1.8% of net sales.
 
Turning to the balance sheet, cash and marketable securities increased $814 
million year
-
over
-
year to $9.58 bi
llion. Inventory increased 56% to $4.99 
billion. And inventory turns were 10.3, down from 11.4 turns a year ago as 
we expanded selection, improved in
-
stock levels and introduced new product 
categories. Accounts payable increased 38% to $11.14 billion, and 
accounts 
payable days increased to 74 from 72 in the prior year.
 
Our Q4 2011 capital expenditures were $550 million. The increase in capital 
expenditures reflects additional investments in support of continued business 
growth, including investments in tech
nology, infrastructure, including 
Amazon Web Services and additional capacity to support our fulfillment 
operations.
 
I'll conclude my portion of today's call with guidance. Incorporated into our 
guidance are the order trends that we've seen to date and wha
t we believe 
today to be appropriately conservative assumptions. Our results are 
inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, 
including a high level of uncertainty surrounding exchange rate fluctuations, 
as well as the global ec
onomy and consumer spending. It's not possible to 
accurately predict demand, and therefore, our actual results could differ 
materially from our guidance.
 
As we described in more detail in our public filings, issues such as settling 
intercompany balances in foreign currencies amongst our subsidiaries, 
unfavorable resolution of legal matters and changes to our effective tax 
rates can all have a material effec
t on guidance. Our guidance further 
assumes that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions or 
investments, record any further revisions to stock
-
based compensation 
estimates and that foreign exchange rates remain approximately where 
they've be
en recently.
 
For Q1 2012, we expect net sales between $12 billion and $13.4 billion, a 
growth of between 22% and 36%. This guidance anticipates approximately 
50 basis points of unfavorable impact from foreign exchange. GAAP 
operating income or loss to be b
etween a loss of $200 million and $100 
million of income, or between 162% decline and 69% decline. This includes 
approximately $200 million for stock
-
based compensation and amortization 
of intangible assets. We anticipate Consolidated Segment Operating Inc
ome, 
which excludes stock
-
based compensation and other operating expense, to 
be between 0 and $300 million, or between 100% decline and 36% decline.
 
We remain heads
-
down focused on driving a better customer experience 
through price, selection and convenien
ce. We believe putting customers first 
is the only reliable way to create lasting value for shareholders.
 
Thanks. And with that, Sean, let's move to questions.
 
Sean Boyle
 
Great. Thanks, Tom. Let's move on to the Q&A portion of the call. Operator, 
will you 
please remind our listeners how to initiate a question?
 
Question
-
and
-
Answer Session
 
Operator
 
[Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from analyst Jeetil 
Patel from Deutsche Bank Securities.
 
Jeetil J. Patel 
-
 
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Div
ision
 
A couple of questions, actually. First of all, on the Kindle Fire, I guess, Tom, 
can you maybe talk about Kindle Fire hardware units? Or did you see an 
increase in terms of unit sales on a month
-
on
-
month basis in terms of 
linearity? Second, as it rel
ates to fulfillment, can you talk about what's your 
thinking in terms of getting closer to the end consumer and trying to drop 
delivery times to same
-
day delivery as you kind of look forward in terms of 
planning and thinking of what's the optimal experienc
e from a consumer 
standpoint?
 
Thomas J. Szkutak
 
In terms of data related to Kindle Fire and actually Kindle itself, the only 
thing I can help you with is on the holiday season, which we put in the 
release. We had a 
--
 
our unit sales nearly tripled. It was 
up 177%, and that 
includes both our Kindle e
-
reader and Kindle Fire. So we're very pleased with 
the great growth we had. And obviously, we've been growing quite fast over 
the last several years from a unit perspective in launching Kindle. So it's on 
a very
 
good base. In terms of fulfillment and delivery time, we're continually 
trying to improve all of our processes around from a customer standpoint, 
and that includes fulfillment and delivery speed. And so you've seen over the 
last several years, we've gotte
n closer and closer to customers from a 
delivery speed standpoint. And when we do that, it not only helps our retail 
offering, but it helps also our third parties who are participating in Fulfilled 
by Amazon. And one of the things that you're seeing in our
 
Q4 numbers is 
we saw very good unit growth. And you're seeing that we expanded our 
third party as a percentage of total units. And one of the ways we did that is 
certainly by Fulfilled by Amazon because again, from a customer standpoint, 
those units are a
vailable for express 2
-
day shipping or 1
-
day if you're a 
Prime member and you pay the small fee, as well as our free shipping offers.
 
Operator
 
And we'll take our next question from analyst Scott Devitt from Morgan 
Stanley.
 
Scott W. Devitt 
-
 
Morgan Stanley,
 
Research Division
 
Two if I could. The first one, Tom, North American segment sales 
decelerated, and if you can, adjustment for Kindle Fire, by a pretty good bit. 
You mentioned third
-
party mix, which I think is a negative impact on that, 
and was wondering 
if you could just talk through the other dynamics if Prime 
is becoming more mature in the U.S. and/or the agency book business, the 
mix shift you're having given the strength of the Kindle product, if that's 
actually having a negative impact on revenue gro
wth?
 
Thomas J. Szkutak
 
Sure. In terms of our overall 
--
 
I'll talk to the total worldwide, as well as to 
the North America piece. But what I was mentioning was our growth rate for 
global revenue was 34%, excluding exchange. That compares to 39% in Q3 
and 37
% last year. If you compare our unit growth, that's a paid unit 
growth, was 46%. Again this is globally in Q4. That compares to 37% in Q4 
last year. So we saw an acceleration in unit growth. On top of that, what we 
saw was third
-
party units grew 65% year
-
o
ver
-
year, and our third
-
party 
units as a percentage of total units were 36%, up from 32%. And so really 
what you're seeing is you're seeing great adoption. Certainly, great revenue 
from a third
-
party perspective. But you're seeing very good adoption of FBA
 
that has grown considerably over the last few years, and that's certainly 
impacting that number. But obviously, we only book a portion of the revenue 
based on the commissions we receive for that business and our top line 
growth. So that's what you're seei
ng in total. And you're seeing that also 
happen in North America, as well as International. To the other comments, a 
few other things to call out in terms of North America. If you take a look at 
our EGM revenue, certainly there was some impact in certain s
ubcategories 
related to the Thailand flood. It certainly impacted some supply. Again, the 
good news is we certainly had some good third
-
party offerings in many of 
those subcategories as well. Same as 
--
 
another similar fact is in North 
America media, we sa
w very, very strong growth in digital media from books 
to video, music. All of those grew very well. We did see video games, which 
includes both consoles and games. Keep in mind that Q4 is very seasonal for 
video games. We actually saw our revenue decline 
year
-
over
-
year in video 
games. We had very strong third
-
party offerings, so our third
-
party growth 
was up. Our unit growth in video games was up, but our revenue was down. 
And that's what you're seeing impacting the North American media number, 
particularl
y versus Q4 last year. So again, those are some of the dynamics. 
But again, what you're seeing is some of this, certainly the strong 
performance on third
-
party sellers, is also impacting the top line, because 
we just recorded a portion of that sale, the co
mmission. But you're seeing it 
positively impact operating income, which is why you see it came in a little 
bit above the guidance that we gave.
 
Scott W. Devitt 
-
 
Morgan Stanley, Research Division
 
And as it relates to CapEx, the run rate, if you go back to
 
'05, you were 
about 2% 
--
 
a little over 2% of revenue, and it's been ramping. I know some 
of the last 2 years this included the building, but we exited 2012 I think at a 
3.7% of revenue on a trailing basis. So I was wondering if you can just talk 
to the w
ay that we should think about CapEx as a percentage of revenue or 
otherwise over the next few years.
 
Thomas J. Szkutak
 
Sure. We look at it certainly on an incremental 
--
 
from an incremental 
growth standpoint. And we look at it versus incremental unit growt
h, as well 
as what we think the NPVs for those specific investments are. But if you 
break down the individual pieces, again, as we've talked about in the last 
several calls, we've just seen such dramatic growth in both, first of all, from 
a retail perspect
ive, on our retail offerings, been growing very fast. Our 
third
-
party with Fulfilled by Amazon, very fast. AWS has been growing very 
fast, and so the capacity that we've needed to support both our operations 
capability, as well as the infrastructure capabi
lity for our Web Services and 
our Retail business has been very high. That said, we feel that we're 
efficiently deploying that capital. We added 
--
 
as we talked about last call, 
we had planned to add 17 FCs, which is what we did in 2011, bringing our 
total
 
to 69. And again, that represents the high growth that we're 
experiencing. So we feel very good about the investments that we're 
making. And with 46% paid unit growth in Q4, we're still experiencing very 
high growth.
 
Operator
 
Our next question is coming f
rom analyst Mark Mahaney from the firm of 
Citi.
 
Mark S. Mahaney 
-
 
Citigroup Inc, Research Division
 
Tom, just a little more color on that North American media growth. You 
talked about the unit trends and the revenue trends in video games. 
Anything you'd wan
t to call out in terms of the other media segments: 
books, music and video? And then real briefly, the share buybacks. I think 
this is the first time in at least 2 years you've done that. Any particular 
reason why you brought back stock in the quarter?
 
Tho
mas J. Szkutak
 
Sure. In terms of the North American media, again, across all of digital 
media, very strong growth. Another call
-
out that I didn't mention is physical 
books. Unit growth was double digit in Q4 year
-
over
-
year, which we were 
very 
pleased with if you think about the shift to digital content and just the 
really rapid growth on the Kindle side. We were pleased to see that. And 
then I'd mentioned the video games was again down from a revenue 
perspective. Third
-
party GMS was up strongly
. Unit growth in total for video 
games was up. Again, there's some difficult compares as you can imagine 
with some of the console piece of that. And again, when I talk video games, 
it's both console and video games. And keep in mind that video games in 
par
ticular is very seasonal, and usually, we see in Q4, and we did see this 
Q4 as well as other Q4s, that video games sales for the quarter is multiples 
of what we see in other quarters, again because of the seasonality. So 
hopefully that's helpful. And then 
in terms of the stock purchase, we've had 
a 
--
 
there's not a lot to comment there. We have said in the past that we'll 
opportunistically buy when we think it's the right value, and that's what we 
did.
 
Operator
 
Our next question is coming from analyst Spenc
er Wang from the firm of 
Crédit Suisse.
 
Spencer Wang 
-
 
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division
 
Tom, 2 quick questions. One is, I think the new disclosure on service sales, 
maybe I missed the footnote in the press release, could you just clarify 
what's included
 
there? Is that 3P, FBA, Prime, AWS and shipping? Or did I 
maybe miss something? And then secondly, can you share with us maybe 
your plans for how many fulfillment centers you plan on opening in 2012?
 
Thomas J. Szkutak
 
Sure. In terms of the disclosure, I w
ould want to guide you right to the 
release to see exactly what's included in there. But certainly, in terms of 
some of the big pieces, it is our third
-
party. It is also AWS and a number of 
other service offerings. And so those are again documented well th
ere, and 
I'd like to point you to that. Also, you can see that it's growing very well, 
and it reflects on the comments I made earlier about the fast
-
growing AWS 
businesses, the fast
-
growing third
-
party business. Service revenue is up 
approximately 74% year
-
over
-
year in Q4. And then in terms of fulfillment, 
we added 17 new FCs in 2011. That's globally. We do plan, based on the 
strong growth, to add more in 2012. As you can imagine, coming out of Q4, 
we're finalizing our plans for what we're going to do there
. And you'll have to 
stay tuned, and we'll keep you updated as we go throughout the year.
 
Operator
 
[Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from Youssef Squali 
with Jefferies & Company as the firm.
 
Youssef H. Squali 
-
 
Jefferies & Company, Inc., 
Research Division
 
So going back to the media question, Tom, can you maybe just help us 
quantify the video games revenue impact, maybe just on the level of 
deceleration? We would've thought that maybe with the launch of Kindle 
Fire, et cetera, we would've s
een maybe a higher attach rate and therefore, 
maybe a higher media revenue growth. And second, just on the streaming 
service, any plans to separate 
--
 
to offer separate pricing for the video 
streaming product? And that's it.
 
Thomas J. Szkutak
 
Yes, just to 
be clear, I'm separating our digital 
--
 
when I talk about our 
growth rates, I'm talking about our digital content businesses across
-
the
-
board grew very strongly during Q4. The video games, physical, as well as 
consoles business, again grows. It's just seas
onally very high. It's not 
--
 
if 
you take a look at it, it's not too dissimilar to what you'd see with our 
electronics portion of our EGM business. It's a very seasonal business, very 
heavy weighted in Q4. And so that's no different. That's not different t
his 
year than in other years. What is different is growth was down from a 
revenue perspective year
-
over
-
year. It was up from a units perspective. And 
again, the reason why it was up is because we had strong third
-
party sales 
in Q4. Keep in mind though, cer
tainly console is a part of that. And again, 
we include consoles and video games as part of our video games line within 
North America media. And you've probably seen other press related to that 
as you look at other releases and updates. But there has been 
a lot of new 
offerings there recently.
 
Youssef H. Squali 
-
 
Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division
 
And on the video streaming?
 
Thomas J. Szkutak
 
I'm sorry, what was your question on that? Could you repeat it again?
 
Youssef H. Squali 
-
 
Jefferies & Comp
any, Inc., Research Division
 
Just on the video streaming side, trying to figure out whether there are any 
other short
-
term plans to offer 
--
 
to strip that out basically from Kindle from 
the Prime and offer it as a standalone offering?
 
Thomas J. Szkutak
 
Wel
l, for digital video, we have a couple different offerings. One is a paid or 
rental offering as part of Amazon Video. We also have a service as part of 
Prime. We like both of them. We made some 
--
 
we put some comments in 
the release about the growth rates 
associated with those. And on the Prime 
that's in Video, we actually like what we see there also. And so it's still early, 
but we like what we see. We are investing in digital content. We're seeing 
great adoption. We're looking at it very carefully to unde
rstand a lot of 
different metrics around that business as you'd expect. And it's still early 
again. We really like what we see so far. We're going to continue to monitor 
it closely, but we will be continuing to add content there.

I was wondering if you could comment a little bit about any cannibalization 
you think you saw in traditional Kindle readers 
as a result of the Fire launch. 
And subsequently, how are you feeling about the Prime conversion of the 
Fire units versus your expectations?
 
Thomas J. Szkutak
 
In terms of both devices, meaning the readers and Fire, did very well and 
we're very pleased with
 
the growth we're seeing there. And that's part of the 
--
 
both are included in the growth rate that we had in our release, which is 
again during the holiday season. It was up 177% year
-
over
-
year. And again, 
we've been growing certainly our Kindle reader bu
siness very fast over the 
past several years since introduction. And so it's on top of a good base. And 
so we're pleased with the growth rate, and customers like both the reader 
and the Fire. Early to tell on Prime conversion. But again, early stats that 
w
e're seeing, we like a lot. And so we'll continue to see how that looks going 
forward, but we like what we're seeing.

Our next question is coming from analyst Justin Post with firm Bank of 
America Merrill Lynch.

Lynch, Research Division
 
Your headcount growth in the quarter was 67%, which is quite a bit higher 
than units or revenue growth. Can you talk about what all those people are 
focused on, maybe a couple of the bigger areas? And is there are day 
coming when y
ou could envision that kind of slowing to below either unit or 
revenue growth with maybe the timeframe on that?
 
Thomas J. Szkutak
 
Sure. First thing is we are investing in a lot of different areas across the 
business, as we've talked about. That being said,
 
when you look at that 
increase that you're referring to, the majority of those increases are in our 
operations and customer service area. And so again, it's in support of the 
growth. And certainly, you're seeing it also in our operating costs. And 
again, 
we're fortunate to have a lot of opportunities. We're fortunate to have 
the growth that we're experiencing, and that's why you're seeing that 
growth. But certainly, you'll see that. As you have over time, you'll see that 
growth rate will go in cycles. But 
we certainly are feeding the growth that 
we're seeing and the opportunities that we have.

And our next question is coming from Jordan Rohan with the firm Stifel, 
Nicolaus.
 
Jordan Rohan

Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division
 
So I'm tryin
g to better understand the guided range for 1Q. And specifically, 
I'm looking at 2 things. First, the impact of currency and really more macro 
weakness in Western Europe. Are you seeing anything there? Is there 
anything that makes you think that things cou
ld be getting materially worse 
in any of your territories? And specific language around which of the 
countries you may be seeing could be quite helpful. And second, I'm 
wondering if you are seeing, or have seen over the course of the last 
quarter, a shift 
of consumer buying habits towards the hardware device 
sales and away from media, and perhaps that could explain the deceleration 
in the media that we appear to be seeing in North America.
 
Thomas J. Szkutak
 
In terms of international growth or in terms of, f
irst of all, your question on 
guidance and the impact of exchange, we have a modest assumption around 
exchanges. Again, we're using the recent exchange rates. But the range for 
growth was 22% to 36%, and it was unfavorably impacting us by about 50 
basis po
ints for foreign exchange. In terms of growth in, you mentioned 
Western Europe, if you take a look at International in Q4, it was up 29% on 
a local
-
currency basis. It did hold up pretty well given obviously the 
challenges that are going on, specifically in
 
Europe from an economic 
standpoint. We're not 
--
 
we don't view ourselves as a bellwether for the 
economy, but certainly we're seeing that it is softer. Hard to quantify how 
much higher that international growth would have been. But it was certainly 
--
 
we'
re all seeing the same thing in terms of the reports in Europe and it's 
certainly soft. So it is impacting our overall growth rate, but hard to tell how 
much. And then on the 
--
 
again on the North America media growth, it's 
actually again very, very strong
 
on the digital content side. Physical books 
were up double digits from a unit perspective, which we thought was 
impressive given the shift to Kindle. And again, video games and video game 
consoles were certainly the biggest call
-
out there from a negative 
standpoint. And that growth was down year
-
over
-
year on a revenue basis 
but up from a unit perspective.

Our next question is from analyst Gene Munster with the firm of Piper 
Jaffray.

If we just take a step back and look at this from a high level, over the last 
couple of years, you've been making significant investments in the business, 
and it's been paying off with just some impressive growth numbers off of 
what have been larger and
 
larger numbers. And I think the big surprise for 
investors tonight is just what appears to be a diminishing return on that 
investment. And I don't know if you can use this as a forum to kind of 
address that concern.
 
Thomas J. Szkutak
 
Yes, I'm not sure how
 
to answer that, or exactly what you mean. What I 
would say is we have been investing very heavily as you mentioned. And as 
a result of that, Q4 unit growth was 46% year
-
over
-
year. That's paid unit 
growth. And we see a lot of opportunity in front of us. An
d yes, there's some 
pockets of softness or challenges with some of the economic impact, 
particularly in Europe. We did see some supply issues with the Thailand 
flood, with certainly some subcategories within some of our hard lines 
businesses as a result. W
e think those things will work themselves out over 
time. But we're incredibly optimistic about the opportunity that we have, and 
that's why we have invested the way we have and why we're continuing to 
invest in the business. So we're very pleased to see it
 
and very pleased to 
have the opportunities that we have in front of us.

Okay. So your outlook in terms of investment philosophy hasn't changed 
versus last quarter going forward.
 
Thomas J.
 
Szkutak
 
No, no. We're continuing to look. As we always do, we learn every week and 
every month and every quarter about more and more about customer 
adoption. And we're looking at just a lot of positive things across the 
business in terms of adoption of ou
r digital offerings, very specifically Kindle 
growth from a device standpoint and the content that's following that. And 
we're seeing some very strong growth along many categories. If you look at 
EGM, we're seeing very good growth in categories like soft l
ines, particularly 
clothing. We're seeing very good growth in consumables. We're seeing very 
good growth outside of some of these supply
-
constrained areas. Within 
consumer electronics, we're seeing good growth. So there's a lot of positive 
things within EG
M. Within our business, we're seeing just tremendous 
growth in Amazon Web Services, so I'm very pleased with how the team is 
doing there, and they're just doing a great job. And so there's a lot of 
interesting opportunities that we continue to invest in. S
o we're very 
pleased, and we're very pleased with the performance in Q4 and what it 
means going forward for us.

Our last question is from analyst Doug Anmuth with the firm of JP Morgan.

JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division
 
Just
 
a couple things. So you're obviously building a lot into Prime with video 
and also the Kindle Lending Library. Can you just give us a sense of how the 
profitability of a Prime customer changes over time? And then also, if you 
could comment more specifical
ly on the early returns on sort of the media 
rate 
--
 
media purchases as it relates to Kindle Fire owners specifically?
 
Thomas J. Szkutak
 
Sure. In each of our video 
--
 
excuse me, in each of our digital contents that 
we're offering, whether it be as part of 
Prime, whether it be Lending Library 
or whether it be video, we just have early results. And so from a return 
perspective, we're going to see 
--
 
what we can see so far is what's 
happening with adoption of Prime members, what's happening with free trial 
con
version, what's happening with Prime memberships that we can attribute 
directly to those services. And again, it's very, very early. But so far, we see, 
we like, which is why we're continuing down the path specifically of adding 
more content to Prime and m
aking Prime better. And so that's something 
that we, over time, we've learned both with our physical offerings and now 
early on in our digital offering, it's something that we think is very good for 
customers and very good for share owners. And so that's s
omething that 
we're focused a lot on. Because we're investing a lot there, we are taking a 
very close look at and making sure that we understand it very well. And 
from what we see so far, it supports a continued strong investment there. 
And so that's what 
we're doing. But again, we'll continue to monitor that 
very closely. And over time, we'll be sharing more about how we're doing 
there.

Thank you for standing by. Good day everyone and welcome to the 
Amazon.com Second Quarter 2013 Financial Results Teleconference. At this 
time, all participants are in a listen
-
only mode. After the presentation, we 
will conduct a 
question
-
and
-
answer session. Today's call is being recorded.
 

Investor Relations, Mr. Sean Boyle. Please go ahead sir.
 
Sean Boyle
 
Hello and welcome to our Q2 2013 financial results con
ference call. Joining 
us today is Tom Szkutak, our CFO. We will be available for questions after 
our prepared remarks.
 
The following discussion and responses to your questions reflect 
management's views as of today, July 25, 2013 only and will include 
forw
ard
-
looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional 
information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is 
included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our 
most recent annual repor
t on Form 10
-
K.
 

release in front of you, which includes our financial results, as well as 
metrics and commentary on the quarter. During this call, we will discuss 
certain non
-
GAAP
 
financial measures. In our press release, slides 
accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is 
posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these 
non
-
GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these 
measures with 
comparable GAAP measures.
 
Finally, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against 
our results for the comparable period of 2012.

ts on our second quarter financial 
results. Trailing 12
-
month operating cash flow increased 41% to $4.53 
billion. Trailing 12
-
month free cash flow decreased 76% to $265 million. 
Trailing
-
12 month capital expenditures were $4.27 billion. This amount 
include
s $1.4 billion in purchases of our previously leased corporate office 
space, as well as property for development of additional corporate office 
space located in Seattle, Washington which we purchased in the fourth 
quarter 2012.
 
The increase in capital expe
nditures reflects additional investments in 
support of continued business growth consisting of investments in 
technology, infrastructure including Amazon Web Services and additional 
capacity to support our fulfillment operations.
 
Return on invested capital
 
was 2%, down from 11%. ROIC is TTM free cash 
flow divided by average total assets minus current liabilities excluding the 
current portion of long
-
term debt over five quarter ends. The combination of 
common stock and stock
-
based awards outstanding was 474 
million shares 
compared with 468 million shares.
 
Worldwide revenue grew 22% to $15.7 billion or 25% excluding the $392 
million unfavorable impact from year
-
over
-
year changes in foreign exchange 
rate. We are grateful to our customers who continue to take ad
vantage of 
our low prices, vast selection and shipping offers.
 
Media revenue increased to $4.4 billion, up 7% or 11% excluding foreign 
exchange. EGM revenue increased to $10.42 billion, up 28% or 30% 
excluding foreign exchange. Worldwide EGM increased to 6
6% of worldwide 
sales, up from 64%.Worldwide paid unit growth was 29%. Active customer 
accounts exceeded 215 million. Worldwide active seller accounts were more 
than 2 million. Seller units represented 40% of paid units.
 
Now I will discuss operating expens
es, excluding stock
-
based compensation. 
Cost of sales was $11.21 billion, or 71.4% of revenue, compared with 
73.9%. Fulfillment, marketing, tech and content and G&A combined was 
$4.09 billion, or 26% of sales, up approximately 275 basis points year
-
over
-
ye
ar. Fulfillment was $1.76 billion, or 11.2% of revenue compared with 
10.1%. Tech and content was $1.43 billion, or 9.1% of revenue, compared 
with 7.6%. Marketing was $651 million, or 4.1% of revenue consistent with 
prior period.
 

egment results and consistent with prior periods, 
we do not allocate the segments, our stock
-
based compensation or other 
operating expense line item.
 
In the North America segment, revenue grew 30% to $9.49 billion. Media 
revenue grew 16% to $2.17 billion. 
EGM revenue grew 31% to $6.48 billion, 
representing 68% of North America revenues, up from 67%. North America 
segment operating income increased 19% to $409 million, a 4.3% operating 
margin.
 
In the international segment, revenue grew 13% to $6.21 billion. 
Adjusting 
for the $391 million year
-
over
-
year unfavorable foreign exchange impact, 
revenue growth was 20%. Media revenue decreased 1% to $2.22 billion, or 
grew 7% excluding foreign exchange, and EGM revenue grew 22% to $3.94 
billion, or 29% excluding forei
gn exchange. EGM now represents 63% of 
international revenues, up from 59%.
 
International segment operating income was zero, down from $16 million in 
the prior
-
year period. Excluding the unfavorable impact from foreign 
exchange, international segment opera
ting income increased to 11%.
 
CSOI increased 14% to $409 million, or 2.6% of revenue, down 
approximately 20 basis points year
-
over
-
year. Excluding the unfavorable 
impact from foreign exchange, CSOI increased 19%. Unlike CSOI, our GAAP 
operating income incl
udes stock
-
based compensation expense and other 
operating expense.
 
GAAP operating income decreased 26% to $79 million, or 0.5% of net sales. 
Our income tax expense was $13 million. GAAP net loss was $7 million or 
$0.02 per diluted share compared with net i
ncome of $7 million and $0.01 
per diluted share.
 
Turning to the balance sheet, cash and marketable securities increased 
$2.49 billion year
-
over
-
year to $7.46 billion. Inventory increased 24% to 
$5.42 billion and inventory turns were 9.4, down from 10.1 tur
ns a year
-
ago 
as we expanded selection, improved in stock levels and introduced new 
product categories. Accounts payable increased 27% to $8.99 billion and 
accounts payable days increased to 73 from 68 in the prior
-
year.
 

 
call with guidance. Incorporated into our 

-
date and what we believe 
today to be appropriately conservative assumptions. Our results are 
inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors
, 
including a high
-
level of uncertainty surrounding exchange rate fluctuations 

accurately predict demand and therefore our actual results could differ 
materially from our guidance. A

filings issues such as settling intercompany balances in foreign currencies 
among such subsidiaries, unfavorable resolution of legal matters and 
changes to our effective tax rates can all have a material effec
t on guidance.
 
Our guidance further assumes that we don't conclude any additional 
business acquisitions, investments, restructurings or legal settlements, 
record any further revisions to stock
-
based compensation estimates and that 
foreign exchange rates re
main approximately where they have been 
recently.
 
For Q3, 2013 we expect net sales of between $15.45 billion and $17.15 
billion, a growth between 12% and 24%. This guidance anticipates 
approximately 300 basis points of unfavorable impact from foreign excha
nge 
rates. GAAP operating loss to be between $440 million and $65 million 
compared to $28 million in the third quarter of 2012. This includes 
approximately $340 million of stock
-
based compensation and amortization of 
intangible assets.
 
We anticipate consol
idated segment operating income or loss, which 
excludes stock
-
based compensation and other operating expense to be 
between $100 million loss and $275 million in income compared to $232 
million of income in third quarter 2012. We remain heads down focused o
n 
driving a better customer experience through price, selection, and 
convenience. We believe putting customers first is the only reliable way to 
create lasting value for shareholders.

Great. Thanks Tom. Let's move on to the Q&A portion of the call. Operator, 
will you please remind our listeners how to initiate a question?

Thanks, guys. Just have one question on shipping. It looks like the unit 
efficiency in shipping continues to improve, what are you guys doing to drive 
the cost of shipping each unit lower? Are there more cost that can b
e taken 
out on a per unit basis? And then as you start looking at same day delivery 
in some of these markets, including the new grocery program, what 
incremental costs do you see around doing same day fulfillment? Thanks.
 
Thomas J. Szkutak
 
In terms of the 

working on how do we serve customers reliably and faster. So that 

 

standpoint, we just as we add capacity, which is gett
ing closer and closer to 
customers with larger selection which is certainly helpful from a productivity 
standpoint. So, those are some of the dynamics that you need to think 
about, when you think about our transportation cost and the teams done a 
great job
 
over the years of becoming even more reliable, faster, and more 
productive and again that we working on ways to make that it better over 
time.

Great. Thanks for taking my q
uestion. I was hoping if you could talk a little 

when is the right time to expand to more markets beyond Seattle and LA? 
And then also if you could comment on the European macro
 
environment, 
just given the growth that you saw in the international business just 
decelerating a little bit from last quarter? Thanks.
 
Thomas J. Szkutak
 
In terms of the, the fresh business, we started doing the pilot several years 
ago in Seattle. We did 
a number of 

 
team has done a great job, inventing 



ifferent 
experiments and invented well on behalf of customers that to see what

Hi. Good afternoon. Could you help us understand the third
-
party unit 
growth? I think this is the first quarter i
n about three years that third
-
party 

could comment at all on potential to expand prime membership options, 
potentially it is something like a super prime offering for expanded video 
content and fulfillment options?
 
Thomas J. Szkutak
 
In terms of the third
-
party unit growth, it was 40% this quarter, which 
compares to 40% last year in Q2. So again, it is flat as a percentage of total 
units. One thing we keep in mind though is our digital
 
units are growing at a 
faster rate than physical. And those digital units are primarily first party 

approximately 300 basis points. So, physical seller business is growing very
 

very pleased to see that.

Hi. Thanks. I guess, the International topic 
again, but it has been asked a

Company hypothesis is in terms of the way that market plays out over time 
and how you think about investment spend in that market. And then 
secondly, as it 


 
the annual event and 
the quarterly events that happened, I was wondering when you think it 
makes sense to start talking more about it in releases and on calls? Is it just 
the 10% revenue threshold or something else th

discussions on that, on calls like this? Thanks.

Two quick questions on revenue recognition, over the past some quarters I 
believe that the certain digital media at least has moved around between the 
agency and wholesale model. Can you help us quantify how this has actually 
imp
acted the reported media revenue rates in other words would 2Q 
revenue rates have been meaningfully different if the model had been the 
same. And then the second question, just quickly on Prime, can you remind 
us how you recognized revenue from the Prime m
emberships deal over the 
course of the year? Thanks.
 
Thomas J. Szkutak
 
Sure. In terms of the Prime we recognized it over the life of the subscription. 
And then in terms of third party versus first party certainly we have had 
some shift within digital media
, but again digital media is primarily a first 

actually right, and in terms of our third party business which from a unit 
perspective is 40% of our total units this quarter. We re
cognized the share 
of that revenue, the rev share if you will ad revenue where as the other

very much. I guess a quick follow up on the device strategy and 
given the fairly quick pace of innovation in the tablet market overall. I 
wonder if you can contrast the benefits of that for Amazon given the 
popularity of shopping in media apps with the co
st and complexity of 
maintaining your own line of hardware, and related to this it seems as if the 
pace of new content acquisition on licensing has picked up a bit and so I 
wonder if that reflects any changes in either the competitive dynamics or 
pricing o

Thank you for standing by. Good day everyone and welcome to the 
Amazon.com Third Quarter 2013 Financial Results Teleconference. At this 
time, all participants are in a listen
-
only mode. After the presentation, we 
will conduct a 
question
-
and
-

 
For opening remarks, I will be turning the call over to the Vice President of 
Investor Relations, Mr. Sean Boyle. Please go ahead sir.
 
Sean Boyle
 
Hello and welcome to our Q3 2013 financial result
s conference call. Joining 
us today is Tom Szkutak, our CFO. We will be available for questions after 
our prepared remarks.
 
The following discussion and responses to your questions reflect 

ude 
forward
-
looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional 
information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is 

most recent Annu
al Report on Form 10
-
K.
 

release in front of you, which includes our financial results, as well as our 
metrics and commentary on the quarter. During this call, we will discuss 
cert
ain non
-
GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides 
accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is 
posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these 
non
-
GAAP measures, including reconciliatio
ns of these measures with 
comparable GAAP measures. Finally, unless otherwise stated, all 
comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period 
of 2012.
 

 
Tom Szkutak
 
Thanks Sean. I will begin wit
h comments on our third quarter financial 
results. Trailing 12
-
month operating cash flow increased 48% to $4.98 
billion. Trailing 12
-
month free cash flow decreased 63% to $388 million. 
Trailing 12
-
month capital expenditures were $4.59 billion. This amount 
includes $1.4 billion in purchases of our previously leased corporate office 
space as well as property for development of additional corporate office 
space located in Seattle, Washington, which we purchased in the fourth 
quarter of 2012. The increase in ca
pital expenditures reflects additional 
investments in support of our continued business growth consisting of 
investments in technology infrastructure, including Amazon Web Services 
and additional capacity to support our fulfillment operations.
 
Return on in
vested capital was 3%, down from 10%. ROIC is TTM free cash 
flow divided by average total assets minus current liabilities excluding the 
current portion of long
-
term debt over five quarter ends. The combination of 
common stock and stock
-
based awards outsta
nding was 475 million shares 
compared with 469 million shares.
 
Worldwide revenue grew 24% to $17.09 billion or 26% excluding the $332 
million unfavorable impact from year
-
over
-
year changes in the foreign 
exchange rate. We are grateful to our customers who 
continue to take 
advantage of our low prices, vast selection and shipping offers.
 
Media revenue increased to $5.03 billion, up 9% or 13% excluding foreign 
exchange. EGM revenue increased to $11.05 billion, up 29% or 31% 
excluding foreign exchange. Worldwid
e EGM increased to 65% of worldwide 
sales, up from 62%.Worldwide paid unit growth was 29%. Active customer 
accounts exceeded 224 million. Worldwide active seller accounts were more 
than 2 million. Seller units represented 40% of paid units.
 
Now, I will dis
cuss operating expenses, excluding stock
-
based 
compensation. Cost of sales was $12.37 billion or 72.3% of revenue 
compared with 74.7%. Fulfillment, marketing, technology and content and 
G&A combined was $4.46 billion, or 26.1% of sales, up approximately 25
0 
basis points year
-
over
-
year. Fulfillment was $1.96 billion, or 11.5% of 
revenue, compared with 10.5%. Tech and content was $1.58 billion, or 
9.2% of revenue compared with 7.8%. Marketing was $671 million, or 3.9% 
of revenue, compared with 3.8%.
 
Now I'll 
talk about our segment results. In consistent with prior periods, we 
do not allocate the segments or stock
-
based compensation or other 
operating expense line item. In the North America segment, revenue grew 
31% to $10.3 billion. Media revenue grew 18% to $
2.61 billion. EGM 
revenue grew 33% to $6.73 billion, representing 65% of North America 
revenues up from 64%. North America segment operating income increased 
1% to $295 million, a 2.9% operating margin.
 
In the International segment, revenue grew 15% to $6.
79 billion. Adjusting 
for the $327 million year
-
over
-
year unfavorable foreign exchange impact, 
revenue growth was 20%. Media revenue increased 2% to $2.42 billion or 
9% excluding foreign exchange. And EGM revenue grew 23% to $4.32 
billion, or 28% excluding
 
foreign exchange. EGM now represents 64% of 
International revenues up from 59%.
 
International segment operating loss was 28 million compared to a $59 
million loss in the prior period. Consolidated segment operating income 
interested 15% to $267 million or
 
1.6% of revenue down approximately 10 
basis points year
-
over
-
year. Excluding the unfavorable impact from foreign 
exchange CSOI increased 18%.
 
Unlike CSOI our GAAP operating income or loss includes stock based 
compensation expense and other operating expen
se. GAAP operating loss 
was $25 million compared to a $28 million in the prior year period. Our 
income tax benefit was $12 million, GAAP net loss was $41 million $0.09 per 
diluted share compared with net loss of $274 million or $0.60 per diluted 
share. The
 
third quarter 2012 included a loss of $169 million or $0.37 per 
diluted share related to our equity method share of losses recorded by Living 
Social primarily attributable to impairment charge of certain assets including 
goodwill.
 
Turning to the balance s
heet, cash and marketable securities increased 
$2.44 billion year
-
over
-
year to $7.69 billion. Inventory increased 20% to 
$6.07 billion and inventory turns were 9.2, down from 9.7 turns a year ago 
as we expanded selection, improved in stock levels and intro
duced new 
product categories. Accounts payable increased 20% to $10.04 billion and 
accounts payable days was 75 consistent with the prior year.
 

our guidance are the order trends th
at we've seen to
-
date and what we 
believe today to be appropriately conservative assumptions. Our results are 
inherently unpredictable and maybe materially affected by many factors, 
including a high level of uncertainties surrounding exchange rate 
fluctuat
ions, as well as the global economy and consumer spending. It's not 
possible to accurately predict demand, and therefore, our actual results 
could differ materially from our guidance.
 
As we described in more detail in our public filings, issues such as set
tling 
intercompany balances and foreign currencies amongst our subsidiaries, 
unfavorable resolution of legal matters and changes to our effective tax 
rates can all have a material effect on guidance. Our guidance further 
assumes that we don't conclude any 
additional business acquisitions, 
investments, restructurings or real settlements, record any further revisions 
to stock
-
based compensation estimates and that foreign exchange rates 
remain approximately where they've been recently.
 
For Q4 2013, we expect n
et sales of between $22.5 billion and $26.5 billion, 
a growth between 10% and 25%. This guidance anticipates approximately 
125 basis points of unfavorable impact from foreign exchange rates. GAAP 
operating income or loss will be between a $500 million loss
 
and $500 
million in income compared to $405 million income in the fourth quarter of 
2012. This includes approximately $350 million for stock
-
based 
compensation and amortization of intangible assets.
 
We anticipate consolidated segment operating income or l
oss, which 
excludes stock
-
based compensation and other expense to be between $150 
million loss and $850 million income compared to $678 million income in 
fourth quarter 2012. We remain heads down focused on driving a better 
customer experience through pric
e, selection and convenience. We believe 
putting customers first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for 
shareholders.

Hey, Tom. On the press release it 
says that you have signed up millions of 
new Prime members and I believe if you read it says it if that happened in 
the last 90 days. I wonder if you ever commented on a time period like that 
before and is that a normal run rate to add millions of Prime us
ers in 90 
days or is there something special in this quarter that drove prime? Thanks.

but we are very excited Prime is growing very fast, very excited for the 
service that we offer customers both in terms of physical and digital goods.

Hi, Tom. Two if I could, first on the Kindle family, it seems like the timing of 
device launches the e
-
book library size in local language content could be 
drivers of different levels of penetratio
n of digital media in the U.S. relative 
to what you have been able to attain outside the U.S. to
-
date? And I was 
wondering if there was anything else notable that you would highlight that 
helps explain the different dynamic that seems to be playing out wit
hin the 
media revenue line domestically versus international? And whether you think 
in any of those issues are structural or to just work themselves out with the 
benefit of time and your execution? And then secondly, if you could talk a bit 
about how you t
hink about the lifetime value of the non
-
Prime customer 
versus the Prime customer and what the intended outcome maybe as it 
relates to the increase in Super Saver pricing in the U.S. market? Thanks.
 
Tom Szkutak
 
In terms of the first question, certainly we 
have been launched devices in 
the U.S. earlier in terms of content both you are really referring to mostly e
-
book content, both growing very fast. The base is different. As you 
mentioned, we have a higher base in the U.S. just based on when we 
launch, so y


 
you do see that difference in the 

both growing very nicely right now in terms of digital Kindle books in this 

different base. And so it looks like lots of 
opportunity that we have in both segments there, but we are further ahead 
right now in North America. And then, I am sorry, could you repeat the 
second part of your question again?
 
Scott Devitt

Morgan Stanley
 
Just how you are thinking about the lifetime value of those that are not 
Prime sales versus Prime sale that you are having an increase recently did 
with Super Saver Shipping in the U.S. from $25 to $35 threshold?
 
Tom Szkutak
 
Sure. In terms of the Prime cus
tomers, we have seen knowing a very strong 
increase and primary [ph] but we have seen very good retention of prime 
numbers. And so you know certainly when you look at that in terms of

different thresholds in various geographies around the world for super saved 
shipment, or super saver delivery in those geographies and the key to U.S. 
we have had the $25 threshold for over 10 years and we changed 35 and 
duri

eligible for that you know by millions items and certainly as you would know 
you know during this you know rather once the time frame transportation 
cost and fuel prices have changed them 
significantly over that time period so

I want to ask about the North America EGM
 
line, I guess it's the second 
quarter in a row you have had acceleration when I asked you about it last 
quarter I think you singled out fashion apparel and consumer staples. But 
the growth is, the acceleration really seems to be in
-
line with easing comps.
 

mass with your customers in those two particular categories and then just 
real quickly on the Kiva Robots is there a reason you would call that out? 
Should that have some sor
t of material impact overtime on leverage in the 
fulfillment cost line? Thank you.
 
Tom Szkutak
 
Sure in terms of you know our growth in EGM you highlighted a couple of 
categories that are growing very nicely, as we mentioned last quarter as 
well. You know w

broad. We have added a lot of unique selection of both our hardline and soft 
lines categories including consumables and apparently as you mentioned the 
experience is getting better on the site, unique
 
selection has increased 
dramatically over the past few year. So, just a number of things they are 
coming together in those category. So when I look at it, it just seems very 
broad which we like and you know there is just a lot of new selection with 
great 


launched few FCs you know we think it's an interesting opportunity. I think 

re ahead of the schedule that we 

excited of what we see. It's certainly we will be adding associates certainly 
overtime in those FCs but this certainly will be productivity with Kiva an

doing it. It is depressing, ROIC. Just keep in mind from a pure metric

by average invested capital. So total a

that relates to the purchase. It goes back to Q4 last year, but
 

TTM free cash flow that relates to the purchase of our campus here in

Thanks for taking my question. The seasonal hiring is I think last year grew 
about in line with the 
growth rate in U.S. revenue growth, but this year it 


 
you are growing at about 10 percentage points above the 

driving that? And then second question on pricing, there 
have been 
numerous reports recently and I think for a while now that the multi
-
channel 
competitors are competing more fiercely with the Amazon in terms of price 
parity etcetera, what impact are you seeing or do you think you could see 
from that and sort of
 
how are you addressing it? Thanks.
 
Tom Szkutak
 
In terms of the seasonal employees, unfortunately, there is not a lot I can 
add to that. We are getting ready for an exciting holiday season and that 
includes making sure that we have the right amount of empl
oyees as well as 
seasonal help during that period. It also includes making sure we have the 
right capacity in place, making sure we have had a lot of selection in the 
past couple of years and particularly over the past 12 months and making 
sure that we hav
e good in
-
stock levels related to that selection. We are 
making sure that we have people to help us with not only serving customers 
with our retail inventory, but also are fulfilled by Amazon grown certainly 
very strongly over the past year and that impact
s the capacity and a number 

number.
 


inceptio
n. We have many, many different competitors. You will pass those 
competitors on your way to work, on the way home. They are offline, they 


 
pricing is 
something that we worked very hard at ove
r the years. We want to make 
sure we have great values for customers and something that we spend a lot 
of time on and work very hard to make sure that we can offer that to 

have be
en dealing with since our inception, but it is a very competitive 
environment.

Thank you.
 
Tom Szkutak
 
You know in terms of China it's very early th
ere, there is certainly a room for 
many winners and it's a very large segment and you know we have seen we 
have good business there in terms of top
-
line it's growing and we will 
continue to look for ways to make sure that we satisfy customer demand. 
We wor
k on a lot of the same inputs, we work on our other geographies, 
make sure we have great prices, good selection, speed of delivery, we work 
very hard in terms of putting in a lot of capacity close to our customers and 

n and try to ensure success there. In 
terms of individual competitors you know we have a long standing practice 
of not let other companies but again there is room for a lot of winners and in 
terms of you know video content is not a lot. I can you know add 
to that 
question I apologize but certainly we had being ramping up our content in 
the U.S. on Amazon.com as part of Amazon Prime It's something that we 
have been you know looking at very carefully. We like what we see so far

We have seen some pretty good progress there in terms of year

year 
improvement, you know little bit of back step last quarter but not too much 
and the categories fell back. I am just kind of wonderi
ng if there is anything 
unusual in there in terms of timing or investments that maybe called out and 
how should we think about it 

 
that over the next few quarters?
 
Tom Szkutak
 
Sure. In terms of Q3 specifically, Q3 just because of the 

 
as I would call it 
the Q4 readiness, the seasonal readiness, you see this often in Q3 where 
both our total and our segment operating profit is lower than other quarters. 

terms of the investments we
 
are making to get ready for the season we 
talked about. You start and just quote the capacity that we are adding 
certainly in multiple geographies, but certainly in the North America it is 
impacting that as well. You can see it in our fulfillment line ite
m as a 
percentage of revenue being up. You can see it in our techno content, so we 
are certainly investing. The other part two that I mentioned earlier is we are 
investing in video content for Prime in the U.S. And you see that has 
certainly in those resul

building generally larger FCs and we are consolidating some of those. So

reaccelerating media revenue, you have seen reacceleration in media in the 
last three quarters, I think in North America? And then secondly, it looks like 
there is six fewer shopping days this holiday seas
on between Black Friday 
and Christmas, just curious what you do with anything differently to prepare 
for that and do you think that could actually even drive more holiday 
shopping online? Thanks.
 
Tom Szkutak
 
Sure. In terms of your second one, second questi
on, there are fewer days. 
There is not a lot that we do different. We certainly see when that happens. 
And there is some behavioral differences on behalf of customers just 
because of the shorter time period that we have certainly some more sizable 
days dur
ing that period, but there is not a lot to add to that. In terms of the 
transition for e

books, in terms of our total growth across Amazon both 

impact to the overall growth rates a

is and maybe which category have outperformed in the quarter?
 
Tom Szkutak
 
Sure. I would look at it more from turns perspective and if you look at it 
more over you know an average turns basis it has gone down and the 
reason is unique selection, we keep having growth in unique selection it has 
increased over the past year and stoc
k levels have gotten better and so 
those are things that are really driving it. In terms of endpoints or any

In terms of speed of delivery whether be it one day or same day, you know 

lot of selection. We have added fulfillment centers as a result of that we

improved and you know certainly for prime customers you know depending 
upon the geography in the case of U.S. you know express two day sh
ipping 

something that you know as you have seen that improvement you know 

even better over the l
ast few years as we have you know rapidly increased 

important and we will continue to work on behalf of customers to give them 
those options and to make sure that you know they get p
roduct when they 
want it. In terms of login and pay you know it's something that we think is 
interesting, you know because of our large customer base and you know the 
credentials that we have and the secure payments that we have we think it's 
an interestin

very excited about the long
-
term opportunity. In terms of you have 
mentioned the trends in the North Am

nice steady acceleration of growth since Q4 last year. So if you look back to 
Q4 last year for North America specifically and you just stress that back over 
the past four quarters, you are seeing a really nice sequenti
al increase from 
quarter

to
-
quarter. And again that gets back to went from 23% in Q4 last 
year to 26% to 30% and 31% versus the year

over

year increases by 
quarter for North America revenue. And a lot of this what we talked about

up to t

did you see any weakness or any discernible trends around the government 
shutdown in August, politics going on in Washington in September and early 
October? And separately, can you talk about what you are learning f
rom 
being an investor in living social with the accounting charges aside. Can you 
talk about your own local business how it may compete with other players in 
the space and all of the various initiatives you have with, what can be 
learned from what you know
 
at this point you are no longer a new investor 
in that company? Thank you.

In terms of North America growth other than what I mentioned on the 
quarterly growth, Q3 was strong. It was 31% growth. Again, we see the nice 
steady increase over the 
past four quarters that the overlap in the quarter 
from Q3 of last year that was 33%. So again, we like we see some growth 
perspectives in Q3 for North America. In terms of total growth, given the 
wide range for Q4 and that reflects our view for Q4, but we
 
are excited 
about the quarter and about getting ready for customers during this heavy 
seasonal quarter. So we are excited about what we see there. In terms of

Great, thank you. When you look at the deceleration in growth in North

I am not sure how to answer your question. It is, the only part I would call

Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Amazon.com Second Quarter 2011

Hello, and welcome to our Q2 2011 financial results conference call. Joining 
us today is Tom Szkutak, our CFO. We will be available for questions after 
our prepared remarks.
 
The following di
scussion and responses to your questions reflect 
management's views, as of today, July 26, 2011, only and will include 
forward
-
looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional 
information about factors that could potentially impact our 
financial results is 
included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our 
most recent annual report on Form 10

K.
 
As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press 
release in front of you, which includes 
our financial results, as well as 
metrics and commentary on the quarter.
 
During this call, we will discuss certain non

our IR website, you will find additional 
disclosures regarding these non

GAAP measures, including reconciliations of 
these measures with comparable GAAP measures.
 
Finally, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against 
our results fo
r the comparable period of 2010. Now I'll turn the call over to 
Tom.

Thanks, John. I'll begin with comments on our second quarter financial 
results. Trailing 12 month operating cash flow increased 25% to $3.21 
billion. Trailing 12 months fre
e cash flow decreased 8% to $1.83 billion. 
Return on invested capital is 21%, down from 34%. ROIC is TTM free cash 
flow divided by average total assets minus current liabilities, excluding the 
current portion of long
-
term debt over 5 quarter ends. The comb
ination of 
common stock and stock
-
based awards outstanding was 468 million shares 
compared with 465 million shares.
 
Worldwide revenue grew 51% to $9.91 billion or 44%, excluding the $477 
million favorable impact from year
-
over
-
year changes in foreign excha
nge. 
We're grateful to our customers who continue to take advantage of our low 
prices, vast selection and shipping offers.

were 36% of paid units compared to 36% of paid units in Q1 2011 and 34%

of revenue compared with 75.5%.

and
 
content was $624 million or 6.3% of revenue compared with 5.3%.

mpensation or other 
operating expense line item.

foreign exchang
e. EGM now represents 53% of international revenues, up 
from 47%.
 
International segment operating income decreased 16% to $172 million, a 
3.8% operating margin. Excluding the favorable impact of foreign exchange, 
International segment operating income decr
eased 34%. CSOI decreased 
5% to $386 million or 3.9% of revenue, down 229 basis points year
-
over
-
year. Excluding the $28 million favorable impact from foreign exchange, 
CSOI decreased 12%. Unlike CSOI, our GAAP operating income includes 
stock
-
based compens
ation expense and other operating expense. GAAP 
operating income decreased 25% to $201 million or 2% of net sales.
 
Our income tax expense was $49 million in Q2, resulting in a 22% rate for 
the quarter and a 26% rate year
-
to
-
date. GAAP net income was $191 m
illion 
or $0.41 per diluted share compared with $207 million and $0.45 per diluted 
share. Second quarter 2011 net income was positively impacted by equity 
method investment activity of $15 million, including the $49 million gain on 
sale of an equity positi
on partially offset by $34 million in losses from equity 
method investments.
 
Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and marketable securities increased 
$1.25 billion year
-
over
-
year to $6.36 billion. Inventory increased 66% to 
$3.23 billion and inventory turns 
were 11.3, down from 12.5 turns a year 
ago, as we expanded selection, improved in
-
stock levels and introduced new 
product categories.
 
Accounts payable increased 61% to $5.72 billion and accounts payable days 
increased to 69 from 65 in the prior year. Our Q
2 2011 capital expenditures 
were $433 million. The increase in capital expenditures reflects additional 
investments in support of continued business growth, including investments 
in technology infrastructure, including Amazon Web Services, capacity to 
supp
ort our fulfillment operations and investments in corporate office space.
 
I'll conclude my portion of today's call with guidance. Incorporated into our 
guidance are the order trends that we've seen to date, and what we believe 
today to be appropriately con
servative assumptions. Our results are 
inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, 
including a high level of uncertainty surrounding exchange rate fluctuations, 
as well as the global economy and consumer spending. It's not poss
ible to 
accurately predict demand and therefore, our actual results could differ 
materially from our guidance.
 
As we describe in more detail in our public filings, issues such as settling 
inter
-
company balances and foreign currencies amongst our subsidiari
es, 
unfavorable resolution of legal matters and changes to our effective tax 
rates can all have a material effect on guidance.
 
Our guidance further assumes that we don't conclude any additional 
business acquisitions or investments, record any further revis
ions to stock
-
based compensation estimates, and that foreign exchange rates remain 
approximately where they've been recently.
 
For Q3 2011, we expect net sales between $10.3 billion and $11.1 billion or 
growth of between 36% and 47%. This guidance anticipat
es approximately 
450 basis points of favorable impact from foreign exchange. GAAP operating 
income to be between $20 million and $170 million or between 93% decline 
and 37% decline. This includes approximately $180 million for stock
-
based 
compensation and 
amortization of intangible assets. We anticipate 
Consolidated Segment Operating Income, which excludes stock
-
based 
compensation and other operating expense to be between $200 million and 
$350 million or between a 50% decline and a 13% decline.
 
We 
remain heads down focused on driving a better customer experience 
through price, selection, and convenience. We believe putting customers first 
is the only reliable way to create lasting value for shareholders. Thanks. And 
with that, John, let's move to qu
estions.

Great. Thanks, Tom. Let's move on to the Q&A portion of the call. Operator, 
will you please remind our listeners how to initiate a question?

Answer Session
 
Operator
 
[Operator Instructions] And our first question today come
s from Jim 
Friedland with Cowen and Company.
 
James Friedland

Cowen and Company, LLC
 
I wanted to ask a question about how you think about ROI and free cash 
flow, as you invest really aggressively to support this 50% growth. We are 
seeing free cash flow le
vels depressed in the near term. And how long can 
this 
--
 
do you expect this to continue? If you keep grabbing shares, should 
we continue to expect pressure, in terms of free cash flow? Just trying to get 
a sense of how we should think about incremental ca
pital invested.
 
Thomas Szkutak
 
Sure. In terms of how we think about these investments. Our approach has 
been pretty consistent over the years. If you look at the, as you mentioned, 
the strong growth, this is the strongest growth we've had from a quarterly 
perspective year
-
over
-
year and over 10 years. And as a result of that, as we 
look forward, there's a requirement for a lot of capacity and it's something I 
talked about on previous calls. And if you think about our capacity, it comes 
in a number of differe
nt forms. First of all, our core Retail business. We need 
both fulfillment capacity, as well as infrastructure capacity. This is something 
that we've been doing really since our inception and I look at it as a high 
quality problem. We have a 
--
 
if you back
 
out cash and marketable 
securities, you see that we have a high ROIC. I'm not saying that's really a 
historical performance, it's not necessarily a predictive performance, but I do 
feel very good about those investments. Those are something that we've 
don
e before. And it's something that we've been working to perfect really 
since we opened our doors back in the mid
-
90s. In terms of there's another 
set of investments certainly you're seeing we're investing in the conversion 
from physical to digital. We thin
k we have good assets to do that. We're 
very focused on the customer experience. And that comes in a number of 
different forms. We feel very good about those investments in terms of the 
traction that we're getting from a customer standpoint. And we're cert
ainly 
optimistic about our ability to generate good free cash flow while high 
returns on invested capital. Then we have some newer businesses. I say 
newer, they've been with us for several years, but at least they weren't 
since inception like beyond the di
gital initiatives like Web services. That's a 
business that we're investing in. We have great traction. The team has done 
a terrific job there. And we continue to improve that business, and it's 
growing very fast. And that's 
--
 
you're seeing capital requir
ements for that 
business. So that's a business that the team is operating very carefully. 
They're looking at best ways to improve return on invested capital over time, 
and we think that's a great big space to be investing in, and we think it's 
good for tha
t customer set. And it's good for, we hope it to be good for 
customers over the long term.

And then just quickly on the investment in AWS it looks like the tech and 
content line has been accelerating and the q over 
q ramp was pretty 
meaningful again in Q2. Is that 
--
 
is the primary driver there AWS or is it a 
mix of things?
 
Thomas Szkutak
 
It's a mix of things but certainly AWS would be a big piece of that, along 
with our infrastructure to support our Retail business.
 
When I say our Retail 
business, I mean everything but AWS. So again, think of it as the 
infrastructure cost to support those 2 businesses. There certainly are other 
investments we're making that are in that line item, but certainly, those are 
two big piec
es.

[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Spencer Wang with 
Crédit Suisse.
 
Spencer Wang 
-
 
Crédit Suisse AG
 
Tom, just a 2 part question on media and then a housekeeping question. On 
media, the revenue growth there reaccelerated prett
y nicely from the last 
couple of quarters. Is there anything you would call out there, in terms of 
driving that reacceleration? Any sort of specific categories? And then the 
second part, I know it's still relatively early days for Prime Instant Video, but 
I was wondering if you could share with us some of the metrics you see and 
the impact on Prime membership. And then just last on the housekeeping 
question, how much were acquisitions to revenue growth in 2Q and in your 
3Q guidance?
 
Thomas Szkutak
 
Sure. In 
terms of media, it was pretty broad across the board. Certainly, 
you're seeing great growth in our digital products, including Kindle that's 
represented there. The other thing to call out just from a sequential 
standpoint as you look at international speci
fically. We did see 
--
 
and this is 
reflected in the total growth rate for international, as well as the media 
growth rate. We did see an acceleration from Q1 to Q2 for our Japan 
business. We had talked about last time being soft given the events there, 
tha
t our team there has done a terrific job serving customers, so we have 
seen the growth rates return more favorably from first quarter. They're not 
quite where they were last year but certainly they've 
--
 
we've seen an 
acceleration there, so that is also im
pacting our global media growth rates 
and it shows up in our International segment. In terms of Prime Instant 
Video, we're measuring, as you'd expect, a number of different things for 
that business. It's very early right now. There's not a lot I can share 
with 
you. What I can say though is we like what we've seen so far. We're 
continuing to invest there, and right now we're seeing customers love it, and 
it's early. So again, that's something that we'll continue to focus on. And 
then your third question in t
erms of acquisitions impact. For Q2, the most 
recent acquisitions for Quidsi and Lovefilm, that impact year
-
over
-
year for 
those two acquisitions, is a little over 200 basis points, approximately 220 
basis points. We had a small amount in Q1. So if you're l
ooking at it 
sequentially, assume it was about 30 basis points in Q1, and a little over 200 
basis points in Q2. Again those are both year
-
over
-
year numbers impact for 
those acquisitions as Lovefilm was about half a quarter in Q1. In terms of 
bottom
-
line im
pact or CSOI and operating income for Q2, CSOI was about 
negative 19, for GAAP operating income, it was negative 27. That's for Q2. 
In terms of Q3, it's reflected in the guidance that we're giving today, and 
we're not breaking out those specific numbers.
 
O
perator
 
And we'll go next to Mark Mahaney at Citi.
 
Mark Mahaney

Citigroup Inc
 
Tom, I want to ask about how you think through balancing margins and 
growth. I know you don't run the business per [ph] markets for free cash 
flow, but as you brought the margi
ns down and investing aggressively to 
support what's this exhilarating 10
-
year high growth rates, I assume you're 
doing with a view not to just growth rate one quarter out or two quarters 
out, but for a full year out. Do you feel that you've got enough to 
grasp over 
the business such that when you see that growth rate slowing down, which it 
inevitably must, whenever that is in the year, that you can easily ramp
-
up 
margins? Do you really feel like you're at a point in the business model 
where that tradeoff i
s a very easy thing for you to manage?
 
Thomas Szkutak
 
Sure. The way you should think about it is first of all, the growth rates that 
you're seeing in Q2 really stem from investments that we've made over a 
long period of time. These aren't investments that 
we've made over the past 
few quarters. We have invested capacity over the last several quarters to 
help support that growth. And certainly that's one of the investments that's 
more recent. But again you should think about it as investments that we've 
made 
over a long period of time. For example, we've started investing in our 
Kindle business and AWS businesses several years ago now. And those have 
gotten great traction. We launched FBA several years ago. We launched 
Prime a few years back. We continue to la
unch new categories. We continue 
to add unique selections, so those of the things that have happened over an 
extended period of Time. We are also planting new seeds today. You see 
that Prime Instant Video as an example of that. Some of the 
--
 
a lot of the 
offerings that we have within AWS are examples of those. And again we 
have many examples of those across the business. So when we look at 
--
 
it 
was similar to the answer that I gave to Jim in the first question is again 
think about our business in a number
 
of different pieces, but we have our 
Retail business that we've been offering in since inception. We continue to 
add capacity to support those. We continue to add selection and so those are 
the parts of the business that we feel very, very good about and 
the fact 
that we have to deploy more capital in terms of capacity we feel very good 
about. Again, our historical returns aren't predictive but we feel very good 
about it. And then we feel very good about the assets we have in our digital 
space as we conver
t from physical to digital, and then we talked about some 
of the newer investments as well that we feel very good that we're investing 
in today that we certainly hope and plan on getting good returns for 
shareholders. But our goal ultimately is, as you men
tioned not to optimize 
for margins, but our goal is to maximize free cash flow and have high ROICs.
 
Operator
 
Our next question comes from Doug Anmuth with JP Morgan.
 
Douglas Anmuth 
-
 
JP Morgan Chase & Co
 
I just wanted to ask two things. First, Tom it 
looks like you hired 5,300 
people during the quarter. Can you give us some color on how they are 
spread out across the business? And then secondly, as you look at your 
margin outlook here for 3Q. Can you give us some color on the target roll
-
off 
and whethe
r that's contemplated here in the outlook and how much of an 
impact that is?
 
Thomas Szkutak
 
In terms of the people and the quarter, keep in mind that we did acquire 
Quidsi at the start of the quarter, so that's included in the number. And so if 
you take Qu
idsi plus the operations in CS people that we added for the 
capacity that we've been talking about. The combination of those two make 
up the majority of those adds. Now we still had certainly adds across the 
business in a number of different areas. And par
ticularly in some of the 
areas I mentioned, in some of the earlier questions. So again, the majority 
are of those 5,300, as well as actually the year
-
over
-
year increase, which is 
just under 15,000 is due to operations in CS and again, more recently, the 
ac
quisition of Quidsi. As for the margin, again, in terms of target, they've 
announced that they're going to be going to their new website in Q4 and 
we've had a very good relationship with them over the past several years. 
And we certainly wish them well wit
h their new website. We were pleased to 
offer those services for them and again they've announced that they'll be 
switching to a new website in Q4.

Two quick questions please. First on the

can you provide us an update on 
the distributed build out? How many distribution centers you have or you 
had by year
-
end 
--
 
I'm sorry, by quarter end. How many do you think you're 
going to have by year
-
end? I'm
 
trying to figure out, where your capacity 
utilization today versus, say, 6 months ago. And second, can you talk about 
the strategy behind maybe the planned launch of the tablet products? Would 
you be able to looking to leverage in
-
store distribution chann
els for that 
product similar to what you've done with Kindle?
 
Thomas Szkutak
 
In terms of fulfillment centers. Last quarter, when we had our call, we had 
mentioned, or I had mentioned, that we had announced 9 fulfillment centers 
globally at that point. Righ
t now, we've announced 15, and we are actually 
planning on a few more than that between now and the end of the year. So 
again if you look at where we're hiring for, we've announced, it's 15 today. 
And you should expect a few more. That compares to 
--
 
we ad
ded 13 last 
year. So it will be more than 15. 13 last year, it will be more than 15 this 
year...
 
Youssef Squali

Jefferies & Company, Inc.
 
And that's for a total of how many?
 
Thomas Szkutak
 
We haven't given the total for the year, but it's approximately i
n the low 50s 
adding 15 on top of that and then expect a few more. In terms of your other 
question, we have a long
-
standing practice of not talking about what we 
might or might not do. And so I can't help you with that question.

Our next question 
comes from Scott Devitt with Morgan Stanley.
 
Scott Devitt

Morgan Stanley
 
Tom, net shipping costs were up 110 basis points year
-
over
-
year. I just 
wondered if you could talk about the impacts on that from oil prices versus 
Amazon Prime adoption and other c
ustomer experience initiatives that 
you've been working on.
 
Thomas Szkutak
 
If you look at really our net shipping costs over the last several quarters, 
what you've seen is we've been shipping and certainly more free and that 
includes Amazon Prime. We've al
so certainly incurred some higher shipping 
costs as you mentioned with fuel prices, but that's something that we've 
been doing with, really, since we started offering free shipping back in the 
early 2000s. So that's something that we're used to dealing wit
h and 
something that we have dealt with. So again what you're seeing again over 
the last several quarters is certainly the customers like our free shipping 
programs, including some [ph] prime and that's reflected and that number. 
That's also one of the inp
uts along with a lot of the other things that we've 
been talking about that's helping fuel our growth.

I guess first off going back, Tom, to wha
t you mentioned earlier in the call 
and the drivers of accelerating growth. I wonder if you could talk about the 
relative importance of these factors, in particular the low prices. And then 
secondly, just curious in the progress you're making in growing th
e China 
business. I think you've added more fulfillment capacity there, e
-
commerce 
in general appears to be accelerating in that market. If you could talk about 
your position and the relative importance of that.
 
Thomas Szkutak
 
Sure. In terms of lower price
s, it's kind of hard to describe, to answer your 
question actually. We view it as an extremely important aspect of our 
business. It's 
--
 
there's a number of different things that are important to 
customers and certainly are making sure that we have great p
rices for our 
customers and great values for customers is extremely important. It's 
something that we've been working on for a number of years, making sure 
that we know when we have great prices relative to others. And so that's 
something that we've contin
ued to work on to make it a great experience for 
customers and we do that globally across all of our categories. In terms of 
your question on China. We're very pleased with our business in China. It's 
growing very fast. It's 
--
 
we are in investment mode in
 
that country and 
--
 
but we think it's a very interesting long
-
term opportunity and the team's 
doing a very nice job there and we continue to invest, and we're seeing nice 
growth there.

Tom, maybe you could give us an update on affiliates and the sales tax issue 
that's going on. Any updates there? As you cut ties with affiliates and 
[indiscernible] collect sales taxes, how should we be thinking about the 
impact 
on both revenue and margin?
 
Thomas Szkutak
 
I think in terms of the sales tax issue in total, the way you should think 
about it is we support a federal simplified approach as we have more than 
10 years. We think in the U.S., that the federal solution's a gr
eat way to 
solve this. Also keep in mind as you think about our global business, we 
already collect sales tax or equivalent to more than half of our business or 
approximately half of our business across the world, and again we think the 
right solution to t
he U.S. is the federal solution. In terms of beyond that, we 
continue to serve our customers globally and we continue to work through 
the issue that you described.

go next to Jeetil Patel with Deutsche Bank Securities.

Two questions. In general digital content is becoming a growing industry 
theme as well as it seems like for Amazon. I guess curious as to whether 
you can comment on if t
here's a higher propensity for Prime customers to 
adopt digital content or is it broad
-
based among the customer base as a 
whole. And then second, a lot of the investments you're pushing through 
today, in terms of facilities, OpEx, et cetera. Can you talk a
bout maybe what 
year are they typically geared for? How far out do you typically plan for in 
terms of investments today on products, new or existing? How far out do 
you typically think about from a planning standpoint that you're already 
absorbing in the m
odel today?
 
Thomas Szkutak
 
In terms of digital content, it's 
--
 
we certainly have an offering right now. 
You asked the relationship between that and Prime. We certainly have a 
product with Prime is in video [ph] that we like. It's extremely early. We're 
le
arning, customers love it. What they're seeing so far we like what we're 
seeing so far in terms of some of the metrics but again it's very, very early. 
We do think that we are fortunate that we can offer such a service to 
customers, along with free shippin
g. We think that our good customers like 
both. They're both physical and digital customers. And so I'm not sure 
there's much more I can add to that. And then I'm sorry the second part of 
your question?
 
Jeetil Patel 
-
 
Deutsche Bank AG
 
Yes just a lot of the 
expense build and investments that you're making today 
in the form of OpEx and CapEx. I guess, how far out do you typically think 
through some of these plans, in terms of today and what you're assuming in 
the model on kind of 
--
 
on these last couple of qua
rters relative to when you 
start to see kind of the fruits of the labor, some of the product start to 
commercialize in the marketplace?
 
Thomas Szkutak
 
Well we look at our overall investments, certainly not on a long
-
term basis, 
we have 
--
 
when we launch or
 
invest in something new, it's usually a 
number of years before we're cash flow positive. And then in many cases, 
several years before cash flow positive. And so we do take a long
-
term view. 
That being said, we monitor those investments very carefully. So,
 
for 
example, and we do it on a discrete basis, on an area
-
by
-
area basis in terms 
of our investment. For example, in our Web Services business. That team 
has done a very nice job of growing that business innovating on behalf of 
customers and we're also try
ing to see how do we get 
--
 
ensure we get 
higher ROICs on that business. And so they've been working on that for a 
number of years. And so they look at it on a service
-
by
-
service basis. And 
what they're trying to do is become not only great 
--
 
have great s
ervices for 
customers but to be as efficient as possible in terms of from an investment 
standpoint. And so those are 
--
 
that just happens to be an example. That 
happens across the business. And we continue to monitor those 
investments.

Deuts
che Bank AG
 
Can I ask it a different way? But the unit growth you're seeing this year of 
50
-
plus percent. When do you think you put in kind of the investments or 
the plans in the P&L? Would you say it was back in 2008 or 2007, or would 
you say it was more 
recent than that?
 
Thomas Szkutak
 
Yes, yes, and yes. In terms of what enabled us to have the growth rate that 
we're experiencing today, I'll just take the retail part of our business for a 
second. There are many, many aspects of it, let me take just the ret
ail part 
of it. We've continued to add great selection over a long period of time. And 
when I say great selection, unique selection. We've continued to get sharper 
and sharper arm pricing, understanding exactly where we are from a pricing 
standpoint. We've
 
continued to launch new programs that get our product to 
customers quicker. We offered free shipping a number of years ago that 
made it more economical. We offer Prime to make it kind of quicker and 
more economical to get to customers, so it's a great ser
vice for customers. 
So all of these things have built upon themselves. We offer third
-
party 
offerings of [ph] 36% of total units. Several years ago now or a few years 
ago now, we'd launched Fulfilled by Amazon. It was a way to make that 
experience better f
or customers as well as sellers. So these things have built 
upon each other over a period of years. Now what you're seeing is there is a 
concentrated amount of investment that's going in, relative to capacity more 
recently. That really came out of 
--
 
you s
ee different periods of growth that 
we've had where things have gotten softer, that we will absorb that 
investment and it becomes more productive. We saw that happen 
particularly in the U.S. when we had the downturn starting in late 2008. It 
kind of went t
hrough a portion certainly of 2009 even though our global 
growth was still in the high 20s. And that was a little bit softer in the U.S. for 
some of those periods. So we were able to add less fixed investment to 
support the capacity for that part of the bu
siness because of the growth. 
Now what you've seen is coming off of that through 2010, you saw very 
strong growth. We had 40% growth in 2010. You saw very strong growth in 
Q1. We had 36% growth on a local currency basis even with some of the 
softness in Ja
pan. You've seen reacceleration in Q2 growth was 44% 
including a couple of hundred basis points of acquisition growth sequentially. 
So again it's, again these are building upon each other and some of the 
larger investments we've made to support capacity ar
e more recent over the 
past 18 months now and that's continuing as you see from our Q3 guidance 
given the growth we're experiencing. So I'm trying to separate a little bit the 
growth to support the 
--
 
sorry, the capacity to support the growth but then 
we'v
e made many smaller, some not so small investments over the past 10
-
years plus that have brought us to the growth rates on the customer 
experience that we have today.

Corre
ct. So tactical, some of the investments that's required to support from 
a capacity standpoint in the infrastructure, as well as FCs this quarter Retail 
business, for example, I would consider that tactical or running the 
business
-
type adjustment. And thos
e have been sizable. You can see step 
change in our capital and part of it's for that growth for that reason, part of 
it's for growth in FBA and part of it's for growth in Web services as well as a 
few other areas.

Back to the tax question. It's inevitable that 100% of your business will be 
taxed. And let's fast
-
forward to that point. What message would you have 
for 
investors on how to think about the impact that will have on your 
business? And then a follow
-
up to that is there are some rumors that as you 
pull the affiliates out of California, you may actually have some sort of sales 
tax liability. Can you put any of 
those rumors to rest?
 
Thomas Szkutak
 
In terms of where we'll end up I'm certainly not going to speculate where 
we'll end up over a period of time, in terms of sales tax. And again, I'm 
talking the broader issue, not any particular state. The way I think ab
out it I 
talked about our approach in terms of the U.S. of having a federal our 
national solution and I think that's the right approach. But in terms of the 
business itself, one thing to keep in mind is that we do collect, as a 
reminder, sales tax or equiv
alent tax at approximately half of our business 
today. And so when you look at the growth rates that we're experiencing, 
again half or a little over half of our business we're collecting that today. So 
that part of the base that we have 
--
 
in the end, cust
omers really want is 
they want a great experience, they want 
--
 
certainly they want low prices. 
They want the selection that they're looking for. They want fast delivery. 
They want it to be as convenient as possible. That's true among certainly our 
retail 
customers. So we continue to work on that experience. We continue to 
work on trying to make the seller experience even better, FBA, Fulfillment by 
Amazon is another example of that. That happens to also have a customer 
benefit the consumer not just the sel
ler, but again sellers like it as well as 
consumers. We continue to make sure that our experience is good for our 
Web Services business. So we take that, the customers experience 

o
ur digital offerings, Kindle, we have a great team who's innovating on 
behalf of customers across the business including our Kindle business. And 
so they're trying to make sure they continue to innovate. And so all of these 
things that I had mentioned are 
things that we think are important to 
customers and ultimately why customers will purchase from us or not. Those 
are the things that we're going to continue to work on because we can't 
predict what will happen in some of these other things. But we can pred
ict 
that customers will still want low prices, they'll still want great selection, 
they'll still want convenience, they'll still want innovative products and 
services, on every half. So those are the things that we're going to be 
continuing to work on and 
have worked on since our inception.

And then the affiliates is there any sales tax? Are you guys liable for any 
past sales tax in California?
 
Thomas Szkutak
 
I can't 
--
 
I'm not to comment on that.

Our last 
question comes from Justin Post with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.

Two things. Talk about a lot of things, but not AWS. You still think that 
business 
--
 
I guess how's the trajectory? Do you still it still can be as big as 
retail? And any thoughts on what the margin profile of that business looks 
like relative to your core? So just thoughts on AWS in general. And then 
secondly, did you change the historical third
-
party unit forecast? I had a 
couple question on that. It looks
 
like some of the historicals might have been 
higher than what you might have said in a couple prior quarters?
 
Thomas Szkutak
 
I'll answer the second one first. In terms of the unit growth and the third
-
party units, what we did this quarter, which is differ
ent than we have 
previously, we actually went with the paid unit growth as opposed to total 
units. So historically, we've been including 
--
 
there's been some amount of 
free units included in those numbers. And so for example, if you take a look 
at our curr
ent quarter, the number I mentioned was paid unit growth of 
56%. That compared to again that's paid unit growth, that compared to 45% 
paid unit growth in Q1. The number that we reported in Q1 was actually 
51% because that included free. So the comparable 
-
-
 
the 45% for Q1 and 
the 56% for Q2 are comparable. Again, those are just paid units. And then 
the third
-
party percentage of total units was 36% this quarter, up from 34% 
last year. And again those are paid units for the percentage of total units. 
And so w
e thought it would be an interesting, another interesting way of 
looking at it so we thought we'd provide it this quarter. In terms of the AWS 
business, it's certainly a very, very big space. Hard to say how big it will be 
for Amazon, but we're incredibly 
excited about that business. The team's 
done a terrific job and continue to innovate on behalf of customers. And we 
have just a great team of innovators and operators running that business, 
and we're very excited about it.

BofA Merrill Lynch
 
Can you say whether it's in investment mode or is it contributing at all to the 
bottom line at this point?
 
Thomas Szkutak
 
You should expect that we continue to invest in that business because of the 
high
-
growth nature of it. It's growing very fast. It is o
ne of the reasons why 
you're seeing certainly a big contributor to our CapEx. It's also reflected in 
the tech and content line. And so again we're very excited about what we're 
seeing there. And the team is going to continue to stay heads down focused 
on t
heir customer to drive that business.
 
John Felton
 
Great. Well thank you for joining us on the call today and for your questions. 
A replay will be available on our Investor website at least through the end of 
the quarter. We appreciate your interest in Amaz
on.com, and look forward 
to talking with you again next quarter.

Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Amazon.com Third Quarter 2011 
Financial Results Teleconference. [Operator Instructions] Today's call is 
being recorded. For opening remarks, I would like to turn the call over to the 
Director of 
Investor Relations, Mr. John Felton. Please go ahead, sir.
 
John Felton
 
Hello, and welcome to our Q3 2011 Financial Results Conference Call. Joining 
us today is Tom Szkutak, our CFO. We will be available for questions after 
our prepared remarks.
 
The followi
ng discussion and responses to your questions reflect 
management's views, as of today, October 25, 2011, only and will include 
forward
-
looking statements. Actual results may differ materially.
 
Additional information about factors that could potentially imp
act our 
financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the 
SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10
-
K.
 
As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press 
release in front of you, which i
ncludes our financial results, as well as 
metrics and commentary on the quarter.
 
During this call, we will discuss certain non
-
GAAP financial measures. In our 
press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the 
SEC, each of which is po
sted on our IR website, you will find additional 
disclosures regarding these non
-
GAAP measures, including reconciliations of 
these measures with comparable GAAP measures.
 
Finally, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against 
our re
sults for the comparable period of 2010.
 
Now, I will turn the call over to Tom.
 
Thomas J. Szkutak
 
Thanks, John. I'll begin with comments in our third quarter financial results. 
Trailing 12
-
month operating cash flow increased 19% to $3.11 billion. 
Trailing 
12
-
month free cash flow decreased 17% to $1.53 billion. Return on 
invested capital is 17%, down from 28%.
 
Return on invested capital is TTM free cash flow divided by average total 
assets minus current liabilities, excluding the current portion of long
-
term
 
debt over 5 quarter end. The combination of common stock and stock
-
based 
awards outstanding was 469 million shares compared with 465 million 
shares.
 
Worldwide revenue grew 44% to $10.88 billion or 39%, excluding the $371 
million favorable impact from year
-
over
-
year changes in foreign exchange. 
We are grateful to our customers who continue to take advantage for our 
low prices, vast selection and shipping offers.
 
Media revenue increased to $4.15 billion, up 24% or 19%, excluding foreign 
exchange. EGM revenue
 
increased to $6.32 billion, up 59% or 54%, 
excluding foreign exchange. Worldwide EGM increased to 58% of worldwide 
sales, up from 53%.
 
Worldwide paid unit growth was 53%. Active customer accounts exceeded 
152 million. Worldwide active sellers were more th
an 2 million.
 
Now I'll discuss operating expenses, excluding stock
-
based compensation. 
Cost of sales was $8.32 billion or 76.5% of revenue consistent with the 
prior
-
year period. Fulfillment, marketing, technology and content and G&A 
combined was $2.29 bill
ion or 21.1% of sales, up approximately 290 basis 
points year
-
over
-
year.
 
Fulfillment was $1.09 billion or 10% of revenue compared with 8.7%. Tech 
and content was $694 million or 6.4% of revenue compared with 5.1%. 
Marketing was $360 million or 3.3% of reve
nue compared with 3.1%.
 
Now I'll talk about our segment results, and consistent with prior periods, we 
do not allocate segments or stock
-
based type of compensation or other 
operating expense line item. In the North American segment, revenue grew 
44% to $5.
93 billion. Media revenue grew 21% to $1.93 billion. EGM 
revenue grew 56% to $3.64 billion, representing 51% of North American 
revenues, up from 56%.
 
North America segment operating income decreased 23% to $144 million, a 
2.4% operating margin.
 
In the Inte
rnational segment, revenue grew 44% to $4.94 billion, adjusting 
for the $367 million year
-
over
-
year favorable foreign exchange impact, 
revenue growth was 33%.
 
Media revenue grew 27% to $2.23 billion or 17% excluding foreign 
exchange and EGM revenue grew 63
% to $2.68 million or 51%, excluding 
foreign exchange. EGM now represents 54% of international revenues up 
from 48%.
 
International segment operating income decreased 46% to $116 million, a 
2.4% operating margin. Excluding the favorable impact of foreign ex
change, 
International segment operating income decreased 55%.
 
Consolidated segment operating income decreased 35% to $260 million or 
2.4% of revenue down approximately 290 basis points year
-
over
-
year. 
Excluding the $14 million favorable impact from foreign
 
exchange, CSOI 
decreased 38%. Unlike CSOI, our GAAP operating income include stock
-
based compensation expense and other operating expense. GAAP operating 
income decreased 71% to $79 million or 0.7% of net sales.
 
Our income tax expense was $67 million in Q
3, resulting in a 52% rate for 
the quarter and a 31% rate year
-
to
-
date. GAAP net income was $63 million 
or $0.14 per diluted share compared with $231 million and $0.51 per diluted 
share.
 
Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and marketable securities increase
d 
$441 million year
-
over
-
year to $6.33 billion. Inventory increased 50% to 
$3.77 billion and inventory turns were 10.8, down from 11.8 turns a year 
ago, as we expanded selection, improved in
-
stock levels and introduced new 
product categories.
 
Accounts paya
ble increased 42% to $6.55 billion and accounts payable days 
decreased to 72 from 73 in the prior year. Our Q3 2011 capital expenditures 
were $529 million. The increase in capital expenditures reflects additional 
investments in support of continued busines
s growth, including investments 
in technology infrastructure, including Amazon Web services and capacity to 
support our fulfillment operations.
 
I'll conclude my portion of today's call with guidance. Incorporated into the 
guidance are the trends that we've
 
seen to date, and what we believed 
today to be appropriately conservative assumptions. Our results are 
inherently unpredictable and maybe materially affected by many factors, 
including a high level of uncertainty surrounding exchange rate fluctuations, 
as
 
well as the global economy and consumer spending. It's not possible to 
accurately predict demand. And therefore, our actual results could differ 
materially from our guidance.
 
As we describe in more detail in our public filings, issues such as settling 
inter
-
company balances in foreign currencies amongst our subsidiaries, 
unfavorable resolution of legal matters in changes to our effective tax rates 
can all have a material effect
 
on guidance. Our guidance further assumes 
that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions or investments, 
record any further revisions to stock
-
based compensation estimates, and 
that foreign exchange rates remain approximately where they've be
en 
recently.
 
For Q4 2011, we expect net sales between $16.45 billion and $18.65 billion 
or growth between 27% and 44%. This guidance anticipates approximately 
130 basis points of favorable impact from foreign exchange.
 
GAAP operating income or loss to be b
etween $200 million loss and $250 
million of income are between a 142% decline and 47% decline. This 
includes approximately $200 million for stock
-
based compensation and 
amortization of intangible assets. We anticipate consolidated segment 
operating income
, which excludes stock
-
based compensation and other 
operating expense, to be between $0 and $450 million or between 100% 
decline and 28% decline.
 
We remain heads down focused on driving a better customer experience 
through price selection and convenience.

I wonder if you would talk a little bit mor
e about the revenue guide for the 
fourth quarter? And just some basic factual things, are you including 
contributions from the Kindle Fire shipments? And do you fully recognize all 
of that or is there some ratable recognition? And is there any particular 
r
eason, in addition to that, that you're guiding for a deceleration? Are you 
seeing signs of softening consumer demand in European markets, for 
example?
 
Thomas J. Szkutak
 
Sure. In terms of the guidance for revenue for Q4, as we've done in previous 
years, we
've given a wide range of guidance in Q4 just because of the 
seasonality and it's difficult to predict. But we feel very good about the 
demand that we've seen to date. And certainly, at the high end of the 
guidance, you can see there's an acceleration that
's possible that's reflected 
in that guidance. But we are given a wide range consistent with what we've 
done in prior Q4s. In terms of the overall growth that we've seen so far, to 
date, you saw a very strong growth in Q3, up 39% on a local currency basis.
 
That's consistent with what we've seen over the past 12 months where we're 
up 39%, also over the trailing 12 months. And we really saw a step change 
2 years ago where last [indiscernible] year
-
over
-
year so far last 12 months 
up 39%. So again, we feel very
 
good about the growth that we are 
experiencing, and I've seen data reflected in the guidance given a wide 
range. In terms of Kindle Fire in our guidance and certainly the largest 
portion of that would be reflected in our revenue.

Tom, could you please speak to what's pressuring margins in Q3 and 
particularly Q4. I guess the implied margin for Q4 is effectively 0 at the 
midpoin
t. It, again, answer the question, what's the financial model going 
forward? Is it to try to maximize growth on the top line even at 0 growth 
--
 
0 margin?
 
Thomas J. Szkutak
 
What you're seeing, and again, it relates back to the growth, we're seeing 
really u
nprecedented growth. We're seeing the best growth which we've 
seen since 2000, meaning in 2010 and so far over the past 12 months 
ending September. And so with this strong growth, we're investing in a lot of 
capacity and that's what we've been talking abou
t over the past couple of 
quarters and that's what you're seeing in our Q3 results specifically. If you 
take a look at our operating expenses in Q3, as a percentage of revenue, 
you see 
--
 
and if you compare that to Q2, as a percentage of revenue, 
you're se
eing very similar trends for marketing and G&A. You're seeing a 
slight uptick in tech content. It's about 10 basis points and then you're 
seeing fulfillment up approximately 80 basis points. The reason why that's 
growing so much, as a percentage of revenue
, is again the capacity that 
we've been talking about. Many days ago, I've mentioned that we were 
--
 
we had announced 15 new fulfillment centers this year that's on a basis of 
52 from last year. And then we'd likely open one or two more. We are 
actually go
ing to be opening 17 new fulfillment centers. And so you're seeing 
that impacting our fulfillment expense in Q3, as well as the bottom line in 
Q3. So that's what's impacting this in Q3. We are also investing in a number 
of different areas. We're investing 
to support retail growth fulfilled by 
Amazon growth, fast
-
growing AWS business, as well as infrastructure to 
support our retail business. We're investing in our Kindle and Digital 
business. I mean you're seeing that reflected in our Q4 guidance as well, al
l 
of these things. And so if you take a look at our Kindle business, for 
example, we've launched 4 new products at the end of September, and 
we're very, very excited about those products. They're at great prices, and 
they are certainly premium products. An
d so we're very excited about those. 
And we think about the economics of the Kindle business, we think about the 
totality. We think of the lifetime value of those devices. So we're not just 
thinking about the economics of the device and the accessories. We
're 
thinking about the content. We are selling quite a bit of Special Offers 
devices which includes ads. We're thinking about the advertisement and 
those Special Offers and those lifetime values. So those are the things 
certainly that are impacting, as wel
l as investments in other areas impacting 
our Q4 guidance. But we feel very good about where we are right now and 
the opportunities that we have in front of us.

We'll take our next question from Scott Devitt with Morgan Stanley.

Morgan Stanley, Research Division
 
Tom, just a bigger picture question on the Retail business. I was wondering 
how you're thinking about individual markets in cases where specific 
markets are highly competitive and markets where you maybe position 
potential
ly as the #2. Do you, long
-
term in markets such as that do you 
believe that the business should be positioned as #1 and that the scale 
advantage has deteriorated if you're not a #1. Just wondering given some of 
the emerging markets and the competitive land
scape that's occurring, 
particularly in Asia. How you think about that?
 
Thomas J. Szkutak
 
Sure. We're 
--
 
maybe to step back from it a bit. Whenever we enter a new 
geography or even a new category, we're trying to make sure that it's 
something that we can, 
we think we can add value to. And so, for example, 
we like categories that have a lot of different SKUs that are complicated in a 
physical retail environment. We like categories where there is, we think that 
we can add a lot of value from a service perspec
tive. And so in each of the 
categories that we operate in, we're always trying to make sure that we can 
--
 
we think we can get great returns on invested capital over a period of 
time. And so I'm not directly answering your question, but we certainly look 
a
t it on a category
-
by
-
category basis. We look at it where we can add value. 
And if you look back over of our history, you can see where we've entered 
new categories, new geographies. We've always started with the customer 
first. We've added selection usual
ly first from a retail standpoint. Sometimes 
with third parties it starts, sometimes not. But we've added third parties as 
we've gone if we haven't done it what we started. And so this is 
--
 
we think 
this model has worked very well for us. And again, we're
 
looking always at 
ways that we can add value for customers and shareholders over time.

I wanted to ask about 
--
 
you with 
Netflix launching. We're announcing that 
they're launching in the U.K. and Ireland with streaming. You guys bought 
Lovefilm earlier in the year and it doesn't seem like you've changed the 
streaming side of the business that much. Are there any plans to ram
p up 
the investment and content outside the U.S., outside of what you're doing 
with Prime streaming? And then on Quidsi, we've seen a lot of new 
announcements in terms of new brands and also new categories. Is that 
having a material impact on some of the l
ower operating profiters. Quidsi is 
just not big enough as a percentage of total to matter?
 
Thomas J. Szkutak
 
In terms of Lovefilm, actually we have been investing in content since 
acquisition. So that's something we have been doing and we continue to 
inve
st there and you'd expect 
--
 
you should expect us to continue to invest 
in Lovefilm. We think it's a graded opportunity. The business is doing very 
well. We're very pleased with how the team is working and we're very 
excited about that opportunity. So that
's something we have been doing 
since acquisition. And you should expect that to continue. In terms of Quidsi, 
yes, they are continuing to expand, doing a very nice job. That is not 
--
 
it 
certainly reflected in the guidance that we're giving for Q4. I woul
dn't 
consider that a material impact.

Just two quick questions. First on U.S. EGM, there was a bit more 
deceleratio
n there than prior quarters. I know that comp was more 
challenging, but can you give us a little color on what's going on with the 
deceleration in domestic EGM? And then a question on mobile, our smart 
phone and tablet users that are buying physical goods 
on the Amazon 
mobile app, how does their purchase behavior differ from the same users 
who are buying stuff on PC? Are they buying more physical goods or less, 
not ebooks or digital goods, but just specifically physical goods?
 
Thomas J. Szkutak
 
Sure. In ter
ms of the first part of your question, we are very pleased with 
the growth rate we saw in North America EGM. It was up 56% year
-
over
-
year. And you do have it right. It is a bit of a tough compare if you look back 
to last year. We did grow 80%. It was certa
inly high watermark for us and 
we're overlapping that. We had very, very strong growth last year Q3. But 
again, still very pleased with what we see in Q3 of this year in EGM 
specifically and our overall growth rates, too. In terms of mobile, we actually 
ha
ven't released a lot of details and that's not much I can help you with 
there. But certainly, we are seeing good trends in our mobile business. And 
again, we like what we're seeing there, but there's not much I can help you

A couple of questions. First of all, I guess on lifetime value, if you look at the 
Kindle kind of customer versus the core retail cus
tomer, can you talk about 
whether lifetime value is comparable or higher, relative to that core 
business? If you can isolate it that way? And second, as you look at the 
third
-
party business, are you seeing an accelerated mixed shift towards 
third
-
party bro
adly? And is there anything 
--
 
any particular markets or kind 
of international that seems to be seeing a bigger pickup in the third
-
party 
side of the business?
 
Thomas J. Szkutak
 
To answer your first 
--
 
the first part of your question, we're not breaking ou
t 
Kindle customer versus non
-
Kindle customer, but I can talk a little bit about 
some of the dynamics related specifically to the Kindle customer. We have 
learned a lot over the past couple of years about 
--
 
since launching Kindle. 
Once a customer's purchas
ed a device, obviously, what else do they buy. 
And what they launch more recently of special offers and ad
-
based Kindles. 
We certainly have some data and we're still learning, but have some data 
that we didn't have prior to launch. And so what we're seeing
 
certainly is 
that once customers purchase a Kindle and are carrying around this really 
massive selection at their fingertips, they're buying more content. We've 
talked a lot about that on previous calls. But again as we think about the 
lifetime value, we 
thinking very specifically about the device itself. How to 
make sure that we get just the absolute device in customers 
--
 
the absolute 
best device in customers hands and have the absolute best content on those 
devices. And we look at the total economics wh
ich include the device, the 
accessories, the content, as well as any ad
-
based revenue and Special 
Offers. So those are the things that we're looking at, as we think about the 
lifetime value of the device. And we like what we see. And so certainly as 
you th
ink about Q4 and you think about the guidance that we're giving, 
certainly we're going to have a 
--
 
we expect to have a record quarter in 
terms of device sales. And because of the back
-
end loading of it, you should 
assume that the content would, obviously,
 
trail that device sale. The ad 
revenue would trail those device sales as well as the Special Offers. So those 
are the things you should think about as you think about our Kindle 
business. But we're extremely excited about it both our electronic ink and 
fi
re devices and couldn't be more pleased to offer those for customers and 
we think that those will be great for share owners over time. In terms of 
third
-
party, we think the business is going very well, in terms of the 
numbers. Our third
-
party units, as a p
ercentage of total units, these are paid 
units, as a percentage of total units is 38% this quarter, up from 35% last 
year. So we're very pleased also on top have very strong overall unit 
growth, so we're very pleased with what we're seeing there. And this 
is a 
trend that's been 
--
 
you've seen for a number of years now, where we're 
getting both great retail growth, as well as third
-
party growth. And certainly 
fulfilled by Amazon and other things that are helping drive that growth rate.

So I guess one question and a couple of parts related to digital content. Tom 
I was wondering if you could just perhaps give us a sense of how m
uch of 
the increase in operating costs in the fourth quarter do you think will be 
driven by digital content rights? Should we expect that to continue to drag 
on into 2012? And then just to clarify, how are you accounting for the 
streaming content rights? I
s that under FAS 63?
 
Thomas J. Szkutak
 
In terms of content, we will be certainly purchasing content for both our U.S. 
business which includes a paid piece and a Prime instant video which will be 
an unpaid piece free as long as you're a Prime member. And so
 
those 
--
 
so 
the content is included in our Q4. In addition to that, we also have content 
costs as we have with Lovefilm in Europe, so those are included in our 
guidance. We are not splitting out the specific dollar amount related to that 
in our guidance f
or Q4. But it's certainly impacting our guidance, along with, 
certainly investing in our Kindle business and some of the other investments 
that I talked about. So those are the things that are impacting us, and we're 
excited to 
--
 
for those opportunities.

So my understanding is that Google will be the default search engine for the 
Kindle Fire. But will the Silk browser have any type of interface or s
earch bar 
that links directly to either physical product or media directly from Amazon? 
And then just separately, on the video distribution, you're still not on the 
game consoles. Any update on why and would you consider deploying any 
device like a Roku bo
x or anything else directly to prime customers so that 
they can get video content to a [indiscernible]?
 
Thomas J. Szkutak
 
It'll be very easy on Fire to access all of our digital content at first. So it's 
very integrated device. It's something that we've be
en working on. It's 
coming together over long period of time, in terms of being able to offer just 
a vast amount of paid and free content. In the case of video, we'll certainly 
have book content, music content. So it will be a very 
--
 
our App Store as 
well
. So it will be very easy and very integrated being able to access all of 
our digital content. It'll also be easy to access physical product as well. So 
those are things that we're very excited about, and customers will be able to 
see when they receive the
ir Fire. And so we think it's an incredible product. 
We're very excited about it. It's certainly a premium product. And at $1.99, 
it's certainly not a premium price. We're very happy to offer that to 
customers. In terms of other things we might do, I don't
 
have anything to 
speak of there.

Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research

Two quick questions. First, I guess on the Target cost drop, I think Target 
drop 
--
 
is dropping basically in August. So wondering what the impact of that 
is from a onetime cost standpoint in the third and fourth quarters. And then 
the second quick question
 
is on the distribution center ramp, the 17 new 
distribution centers that you're adding, how long would it take for those 
distribution centers to operate at normalized levels similar to your 52 other 
distribution centers?
 
Thomas J. Szkutak
 
In terms of Targ
et, we're not breaking out any specific partner relationship. 
But certainly, in terms of you have the timing right, in terms of that did 
happen during Q3. We're very fortunate to be able to partner with Target 
over a number of years and so we're very happy
 
to have done that, and so 
that relationship ended from a partnering of their website in Q3. And any 
associated impact has been reflected in our actual results for Q3 and our 
guidance for Q4. And then in terms of the FCs, the way you should think 
about it 
is think about just the sheer ramp up of going from 52 to 69 FCs in 
a year. It's happening very fast. We have a fantastic team around the world 
who has been working very hard, making sure that we're up and running, 
and we have all of our associates train. 
That being said, as you can imagine, 
we're having people come in well before starting fulfillment for training. We 
are signing leases and getting product available for shipment well before 
doing so. And so, consequently, just as a result of having a ramp u
p where 
they'll be no output for some period of time even though we'll have people in 
building someplace and moving, receiving product in as productive 
downtime. And then there's a timeframe where it takes to ramp up during 
--
 
from a distribution standpoin
t. And so all these things will take time. It's 
something that we have been doing since the start of Amazon. It's 
something that I think we understand very well, and it takes a period of time 
depending upon the FC and how automated it is or non automated i
t is. So 
those 
--
 
all of those factors, we certainly understand well and we'll certainly 
feel very good about deploying those assets and get great returns on 
invested capital on those assets over time.

Just two quick questions. Would you provide any color on current traction

there any chance that we could see the video

perhaps with a standalone fee? I know it's kind of a forward look but it's just 
how

can we think about

how can we think about that?
 
Thomas J. Szkutak
 
We're happy with the traction we're getting, both the Cloud Player and
 
Prime 
video 
--
 
both from very early. In terms of Prime video, customers absolutely 
love it. It's free video. We're adding a lot of content there. We have a lot of 
customers who are requesting free trials, and then the converting base on 
those free trials.
 
This is the Prime trials. And so it's very early. And it's 
something that we'll be adding to, certainly, over the course of the next 12 
months and we feel very good about that. But we're also monitoring it very 
carefully, and we're watching all of the cus

Two things. First, Tom, we've seen in the past sometimes when companies 
make changes to the site, in terms of the UI that it can take customers a 
little time to get adjusted to those. Can you comment on what you're seeing 
in the early impact on 
your site and how that plays into the 4Q? If it does at 
all? And then secondly, can you comment on whether you're paying any 
royalties around the Kindle Fire?
 
Thomas J. Szkutak
 
In terms of the UI, there's not a lot I can say there. It's certainly that's 
pr
obably the most recent data would be to look at our Q3 results. We didn't 
have the new UI at 100% for the full quarter. But again, we saw a very 
strong growth rate in Q3. As I've mentioned earlier, up 39%, so we feel very 
good about it and it's certainly r
eflected in our actual results in our guidance 
as I've mentioned earlier. If you think about Q4, we think we'll have 
certainly, we've added a lot of selections over the past 12 months, a lot of 
great unique selection, so we think we are well positioned for
 
Q4 from a 
selection standpoint. We continue to make sure that our prices are sharp, so 
we have great value to customers. We continue to work on improving 
service levels that comes in a number of different forms, but certainly 
getting goods to customers fa
st is important and certainly Prime is playing a 
key role on that and we have certainly a lot more Prime members this year 
than we have previously. So all of those things we have 4 new Kindle 
products at just great prices for customers. So all those attrib
utes set up Q4 
for a nice growth quarter. Although as we have another Q4 because again 
our 
--
 
but again, we feel very, very good about the growth that we're seeing 
over the past quarter and our prospects for the holiday season. And that's 
reflected in the 
guidance that we're giving. And in terms of specifics on 
royalties and everything, we certainly wouldn't talk to that.

Jus
t one follow
-
up on the fulfillment centers, Tom. I think you mentioned 
before that you might need to increase beyond the 15 new centers if 
revenue growth were faster than originally expected. If you could confirm 
that, that was the thought process here as 
well looking into Q4? And then 
just on the Kindle Fire and EE devices based on your comments on sales 
trends thus far, is there any potential supply constraints that you foresee for 
the holiday period?
 
Thomas J. Szkutak
 
In terms of the first part, in terms
 
of fulfillment centers, yes. As I mentioned 
90 days ago, we've given a range of guidance for the top line for Q3. We 
hadn't given guidance for Q4. We were very excited about the growth that 
we were seeing through the first half of the year, but we wanted 
to get 
through Q3. And again, I'd announced or had mentioned that 90 days ago 
that we had announced that we were opening 15 and potentially 1 or 2 
more. And that reality is coming true. We are actually opening up 17. And so 
--
 
and again, that illustrates w
e feel about 
--
 
how we feel about, not the 
growth that's happened in the past. But certainly impacting how we're 
thinking about it, but it impacts the fulfillment we're adding is about growth 
going forward. And so we feel very good about the growth they're
 
experiencing and we're looking at a number of different factors, including 
our most recent historical growth rates. In terms of supply, you probably 
saw the release. But again, in the first 3 weeks since launch, orders for our 
EE Kindles are double the pr
evious launch. We're also seeing extremely 
strong Kindle Fire pre
-
orders and we're increasing capacity in building 
millions more than already planned. And so that's what we're doing from a 
production standpoint, and we're getting ready as you'd expect for 
just a 
great holiday season for customers overall and for Kindle customers.

First, your employee count is up about 19% sequentially ver
sus a move of 
about 10% over the last few years. So I'm wondering, is this quarter and 
next quarter when you hire a lot of temporary workers sort of the apex of 
the pain that you'll feel on all these new FCs or do you think that employee 
growth could actua
lly accelerate in the first half of next year? And then 
secondly, your shipping costs were also up pretty significantly, how much of 
that is Prime usage versus Prime customer acquisition cost?
 
Thomas J. Szkutak
 
In terms of employment, we're not 
guiding or giving estimates beyond the 
quarter. But you're right, we're seeing a large sequential increase in 
employment and a large year
-
over
-
year increase in employment, and it's 
across many different areas that we're adding. But certainly the most 
notab
le, both from a year
-
over
-
year and sequential and certainly represents 
the majority of the additions would be our operations and customer service 
associates. And so those are certainly growing fast, and we're also 
--
 
given 
the opportunity that we have to g
row. We're also investing in other areas. 
But again, the majority of the sequential and year
-
over
-
year increase is 
coming from operations and customer service associates. In terms of the 
shift margin as you're mentioning, certainly, Prime is certainly havi

Good day, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the Amazon.com Q4 2013 
Financial Results Teleconference. At this time, all participants are in a listen
-
only mode. After the presentation, we will conduct a question
-
and
-
answer 
session. Today's 
conference is also being recorded.
 
Now for opening remarks, I will be turning the call over to the Senior 
Manager of Investor Relations, Dave Fildes. Please go ahead, sir.
 
Dave Fildes
 
Hello and welcome to our Q4 2013 financial results conference call. Join
ing 
us today is Tom Szkutak, our CFO. We will be available for questions after 
our prepared remarks. The following discussion and responses to your 
questions reflect management's views as of today, January 30, 2014 only 
and will include forward
-
looking sta
tements.
 
Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that 
could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press 
release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent Annual 
Report on Form 10
-
K.
 
As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press 
release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as our 
metrics and commentary on the quarter.
 
During this call, we will discuss certain non
-
GAAP financial m
easures. In our 
press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the 
SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional 
disclosures regarding these non
-
GAAP measures, including reconciliations of 
these measures wit
h comparable GAAP measures.
 
Finally, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against 
our results for the comparable period of 2012.
 
Now, I will turn the call over to Tom.
 
Tom Szkutak
 
Thanks, Dave. I will begin with comments on our fou
rth quarter financial 
results. Trailing 12
-
month operating cash flow increased 31% to $5.47 
billion. Trailing 12
-
month free cash flow increased to $2.03 billion. Trailing 
12
-
month capital expenditures were $3.44 billion.
 
The increase in capital expenditure
s reflects additional investments in 
support of continued business growth consisting of additional capacities to 
support fulfillment operations and investments in technology infrastructure, 
including Amazon Web Services.
 
Return on invested capital was 13%,
 
up from 4%. ROIC is TTM free cash 
flow divided by average total assets minus current liabilities, excluding the 
current portion of long
-
term debt over five quarter ends. The combination of 
common stock and stock
-
based awards outstanding was 476 million sh
ares 
compared with 470 million shares one year ago.
 
Worldwide revenue grew 20% to $25.59 billion or 22% excluding the $258 
million unfavorable impact from year
-
over
-
year changes in foreign 
exchange.
 
Media revenue increased to $7.23 billion, up 11% or 13% e
xcluding foreign 
exchange. EGM revenue increased to $17.13 billion, up 23% or 24% 
excluding foreign exchange. Worldwide EGM increased to 67% of worldwide 
sales, up from 65%. Worldwide paid unit growth was 25%. Active customer 
accounts exceeded 237 million.
 
Worldwide active seller accounts were more 
than 2 million. Seller units represented 39% of paid units.
 
Now I will discuss operating expenses excluding stock
-
based compensation. 
Cost of sales was $18.81 billion or 73.5% of revenue compared with 75.9%. 
Fulf
illment, marketing, technology and content and G&A combined were $5.9 
billion or 23.1% of sales up approximately 210 basis points year
-
over
-
year. 
Fulfillment was $2.84 billion or 11.1% of revenue, compared with 10.3%. 
Tech and content was $1.69 billion or 
6.6% of revenue, compared with 
5.7%. Marketing was $1.11 billion or 4.3% of revenue compared with 3.9%.
 
Now I will talk about our segment results and consistent with prior periods, 
we do not allocate to segments or stock
-
based compensation or other 
operati
ng expense line item. In the North America segment, revenue grew 
26% to $15.33 billion. Media revenue grew 21% to $3.51 billion. EGM 
revenue grew 25% to $10.65 billion, representing 69% of North America 
revenues down from 70%. Other revenue grew 52% to $1.
17 billion. North 
America segment operating income increased 19% to $725 million, a 4.7% 
operating margin.
 
In the International segment, revenue grew 13% to $10.26 billion. Adjusting 
for the $244 million year
-
over
-
year unfavorable foreign exchange impact, 
revenue growth was 15%. Media revenue grew 3% to $3.71 billion, or 6% 
excluding foreign exchange and EGM revenues grew 19% to $6.48 billion or 
21% excluding foreign exchange. EGM now represents 63% of International 
revenues, up from 60%. International segm
ent operating income increased 
to 116% to $151 million, a 1.5% operating margin. Excluding the 
unfavorable impact from foreign exchange, International segment operating 
income increased to 119%.
 
CSOI increased 29% to $876 million, or 3.4% of revenue, up ap
proximately 
20 basis points year
-
over
-
year. Excluding the unfavorable impact from 
foreign exchange, CSOI increased 28%.
 
Unlike CSOI, our GAAP operating income includes stock
-
based compensation 
expense and other operating expense. GAAP operating income incr
eased 
26% to $510 million or 2% of net sales. Our income tax expense was $179 
million, resulting in a 40% tax rate for the quarter and 32% rate for the full
-
year 2013. GAAP net income was $239 million or $0.51 per diluted share, 
compared with $97 million a
nd $0.21 per diluted share.
 
Now, I will discuss our full
-
year results. Revenue grew 22% to $74.45 billion 
or 24% excluding the impacts of foreign exchange. North America revenue 
grew 28% to $44.52 billion and International revenue grew 14% to $29.94 
billio
n or 19% growth excluding year
-
over
-
year changes in foreign 
exchange. Consolidated segment operating income or CSOI increased 20% 
to $1.99 billion or 21% excluding the unfavorable year
-
over
-
year impact 
from foreign exchange and operating margin was 2.7%, c
onsistent with the 
prior year. GAAP operating income increased 10% to $745 million or 1% of 
net sales.
 
Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and marketable securities increased $1 
billion year
-
over
-
year to $12.45 billion. Inventory increased 23% to $7.41 
bill
ion and inventory turns were 8.9, down from 9.3 turns a year ago as we 
expanded selection, improved in
-
stock levels and introduced new product 
categories. Accounts payable increased 14% to $15.13 billion and accounts 
payable days decreased to 74 from 76 fr
om the prior year.
 
I will conclude my portion of today's call with guidance. Incorporated into 
our guidance are the order trends that we have seen to
-
date and what we 
believe today to be appropriately conservative assumptions. Our results are 
inherently un
predictable and maybe materially affected by many factors, 
including a high level of uncertainty surrounding exchange rate fluctuations 
as well as the global economy and consumer spending. It's not possible to 
accurately predict demand and therefore our ac
tual results could differ 
materially from our guidance.
 
As we described in more detail in our public filings, issues such as settling 
intercompany balances and foreign currencies amongst our subsidiaries, 
unfavorable resolution of legal matters and changes
 
to our effective tax 
rates can all have a material effect on guidance.
 
Our guidance further assumes that we don't conclude any additional 
business acquisitions, investments, restructurings or legal settlements, 
record any further revisions to stock
-
based 
compensation estimates and that 
foreign exchange rates remain approximately where they have been 
recently.
 
For Q1 2014, we expect net sales of between $18.2 billion and $19.9 billion 
or growth of between 13% and 24%. This guidance anticipates 
approximately
 
30 basis points of unfavorable impact from foreign exchange 
rates.
 
GAAP operating income, or loss to be between a $200 million loss and $200 
million in income, compared with $181 million in income in the first quarter 
of 2013. This includes approximately 
$350 million for stock
-
based 
compensation and amortization of intangible assets.
 
We anticipate consolidated segment operating income, which excludes stock
-
based compensation and other operating expense to be between a $150 
million and $550 million, 
compared with $441 million in the first quarter of 
2013.
 
We launched Prime in the U.S. nine years ago with free, unlimited two
-
day 
shipping on 1 million items in an annual membership priced at $79. Today 
Prime Selection has grown to over [19] [ph] million 
items.
 
Even as fuel and transportation cost have increased, the $79 price has 
remained the same. We know that customers love Prime as the usage of the 
shipping benefit has increased dramatically since launch. On a per customer 
basis, Prime members are orde
ring more items across more categories with 
free two
-
day shipping than ever before.
 
With the increased cost of fuel and transportation as well as the increased 

between $20 to $40 in 
the U.S.
 
We remain heads down focused on driving a better customer experience 
through price, selection and convenience. We believe putting customers first 
is the only reliable way to create lasting value for shareholders.
 
Thanks. With that, Dave, let's mov
e to question.
 
Dave Fildes
 
Great. Thanks, Tom. Let's move onto the Q&A portion of the call. Operator, 
will you please remind our listeners how to initiate a question?
 
Question
-
and
-
Answer Session
 
Operator
 
Absolutely, Mr. Fildes. Well, ladies and gentlemen a
t this time, we will now 
open the call up for question. In the interest of time, we ask that you limit 
yourself to one question. (Operator Instructions) Our first question will come 
from Mark May with Citi.
 
Mark May 
-
 
Citi
 
Thanks for talking my questions. 
The unit growth in the quarter, I believe 
was around 25%, which was a deceleration notable versus the last couple of 
quarters I believe the comp even got a little easier. Can you provide any 
color as to the dynamics in the quarter that may have drove that.
 
Then I am 
trying to get a sense of how to think about the magnitude of Prime price 
increase maybe if you could give us a sense of the base of subscribers that 
that would be applied to. Then lastly on shipping demand, is there anything 
that Amazon will do 
differently next holiday season to try to smooth out the 
pace of demand late in the holiday shopping season.
 
Tom Szkutak
 
First, the unit growth, you are right. It was 25% year
-
over
-
year it is a small 
deceleration over the last couple of quarters. Keep in m
ind that it is certainly 
our biggest quarter most seasonal and so both, from a revenue and from a 
unit standpoint you saw a deceleration from Q3 to Q4 of 2012 also, so we 
saw a deceleration not of the same magnitude we saw back in 2012 from Q3 
to Q4.
 
If yo
u take a look at the total growth, it's 25% on a unit basis, 22% ex
-
exchange on a revenue basis. We saw very good growth in North America, 
up 26%. This is again on a revenue basis. It's down sequentially a little bit in 
the last couple of quarters but cert
ainly up from Q4 of last year, where we 
grew 23%. In the International, revenue was up 15%, ex
-
exchange.
 
If you look at the pieces, certainly one of the biggest things you are seeing 
is, if you look at the media growth in our digital categories within medi
a and 
International, it's growing very fast, but as we have been talking about for 
quite some time, certainly a shift going from physical to digital you see that 
reflected in the North America media growth rates.
 
The reason why you don't see it as much in 
our International is because we 
are at the very early stages of that. So that's what you are seeing in terms 
of the differential, certainly one of the key differentials between the 
International media growth rate and North America growth rate. Also, keep 
i
n mind, in other revenue, the AWS revenue is growing very fast is recorded 
North America segment.
 
In terms of the Prime in terms of the impact, I am sorry I can't help you 
with the impact on U.S. What we have said, is globally we have tens of 
millions of c
ustomers and we certainly have been offering Prime in the U.S. 
longer than International and both segment is growing very fast from a 
Prime perspective. That's helpful.
 
Then, from a customer standpoint, during Q4 we worked very hard on behalf 
of customers 
to make sure that we can service them. I think the team did a 
very nice job. We will continue to work on that to get even better in future 
quarters and in future Q4 going forward.
 
Operator
 
Our next question will come from Neil Doshi with CRT Capital.
 
Unide
ntified Analyst
 
Good afternoon. It's actually Rob [ph] on the call for Neil. I have a couple of 
questions. If you could maybe talk a little bit about the impact of refunds or 
incentives given to customers to make up for some of the goods that arrive 
late i
n the holiday season? Also on Prime, with respect to the increase, 
would you consider saving that in Prime, perhaps just the new members at 
first and also would you consider giving an installment option to maybe 
soften the blow? Thank you.
 
Tom Szkutak
 
Yes,
 
in terms of the refunds, we did give some in the form of gift certificates 
as well as refunding some shipping fees or fees that were incurred by 
customers for that subset of customers who were impacted. So that's 
reflected in the Q4 results that you see t
oday. In terms of details of how we 
would roll out the Prime price increase that we are considering, you have to 
wait on that, but certainly as I mentioned, it's something that we haven't 
had any increase in the nine years. Customers certainly love Prime.
 
The available units for shipment have grown dramatically from one million to 
over 19 million over the last nine years. We haven't had any price increase. 
Customer usage, on a per customer basis, has gone up pretty dramatically, 
given the selection and the 
convenience of the service. So that's why we are 
considering, of course during this nine year period, shipping cost have gone 
up a lot, fuel cost have gone up a lot. So that's certainly the basis for us 
taking a look at it but in terms of the details, we w
ill be back when we make 
those decisions back to customers.
 
Operator
 
Moving on to Douglas Anmuth with JPMorgan.
 
Douglas Anmuth

JPMorgan
 
Great. Thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to follow
-
up on Prime as 
well. I was hoping, Tom, maybe you 
could give us some color on how newer 
Prime members, you have obviously added a lot of them over the recent 
quarters, but how newer cohorts of Prime members act relative to older 
cohorts and in particular if they convert as quickly and if they are spending
 
on a similar early trajectory as your more tenured Prime members? Then 
also, can you just comment on, I believe, the constrained signups in 4Q on 
Prime? Thanks.
 
Tom Szkutak
 
Sure. In terms of the details, I can't really give you a lot of color on the 
more 
recent versus the Prime member who have been with us for a long 
time, except to say that there is a lot of similarities in terms of what we are 
seeing. In other words customers, when we launched Prime nine years ago, 
one of the things that we hoped for was
 
customers who would do a lot more 
cross shopping that they would buy more from us and we are seeing that 
trend also in more recent Prime additions. The program is growing very fast. 
We are very, very pleased with it and we think it's great for the busines
s as 
we look forward as well. What was the second part of the question again?
 
Douglas Anmuth 
-
 
JPMorgan
 
4Q, I think you talked about signups being constrained in the quarter.
 
Tom Szkutak
 
Again, we have a very fast growth. We put a couple of statistics out 
in our 
holiday release on the 26
th
 
that you can refer to, but we had very strong 
growth and it did constrain it a bit and the customers liked it. Again, there is 
lot of demand for the service and we are going to continue to make sure that 
we can satisfy cu
stomers there and we thought it was appropriate to do so, 
to do that during Q4.
 
Operator
 
We will move on to Scott Devitt with Morgan Stanley.
 
Scott Devitt

Morgan Stanley
 
Hi, Tom. A couple of questions. Starting with continue the trend with Prime 
question
s. First, you mentioned higher shipping costs being a driver of 
potentially higher prices in the U.S. The U.S. Prime service is also the only 
one that has Kindle lending library and video and was just wondering if 
potentially if those additional services l
ed you think about increasing price as 
well to potentially further bolster either or both.
 
Then secondly international CSOI has been on the glide path lower over the 
past few years and if that's happened, the organic international growth rates 
moderated du
ring the same period.
 
Then just wondering going back to the decision to embark on the 
international investment cycle, if you anticipated the current revenue growth 
rate that you are experiencing, and if not, where are the areas in the 
business where you co
uld point to that we would begin to see growth that 
has not yet evident in the international business. Thank you.
 
Tom Szkutak
 
Sure. In terms of the first part, we have added a lot of new services to Prime 
beyond this shipping benefits you mentioned Kindle 
owners lending library. 
Certainly video, Prime Instant Video we are investing very heavily, and so 
those are certainly costly. Those aren't the reasons for the price increases 

-
 
we have not 
don
e our price increase in nine years. Shipping costs have gone up if you 
look back very considerably over the nine
-
year period.
 
Customers like the service, they are using it a lot more and we have a lot 
more selection. They are using it a lot more and so tha
t's the reason why we 
are looking at the increase.
 
In terms of the international growth, the growth was solid, with revenue ex
-
exchange at 15% the unit growth was considerably faster than that, 
primarily because third
-
party growth was very strong and certa
inly FBA is a 
component of that and when you think about the capacity that we built for 
not only for retail, but also for our third parties and we are able to offer our 
FBA items through Prime as well, so we are very happy with the capacity 
that we have bu
ilt across the world, including our international operations 
and that's reflected in the results that you are seeing.
 
Certainly one of the reasons why you are seeing the growth of operating 
income up over 100% in Q4 for international is because of the mix 
of third
-
party certainly helping that, so it's a combination of a number of factors, but

Great. A couple of things. I was hoping you could talk about your initiatives 
with AmazonFresh. What you are seeing in the Bay Area and Los Angeles so 
far? Are you seeing more units per customer?
 
Then maybe talk a little bit about the internat
ional Kindle stores. Could you 
start to see the better media results as you build out that infrastructure? 
Thank you.
 
Tom Szkutak
 
Sure. In terms of Fresh in LA in the Bay area, it's very, very early. We like 
what we see. Customers like the service. There h
as been good adoption. 
There has been good conversion from the Prime trials. So we are very 
pleased with what we were seeing there, but it is still very early. So you will 
have to stay tuned on that one. But again, it's very early but we like what 
we see.
 
In terms of International Kindle stores, absolutely. To be very clear, if you 
look at the Kindle content growth in Q4 in International, it's very strong. It's 
just again, we are at the early stages of this cycle from physical to digital. 
So the growth rate
 
is very strong and the and we saw similar type things 
when look back in the U.S. in terms of trends, but again, it's at the early 
part of the cycle in that conversion.

Thanks. It looks like a 1P growth margin, ex
-
shipping expanded nicely year

on

year again. I was wondering if you could talk to some of the margins or 
some of the drivers of 1P growth profitability getting better?
 
And how should 
we think about the sustainability of that over time? Thanks.
 
Tom Szkutak
 
We are not breaking out the first party margins, if you will. So I can't talk to 
the specifics of that but our retail business is very good. The combination of 
our ret
ail business is in our third
-
party business on a platform. It works for 
us. We think it's very important to have both offerings for a number of 
reasons. One is, from a customer experience standpoint, we like the fact 
that customers come to our detail pages
 
on our respective websites around 
the world they see competitive offerings. They know that we are very 
excited about making sure we get great values for customers and we price 
our products, appropriately and competitively low. So having the third
-
parties 
on our website certainly helps do that. It also adds additional 
selection that we don't have. So the combination of being able to make sure 
we have a competitive marketplaces as well as add great unique selection 
from both retail offerings and third
-
partie
s to make it work. So that's why 
we don't initially about first
-
party or third
-
party in terms of margins, but it's 
a combination of those working together on a platform that makes it work.

Great. Thank you. A couple of questions. With the potential pricing change of 
Prime in the U.S. would Amazon consider offering Prime Instant Video 
separately? And in terms of Prime
 
Instant Video, can you discuss the change 
in marketing spend for the service on a year
-
over
-
year basis 4Q13 versus 
4Q12? Then just, in the North America electronics and other goods segment, 
could you call out any particular categories that you drove the g
rowth? 
Thank you.
 
Tom Szkutak
 
In terms of Prime, there is not a lot I can help you with there. We certainly 
have 
-
 
it's a great offering for customers. I wouldn't speculate what we 
would do or not do going forward but we like the service that we have. We 
c
ontinue to invest in our Prime offering and it comes in a number of different 
forms. We will continue to add unique selections that Prime eligible. We have 
a great pattern of doing that over the nine
-
year period. We have also offered 
other services, as you
 
mentioned, in terms of Prime Instant Video as well as 
Kindle Owners' Lending Library. So it's a great value for customers and we 
plan on keeping that a great value for customers even with the price 
increase that we are considering in the U.S.

Great. Thanks. And in the North America, in the electronics and other goods 
segment, just wondering if there are any particular categories that drove the

Tom Szkutak
 
Yes, it was very broad, in terms of growth. We are very fort
unate that we 
saw very good growth across many different categories. Certainly, in a few

again in number of different areas those sort of lengthy [columns].

RBC Capital Markets
 
Yes. Just stick with that EGM category North America. It looks to us like it 
has decelerated relatively sharply. I thought you were going to call out some 
areas of weakness
 
there. Is there anything that cause that growth rate 
-
 
you 
would call out that caused the growth rate to decelerate on easy comp? 
Then Tom, could did you want to call it anything related to whether or UPS 
started to think that those impacts [material busi
ness].
 
Tom Szkutak
 
Well, again, I think the question was around EGM in North America in good 
25% already did decelerate from Q3. Keep in mind that a number of the 
categories with EGM this certainly is seasonal impact. If you look back to last 
year, Q4 grow
th rate in North America was 24%, so we actually saw an 
acceleration from Q4 last year to Q4 this year slightly.
 
Then, sorry, Mark. Second part of your question was related to?
 
Mark Mahaney

RBC Capital Markets
 
Did you want to call it anything 
related to weather an UPS?
 
Tom Szkutak
 
No. I mean, I think, certainly some of the UPS issues were documented in 
the press. From our standpoint, our team did a very good job of serving 
customers. We did have the issues that you are describing, but again I w
ill 
continue work on behalf of customers to make sure improve that experience 
over time and we didn't serve them well. We certainly did give some GCs to 
customers who also reimbursed them for shipping costs with where they 
incurred that and we will continu
e to make that better for customers over 
time.

Moving on to Carlos Kirjner with Bernstein.
 
Carlos Kirjner

Bernstein
 
Thank you. The two quick questions. Your CapEx was just slightly higher 
than last year's same period if you this correct for the 
real estate purchase. 
Even though the business overall grew 22% and you said AWS grew very 
fast. Does this relative decrease in CapEx signal an expectation AWS is going 
to grow slower?
 
Secondly, again, the Prime price increase, if you haves tens of million
s of 
prime users that decreasing price at least $20 with no incremental expense. 
That's quite a good chunk of money. Do you have specific to reinvest that 
money? Thank you.
 
The first part of your question, do we expect, is this an indication that AWS 
is sl
owing down. No. It's not. Actually, we are very pleased with the AWS 
business. It's growing very fast. The team is doing a fantastic job from a 
product and service standpoint and that we are very excited about that 
business, so I wouldn't form any pins abo
ut what CapEx might be in the 
future related to the growth rates and AWS is going very, very well.
 
Then you know the price increase on Prime, anything that we would invest 
would be an independent decision. From that, again, I think in the opening 
remarks I
 
talked about the rationale as to why and that's really what's 
driving that decision and then our investment decisions would be 
independent of that.

Greg Melich with ISI Group has the next question.
 
Greg Melich

ISI Group
 
Hi. Thanks, Tom. 
Going back to Prime, you consider the price increase, do 
you think the brand is such that you would be running to price seller or [tier] 
based on the value that's offered and sort of services you provided to certain 
customers?
 
Then second, on the categorie
s, I believe you called out a few quarters 
earlier that clothing in particular was one and third
-
party clothing had picked 
up a lot. Did you see that this holiday just given the importance of that 
category in the season?
 
Tom Szkutak
 
I will take the second 
part first. Softlines is very strong in Q4, which clothing 
is a piece of that.
 
In terms of tiers on Prime, I wouldn't speculate. We might or might not do in 
the future, but we like the Prime program where we have invested very 
heavily in it. We continue or
 
you should expect us to continue making it 
even better over time.
 
Unidentified Analyst
 
There's no prohibition to that but just do you still like it the way it is.
 
Tom Szkutak
 
Yes, we like it the way it is. Yes. But again, if you look back at what we have 
done, you can't expect that we might do going forward, but certainly we 
have had, in the U.S., Prime in place for nine years. We have added a 
massive selection during that time period. We have also added, this is on the 
physical side and we have also added
 
digital content as well to the service in 
the U.S. with Kindle Owners' Lending Library as well as Prime Instant Video 
and so it's a great value for customers. We see that customers love it and 
we are going to continue to try and make that even better for 
customers 
over time.

Great. Thanks for taking the questions. So I wanted to follow
-
up on AWS 
and talk a little bit on pricing. While it is certain coming down as efficiencies 
i
mprove but I believe AWS is sold in hour increments. I think Google's 
compete solution is sold on a per minute views. So I was wondering if you 
thought about maybe changing the way AWS is charged to maybe per 
minute? And then a quick follow
-
up on just fulf
illment centers, if you could 
just remind us what you ended the year with and if you have any plans for 
this year? Thank you.
 
Tom Szkutak
 
Sure. I will take the second part first, the fulfillment centers. We opened 
seven on a net basis. So that's the net ad
ds, but if you take that as a 
percentage for total fulfillment centers, you will get a number, but our 
square footage actually grew at quite a bit faster rate than that. Keep in 
mind that, I think we have talked about it in previous calls, we did have 
some
 
smaller older facilities that we consolidated into larger ones. So that's 
a net seven. Again the square footage growth is higher than that.
 
In terms of pricing on AWS, the team has done a fantastic job looking at the 
best way to run that part of our 
business. I wouldn't want to speculate what 
they would or wouldn't do related to pricing, but they are certainly making 
sure that they have offered great services to customers and they are great 
values to customers as well. And we are very excited about th
at part of the 
business.

Hi. Thank you. Two quick questions. How much of the slowdown in revenue 
in unit growth was a functio
n of the shorter shopping season in Q4? And 
then, in terms of raising the price on Prime, how much of that might be 
based on customers' reaction behavior after recently raising the threshold 
for free shipping to $35?
 
Tom Szkutak
 
In terms of the shorter per
iod for shopping, it's hard to tell, honestly. It's 
hard to know. It definitely was a shorter period from post
-
Thanksgiving to 
the holiday. But again, hard to know. And then, sorry, your other part of 
your question?
 
Chad Bartley 
-
 
Pacific Crest
 
I am curiou
s if the potential price increase on Prime and your confidence in 
doing that and that it wouldn't impact the adoption of Prime. How much of 
that is tied to the early results of raising the shipper saving threshold to $35 
from $25?
 
Tom Szkutak
 
They were ind
ependent decisions. They weren't related.

Great. Thanks for taking my question. So, when we think abo
ut shipping 
costs, I know you are talking about raising the rate on Prime, but you just 
indicated that you added seven fulfillment centers in 2013 on a net basis. As 
you get closer to the consumer and you shorten the shipped miles, how 
should we think abou
t the benefit on shipping expenses from just having 
more fulfillment centers close to the consumer?
 
Tom Szkutak
 
Yes. There's no question that as we grow our footprint, we get closer and 
closer to customers with additional selection and that certainly helpe
d us not 
raise prices or look at raising prices before this. So certainly we will continue 
to roll out our footprint. We are trying to make our networks as efficient as 
possible. And that's even with this price increase that we are looking at. It 
still ena
bles us to make sure that we have Prime at a great value to 
customers and that's something that's very important to us, because we 
know it's very important to our customers.

ks. In terms of digital content how are exclusive titles and 
original series driving user growth and Prime memberships? And any color

the question please?

Sure. In terms of digital content, I am just trying to figure out how some of 
your exclusive content titles are driving user growth and Prime memberships 
and any color just on what type of engagement you are 
seeing across 
different platforms via PC, tablet et cetera.
 
Tom Szkutak
 
We are seeing customers like the digital content. We are seeing great 
engagement, we are not breaking out in terms of the form, but again we are 
seeing great engagement. We do track ve
ry closely the Prime customers to 
come from free trials for examples.
 
They come through the pipeline for digital content from free trial standpoint, 
we track those conversions and we see that's growing very nicely. We do 
look at customers that use our Prim
e Instant Video, what are their shopping 
patterns look like both side of digital content.
 
Beyond the free content we have on there, do they buy more digital content 
and certainly we are seeing nice growth in digital content because of that, 
because they do
. They also do a lot of shopping physical categories as well, 
so those things we are tracking very closely and it's a great pipeline for us 
as customers look at the total value proposition for Prime, including digital 
content.

Heath Terry with Gol
dman Sachs has the next question.
 
Heath Terry 
-
 
Goldman Sachs
 
Great. Thanks. Tom, you mentioned a strong growth in AWS. Looking at the 
deceleration in the North America and other line, how should investors think 
about the relative growth of AWS versus the 
advertising and financial 
partnership that make up the rest of that segment? Then just on Fresh with 
L.A. and San Francisco's performance centers caring a number of non
-
perishable SKUs. What does Fresh do for your same day fulfillment 
capabilities in those
 
markets?
 
Tom Szkutak
 
In terms of AWS, I think the best way to think about it is a number of things 
other than AWS can be a lumpy, and you should assume when you look at 
the North America growth for Q4, our AWS revenue is growing at a faster 
rate than othe
r.
 
Then in terms of Fresh, when you look at those two and look at the new 
offerings that we have in the Bay Area and in the L.A. area it's certainly 
helping our same day delivery and they work hand in hand. In another 
words, we have increased the capabilit
y both, for Fresh as well as for our 
non

Deutsche Bank
 
Thanks. Tom, just a quick high
-
level question, so consumers in smartphone 
markets are 
spending about half their time on mobile these days and a lot of 
that's coming off of PC. I am sure that is a great kind of new customer 
acquisition channel for you guys, but in terms of existing Amazon customers, 
are you guys seeing purchase frequency for
 
physical products go up because 
of having phones with you all day? Or is it just swapping off of PC and into 
these newer channels? Thanks
 
Tom Szkutak
 
I kind of view just having the more connected devices, is just a tailwind for 
our business, and it's addi
tive. It's certainly helping our business grow. So 
whether that's phones or tablets, it's just a tailwind for our business. And we 
think it will continue to be so. So customers will certainly still purchase from 
their desktop or their laptop and so the tab
let mobile will not be completely 
additive, but it will certainly be a tailwind for our business. It's just anytime 
customers have easier access to be able to purchase, that's good for us.

Piper Jaffray
 
Thank you. Good afternoon. Could you just remind us on just kind of high 
level philosophy, the trade
-
off between revenue growth and earnings. I think 
investors typically think that you
 
see this as all of your market as nascent 
and profitability as kind of a distant thought. Is that still the case and any 
guidance in terms of how to think about that over the next two, five, ten 
years? Thank you.
 
Tom Szkutak
 
Sure. We track a lot of our in
vestments on a discreet basis as best we can. 
We are looking to maximize. Can you hear me okay?
 
Gene Munster

Piper Jaffray
 
Yes.
 
Tom Szkutak
 
We are looking to maximize free cash flow in those investments over time. 
So we have some investments that certain
ly start to pay
-
off and become 
profitable in a three to five year period. We have others that have been a bit 
longer. But again, we are monitoring those investments very carefully. Our 
goal is to maximize free cash flow for investors over time. That's clea
rly our 
goal. And that's something that we are working towards.
 
All that being said, we are investing a lot in the business right now. You can 
see that when you look at our results and the reason why we are doing that 
is because of the very large opportuni
ties that we see. We do go in cycles, 
as you have seen in our historical results, from time to time. We will pull 
back to make sure the model is working and we have done that and I am 
sure you will see that going forward at times as well. But again, we are
 
focused on making sure that we have a great customer experience with 
maximized free cash flow over the long term.

Good day, and welcome to the Amazon Quarterly Conference Call. Today's 
call is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Mr. 
John Felton, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
 
John Felton
 
Hello and 
welcome to our Q1 2011 Financial Results Conference Call. Joining 
us today are Tom Szkutak, our CFO; and Rob Eldridge, our VP of Investor 
Relations. We will be available for questions after our prepared remarks.
 
The following discussion and responses to yo
ur questions reflect 
management's views as of today, April 26, 2011, only and will include 
forward
-
looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional 
information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is 
include
d in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our 
most recent annual report on Form 10
-
K.
 
As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press 
release in front of you, which includes our financial results, as we
ll as 
metrics and commentary on the quarter.
 
During this call, we will discuss certain non
-
GAAP financial measures. In our 
press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the 
SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will fin
d additional 
disclosures regarding these non
-
GAAP measures, including reconciliations of 
these measures with comparable GAAP measures.
 
Finally, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against 
our results for the comparable period of 2
010. Now I'll turn the call over to 
Tom.
 
Thomas Szkutak
 
Thanks, John. I'll begin with comments on our first quarter financial results. 
Trailing 12 months operating cash flow increased 9% to $3.03 billion. 
Trailing 12 months free cash flow decreased 18% to 
$1.9 billion. Return on 
invested capital of 24%, down from 45%. ROIC [return on invested capital] 
as TTM [trailing 12 months] free cash flow is divided by average total assets 
minus current liabilities excluding the current portion of long
-
term debt over 
5
 
quarter ends.
 
The combination of common stock and stock
-
based awards outstanding was 
466 million shares compared with 463 million shares.
 
Worldwide revenue grew 38% to $9.86 billion or 36%, excluding the $144 
million favorable impact from year
-
over
-
year c
hanges in foreign exchange 
rates. We're grateful to our customers who also continue to take advantage 
of our low prices, vast selection and shipping offers.
 
Media revenue increased to $3.96 billion, up 15% or 13%, excluding foreign 
exchange rates. EGM [Ele
ctronics and other General Merchandise] revenue 
increased to $5.59 billion, up 59% or 57% excluding foreign exchange. 
Worldwide EGM increased to 57% of worldwide sales, up from 49%. 
Worldwide unit growth was 51%.
 
Active customer accounts exceeded 137 milli
on. Worldwide active seller 
accounts were more than 2 million. Seller units were 33% of total units.
 
Now, I'll discuss the operating expenses excluding stock
-
based 
compensation. The cost of sales was $7.61 billion or 77.2% of revenue 
compared with 77.1%. F
ulfillment, Marketing, Technology and Content and 
G&A combined was $1.78 billion or 18.1% of sales, up 234 basis points 
year
-
over
-
year. Fulfillment was $831 million or 8.4% of revenue compared 
with 7.4%. Tech and Content was $580 million or 5.3% of revenue
 
compared with 4.5%. Marketing was $320 million or 3.2% of revenue 
compared with 2.7%.
 
Now, I'll talk about our segment results, and consistent with prior periods, 
we do not allocate the segments, our stock
-
based compensation or other 
operating expense lin
e items. In the North America segment, revenue grew 
45% to $5.47 billion. Media revenue grew 18% to $1.89 billion. EGM 
revenue grew 63% to $3.3 billion, representing 60% of North America 
revenues, up from 54%. North America segment operating income increas
ed 
6% to $290 million, a 5.3% operating margin.
 
In the International segment, revenue grew 31% to $4.39 billion. Adjusting 
for the $141 million year
-
over
-
year favorable foreign exchange impact, 
revenue growth was 27%. We estimate that the international rev
enue 
growth rate was negatively impacted by approximately 500 basis points 
following the earthquake and subsequent events in Japan.
 
Media revenue grew 13% to $2.07 billion or 9% excluding foreign exchange, 
and EGM revenue grew 54% to $2.29 billion or 49% e
xcluding foreign 
exchange. EGM now represents 52% of international revenues, up from 
44%.
 
International segment operating income decreased 25% to $175 million, a 
4.0% operating margin. Excluding the favorable impact from foreign 
exchange, International seg
ment operating income decreased 28%.
 
CSOI [consolidated operating income] decreased 8% to $465 million or 
4.7% of revenue, down 239 basis points year
-
to
-
year. Excluding the $7 
million favorable impact from foreign exchange, CSOI decreased 9%.
 
Unlike CSOI, 
our GAAP operating income includes stock
-
based compensation 
and other operating expense. GAAP operating income decreased 18% to 
$322 million or 3.3% of net sales.
 
Our income tax expense was $89 million in Q1 or a 29% rate for the 
quarter. The tax provision
 
for Q1 2011 includes income tax expense for 
approximately $8 million related to a discrete item in the quarter. GAAP net 
income was $201 million or $0.44 per diluted share compared with $299 
million and $0.66 per diluted share.
 
Turning to the balance shee
t. Cash and marketable securities increased 
$1.82 billion year
-
over
-
year to $6.88 billion. Inventory increased 59% to 
$2.89 billion and inventory turns were 11.6, down from 12.6 turns a year 
ago, as we expanded selection, improved in
-
stock levels and intro
duced new 
product categories. Accounts payable increased 53% to $5.54 billion and 
accounts payable days increased to 66 from 59 in the prior year.
 
Our Q1 2011 capital expenditures were $298 million. The increase in capital 
expenditures reflects additional 
investments in support of continued business 
growth, including investments in technology infrastructure, including 
Amazon Web Services, capacity to support our fulfillment operations and 
investments in corporate office space.
 
I'll conclude my portion of to
day's call with guidance. Incorporated into our 
guidance are the order trends that we've seen to date, and what we believe 
to date to be appropriately conservative assumptions. Our results are 
inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many
 
factors 
including the high level of uncertainty surrounding exchange rate 
fluctuations, as well as the global economy and consumer spending. It's not 
possible to accurately predict demand, and therefore, actual results could 
differ materially from our gui
dance.
 
As we describe in more detail in our public filings, issues such as settling 
intercompany balances and foreign currencies amongst subsidiaries, 
unfavorable resolution of legal matters and changes to our effective tax 
rates can all have a material ef
fect on guidance.
 
Our guidance further assumes that we don't conclude any additional 
business acquisitions or investments, record any further revisions to stock
-
based compensation estimates and that foreign exchange rates remain 
approximately where they've
 
been recently.
 
For Q2 2011, we expect net sales between $8.85 billion and $9.65 billion or 
growth between 35% and 47%. This guidance anticipates approximately 640 
basis points of favorable impact from foreign exchange.
 
GAAP operating income to be 
between $95 million and $245 million or 
between 65% decline and 9% decline. This includes approximately $180 
million for stock
-
based compensation and amortization of intangible assets. 
We anticipate consolidated segment operating income, which excludes sto
ck
-
based compensation and other operating expense, to be between $275 
million and $425 million or between a 32% decline and 5% growth.
 
We remain heads
-
down focused on driving a better customer experience 
through price, selection and convenience. We believe
 
putting customers first 
is the only reliable way to create lasting value for shareholders.
 
Thanks. With that, John, let's move to questions.
 
John Felton
 
Great. Thanks, Tom. Let's move on to the Q&A portion of the call. Operator, 
will you please remind our
 
listeners how to initiate a question?
 
Question
-
and
-
Answer Session
 
Operator
 
[Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Spencer Wang with 
Crédit Suisse.
 
Spencer Wang 
-
 
Crédit Suisse AG
 
Thanks for taking the question. 2 quick questions for To
m. Can you just 
maybe elaborate a little bit on your 2Q guidance and what you're thinking 
the impact from Japan could be and how you're thinking about when you 
incorporate that into your guidance? And then secondly, on shipping, the 
losses seem like they'r
e growing. So I was wondering if you could just talk, 
Tom, about is that a function of more Prime usage, faster shipping or fuel 
cost perhaps impacting that line? Any more detail there would be great. 
Thanks.
 
Thomas Szkutak
 
Sure. In terms of your first que
stion, what we saw for Japan, first of all to 
talk just briefly about Q1 and then I'll talk about Q2. Q1 in terms of impact, 
we think the impact is approximately 500 basis points on international 
revenue. If you take a look at international revenue growth,
 
excluding 
foreign exchange, was up 27%. So about for the unfortunate events in 
Japan, it would have been approximately 32%. The impact on Q1 in terms of 
consolidated segment operating income was approximately $20 million. 
What we saw post the events, we c
ertainly saw a pretty sizable slowdown for 
the few weeks ending the quarter. What we've seen since then so far 
quarter
-
to
-
date has been that certainly our growth rates have picked up, but 
they're not at the rates they were previous to the events. So again,
 
we're 
seeing a positive growth there but not the growth rates we were seeing prior 
to that. And so what we believe for the quarter, along with all of our other 
assumptions are included in the guidance that we've given today. In terms 
of your second questi
on related to shipping profit, what you're really seeing 
there is customers are coming out in great numbers with all of our adopting 
all of our free shipping programs including Amazon Prime. I think we're 
seeing great adoption there and that's really what'
s driving those numbers.
 
Operator
 
[Operator Instructions] We'll go next to Jeetil Patel with Deutsche Bank.
 
Jeetil Patel

Deutsche Bank AG
 
Great, thanks. A couple of questions. One, I guess, when you look at your 
--
 
it looks like the International busines
s is really starting to kick in nicely and 
it seems like Amazon Prime has now had a chance to really mature and 
ramp up in a lot of your regions. I'm curious, are you seeing the same type 
of kind of returns that you saw in the U.S. market in terms of custo
mer 
adoption, kind of purchase frequency in the international markets around 
Prime? And second, it seems like Kindle, you're kind of employing a similar 
strategies that you did with Prime which is stagger versus the U.S. market, 
and is it almost following 
the same path of kind of ramp and returns for the 
Kindle initiatives globally as you saw in the U.S. market?
 
Thomas Szkutak
 
In terms of your first question, Jeetil, related to Prime, we are seeing these 
similar dynamics. We are seeing customers love Prime 
in all geographies 
that we've offered it in. We are seeing great cross shopping that's 
happening, so customers really like the program. And obviously we have 
different offers depending upon geography, but we're very pleased with what 
we're seeing so far. I
n terms of Kindle, we've seen tremendous growth both 
from a device standpoint, as well as a unit standpoint in terms of digital 
books in the U.S. And where we are now offering it outside of the U.S., we're 
seeing the same 
--
 
even though it's early, we're s
eeing great adoption and 
growth there. So we're very, very happy to see the progress that we've 
made. One thing that we're doing obviously, you probably saw the launch 
related to 
--
 
the announcement related to Kindle special offers, we actually 
will start 
shipping tomorrow. The teams did a nice job of moving the dates 
up from several days from now to start shipping tomorrow, so very pleased 
to be able to offer that and excited about that offering.
 
Operator
 
And we'll take our next question from Mark Mahaney 
with Citi.
 
Mark Mahaney 
-
 
Citigroup Inc
 
Great, thanks. 2 quick questions. That 51% unit growth seems like a real 
outlier. You haven't had that kind of unit growth in the past. Is there 
something in there that's unusual, something in there that's one time
-
i
sh, 
something in there that tells 
--
 
would have you warn people to think that 
that's not a sustainable growth level? And then very recently, you have 
something of an outage in the Amazon Web Services field. Was that a 
demand problem which is not necessaril
y a bad thing or are there certain 
efficiencies that you needed to 
--
 
or inefficiencies that you needed to 
address that have been fixed? Thanks.
 
Thomas Szkutak
 
Probably the best way to answer the unit growth rate is if you take a look at 
what we saw in Q4 
which is 43% growth rate, we saw a nice acceleration 
from 43% to 51% in Q1. What you're seeing there is we saw a great growth 
across the business. But the biggest thing you're seeing is that 
--
 
which 
primarily the consequence of growth of our digital busin
ess. That's what 
you're seeing in the growth rate, the acceleration in growth rate from Q4 to 
Q1. In terms of AWS, again, the team is working very deliberately on the 
way to identify and validate and fix the root causes associated with this 
incident, and t
hat's what they're working on and I don't really have a lot to 
add to that at this time.
 
Operator
 
And we'll take our next question from Youssef Squali with Jefferies.
 
Youssef Squali 
-
 
Jefferies & Company, Inc.
 
Thank you very much. 2 quick questions. First, the midpoint of guidance for 
Q2 implies margins about 1.8%. So x SBC, where's the other 150 bps or so 
of additional spend going? How much of that is on recurring things like the 
4,200 people or so you hired in
 
the quarter versus kind of any one
-
time 
items? And second on the state tax issue, how big a concern is it to you, 
how big an advantage do you believe you've enjoyed so far from not paying 
taxes in those states? I guess in other words, would you have been 
able to 
grow at the rates you have been growing at if taxes were kind of levied 
across 
--
 
on your business across the U.S.?
 
Thomas Szkutak
 
Sure. In terms of your first question, we're not breaking out the individual 
line items, if you will, for operating e
xpenses. But if you take a look at what 
we saw in Q1, you're seeing that we've added a lot of capacity to our CapEx 
and you'll also see the fulfillment capacities here on our CapEx and you'll 
also see it in the fulfillment line item. We added 13 fulfillmen
t centers last 
year. If you take a look at the announcements that we've had to date, we're 
adding 9 fulfillment centers this year. Those are the ones that we've 
announced. With the growth rates we're seeing, you should expect 
--
 
if the 
order continues, you
 
should expect to see more than that this year as well, 
more than the 9. So that's what you're seeing in the Q1. And you'll also see 
that reflected in the Q2 guidance as well. Same is true with Tech and 
Contents. We're adding a lot of capacity to support o
ur growing business. 
Again, you've seen that reflected in the CapEx as well as the Q1 Tech and 
Content line and that's also reflected in the guidance as well. In terms of 
state taxes, one thing you keep in mind is we actually collect sales and 
value
-
added 
tax in approximately 50% of our revenue base, sort of a little 
over 50% of our revenue base today. And so the growth rates that you're 
seeing reflect the fact that we are collecting in more than half of our revenue 
base. So beyond that, there's not a lot I
 
can add there.
 
Operator
 
We'll take our next question from James Mitchell with Goldman Sachs.
 
James Mitchell 
-
 
Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
 
Great. Thanks very much for taking the questions. If I look at the 74% 
growth in North America and other revenues, is th
at primarily due to 
Amazon Web Services? And then similarly, if I look at the step up in CapEx, 
would that also be primarily due to Amazon Web Services? And then kind of 
uniting the 2 questions together, historically Amazon has been very capital 
discipline
d, how do you get confident that the capital you're putting into 
Amazon Web Services would generate returns over the time that you desire?
 
Thomas Szkutak
 
Sure. If you look at North America, other growth in the North America 
includes a number of items, incl
uding Web services. So it's a combination of 
all those items that we've talked about in the past. And so but certainly, 
Web services is a meaningful part of that. In terms of the CapEx question, 
what you see in CapEx is 
--
 
if you look at the growth, we had
 
$1.1 billion of 
CapEx in the last 12 months. And if you look at the growth year
-
over
-
year of 
that CapEx, approximately 80% of that is due to pure capacity. And that's 
capacity in terms of fulfillment, that's capacity from an infrastructure 
standpoint to s
erve the retail business as well as AWS. And another 10% to 
12% is associated with just the corporate office space and the remainder is a 
number of small items. So again, the vast majority, approximately 80%, is 
due to capacity, both infrastructure and our
 
operation capacity. In terms of 
your question about how we think about AWS, we, like a lot of parts of our 
business, we look at that business very discretely and all the services very 
discretely. And we look at the ROIC potential of those businesses and t
he 
opportunity to work on trying to figure out the best way we get great returns 
for shareholders. And that's something that we've been doing since we 
launched the business, and obviously we have a lot more information to do 
that now than we did at launch.
 
But again, it's something that we do 
continuously.
 
Operator
 
We'll take our next question from Jim Friedland with Cowen and Company.
 
James Friedland 
-
 
Cowen and Company, LLC
 
Thanks. One of the other line items that was up year
-
over
-
year was 
marketing expen
se, 50 basis points. Is that a ramp or an incremental ramp 
in Kindle promotion? You guys also did something with a LivingSocial 
promotion in Q1. And also equity and affiliates was up a little bit. Was that 
due to the LivingSocial investments? Thanks.
 
Thoma
s Szkutak
 
In terms of marketing, the 2 primary paid marketing are still our associates 
channel and sponsored search. And so those are our 2 primary, but you're 
correct in terms of we are doing, as you've probably seen, some more 
broadscale advertising rela
ted to Kindle would be certainly incremental year
-
over
-
year and certainly impacting that number. In terms of the equity line, 
we do have a number of equity investments. And certainly, one of those is 
LivingSocial. And it's certainly impacting that number t
hat you're seeing.

We'll take our next question from Ben Schachter with Macquarie.
 
Benjamin Schachter

Macquarie Research
 
Can you describe how Amazon views its advertising business? In particular, 
how ramping up capabilities there could impact bo
th Amazon properties and 
devices? And then separately, how you could participate in advertising 
opportunities on third
-
party sites? Thanks.
 
Thomas Szkutak
 
Yes, in terms of our advertising business, it's still very early. The team has 
done a fantastic job g
rowing that business, and we'll have to wait and see 
what we do further with that business, but it's something that the team has 
done a great job. And it allows us and we think it allows us over time to 
have another way to have great low prices for custome

capacity build out. So when you mentioned that these top line growth rates 
that you may consider increasing the capital 
commitment to new capacity, is 
that something that's already reflected in the Q2 guidance range, or is that 
more likely a decision for the second half of the year? And then on the 
international operating income being down 25%, given that majority of Tech 
a
nd Content spending is incurred in North America, if you could just clarify 
the drivers of that decline in income? Thank you.

You just 
--
 
I'm sorry, Colin, you're just breaking up in the first part of your 
question around capacity?
 
Colin Sebastian

Lazard Capital Markets LLC
 
Sure. So you mentioned the top line growth, if these rates continue, you 
might consider increasing the capital commitment to new capacity. And so I 
guess the question is, is that already somewhat reflected in yo
ur Q2 
guidance or would that be a second half decision in terms of ramping up 
beyond the 9 fulfillment centers?
 
Thomas Szkutak
 
Here's where we are. We've had announcements of 9 fulfillment centers. 1 is 
operational today, 1 is coming up, will be operationa
l in the coming days. 
We're actually doing receiving now. And then the remainder of those 
fulfillment centers will be throughout the year. And my comment was those 
are the ones that we've announced that certainly with the high growth that 
we're experiencin
g, you should expect that, should that continue, we would 
be adding additional fulfillment centers beyond it. What you are seeing in the 
Q2 guidance certainly reflects the fact that we will be adding capacity. And 
that's certainly 1 of the factors that wen
t into the guidance that we've given.

Thanks, just 1 question please. In categories that are facing structural 
change in distribution like the bo
ok industry which continues to be your 
largest segment, I was just wondering if you could talk about the effects that 
that is having today or may have on the margin profile of that business for 
you over time? Thanks.
 
Thomas Szkutak
 
Well, as we look at thes
e new businesses, we're certainly looking at it from a 
free cash flow and a return on investment standpoint from a long term 
--
 
with a long
-
term perspective. We're incredibly excited in that specific one 
that you mentioned with Kindle because we see that c
ustomers are buying a 
lot more books. And so we're incredibly excited to be able to offer that to 
customers. We think the potential long term is 
--
 
we love the potential that 
it has long term and we continue to invest in that business.

We'll take 
our next question from Brian Pitz with UBS.
 
Brian Pitz

UBS Investment Bank
 
Thanks. A couple of quick ones. For Q2 revenue guidance, would you 
comment on whether Quidsi and Lovefilm are included? If so, any 
approximation of the impact? And then on content
, can you give us any 
indications on the level of spending to secure digital content rights? Do you 
anticipate for Prime instant video? And then any commentary on whether or 
not that's driving Prime usage? Thanks.
 
Thomas Szkutak
 
In terms of Quidsi and Love
film, yes they're both in Q2. The impact is on 
revenue, approximately $140 million of revenue in Q2 which works out to be 
about 220 basis points of growth. Consolidated segment operating income is 
actually negative, approximately $15 million, and GAAP oper
ating income is 
approximately negative $30 million in the quarter. So that's what's included 
in the Q2 guidance for Quidsi and Lovefilm combined. In terms of content, 
you have to stay tuned on that. We're not putting out those details. But the 
only thing I
 
would say about it is we're very, very pleased with the adoption 
so far and it's very early and we will be adding some more content over 
time.

We'll take our next question from Sandeep Aggarwal with Caris & Company.

Thanks for taking my question. I have 2 questions. One is, Tom, fulfillment 
and shipping expense have been among the core of Singles Amazon. And 
many multi
-
general dealers and pure
-
play commerce companies are getting 
into that space or getting better 
at least including eBay's possible acquisition 
of GSI Commerce. So how does Amazon continue to spend on its 
competitive modes around fulfillment and shipping experience? And second 
question is can you make a comment about the capacity utilization of the 13
 
fulfillment centers you set up last year?
 
Thomas Szkutak
 
Sure. In terms of the first part, we have a fantastic operations team that is 
continuing to look at ways to improve delivery speed, as well as improving 
our cost structure over time. And that's some
thing you'd see if you look back 
over our history, it's something that they've worked on. And so they're 
always looking at ways to better serve customers and to get better. And so 
there's a number of ways that they do that. And it's a constant focus. In 
te
rms of the capacity, I don't think there's anything, any way to really help 
you because, again, the utilization will vary from week
-
to
-
week and quarter
-
to
-
quarter. But what we are seeing is, as you would expect with this great 
growth that we're experiencin
g, there is just more demand for capacity and 
that's both from a fulfillment capacity, that's both from our core retail 
business as well as fulfilled by Amazon.

Thanks. So for the days payable to vendors, the increase was 11% to 66 
days. How much more improvement do you think that you have there or is 
there something also driving that improvement that you can share? Thanks.
 
Thomas Szkutak
 
We're not giving 
--
 
we have been able to get good improvements over the 
past several years in AP days. We're not giving guidance on what that could 
look like, but we continue to work with our partners to improve our working 
capital cycle. And obviously, t
here's certainly a mix of categories that we 
have. They all have their own operating cycle. But again, we're very pleased 
with the operating cycle that we have and we'll continue to work with our

And we'll take our next 
question from Jason Helfstein with Oppenheimer & 
Co.
 
Jason Helfstein

Oppenheimer & Co. Inc.
 
Thanks. Can you just go into a little bit more detail on the DC centers? So of 
the 9 centers that you've announced, how many are international? And then 
are the c
osts higher to launch an international DC internationally than in the 
U.S.? So just a little more color on that. Thanks.
 
Thomas Szkutak
 
Sure. The 
--
 
of the 9, and we could probably have either Rob or John get 
back to you on the exact details, but 
approximately 4 those are in the U.S. 
or 5 in North America and the others are in international. So the fulfillment 
centers vary depending upon the level of automation and the locations 
they're in. I can't really give you a precise as 1 geography higher th
an 
another. It kind of depends on size and the level of automation.
 
Robert Eldridge
 
Hey Jason, it's Rob. I think 1 thing to add here is Tom's point. We're 
expanding fulfillment capacity worldwide. It's not just in a specific geography 
because the growth we
're seeing is broad
-
based. The second point I just 
want to make is as we are building system of scales, fulfillment becomes 
more of a continuous investment project. It becomes less project to our end, 
just something that we need to undertake on a go
-
forwar
d basis. And so 
you're certainly seeing that decision being reflected in our Q1 results and it's 
also reflected in our Q2 guidance.

We'll take our next question from Gene Munster with Piper Jaffray.
 
Charles Munster

Piper Jaffray Companies
 
And I 
realized you guys talked about the impact of the LivingSocial promo, 
and as we look at the uptick in marketing expenses, it seems that you're 
spending a little bit more to get each incremental new customer. Is that 
true? And if so, what will be driving tha
t?
 
Thomas Szkutak
 
Sorry, I didn't catch the first part of it, the LivingSocial piece.
 
Charles Munster 
-
 
Piper Jaffray Companies
 
Well, I know you mentioned the LivingSocial, the impact of the LivingSocial 
promo on the marketing expenses. But backing that ou
t, as you look at your 
marketing expenses, can you just talk a little bit about customer acquisition 
cost and how they've been trending?
 
Thomas Szkutak
 
In terms of 
--
 
I didn't mention anything about LivingSocial as it related to 
our marketing expense line.
 
What I was referring to is if you look at our 
equity income line on our income statement, you can see an expense there 
and I've said that there was 
--
 
that was made up of a number of different 
investments that we have which includes LivingSocial, so that 
was the 
LivingSocial piece. In terms of marketing spend, we still 
--
 
the spend is very 
efficient. And again, what I mentioned earlier was that still the 2 primary 
pieces of our spend are our associates channel and also sponsored search, 
so those are our 2 
primary. In terms of looking at it year
-
over
-
year, you're 
also seeing some of the broadscale spending we're doing specifically related 
to Kindle that's impacting that number as well.

Great, thank you. Seeing growth rates accelerate even slightly for the first 
time in the past 4 quarters, to what extent would you attribute that to the 
infrastructure buildout, improving product selection and availability? And 
maybe to ge
t a little more granular, can you quantify for us the 
improvement in your product delivery time or availability that you've seen 
since the beginning of investment cycle?
 
Thomas Szkutak
 
In terms of quantifying, I'm not sure how much I can help you with that
 
but 
there's no question that what we're seeing is customers responding to the 
increased selection across many categories, across many geographies. We 
also, certainly Prime is having an impact, as well as our other free shipping 
offers and so the adoption 
of both has been great. And so we're very pleased 
to that. Also, making sure that we have great low prices for customers is 
also having impact. So all of those things are having an impact on our 
growth rate that you see there.

And we'll take our n
ext question from Steve Weinstein with Pacific Crest.
 
Steve Weinstein

Pacific Crest Securities, Inc.
 
Great, thank you for taking my question. So it's already been noticed that 
the growth in units relative to growth in revenues is a pretty substantial 
dif
ference and kind of a widening difference. I was wondering if you could 
explain when a customer becomes a digital customer and they started 
buying whether Kindle books or another digital product, how does their 
spending on Amazon change? Are they spending 
similar amounts with you 
and just buying more units or is the actual amount of spending with Amazon 
going up? Obviously the unit growth is a lot. Thanks.
 
Thomas Szkutak
 
I apologize, Steve, but there's not a lot I'll be able to help you with there in 
terms of specific numbers. But we are seeing customers who are digital 
customers still being very good, physical customers as well, so buying, doing 
a lot of cross shopping across our business. And so we're very excited about 
our digital offerings and it's
 
certainly reflected in the unit growth that you 
mentioned. But also we're seeing very good growth amongst many physical 
categories across all of our geographies as well. So again, customers are 
responding to some of the things I already mentioned but they
're certainly 
responding to the selection that we have for our digital offerings, as well as 
our physical product offerings. And that's reflected in the growth rates.

And ladies and gentlemen, we have time for 1 final question tonight. It does 
com
e from Matt Nemer with Wells Fargo Securities.
 
Matt Nemer

Wells Fargo Securities, LLC
 
Thanks for taking my question, 2 questions actually. One, is there a point 
where increased digital offerings sales offset investments in selection and in 
stocks and we 
start to see that in the inventory turns number? And then 
secondly, a question on fulfillment and tax issues. How flexible is your 
fulfillment capacity in the U.S. if a state changes its mind or renegs on a 
prior agreement regarding tax collection? Thanks.
 
Thomas Szkutak
 
In terms of your first question, the reason why we're adding the physical 
capacity is it's growing very fast. So we are having the benefit of seeing both 
a very strong growth in our digital offerings, as well as a very strong growth 
in our 
physical offerings. So it's the combination of both things that are 
driving the overall growth of our business, as well as the fulfillment centers 
that you're seeing in the case of your question. In terms of the fulfillment 
centers, we have a lot of 
--
 
we 
have a wide range of fulfillment centers 
across a number of different states and geographies, and we continue 
--
 
our 
operation team does a great job in terms of figuring out where the best 
places are to invest and they'll continue to do that over time.

Thank you for standing by. Good day everyone and welcome to the 
Amazon.com, Q3 2019 Financial Results Teleconference. At this time all 
participants are in a listen
-
only mode. After the presentation we will conduct 
a 
question
-
and
-
answer session.
 

over to the Director of Investor Relations, Shelly Kay Pfeiffer. Please go 
ahead.
 
Shelly Kay Pfeiffer
 
Hello, and welcome to our Q3, 2019 financial 
results conference call. Joining 
us today to answer your questions is Brian Olsavsky, our CFO; and Dave 
Fildes, Director of Investor Relations.
 

release in front of you, which incl
udes our financial results, as well as 
metrics and commentary on the quarter. Please note, unless otherwise 
stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the 
comparable period of 2018.
 
Our comments and responses to your questions ref

as of today, October 24, 2019 only and will include forward
-
looking 
statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information 
about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in 

ess release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent 
annual report on Form 10
-
K and subsequent filings.
 
During this call, we may discuss certain non
-
GAAP financial measures. In our 
press release, slides accompanying this webcast, and our fil
ings with the 
SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional 
disclosures regarding these non
-
GAAP measures, including reconciliations of 
these measures with comparable GAAP measures.
 
Our guidance incorporates the order trends that
 

-
date and 
what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are 
inherently unpredictable and maybe materially affected by many factors, 
including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic 
conditions and
 
customer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the 
Internet, online commerce and cloud services, and the various factors 
detailed in our filings with the SEC.
 

additional busin
ess acquisitions, investments, restructurings or legal 

services, and therefore our actual results could differ materially from our 
guidance.
 
With that, we will move to Q&A. Opera
tor, please remind our listeners how 
to initiate a question.

Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of 
Eric Sheridan with UBS. Please proceed.
 
Eric Sheridan
 
Thanks so much for taking 
the question. I wanted to know if I could go a 
little bit deeper in the framework you gave around revenue guidance for Q4.
 
Historically, you have seen deceleration in the year
-
on
-
year growth rate in 
Q4 versus Q3, but many of your businesses look like they 
reaccelerated in 
Q3 over Q2. So just wanted to know whether it was AWS or advertising or 
some of the things in e
-
commerce business, whether there are things we 
should be keeping in front of mind from a headwind or a tailwind 
perspective, as we think throug
h some of the moving pieces in Q4? Thanks 
so much.
 
Brian Olsavsky
 
Sure. Hi, Eric. Yes, let me make clear, we are really excited and looking 
forward to a great holiday season. We feel like we had a great Q3 as well 
and have made rapid progress on our One Da
y shipping. The ops team has 

going to be a great additional service for customers in Q4.
 

look back over th
e last few years and adjust for the acquisition of Whole 
Foods and Soup, which obscured this a bit in the last couple of years.
 
There has been a noticeable drop in run rate, between Q3 and Q4 generally 
on the lines of about 300 basis points. We are factori
ng that in this year, 


tight few weeks of the holiday season versus the rest of the year.
 
So we factor that 

holiday in India was all in Q4 last year and a bit of it was in Q3 this year. 
Also the Japan consumption tax was raised from 8% to 10% on October 1, 
and what we saw was a pre
-
buy a bit in Q3 at the end
 
of the quarter, and 
based on our history with the last time the consumption tax went up many 

Japan.
 

with o
ur international growth rate. I would say it has helped us by 150 basis 
points in Q3, and will be a negative headwind of 300 basis points year
-
over
-
year in Q4.

great new device lineup you may have seen announced in September and on 

Vegas, where we welcome over 65,000 conference attendees.

Th
ank you. Our next question is from Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan. Please 
proceed.
 
Doug Anmuth
 
Thanks for taking the questions. Brian, I just wanted to ask you kind of more 
broadly about Prime One Day, what your biggest learnings have been so far 
over the 

 
And then how should we think about that availability now, and when we get 
into the heart of the holiday season? And can you also just help us 

me guidance for 4Q? 
Thanks.
 
Brian Olsavsky
 
Sure. Let me start with the second part of that. So back in Q2, I said that we 
were estimating an $800 million expense tied to One Day in Q2, and we 
actually were just above that in Q2. In Q3, we expected that to 
grow, we put 
into our guidance and we hit essentially where we expected on the guidance.
 

in Q4 year

year for the cost of shipping, which is essentially 
transportation costs, 
the cost of expanding our transportation capacity, 
things like adding additional poles and shifts in our warehouses, the cost for

transportation cost.
 

with the customer response to One Day. You can see it in our revenue 
acceleration and also in our unit growth acceleration. Once again the ops 
team has really d

they continue to unlock additional capacity daily.
 

have seen Prime members increase their orders, spend more, so that they 
m
ust also see it as a real help to them in their daily lives.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Youssef Squali with 
SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Please proceed.
 
Youssef Squali
 
Great, thank you so much. Brian, kind of just a couple 
of quick ones. Of the 
400 basis point sequential acceleration growth, can you help us just 
understand maybe how much of that was driven by Prime Day, which I think 
you guys said was a record day for you versus One Day shipping. Just trying 
to extract one v

going to have the latter.
 
And then on 

 
a lot of news around counterfeit and whatnot on the side. Can 
you just help quantify that for us if there is a way for you to do that? And is 
the higher Op
Ex 4Q also driven at least in part by the higher investment to 
combat that? Thank you.
 
Brian Olsavsky
 

trying to catch counterfeit products. We put a lot of effort into that, we p
ut a 
lot of human effort, we put a lot of machine learning and algorithmic effort 
into that as well.
 
But I would say the bigger investments in Q4 are certainly two
-
fold: One 
around the One Day shipping that I just mentioned. The other would be on 
AWS. We c
ontinue to invest in AWS. If you look at the progression of our 
operating margin in that business, it reached a high of 31% last Q4, excuse 
me Q3. That was a time when we were 

 
as we mentioned at the time it was 
very efficient, we had been banking some sa
vings from forward investments 
in infrastructure in 2017.
 
We continue to feel really good about not only the top line, but also the 
bottom line in that business, but we are investing a lot more this year in 
sales force and marketing personnel, mainly to ha
ndle a you know wider 
group of customers, an increasingly wide group of products, we continue to 
add thousands of new products and features a year, and we continue to 
expand geographically.
 
So the biggest impact that we saw in Q3 year
-
over
-
year in the AWS 
segment was tied to costs related to sales and marketing year
-
over
-
year 
and also to a secondary extent, infrastructure, which if you look at our 
capital leases or equipment leases line, it grew 30% on a trailing 12
-
month 
basis in Q3 of this year and that w
as 9% last year.
 
So there has been a step up in infrastructure costs to support the higher 

essentially, probably the other element of operating income year
-
over
-
year, 

n prior quarters.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Nowak with Morgan 
Stanley. Please proceed.
 
Brian Nowak
 
Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. Just to go back to the One Day 

out how you think about 
what portion of these costs are sort of transitory versus structurally? It 
sounds like there are some shipping costs in there.
 
Can you just sort of talk to some of the steps, you have to take over the 
next one to two years to get th
e One Day shipping costs closer to what they 

take?
 

-
date, is that right? 
And then if not, how do you think about sort of timi
ng on pushing more 
internationally? Thanks.
 
Brian Olsavsky
 
Sure. Yes, most of the expense has been in the U.S., but we have also 

benefits from that. But I would say the biggest imp
act so far, both on the 
top line lift and also the bottom line cost is in the U.S.
 

what the long
-
term cost structure will be. We know we have temporary costs 
in the short run as we do t
hings like forward deploy inventory, get greater 
inbound into those warehouses, set up new Amazon Logistics, AMZL 
capacity, staff you know multiple shifts, so that we can have later pull times 
to hit One Day cut
-
offs, things like that, adding sort centers.
 


 

this road before obviously, and a number of different incarnations in Amazon 
history. So we will keep posted 
on a, you know quarterly basis as best we 
can, but right now, really forward guiding is for Q4.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Heath Terry with 
Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.
 
Heath Terry
 
Great, thanks. I know most of the 
focus on One Day has been on speed, but 

your own last mile infrastructure is maybe the bigger part of this.
 
As it scales and you get to higher levels of efficiency and utilization,
 
does 
that become margin accretive or profitability accretive relative to using the 
third parties almost exclusively in the way that you have in the past? And 
then this was also a very big hiring quarter for you, 100,000 people. Can 
you give us a sense of 
where those people are going you know relative to 
AWS fulfillment, retail, kind of understanding sort of where they have been 
prioritized?
 
Brian Olsavsky
 
Sure. Thank you for your questions Heath. On the first question, I think it 
boils down to whether it w
ill be competitive long term with other options out 
there. Yes, we will be, we believe that. In many cases we are already are 
and the places where we have very high AMZL percentages, the U.K. for 

r the type of 

 

capacity, certainly fueled by helps with third party carriers, large carriers 

fact including 

businesses to help fill this need as well.
 

will improve over time and get our cost str
ucture down, but for now, there is 
certainly some start
-
up paying in adding new capacity.
 
On the headcount question, yes we increased as you said close to 100,000 
people in Q3. I mean we are up 22% year
-
over
-
year. In the past that 
pointed to investments in
 


for fulfillment and transportation roles, especially as we head into Q4 and 
add this additional transportation capacity to servi
ce One Day.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question comes from Stephen Ju with Credit Suisse. 
Please proceed.
 
Stephen Ju
 

and takes on the long
-
term potential margin for AWS? When this w
as first 
launched it pretty much sold itself and now you are employing a greater 
number of salespeople, and with that I guess the incremental marketing 
dollars. But on the other hand it seems like the engineering talent hiring 
should slow down over time. S


 
Brian Olsavsky
 
Yeah, sure. I would say the margins 

 
our margins expectations are that we 
will price competitively and continue to pass along pricing reductions to 
c
ustomers both in the form of absolute price reductions and also in the form 
of new products that will in effect cannibalize the old ones.
 

renegotiating or negotiating incremental pr
ice decreases for customers who 
then commit to us long term. And if you look at our disclosure on our 10
-
Q, 
it shows that we have $27 billion in future commitments for AWS, from AWS 

-
over
-

wat

-
term commitment, but also the long
-
term 
commitment that we see.
 
On the rest of the P&L, there again we have, I believe some of the best 
infrastructure people in the industry. If not the best, we are continually 
driving up effici
ency and lowering costs and we see that in our bottom line.
 

and that will be, you know as we say bumpy as we go along, but we are fully 
confident that that will be a very leveraged 
cost as we get to scale.
 
And then on the technology side, as you said, yes we will continue and 
invest in SDEs and software engineers to build these you know products that 
customers love, continue to respond to their demands, and that will push or 
inform o
ur product portfolio.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question is from Lloyd Walmsley with Deutsche Bank. 
Please proceed.
 
Lloyd Walmsley
 
Thanks. Can you talk about the key drivers of the acceleration in what looks 
like advertising revenue within other and rel
ated to that, the press release 
mentions I think you are now $37 million Fire Stick users worldwide. So can 

of networks within that and how meaningful is this to the overall kind of 
advertising strategy. Thanks.
 
Brian Olsavsky
 
Yes, so let me start with the first question on advertising. So other revenue, 
which is principally advertising grew 45% this quarter, up from 37% last 
quarter and the biggest thing in there is advertising and a
dvertising grew at 
a rate higher than that 45%.
 
So we are very happy with the progress in the advertising business, continue 
to focus on advancing advertising experiences there, helpful for customers, 
helping them to see new products, we want to empower ou
r businesses to 

vendor sellers and third
-
party advertisers.
 

making sure that the ads are relevant
 
to our customers, helpful to our 

drive better, better and better relevancy.
 
Dave Fildes
 
Yeah. And then Lloyd, this is Dave. Just quickly on Fire TV. I mean I have to 
start 
with the fact that we did recently introduce 20 new Fire TV products, so 
that includes the new 

 
and the first Fire TV Edition Sound Bar, Fire TV 


 
to come there.
 
I think specifically on the advertising side and the opportunity with that, we 
are continuing to see some increased adoption. You know one of our areas 

in this s

like adding more inventory through Fire TV apps, and as I said IMDb TV, 
adding more OTT video supply through Amazon Publisher Services or APS 
integrations and streamlining access for third
 
party apps and really just 
making it easier for advertisers to manage their campaigns and provide 
better results.
 
So, as I said early days, but I think with the engagement of the device 

i
mprovements of these devices, I think yeah, again a lot of opportunity 
there.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question comes from Scott Devitt with Stifel. Please 
proceed.
 
Scott Devitt
 
Thanks. There has been a meaningful reacceleration in paid unit growth in 
the past two quarters with the expansion of the One Day guarantees for 

in certain categories that you would highlight over others or is the response 
fairly broad
-
based across the prod
uct categories where One Day has been 
expanded? Thank you.
 
Brian Olsavsky
 
Hi, Scott. Yeah, what I can tell you is that yes, the unit growth has been 
reaccelerated in the last two quarters and actually Amazon Fulfilled unit 
growth is growing at a higher cli
p. So we do attribute it to One Day.
 


doing separately over the last six months that have spurred some sales 
in 
lower ASP items, but we think that is again the right decision for customers, 
especially over the long term.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital 
Markets. Please proceed.
 
Mark Mahaney
 
Hey, thanks, I want to go b
ack to AWS. When asked about margins, you first 
referred to 

 
Brian you first referred to by bringing down prices. Are you 
seeing anything different in terms of the level of price competition? Could 

out into the 

part of this is, your interest and your success in going in and generating 
more app 

 
you know going up the stack and getting more into the 
application software spa
ce, all that AWS related. Thanks.
 
Brian Olsavsky
 
Sure. Hi, Mark. So yeah, I would say my comments around pricing were as 


 
really a 
number of years. So everyone is very sharp on their pricing and is very 
eager to lock up long
-
term commitments from AWS customers.
 
We do it with you know a combination of price and capability that we think is 
unmatched. So the bigger element of t
hat really is around us creating new 
products and services that are cheaper and less expensive than the old 
ones. So there is a certain bit of mix issue that we are always up against.
 
But again in your question on enterprise penetration, you know I think t
he 


-
to
-

to predict the pace of some of the sales cycles and the enterprise migrations 
that companies are willi
ng to make or some are faster than others and some 
have other work to do before they can migrate.
 


sales 
representatives, especially for the enterprise market.
 
Dave Fildes
 
Yeah, and Mark, this is Dave. Just really quickly just in terms of your 
question on the stack. I mean I think for really since as long as AWS has 
been around, we really pride ourselves in g
etting really top, high caliber 
people both in the technical side, but also sales people that are plugged in 
and listening to customers, understanding issues that are emerging, having 

ckly 
and really faster than anyone else, and we see that in the terms of the 
service and feature breadth and depth that we have.
 
So, a lot of the focus for us is really making sure that that flywheel keep 
spinning, and that we continue to roll out a lot of
 
great services the 

roadmap and making sure that we give ourselves autonomy and availability 

technologies or r
eally just our customer needs or pain points that need to be 
solved.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question comes from Colin Sebastian with Baird. Please 
proceed.
 
Colin Sebastian
 
Thanks. Maybe first is a follow
-

won
dering if you could give us some sense for the portion of SKUs in the 
U.S. or orders in the U.S. that are now delivered through your own network 
of drivers and partners.
 
And then secondly, there have been some reports that Amazon is or on 
occasion is deliv
ering products for other merchants or suppliers, not 
specifically tied to an Amazon order. So just wondering if you view this as 
another potential opportunity down the road as you get excess capacity and 
on the logistics side? Thanks.
 
Dave Fildes
 
Yeah 

terms of how we think about the capacity we might have for our own, I think 
you know 

 

party carriers across the coun
tries where we operate.
 

internal volume using AMZL or Amazon Logistics, but also continue to grow 
our 3P volumes with carriers, transporters around the world. But our focus is 
really o


medium
-
sized businesses in the 3P realm, but also the first party items that 
we are receiving orders from cust

those things quickly and reliably.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our final question will come from Justin Post with Bank of 
America/Merrill Lynch. Please proceed.
 
Justin Post
 

re. Just wondering back on 

overall online sales in the quarter, anything specific to Amazon?
 
And then secondly, just thinking about the regulatory environment. I wonder 
if you could
 
just comment on the opportunities and the competitiveness for 
third
-
party sellers. Are there other platforms that you see for them and how 
do you think about their profitability on Amazon, if you can comment on that 
at all? Thank you.
 
Brian Olsavsky
 
Sure,
 
yeah. On third party I would say we only succeed if the third party 

are constantly investing on their behalf, adding new products and features 
and you know we are cognizant of th
eir economics as well and we want a 
business that works for both of us and we set our fees accordingly.
 


 

Day, the increase in One Day sellers have participated, and not as much as 
an

sellers as well as, particularly in our FBA program.
 
On the holiday season question, we are not anticipating that the move of 
you know the shorter time period between Thanksgiving and yo
u know 
Christmas Day is going to be that impactful. What we found in the past is 
that there is generally a holiday budget that is spent somewhere between 
November 15 and 
-
 
November 1 maybe and December 25, and well certainly 
Black Friday and Cyber Monday a
re important dates in that holiday period.
 
You know there is 
-
 
the purchase tend to move around. Some have been 
moving early in the quarter, some of them moving later in the quarter as 
customers can count on and receive very quick shipments at the end and 


 
Dave Fildes

of the quarter. We appreciate your interest in Amazon and look forward to 
talking with you again next quarter.

-
only 
mode. After the presentation, we will conduct a question
-
and
-
answer 
session. Today's call is 
being recorded. For opening remarks, I will be 
turning the call over to the Director of Investor Relations, Phil Hardin. Please 
go ahead.
 
Phil Hardin

Director, Investor Relations
 
Hello and welcome to our Q3 2015 financial results conference call. Joining
 
us today is Brian Olsavsky, our CFO. We will be available for questions after 
our prepared remarks.
 
The following discussion and responses to your questions reflect 
management's view as of today, October 22, 2015 only, and will include 
forward
-
looking sta
tements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional 
information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is 
included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our 
most recent annual report on Form 10
-
K.
 
As you listen to today's conference 
call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which 
includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the 
quarter.
 
During this call, we will discuss certain non
-
GAAP financial measu
res. In our 
press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the 
SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional 
disclosures regarding these non
-
GAAP measures, including reconciliations of 
these measures with co
mparable GAAP measures. Finally, unless otherwise 
stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the 
comparable period of 2014.
 
Now, I'll turn the call over to Brian.
 
Brian T. Olsavsky

Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Offic

Thanks, Phil. I'll begin with comments on our third quarter financial results. 
Trailing 12
-
month operating cash flow increased 72% to $9.8 billion. Trailing 
12
-
month free cash flow increased to $5.4 billion, up from $1.1 billion. 
Trailing 12 months free
 
cash flow, less lease principal repayments was $3.1 
billion, up from an outflow of $99 million. Trailing 12 months free cash flow 
less finance lease principal repayments and capital acquired under capital 
leases was $637 million, up from an outflow of $2.
3 billion.
 
Trailing 12
-
month capital expenditures were $4.4 billion. Capital 
expenditures does not include the impact of property and equipment 
acquired under capital and finance lease obligations. These capital 
expenditures and capital leases reflect addi
tional investments in support of 
continued business growth due to investments in technology infrastructure, 
the majority of which is to support AWS and additional capacity to support 
our fulfillment operations.
 
The combination of common stock and stock
-
bas
ed awards outstanding was 
489 million shares compared with 481 million one year ago. Worldwide 
revenue grew 23% to $25.4 billion, or 30% excluding the $1.3 billion 
unfavorable impact from year
-
over
-
year changes in foreign exchange.
 
Worldwide paid unit grow
th was 26%. Worldwide active customer accounts 
was approximately 294 million. Excluding customers who only had free 
orders in the preceding 12
-
month period, worldwide active customers were 
approximately 272 million, up from approximately 244 million in the
 
comparable prior
-
year period. Worldwide seller units represented 46% of 
paid units, up from 42% in the comparable prior
-
year period.
 
Now, I'll discuss operating expenses, excluding stock
-
based compensation. 
Cost of sales was $16.8 billion or 66.1% of reve
nue, compared with 71.1%. 
Fulfillment, marketing, technology and content, and G&A combined was $7.6 
billion, or 30.1% of sales, up approximately 50 basis points year
-
over
-
year. 
Fulfillment was $3.1 billion or 12.3% of revenue, compared with 12.4%. 
Tech and
 
content was $2.9 billion or 11.4% of revenue, compared with 
10.8%. Marketing was $1.2 billion or 4.8% of revenue, compared with 
4.7%.
 
Now, I'll talk about our segment results. As a reminder, in the first quarter, 
we changed our reportable segments to repo
rt North America, International 
and Amazon Web Services. Consistent with prior periods, we do not allocate 
to segments our stock
-
based compensation or the other operating expense 
line item.
 
In the North America segment, revenue grew 28% to $15 billion, or 
29% 
excluding foreign exchange. Media revenue grew 8% to $3 billion, or 9% 
excluding foreign exchange. EGM revenue grew 35% to $11.8 billion. EGM 
now represents 79% of North America revenues. North America segment 
operating income was $528 million, a 3.5% 
operating margin, compared to a 
loss of $60 million in the prior
-
year period. North America segment 
operating income includes $11 million of favorable impact from foreign 
exchange.
 
In the International segment, revenue increased 7% to $8.3 billion. 
Excludi
ng the $1.3 billion year
-
over
-
year unfavorable foreign exchange 
impact, revenue growth was 24%. Media revenue decreased 8% to $2.3 
billion, or increased 6% excluding foreign exchange. EGM revenue grew 14% 
to $5.9 billion, or 32% excluding foreign exchange.
 
EGM now represents 
71% of International revenues. International segment operating loss was 
$56 million compared to a loss of $174 million in the prior
-
year period. 
International segment operating loss includes $64 million of unfavorable 
impact from foreig
n exchange.
 
In the Amazon Web Services segment, revenue grew 78% to $2.1 billion. 
Amazon Web Services segment operating income was $521 million, a 25% 
operating margin, compared to $98 million in the prior
-
year period. AWS 
segment operating income includes
 
$78 million of favorable impact from 
foreign exchange.
 
Consolidated segment operating income was $993 million or 3.9% of 
revenue, up approximately 460 basis points year
-
over
-
year. CSOI includes 
$25 million of favorable impact from foreign exchange. Unlike
 
CSOI, our 
GAAP operating income includes stock
-
based compensation expense and 
other operating expense. GAAP operating income was $406 million, 
compared to a loss of $544 million in the prior
-
year period.
 
Our income tax expense was $161 million. GAAP net i
ncome was $79 million 
or $0.17 per diluted share compared to the net loss of $437 million or a loss 
of $0.95 per diluted share.
 
Turning to the balance sheet, cash and marketable securities increased $7.5 
billion year
-
over
-
year to $14.4 billion. Inventory i
ncreased 23% to $9 billion, 
and inventory turns were 8.6, down from 8.9 turns a year ago as we 
expanded selection, improved in
-
stock levels and introduced new product 
categories. Accounts payable increased 22% to $14.4 billion, and accounts 
payable days in
creased to 79 from 74 in the prior year.
 
I'll conclude my portion of today's call with guidance. Incorporated into our 
guidance are the order trends we've seen to date and what we believe today 
to be appropriately conservative assumptions. Our results are 
inherently 
unpredictable, and may be materially affected by many factors, including a 
high level of uncertainty surrounding exchange rate fluctuations as well as a 
global economy and customer spending. It's not possible to accurately 
predict demand, and th
erefore, our actual results could differ materially from 
our guidance.
 
As we've described in more detail on our public filings, issues such as 
settling intercompany balances in foreign currencies among our subsidiaries, 
unfavorable resolution of legal matt
ers and changes to our effective tax rate 
can all have material effects on guidance. Our guidance further assumes that 
we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, 
restructurings or legal settlements, record any further revisions to
 
stock
-
based compensation estimates, and that foreign exchange rates remain 
approximately where they've been recently.
 
For Q4 2015, we expect net sales of between $33.5 billion and $36.75 
billion, or growth of between 14% and 25%. This guidance anticipates
 
approximately 340 basis points of unfavorable impact from foreign exchange 
rates, GAAP operating income to be between $80 million and $1.28 billion 
compared to $591 million in the fourth quarter of 2014. This includes 
approximately $620 million for stock
-
based compensation and amortization 
of intangible assets.
 
We anticipate consolidated segment operating income, which excludes stock
-
based compensation and other operating expense to be between $700 
million and $1.9 billion compared to $1.04 billion in the 
fourth quarter 2014.
 
We remain heads down, focused on driving a better customer experience 
through price, selection and convenience. We believe putting customers first 
is the only reliable way to create lasting value for shareholders.
 
Thanks. And with that
, Phil, let's move on to questions.
 
Phil Hardin 
-
 
Director, Investor Relations
 
Great. Thanks, Brian. Let's move on to the Q&A portion of the call. Operator, 
will you please remind our listeners how to initiate a question?
 
Question
-
and
-
Answer Session
 
Operator
 
Certainly. At this time, we will now open the call up for questions. Our first 
question comes from Scott Devitt with Stifel Nicolaus. Please proceed. Your 
line is live.
 
Scott W. Devitt 
-
 
Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.
 
Hi.
 
Thanks for taking my questions. The first question, Brian, International 
retail growth continues to improve, and I was wondering if you can just talk 
through some of the dynamics there, understanding that consumption tax in 
Japan comped, you have some new
er markets where you have physical 
infrastructure now in Europe, and then also the dynamics in India and China 
as contributors.
 
And then secondly, maybe if you could just, given how profitable AWS has 
become, if you could give a framework for thinking abou
t the long
-
term 
profitability of that business. Thank you.
 
Brian T. Olsavsky 
-
 
Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
 
Sure, Scott. Thanks for your questions. On the International, yes, you're 
right. First of all, the FX neutral growth of 24% yea
r
-
over
-
year was up 200 
basis points versus Q2 and up 1,100 basis points year
-
over
-
year. Some of 
that is due to the comping of the JP consumption tax increase in April of last 
year, which we said last year impacted Q2 and Q3 and not really impacted 
Q4. So w
e're seeing the last of that on the comp. And the impact of Prime 
Day globally we estimated at about 200 basis points, and we saw a pickup in 
both. I'll remind you that Prime Day was a global event, so we saw that is 
International as well, and it was a gre
at event for 

 
a great day for 
customers, Amazon and sellers alike.
 
But the base International growth is really being driven by Prime adoption, 
greater selection, greater Prime selection, including FBA. So it's essentially 
the same playbook at the U.S., th
e additional Prime features. We launched a 
Prime Now location in the UK this quarter. Not materially going to impact the 
entire continent, but it's a good start. So we like the trends in International, 
and they mirror many of the same things we see in Nort
h America.
 
On AWS, I don't remember your question, business model there. Yeah, let 
me talk about margin. It was up sequentially from Q2, from 21.4% to 25%. 
We're continuing to see great acceleration in the pace of innovation. We've 
launched 530 new signifi
cant features this year, which is more than last year 
already. We continue to lower prices. We've lowered prices eight times since 
a rather large price cut in April of 2014, excuse me, April of 2014. And we 
like that the customers are really responding. Th
ey like the speed and agility 
that AWS provides them. They like the new features that we launched, many 
of which are also enable them to lower their cost of infrastructure. Amazon 
Aurora, one
-
tenth the price of other high
-
end commercial databases, a new 
st
orage class of Amazon S3, QuickSight, also very effective and cost
-
effective products for our customers.
 
So like AWS, the model remains early days and we enjoy leading this 
business and customers responded well and we believe we are adding new 
services and
 
features at a rate faster than many others. But the growth 
rates and margins will certainly remain lumpy and bumpy as we go forward. 
But we're very encouraged by the business, and so are our customers.
 
Operator
 
Our next question comes from Mark May with C
iti. Please proceed. Your line 
is live.
 
Mark A. May

Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)
 
Hello? Can you hear me?
 
Brian T. Olsavsky 
-
 
Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
 
Yes.
 
Mark A. May 
-
 
Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)
 
Okay. Tha
nks. A question hopefully hasn't been asked already is around 
AWS. Margins were obviously quite strong in the quarter. Can you speak to 
the sustainability of the margin improvement that we've seen there, and 
what is your long
-
term expectations for profit m
argins for this business? And 
if you could give us a sense of what CapEx for this segment of the business 
looked like in the quarter, and the rate of growth there would be helpful.
 
And then secondly, your employee adds were fairly strong in the quarter as 
well. I wonder if you could call out any particular areas of 

 
within the 
business where you're strengthening your hiring efforts. Thanks.
 
Phil Hardin 
-
 
Director, Investor Relations
 
So this is Phil. I'll take the AWS portion. So I'll echo what Brian said e
arlier. 
This is a young and rapidly growing business, and as you've seen looking 
backwards, certainly growth rates and margins and capital expenditure 
timing can be bumpy. We're taking a very long
-
term view on this business. 
We're excited about the potenti
al there, and really the team's focused on 
just keeping their heads down and continuing to accelerate the pace of 
innovation to try to continue to grow the functionality gap we think we offer. 
So a lot of hard work going on there. But again, we're taking a
 
long
-
term 
view on the business and interested in helping customers as much as 
possible in that space.
 
On the CapEx, again, we're focused on the ability to drive efficiencies across 
all of Amazon, but we're also certainly investing in growth. And so, on th
e 
AWS side, we've got investment going on around the world, certainly 
additional servers to support the strong growth we have. And some of the 
expense for things like data centers or new regions can be a little lumpy, 
and we've mentioned a couple of new re
gions we're working on throughout 
the world. So that's going on as well.
 
Brian T. Olsavsky 
-
 
Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
 
Mark, on your head count question, you're right. Headcount was up 49% 
year
-
over
-
year, which is higher than Q2 

 
w
e saw in Q2. This is going to be 
primarily in our ops area. If you exclude ops
-
related employees, our head 
count's growing actually slower than our FX neutral growth rate of 30%. So, 
what's going on in ops is we've added 14 net fulfillment centers this yea
r, 
bringing the total to 123 globally. We've added four sort centers in the U.S., 
bringing U.S. footprint to 23. We're staffing earlier in those locations, we're 
in good shape for the holidays and ready to go.
 
The other issue is there, the other reason is 
that we are also doing a lot of 
conversion of temp workers to full
-
time workers purposefully. There is a 
metric employment of full
-
time hires. So it is a little bit higher due to that 
program.
 
Operator
 
Our next question comes from Mark Mahaney with RBC Cap
ital Markets.
 
Mark S. Mahaney 
-
 
RBC Capital Markets LLC
 
I'm tempted to ask about the long
-
term margins for AWS, but I won't. Could 
you talk about two areas? One, EGM growth in North America. It's 
accelerated really strongly. Any color behind what's 

 
any particular 
categories that are driving that? And secondly, you've made some public 
comments in the last eight months about some, on the retail side, about 
investments internationally, particularly in India. Could you just refresh us 
on what kind of lev
els of spend you're interested in targeting in that market, 
and then maybe as part of that, any comments on China and how well you 
think you're doing there now. Thanks a lot.
 
Brian T. Olsavsky 
-
 
Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
 
Sure. On EG
M growth, I won't call out any particular categories, but it is a 
direct reflection of our efforts to grow selection, both our retail selection and 
also our third party, particularly FBA which is also Prime eligible and then 
just the responsiveness of our 
customers, especially our Prime customers to 
the EGM product line. So, we're very encouraged with EGM growth.
 
And on India, I will not 

 
excuse me 

 
I won't give specific dollar numbers 
around investment, but I can give you an update on India. We're really
 
encouraged with what we are seeing, both on the customer side and the 
seller side. On the customer side 

 
excuse me, active customer accounts are 
up 230% year
-
over
-
year. We are in the middle of the Diwali season that is 
going really well. Sales are 4x wha
t they were last year. So customers are 
responding greatly this year. We continue to invest. We've been adding 
products at a rate of 40,000 products per day so far this year. And just as 
big as the number of sellers, the sellers, the number of sellers has 
grown 
more than 250% year
-
over

Mark, I think you asked about China as well, this is Phil. So we're continuing 
to work on some of the items we've been talking about for a couple of 
quarters now. So the team had some inte
resting ideas, really focused on 
making Amazon a trusted conduit for Chinese customers to access, authentic 
international branded products, and things that customers can't get. I think 
Amazon Global Store continues to expand the selection there. We added 
a
bout another 400,000 items to that store this quarter and continue to focus 
on using our global network of vendors to be able to get those products to 
customers. We continue to test store on Tmall as well. The team has some 
other ideas, but that's what we'
re talking about so far.

Thanks for taking the question. Can you call out in terms of the 3P business 
what you're seeing in terms of thi
rd party sellers maybe needing to make 
more and more of their goods Prime eligible? What the economics of that 
might be in terms of creating a tailwind for the business, and how we should 
think about that evolving over the next couple of years. Thanks.
 
Bri
an T. Olsavsky

Sure, Eric. What I can tell you is the 3P percent of revenue continues to 
grow, we are now up to 46% of paid units, which is up 400 basis points 
year
-
over
-
year, and 100 basis points sequent
ially of Q2. We feel that Prime 
and FBA are 

 
reinforce each other. They're inextricably linked. FBA as Prime 
selection and Prime growth attracts more FBA sellers. So, we have seen 
growth in FBA, it increases our Prime fast track eligible selection which w
e 
like and customers like. So, we like what we see on the third party side.

This is Phil. So it's still pretty early for a lot of the really expedited delivery 
options. We've been working on our network for about 20 years to be able to 
enable some of the really 
fast delivery with things like Prime Now. But at this 
point, we're in a relatively small list of cities, but it's expanding pretty fast. I 
think we launched a couple more Prime Now cities just today, so that brings 
us up to about 17 across the globe. On th
e next day or same day, here in 
the U.S., we continue to expand that as well, but we think that those fast 
options add us to the consideration set of a customer's purchase on some 
purchases that we might not otherwise be included in. But at this point, 
we'
re still working on that and kind of getting it up to speed. So nothing 
specific to call out on that.
 
On the other part of your question, we continue to work on the network 
around the world, but I can't respond to any of the rumors and speculation.

Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to ask the most frequent 
investor question and concern that we get is when will Amazon flip back t
o 
its heavier spending and investment ways from 2014 and earlier? So I just 
wanted to ask, is that a legitimate question do you think or are you now at a 
point of scale and market share and maturity that you can sustainably 
manage the heavy investment whil
e still delivering material profit? Thanks.
 
Brian T. Olsavsky 
-
 
Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
 
Yeah, thanks, Doug. Well, I will point out that this quarter showed a lot of 
innovation, a lot of new products and features and a lot of inves
tment. 
We've already talked about India but domestically we are, globally, we are 
investing very heavily in our Prime platform, both in North America and 
International and that includes video content and original content, Prime 
Music. Phil just said the Pr
ime Now has been expanded to 14 metro areas. 
We've had same
-
day delivery now in 16 metro areas. We've built 14 new 
fulfillment centers. We've launched multiple devices including e
-
readers, 
tablets that are priced under $50, Echo, Dash Button.
 
So there is a
 
lot of investment going on and there will be continued, 
especially related to Prime. And on the AWS side, as I said, we have 530 
new features so far this year. So innovation and investment will continue 
and can be lumpy. I hate to use that word again, but
 
could be lumpy over 
time. The other dynamic in our company though is definitely working on cost 
reductions and efficiency. And I think you see a lot of that in this quarter's 
P&L and in our capital efficiency, both in the warehouse world and also in 
infra
structure. So we will continue to work on costs. The good thing about 
30% revenue growth is it gives you a lot more cost to work on as well.
 
So I would say it's not as much of pendulum as maybe it's been portrayed. 
It's more of a constant. The investment w
ill, it sometimes ebbs and flows, 
but the cost reductions will be a constant presence and the increase in 
customer experience and shortening the time to delivery and making the 
customer experience better.

Thanks for taking my questions. You guys have had the Kindle Store in 
Brazil since December of 2012. Just curious about the learnings around that 
and kind of what benchmarks are you analyzing as yo
u kind of try to 
determine whether or not to invest further in a larger Brazil store?
 
And then the second one, just curious for comments on International Prime 
sub growth. It sounds like Prime subs are growing really well. I think a 
couple of quarters ago,
 
you mentioned how they're growing over 50%. Is 
that still the case? And if so, what's driving that faster International Prime 
sub
-
growth?
 
Phil Hardin

Director, Investor Relations
 
So, on the Brazil side 

 
this is Phil 

 
we've had the Kindle Store in Braz
il for 
a while. I think we look at all of our investments with an eye towards trying 
to maximize long
-
term free cash flow at strong returns on invested capital. 
So that's across the board. That's kind of the criteria we're using, making 
sure we're building
 
things that customers love that can have attractive 
financial returns over time, and can persist for a long time. And if they work, 
can be big. And so, that's the metrics we're using. There's nothing specific to 
call out to Brazil though.
 
Brian T. Olsavsk

Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
 
And this is Brian. We're not going to update our Prime subscription growth 
beyond what we said last year at the end of last year, which last year in a 
year when we raised prices early in 2014. The globa
l growth rate was 53% 
and North America growth rate was 50%. So, by default, the International 
growth rate was higher.
 
We like the adoption of Prime internationally. It's helped by additional 
selection that's available for fast track shipment, including FB
A. So that 
flywheel is working. We've also launched video benefits most recently in 
Japan, but we have them in the U.K. and Germany. We continue to launch 
other Prime benefits, Amazon Pantry in Japan and Germany this quarter. We 
launch Prime Now in the U.K
. So, it's very similar to the U.S. story, 
potentially time lagged a bit, but we are seeing the same customer adoption 
and impact on growth rates.

Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC
 
Thank you. I have two questions. So you have told us that you have tens of 
millions of Prime users that you are investing heavily in Prime. Now, at this 
scale I know with the 50% plus growth rates that you just mentioned, i
f you 
roll the clock two or three years, one can see Prime penetration in markets 
like the U.S. starting to saturate as there are just so many homes in the 
country. How should we think about the level of investment in Prime once 
you have reached full penet
ration? Are there components that are due 
primarily to customer acquisition, and what's the right way to think about 
that?
 
And secondly, what are the economic drivers that justify the business case 
for Prime Now? I don't expect you to give us any numbers, 
I've learned that 
in the last few years. But what are the components of the customer lifecycle 
value calculation or whatever calculation that you make to justify someone 
dropping a box with a, I don't know, $15 order to a customer? Thank you.
 
Brian T. Olsa
vsky 
-
 
Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
 
Sure. Thank you, Carlos. First on, classify as Prime demographics. So yes, 
we still think there's a lot of people in the country who are not Prime 
members. And we're anxious to have them try it and s
ign up and join. The 
other thing that we see is that with our vast offering of selection and faster 
and faster shipping programs, we have more competitive offering for many 
things that they buy. So there's a share of wallet element to it as well over 
time 
that we are looking to be more useful to customers all the time.
 
On your comment about the economic drivers of Prime Now, what I'll say is 
customers really value it. It's not our entire selection, it's tens of thousands 
of items that they may need on a dai
ly basis. We think it's an interesting 
part of the selection offer for Prime and it's, in many ways, something that 
we can do that others can't, because it's a natural evolution of our 20

effort to grow our fulfillment center network and our scale qui

makes it possible to even offer this to customers.

Great. Thanks, guys. Can you talk a little bit more about India and 
what's 
kind of the opportunity there that you see, there's a tremendous amount of 

 
tremendous middle class there. But the distribution can be very 
challenging. So is that an area where we could see Amazon really building 
out the last mile? And then there'
s been some reports of an Amazon 
potentially trying to close the gap in terms of delivery and deliver sooner. On

I'll take the India question. So again, India is a different market and does 
not have a lot of the same ready fulfillment options that some other 
countries did. We se
e that as an opportunity, an opportunity that we can 
build and we can bring to sellers. And as I believe I already mentioned, we

n
umber of

Emmys this year. So we're really excited about the creative team we'v
e

Hey, guys. So Prime has done remarkably well with folks willing to pay $99 
up front. But do you expect to have different offerings for different cohorts? 
In other words, right now, Prime is sort of a one

size
-
fits
-
all model. Could 
we see different 
pricing models for different demographics in the future? And 
then separately, can you also talk about how shipping leverage changes 
during the holiday season when shoppers tend to order more items per 
transaction? Thanks.
 
Phil Hardin

Director,

Sure. So this is Phil. On the Prime pricing, we do have a few different 
programs for different demographics today with programs like Prime Student 
or Prime Family, which we're very excited about. Can't speculate as to what 
we'd do in the
 
future, but Prime is a program that's really important for us, 
and we're working hard every day to continue to build selection there and to 
continue to make Prime better. And so hopefully, you see that in the list of 
things we've launched recently and the
 
continued cadence of making the 
services we have better. We just added a lot of new music in our Prime 
Music program. And as Brian mentioned, some of the upcoming 
programming should be pretty good in the fall. The Man in the High Castle 
was actually our m
ost
-
watched pilot, so we're excited about that one as well. 
So continuing to work on Prime.
 
On the shipping side, I would say it's a difficult equation. Yes, order size can 
go up, but we ship a lot of toys and bigger items. So it's hard to predict what 
tha
t looks like. But having the density, having the sort centers has certainly 
helped our cost structure in that area and having inventory closer to our 
customers.

Okay. Thanks. So Brian, it seems like you guys are rolling out Prime Now as

place different processes to iterate more quickly?
 
And second, I think you've disclosed that as of the end of 2014, a little less
 
than 10% of your fulfillment centers are outfitted with Kiva. So I guess are 
all of your other fulfillment centers on a go
-
forward basis going to have 
Kiva? If not, why not? And given the pickup and presumably the volume 
throughput there, does this mean y
ou can slow down the pacing of your 
build
-
out there? Thanks.
 
Brian T. Olsavsky

Yeah, sure. On Prime Now, it is our intent to roll out benefits and

're able to do that with 
Prime Now and get to the UK faster. We're happy with that. It's not 
necessarily common on AmazonFresh. They're just, they're different 
businesses. So we're happy with the launch in the UK and the team did a 
great job to get that la
unch in a timely manner. On Kiva, we are up to 
30,000 bots at the end of Q3, and they're in 13 fulfillment centers. At the

Great. Thanks for taking the question. Just real quickly on paid unit growth, 
accelerated 26% this year. I realize it's easier comp

significantly higher or anything that happened this quarter? I know Prime 
Day could be it, but wondering if that was the reason. And then on AWS

usage was growing faster than revenue. I wonder if 
that's the same case this quarter. Thank you.

So this is Phil. On the unit side, you did see units move at a rate that's

p in mind, AWS and some of the 
other rental

type offerings don't generate units, so we don't count those. But 
we did see, certainly saw some additional units as a result of Prime Day. And 
on a longer

ntinued 
selection expansion, is helping with the unit's growth there. Sorry, was there 
a second part of your question?

happy with Kiva. We thi
nk it's a great, pairing our associates with Kiva

Hi, great. Thanks. Two questions. So first, our data suggest that a U.S. 
Prime sub growth is growing very rapidly at scale. Just wonder
ing where you 
think the U.S. Prime sub base is right now on the adoption curve.
 
And then the second question is North America and EGM growth accelerating 
again this quarter. We're assuming growth is being driven in part by 
categories like apparel and consu
mables versus perhaps some more mature 
category like electronics. So the questions are, with a vertical mix changing, 
how should we think about the impact of margins or some of the newer and 
faster growing categories, structurally higher margins for Amazon
 
than the 
more mature categories? Thank you.

different product lines and working with vendors to get more selection on 
site, both retail and also third party. So still a lot of room there. On the 
Prime sub growth, we're not
 
updating the statistics. We are very happy with

Director, Investor Relations
 
Hello. And welcome to our Q2 2015 f
inancial results conference call. Joining 
us today is Brian Olsavsky, our CFO who will be available for questions after 
our prepared remarks. The following discussion and responses to your 
questions reflect management's views as of today, July 23, 2015 onl
y and 
will include forward
-
looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. 
Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our 
financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the 
SEC including our mo
st recent annual report on Form 10
-
K.
 
As you listen to today's conference call we encourage you to have our press 
release in front of you which includes our financial results as well as metrics 
and commentary on the quarter. During this call we will discus
s certain non
-
GAAP financial measures. In our press release slides accompanying this 
webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR 
website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non
-
GAAP 
measures, including reconcil
iations of these measures with comparable GAAP 
measures. Finally unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be 
against our results for the comparable period of 2014.
 
Now I'll turn the call over to Brian.
 
Brian T. Olsavsky

Senior Vice Pres
ident and Chief Financial Officer
 
Thanks, Phil. I will begin comments on our second
-
quarter financial results. 
Trailing 12
-
month operating cash flow increased 69% to $8.98 billion. 
Trailing 12
-
month free cash flow increased to $4.37 billion up from $1.04 
b
illion. In the supplemental financial information and business metrics 
portion of our earnings release, we include a few additional free cash flow 
measures. We believe these measures provide additional perspective on the 
impact of acquiring property and eq
uipment with cash and through capital 
and finance releases.
 
Trailing 12
-
month capital expenditures were $4.61 billion. Capital 
expenditures do not include the impact of property and equipment acquired 
under capital and finance lease obligations. The increa
se in capital 
expenditures and capital leases reflects additional investments in support of 
continued business growth due to investments in technology infrastructure, 
the majority of which is to support AWS and additional capacity to support 
our fulfillmen
t operations.
 
Return on invested capital was 17% up from 6%. ROIC is trailing 12 month 
free cash flow divided by average total assets minus current liabilities 
excluding the current portion of long
-
term debt over five quarter
-
ends. 
Combination of common st
ock and stock
-
based awards outstanding was 488 
million shares compared with 480 million one year ago. Worldwide revenue 
grew 20% to $23.18 billion, or 27% excluding the $1.39 billion unfavorable 
impact from year
-
over
-
year changes in foreign
-
exchange.
 
World
wide paid unit growth was 22%. Worldwide active customer accounts 
was approximately 285 million. Excluding customers who only had three 
orders in the preceding 12 month period worldwide active customers were 
approximately 265 million up from approximately 
237 million in the 
comparable prior year period. Worldwide seller units represented 45% of 
paid units, up from 41% in the comparable prior year period.
 
Now I will discuss operating expenses excluding stock
-
based compensation. 
Cost of sales was $15.16 billi
on or 65.4% of revenue compared with 69.3%. 
Fulfillment, marketing, technology and content and G&A combined was 
$6.95 billion or 29.9% of sales, up approximately 130 basis points year
-
over
-
year.
 
Fulfillment was $2.74 billion or 11.8% of revenue compared wi
th 11.8%. 
Tech and content was $2.70 billion or 11.7% of revenue compared with 
10.4%. Marketing was $1.1 billion or 4.7% of revenue compared with 4.7%.
 
Now I'll talk about our segment results. As a reminder, in the first quarter 
we changed our reportable s
egments to report North America, International, 
and Amazon Web Services. Consistent with prior periods we do not allocate 
two segments, our stock
-
based compensation, or the other operating 
expense line item.
 
In the North America segment, revenue grew 26% t
o $13.8 billion. Media 
revenue grew 6% to $2.62 billion or 7% excluding foreign
-
exchange. EGM 
revenue grew 31% to $10.99 billion or 32% excluding foreign
-
exchange. 
EGM now represents 80% of North America revenues. North America 
segment operating income inc
reased 113% to $703 million a 5.1% operating 
margin. Excluding the $9 million favorable impact from foreign
-
exchange, 
North America segment operating income increased 111%.
 
In the International segment revenue increased 3% to $7.56 billion. 
Excluding the $
1.37 billion year
-
over
-
year unfavorable impact from foreign
-
exchange, revenue growth was 22%. Media revenue decreased 12% to 
$2.09 billion or increased 3% excluding foreign
-
exchange. EGM revenue 
grew 10% to $5.43 billion or 31% excluding foreign
-
exchange. 
EGM now 
represents 72% of International revenues. International segment operating 
loss was $19 million compared to a loss of $2 million in the prior year 
period. International segment operating loss includes $89 million of 
unfavorable impact from foreign
-
e
xchange.
 
In the Amazon Web Services segment revenue increased 81% to $1.82 
billion. Amazon Web Services segment operating income increased 407% to 
$391 million, a 21.4% operating margin. Excluding the $71 million favorable 
impact from foreign
-
exchange, AWS
 
segment operating income increased 
314%. Consolidated segment operating income increased 166% to $1.07 
billion or 4.6% of revenue, up approximately 250 basis points year
-
over
-
year. Excluding the $9 million unfavorable impact from foreign
-
exchange, 
CSOI in
creased 168%.
 
Unlike CSOI, our GAAP operating income include stock
-
based compensation 
expense and other operating expense. GAAP Operating income was $464 
million compared to a loss of $15 million in the prior year period. Our income 
tax expense was $266 mi
llion. GAAP net income was $92 million or $0.19 
per diluted share, compared with a net loss of $126 million or a loss of $0.27 
per diluted share.
 
Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and marketable securities increased 
$6.02 billion year
-
over
-
year to $14 bil
lion. Inventory increased 12% to 
$7.47 billion and inventory turns were 8.9 turns down from 9.1 turns a year 
ago as we expanded selection, improved in
-
stock levels and introduced new 
product categories.
 
Accounts payable increased 18% to $12.39 billion and 
accounts payable 
days increased to 74 from 71 in the prior year. I'll conclude my portion of 
today's call with guidance. Incorporated into our guidance are the order 
trends we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriately 
conservative assum
ptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may 
be materially affected by many factors including a high level of uncertainty 
surrounding exchange rate fluctuations as well as the global economy and 
customer spending. It's not possible to accuratel
y predict demand and 
therefore our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.
 
As we describe in more detail in our public filings issues such as settling 
inter
-
company balances in foreign currencies among our subsidiaries, 
unfavorable resolu
tion of legal matters, and changes to effective tax rate can 
all have a material effect on guidance. Our guidance further assumes that 
we don't include additional business acquisitions, investments, 
restructurings, or legal settlements, record any further 
revisions to stock
-
based compensation estimates and if foreign
-
exchange rates remain 
approximately where they've been recently.
 
For Q3 2015 we expect net sales of between $23.3 billion and $25.5 billion, 
or growth of between 13% and 24%. This guidance anti
cipates 
approximately 620 basis points of unfavorable impact from foreign
-
exchange 
rates, GAAP operating income or loss to be between $480 million loss and 
$70 million of income compared to a $544 million loss in the third quarter of 
2014.
 
This includes ap
proximately $580 million for stock
-
based compensation and 
amortization of intangible assets. We anticipate consolidated segment 
operating income, which excludes stock
-
based compensation and other 
operating expense to be between $100 million and $650 millio
n, compared 
to a $136 million loss in the third quarter of 2014. We remain heads
-
down 
focused on driving a better customer experience through price, selection, 
and convenience. We believe putting customers first is the only reliable way 
to create lasting v
alue for shareholders.
 
Thanks. And with that, Phil, let's move on to questions.

Director, Investor Relations
 
Great. Thanks, Brian. Let's move on to the Q&A portion of the call. Operator, 
will you please remind our listeners how to initiate a 
question.
 
Question

Certainly. Our first question comes from Mark May with Citi. Please proceed. 
Your line is live.

Thanks for taking my questions. You clearly had a lot of things working well 
in the quarter, but maybe just focusing in on AWS, which seems to be 
quickly emerging as kid of your largest contributor to operating income. Can 
you maybe provide a little more c
olor on what drove the acceleration and 
just the overall growth in the business? If you could talk a little bit about the 
addition of new customers versus average spend per customer and I think in 
the past you've talked about what unit growth was for AWS? 
And in the 
press release you talked about expanding AWS into some new International 
markets. Can you give us a feel for how much of AWS' business today is 
domestic and what kind of opportunity you have there to expand AWS 
outside the U.S.?
 
Brian T. Olsavsk

Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
 
Yes, Mark. Thanks for your question. We will not be providing the granular 
customer detail unfortunately but we will say the growth of 81% was up 
49% in Q1. You remember that we are lapping a number of 
large price 
decreases in Q2 of last year, so it was somewhat expected but a very strong 
quarter in AWS.
 
We did announce a region in India. The other thing to mention is that we 
continue to see very strong usage of growth that's outpacing the revenue 
growth

you've talked 
a little bit about that market in the past

there in terms of how you think about approaching the market and the level 
of investments that might be needed to compete in the market? Thank y

Certainly Eric. What I can say about India is when we see a positive surprise 
we double down on it. That's kind of our policy, and India is that kind of 
surprise. So we're very happy
, very encouraged early on with what we've 
seen in the ramping of the business, the level of invention going on for both 
customers and sellers. We are over $25 million or excuse me, 25 million 
names (14:02) which is the largest online store in India. And w
e continue to 
improve pricing and fast delivery so were super excited about India. I will 
not get into specific investment levels right now but we continue to ramp up 
our investment there.

Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.
 
Thank you. A couple of questions here. We followed this coming for a long 
time and profits seem to move around quite a bit year
-
over
-
year and
 
year 
against year. And just wondering how you think about that? Is that just the 
nature of your big bets and that's just going to continue or is there a way to 
kind of smooth that out?
 
And then secondly, in AWS it does seem like pricing competition has co
me 
down and we've been to a lot of your events and it seems like you're 
emphasizing pricing a little less to your customers. Can you talk at all about 
the pricing environment in cloud? Thank you.
 
Brian T. Olsavsky

Senior Vice President and Chief Financia
l Officer
 
Sure, let me start with that second question. So, as Phil mentioned, we are 
seeing continued increases in usage, both sequentially and year
-
over
-
year. 
We are also seeing a great efficiency in the business on a cost basis. 
Innovation is accelerati
ng, not decelerating. We had over 350 significant new 
features and services and we believe that's what resonates with customers. 
While pricing is certainly a factor we don't believe it's always the primary 
factor; in fact what we hear from our customers is
 
that the ability to move 
faster and more agiley is what they value. I'm sorry the first party your 
question was?
 
Justin Post

Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.
 
I was asking about just how the profitability kind of really moves pretty big 
swings
 
year
-
over

year? Is that the nature of your just big bets and that can 
continue or is there a way to kind of smooth that out going forward? How do 
you think about that?
 
Brian T. Olsavsky 
-
 
Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
 
Yes sure. Well he
re's how I think about it. We have two things, at least two 
things going on. We are continuing to drive operational improvement in 
every business that we are in, but we are also investing in large 
opportunities that are in front of us, particularly in Mark
etplace Prime and 
AWS. If you saw our shareholder letter this year, I think Jeff Bezos put it 
really well. He said we're going to look for things that are important to 
customers, customers love them, businesses that can grow to be a large size 
that can gen
erate a high return on invested capital and are durable and can 
last for decades. So we will continue to invest in the businesses we think fit 
that profile and we're always looking for a fourth or fifth business that fits 
that profile. So as far as lumpine
ss, admittedly it is lumpy and we will 
continue to work on both those tracks going forward.

RBC Capital Markets LLC
 
Okay. Thanks. I don't know if Tom's listening in. That's a great exit on his 
part. On International retail you guys had nice acceleration there. Could you 
give us a little more of the why behind that? Why would Internation
al 
revenue grow, particularly in EGM, accelerate pretty materially. And is that 
the impact 

 
it's one thesis 

 
is that the impact of kind of the buildup of 
Prime in International markets and also in the U.S. too, but more spend per 
Prime customers as they 
go through this evolution that is just kind of 
layering on? Is that what it is? What is causing that acceleration? Thank you.
 
Brian T. Olsavsky 
-
 
Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
 
Certainly. We saw good acceleration in both North America an
d International 
this quarter. North America was up 200 basis points sequentially and 
International was up 800 basis points and half of that you remember we've 
spoken about the impact of the Japanese consumption tax that was 
instituted last 

 
April 1 of 201
4. It had a measurable impact on our run rate, 
our growth rate last year particularly Q2. And so we are lapping that, which 
sequentially makes up half of the 800 basis points sequential gain.
 
But independent of that, yes, you're right; Prime membership con
tinues to 
grow. Faster outside, data that we gave at the end of the year. It's growing 
faster outside the U.S. than it is in the U.S. and we are happy with both 
growth rates quite frankly. So I would say the Prime membership to Prime 
flywheel, the addition
al benefits we are adding to Prime, not only in North 
America but also Internationally, and additional selection both retail and FBA 
which feeds the Prime flywheel.

Brian Nowak

Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
 
Great. Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. The first one on the 
North America retail profitability was up nicely. Can you just talk to some of 
the drivers of that? Is i
t more top
-
line and more Prime subs coming on or is 
it more on the logistics side and what's driving the North America improving 
profitability? And then on the International profitability, is there any way you 
can help us understand the profitability of th
e more mature International 
markets like U.K. and Germany relative to the U.S. at this point?
 
Brian T. Olsavsky 
-
 
Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
 
Sure. So let me start with North America. 5.1% operating margin was up 
from 3.9% in Q1 and 3
% last Q2. You hit a nail on the head. A lot of it is the 
top
-
line growth, but it's also a lot of the efficiency we're seeing, particularly 
on the fulfillment and marketing lines, which for the whole company were 
flat year
-
over
-
year on a percent of revenue
 
basis. So we are getting very 
good top
-
line growth. A lot of that is fueled by Prime adoption and we are 
dropping a lot of it to the bottom line with many of the efficiency projects.
 
In International we have not split countries out. What I can say is that
 
if you 
adjust for foreign exchange the operating margin is up slightly both 
sequentially and year
-
over
-
year. What you're seeing there is also obviously 
colored by our investment our increased investment in India based on the 
momentum and the success we've
 
been seeing there so far.

Douglas T. Anmuth

JPMorgan Securities LLC
 
Great. Thanks for taking the question. Just two things I 
wanted to ask, First 
on Prime Day. Brian, if you could give a little more color there on the early 
takeaways that you have and then also perhaps more importantly how you 
think that sets Amazon up for the back
-
to
-
school season and then also the 
holidays lat
er in the year? And then also can you just comment on the head 
count, which I believe is up 18,000 or so sequentially, which I believe is the 
biggest number that you've ever added in a quarter. Is there anything in 
particular that stands out there, or just
 
more fulfillment centers, more 
geography expansion as well? Thanks.
 
Brian T. Olsavsky 
-
 
Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
 
Let me start with that second question first. Yes, head count was up 38% 
year
-
over
-
year. The vast majority of that is
 
in operations where we are 
adding people for our new FCs and call centers. We continue to look for 
smart, innovative people who want to build on behalf of customers and 

 
but 
this particular quarter is colored a bit by the operations growth.
 
If you look a
t Prime Day, we're thrilled with the results of Prime Day. It 
surpassed all of our expectations. Any metric we look at, everything was a 
huge success. Customers save millions. New Prime members signed up in 
higher rates than we've ever seen.
 
People bought 
more devices than on any other day. So, it's a great success. 
My hats off to operations team and all the people who worked on that 
because it was Christmas in July quite frankly, a bigger day than Black 
Friday, as we've said and orders increased 266% year
-
over
-
year. I'll also 
point out that worldwide FBA unit growth approached 300%, so not only was 
it a great day for Amazon, it was also a great day for our sellers which is 
great. So while not breaking out the impact of Prime Day specifically, it's 
incorpora
ted into our guidance.

Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC
 
Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. I may be delusional, but if I 
add your capital leases and 
CapEx that suggests that AWS capital intensity is 
at least 80% if not much higher. What gives you confidence that if AWS 
continues to grow so fast and consuming so much capital two years out 
you'll be able to fund its growth from the retail business. And s
econdly, can 
you help me understand why you are not ruling out Prime Now and Fresh 
faster? What specifically are the bottlenecks there? Thank you.
 
Brian T. Olsavsky 
-
 
Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
 
Let me start with that second one. Prim
e Now you said, and Amazon Fresh. 
We are working very quickly on Prime Now. We've now expanded to nine 
cities, three more in the quarter including our first International city in 
London. So, we're moving quick, but we'd always like to move quicker 
obviousl
y. On AWS I think your question was more around the ability to fund 
AWS? No comment specifically on that. We do realize it's a capital
-
intensive 
business and we have modeling that shows it's going to be a very 

 
it is a 
very good business for us and that's
 
what we aim for as long
-
term return on 
invested capital and free cash flow. So, we're certainly cognizant of the 
capital part of the calculation, so not much more I can add on that, Carlos.

Heath P. Terry

Goldman Sachs & Co.
 
Great. Thanks, guys. I'm wondering if you can touch a little bit more on AWS 
margins. Is there a level particularly when you've been a
ble to maintain 
pricing strength the way you have been, where you feel like margins start to 
become and that the leverage you have there start to become a catalyst for 
lowering prices? Or is that purely a competitive decision? And as you think 
about sort o
f AWS longer
-
term, is there a framework or structure that you 
use to think about where margins in that business should be?
 
Brian T. Olsavsky 
-
 
Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
 
Sure. Thanks for your question Heath. I will point out that we 
have 
continued to lower prices. We've had multiple price cuts this year. We are 
now up to 49 since launch in 2006, so it is a fundamental part of our 
business model. So is innovation. As I said, we have over 350 new features 
and services 

 
also significant
 
features and services that have launched this 
year. And as we were just talking with Carlos, the capital investment is very 
large as well, so we continue to fund it. And we are super excited with the 
customer reception that we are getting and the feedback
 
we get from large 
customers so we are thrilled with the business.
 
And price reductions are part of that model. And again, as I said earlier, 
we're in the long haul. We're in this for the long haul. We are looking for 
return on invested capital, free cash 
flow, and happy customers in the space.

Thank you. I 
guess, another question on AWS if I may. So, I want to go 
back to something that you said, Brian. You said that you've seen greater 
efficiency in the business from a cost standpoint. I was wondering if you can 
maybe parse that out a little more for us. Wer
e you referring to OpEx or 
CapEx? And if you're referring to CapEx as well, do you feel you that you 
have reached escape velocity that should allow CapEx as a percentage of 
revenues, pricing aside, to now allow you for a constant decline in that 
metric, Ca
pEx as a percentage of revenue for that that particular business? 
Thanks.
 
Brian T. Olsavsky 
-

What I can tell you is we have seen great efficiency on the cost side, the 
cost to generate the capacity for AWS
. I will also say that Amazon is one of 
the primary large customers of AWS so we see it in the consumer side of the 
business as well, although that's not included in AWS revenue. It's an inter
-
company relationship. So, we get a double whammy there. We are 
getting 
great efficiency from our external AWS business but also from our own use 
of AWS services.

Ron V. Josey

JMP Securi
ties LLC
 
Great. Thanks for taking the question. Just a quick follow
-
up on Heath's 
question, just on the price reductions. Brian, you said earlier in the year, can 
you just compare the reductions earlier this year versus the ones across the 
board and from l
ast year in 2Q 2014? And then a follow up just on the third
-
party units I think you mentioned third
-
party units are now 45% or maybe 
47% of total units. Is there a natural limit there or it doesn't matter as long 
as the customer experience through FBA is s
eamless? Thank you.
 
Brian T. Olsavsky 
-
 
Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
 
Hey Ron. So, I'll comment on the units first. We are really following the 
model of giving our customers as many choices as possible and letting them 
choose 
whether they want to buy first
-
party or third
-
party and I think we're 
working really hard to make sellers succeed on the platform. Brian touched 
on the success that our FDA sellers had with Prime Day, but we see FBA as a 
tailwind for third
-
party business i
n general.
 
When we surveyed those sellers in the past, in 2014 about 71% of sellers 
saw a 20% or greater increase in sales when they entered the FBA program. 
So we are really happy with what that's doing for third
-
party business. We're 
working really hard 
to give customers as many options as possible and 
allowing them to choose. And we don't really have a specific target there. It 
all comes down to customer choice.
 
On the price reduction question, we've got a long track record of driving 
costs out of the bu
siness and you can certainly see where we've even done 
that over the last several quarters if you look at the margins in AWS. We've 
also lowered prices for customers 49 times since launch and so it can be 
lumpy, but over the long haul that's the model we f
ollow.

on how engaged fo

behavior, number one. And number two, just any update on sort of your 
plans for growth on the content cost side? Thank you.
 
Brian T. Olsavsky 
-
 
Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
 
Sure. On th
e engagement of the Prime customers, excuse me PIV 
customers, we have seen buying habits that look like normal Prime 
customers or other Prime customers from the group that comes in through 
the digital pipelines, but we do also see a higher pickup in retent
ion rates 
and free trial conversions. So we're very happy with the linkage between our 
digital offerings in the Prime customer base.
 
On the content side, I will say that one of the factors in the sequential 
guidance Q2 to Q3 being lower, is two things. Wha
t we are talking about is 
the fulfillment center 

 
additional fulfillment center costs that we see this 
time every year as we get ready for Q4 but also additional step
-
up in 
content spend, where we spend a lot of our content in Q3. You will see 
extensions 
of a lot of the successful shows that we've had so far this year. A 
new pilot season including Man in the High Castle and Hand of God so stay

Good afternoon, and congratulations. I just want to follow up on a previous 
question. In past calls you talked about an increased foc
us on productivity. 
Is that still a focus of yours? And separately, any thoughts in terms of how 
robotics are impacting 

 
any updates in terms of number of robots in 
fulfillment centers? Thanks.
 
Brian T. Olsavsky 
-
 
Senior Vice President and Chief Financial
 
Officer
 
Sure thing. Thanks for your questions, Gene. On robotics first, we don't have 
any new numbers to share with you, but we're super excited with the 
progress of that business. We had very high expectations for Amazon 
Robotics and its impact on our wa
rehouse cost structure and we have been 
very pleasantly surprised by the job being done on that by that team. So 
that's looking great.
 
Efficiency, yes. As we've talked about in the last few calls we have even 
more emphasis on variable and fixed productivit
y. I think that's evident in 
the Q2 results that you've just seen. To give you a little more color on that, I 
would say what does that look like? We have defect reduction and process 
improvements are probably something we've always done and worked on, 
both
 
to lower our cost but also to improve the customer experience and also 
the seller and vendor experience.
 
We're using software and algorithms to make decisions rather than people, 
which we think it's more efficient and scales better and will be more 
accura
te, especially as we insert machine learning into the decisions.
 
As I said earlier we benefit from the efficiency gains of the AWS business on 
the Amazon site as well.
 
We look to increase the leverage of our fixed assets, particularly our 
fulfillment cente
rs and the throughput of the fulfillment centers, and just 
generally getting inventory closer to customers as we add and expand 
warehouses in the sort centers that we added primarily last year. All have 
helped our cost structure, so just a little more colo
r on maybe some specifics 
on the efficiency area.

out plans for the year? If you can't disclose that, can 
you maybe just give us a general sense of focus and strategy? How should 
would be thinking about domestic versus International? As

18 months? Thanks.
 
Brian T. Olsavsky

Sure. So we ended the year last year with 109 fulfillment centers aro
und the 
world and 19 U.S. sort centers. And typically we're looking at what the 
demand would be for peak as we figure out what we need; so still a little 
early in the year to comment on that, but in the past we've given an update 
sometime around Q3 on that
. But continuing to build as we have demand. 
And like Brian said, we like to be close to customers and benefit from having 
inventory close to customers as well. So like I said, a little early for the

Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)
 
Great. Thanks and congrats on
 
the great quarter. In the Retail business 
obviously a lot of variables driving growth there, we're seeing higher Prime 
membership levels for one, but I wonder how much of that growth you can 
also break down by some other factors; for example, we're seeing
 
a notable 
increase in selection across longer tail categories? And then secondly, in the 
press release, no mention of Fire Phone. I think almost every other product 
was mentioned. Can we just chalk that one up now to a learning experience 
and an example o
f where Amazon is showing some discipline around 
investments? Or how should we think about that? Thanks.
 
Brian T. Olsavsky 
-
 
Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
 
So I'll start with the Fire Phone question. We have a policy of not 
commenting on
 
our roadmap, so can't give you anything there. We obviously 
do learn from everything we do and value the feedback we get from 
customers, but nothing to share at this point. In terms of growth, we 
continue to see selection as a strong driver of growth. Pri
me is obviously 
very important as well; we really haven't teased those apart. FBA becomes 
very important as well and we've talked about some of the tailwinds we see 
there, and sort of the linkage between marketplace and Prime that FBA 
provides. So all thos
e things are going on. As you're seeing EGM strength 
across a lot of the categories there, there was no single category we're really 
calling out, but continue to see good selection growth and good Prime 
growth as well.

Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
 
Thanks, guys. So, Brian, I know you guys don't like to provide guidance 
beyond the next quarter but philosophi
cally if we go back a few quarters 
you've characterized 2015 as a year where you believe that some of the 
heavier investments made in prior years should start to benefit and pay off. 
And we're see 

 
we're clearly seeing that in AWS and in North America ret
ail 
and it looks like you're still investing heavily on International retail. So if we 
kind of look out 2016, 2017, is there any high
-
level philosophical 
commentary about whether you see next year as another year of these 
types of trends that you're seeing
 
now? Or are there any bigger investment 
areas particularly in the retail business that you might be looking to take 
advantage of?
 
Brian T. Olsavsky 
-
 
Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
 
Thanks for your question. I can't forecast into the fut
ure on that but I will 
reiterate the investments we have going on right now which again, we're 
looking to invest to strengthen the Prime platform. That includes video 
content including Amazon Originals, Prime Music, Prime Now. We have 
robust device busines
s including the launch of a new Paperwhite Fire TV 
Echo with general availability and numerous other products that we're very 
excited about. That roadmap, we know that those devices drive customer 
engagement and sales. We build fulfillment centers so that 
we can add 
selection and we can add FBA partners. And we had things like same
-
day 
delivery which we talked about.
 
On the AWS side we continue to invest in that infrastructure. We talked 
about opening, announcing the region in India so there's expansion the
re as 
well. Future expansion, services expansion Internationally very similar to the 
U.S. on a number of the Prime fronts but also the investment in India. And 
then a few other things you may have seen in our press release today, the 
launch of Mexico which
 
we are excited about and Amazon business.
 
So lots of 

 
as I said, lots of investment in front of us. But we operate in two 
paths. We are definitely working for operational efficiencies in the business 
that we're in. We're investing wisely in things that w
e think are big and 
important. And it's not a static activity. We continue to evaluate those 
investments, take into account what customer response is and make 
changes. So I think you can look forward to the continuation of that into the 
future.

strategy with the post office? And then, you guys haven't necessarily broken 
this out, but I think you do generate a fair amount of revenue from

can provide on advertising revenue? Thank you.
 
Brian T. Olsavsky

did a lot of the Sunday delivery that you saw when we started launching 
Sunday delivery. So we try lots of things for fulfillment. We're constantly 
working to provide the best experience to customers and be as e
fficient as 
possible. And so we're happy with all the partners we have and continue to

For advertising, I would remind you that certain parts of the advertising roll 
up into other. Some 
actually roll up to EGM and media, as well. So it's a 
business we're really excited about. We're taking a customer centric 
approach as we build that to make sure we're providing engaging business, 
engaging adds to customers and making sure we keep the cust
omer front of

Yeah. Thanks. Brian, just to follow
-
up on the India question earlier. I mean, 
o my knowledge foreign e
-
commerce operators such as yourself are not 
allowed to have first
-
party retail 
operations. But given that fulfillment 
enhance customer service has always been a high focus item for you guys. 
What steps have you taken in the country to make sure that the consumer 
experience there is as good if not better for the inventory on which you
 
have 
no direct control?
 
And secondarily, similar to China, you have a pretty large population base 
and Internet penetration growing that's probably comparable to what was 
the case when you add JOYO 

 
when you acquired JOYO. So can you provide 
any color on
 
how the general operating environments are the same or 
different? And do you expect your growth trajectory there to be similar to 
what you saw in China? Thanks.

So, your first question 
was about the infrastructure and how we're managing 
the customer experience in India. So FBA, Easy Ship and some of those 
programs are important to us. They're very valuable for sellers to make it 
easy for the seller to get their goods to the customer. The
y're great from a 
customer experience standpoint because we can do what we do best with 
the logistics. And so there is a lot of investment and a lot of efforts going on 
that front.
 
I would say that India and China are totally different. And I think as Bria
n 
mentioned, India is a country that we're doubling down on based on the 
success we've seen there so far. And so very happy with the trajectory we're 
on there and excited to be investing and have the opportunities we do at 
that point.

Your next question comes from John Blackledge with Cowen & Company.

Great. Thank you. It appears that Amazon is
 
growing its share of household 
budget driven by many factors, Prime growth and strong growth in large 
verticals like apparel among others. Specifically on apparel, I'm just 
wondering how you view the breadth of Amazon's apparel offering. Any color 
on that
 
segment's performance in the second quarter. And how do you view 
Amazon's apparel opportunity going forward? Thank you.

Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
 
Yeah. Thanks for your question. We have not broken out specifical
ly apparel, 
but we're super excited about that business. It's growing very well. We like 
our position in it. We think our website is very tuned to selling online. So 
we're very happy with that. It is a big business for us, not only in North 
America but als
o Internationally. You mentioned a couple other consumables 
categories. I will say we are very happy in our consumables and hard lines 
categories, as well. We drive a lot of repeat business with things like Prime 
Pantry and Subscribe and Save and others. S
o, very happy with the EGM 
business as a whole.

And your final question comes from Scott Tilghman with B. Riley.

B. Riley & Co. LLC
 
Thanks. I wanted to just follow up on a couple things.
 
Three quick questions, 
first off on International I was wondering if you could compare and contrast 
relative performance of media and EGM? You're moving in different 
directions. Second, there have been a couple questions about shipping but 
most notable is
 
that we had a couple price increases from the majors hit at 
the beginning of the year and it seems like you're costs are coming down. I 
was wondering if you could comment on that. And then third, just following 
up on Brian's question around the FCs. I was
 
wondering how many of the 
facilities lend themselves to expansion rather than having to put up a new 
facility? Thanks.
 
Brian T. Olsavsky 
-
 
Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
 
Sure. Let me start with the first question on International media 
and EGM. I 
think we are seeing similar trends in both geographies, those segments that 
EGM growth is very strong media growth has been consistent for the last 
four quarters. We do like the work being done by media teams. There's a lot 
of pipeline of invent
ion: things like Prime Instant Video, Prime Music; all feed 
the Prime pipeline and Prime ecosystem, if you will. They work great with 
our devices by the way. They drive other non
-
media sales.
 
They are very tied together, although certainly the EGM is outpa
cing the 
media segment or media businesses right now. On transportation costs, not 
a lot to add there. Again, the combination of doing our own shipping and 
using third
-
party carriers so the rate increases are staged and we see those 
quite frequently, so no
thing to add there. On the FCs and whether we would 
expand or build new, I think we are looking to always get the most out of 
the fulfillment centers that we have and as we need new facilities we place 
them closer and closer to customers so that can have i
ts benefits as well, 
but not much more to add on that one.

Thank you for standing by. Good day, everyone, and welcome to the 
Amazon.com Q2 2019 Financial Results Teleconference. At this time, all 
participants are in a listen

only mode. After the presentation, we will 
conduct a 
question

For opening remarks, I will be turning the call over to the Director of 
Investor Relations, Shelly Kay Pfeiffer. Please go ahead.

Hello, and welcome to our Q2 2019 Financial R
esults Conference Call. Joining 
us today to answer your questions is Brian Olsavsky, our CFO; and Dave 

call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you which 
includ
es our financial results, as well as metrics and commentary on the 
quarter.
 
Please note, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be 
against our results for the comparable period of 2018. Our comments and 
responses to your questions refle

25, 2019 only, and will include forward
-
looking statements. Actual results 
may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could 

release 
and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent Annual Report on 
Form 10
-
K and subsequent filings.
 
During this call, we may discuss certain non
-
GAAP financial measures in our 
press release, slides accompanying this webcast, and our filings 
with the 
SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website. You will find additional 
disclosures regarding these non
-
GAAP measures, including reconciliations of 
these measures with comparable GAAP measures.
 

e seen to
-
date and 
what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are 
inherently unpredictable and maybe materially affected by many factors, 
including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic 
conditions and cust
omer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the 
Internet, online commerce and cloud services, and the various factors 
detailed in our filings with the SEC.
 

additional business
 
acquisitions, investments, restructurings, or legal 

services, and therefore our actual results could differ materially from our 
guidance.
 
With that, we will move to Q&A. Operato
r, please remind our listeners how 
to initiate a question.

in that? So which specific categories of consumption are you
 
seeing really 
drive that acceleration? And then sort of the opposite question on AWS, 
which has slowed a little bit can you just talk about some of the puts and 
takes in the AWS revenue growth this quarter versus the prior Q? Thanks.
 
Brian Olsavsky
 
Sure, 
Brian. Thanks for your questions. Let me start with AWS. We feel this 
really strong quarter. We had a growth year
-
over
-
year in our run rate from 
$24 billion to $33 billion, so 37% growth. The $9 billion that we increased 
our run rate by was second only to 
Q4 of last year as far as our history. So 
as you can tell, we've been pretty transparent with our AWS revenue and 
income numbers we've been breaking it out for 2015 and we're very happy 
with the growth in absolute dollar terms and we're seeing a pick up fr
om 
customers and their usage, their increased pace of enterprise migrations, 
increased adoption of our services especially our machine learning services. 
And continually again AWS is being chosen as a partner to many companies 
because of our leadership pos
ition both in technology, our vibrant partner 
ecosystem, and also the stronger security that we offer.
 
On your question about one
-
day, let me update you on that, because 
obviously that was a big topic of conversation last quarter and you can see 
that it's 
starting to show up in our results in Q2. So we are really pleased 
with the customer response to our growing one
-
day offering.
 
In Q2, we had a meaningful step up in the one
-
day shipments, primarily in 
North America. And volume 
--
 
one
-
day volume was acceler
ating throughout 
the quarter. The ops team did a fantastic job here, not only in being able to 
expand one
-
day selection and delivery capacity, but also preparing for and 
handling some very high volumes on Prime Day earlier in the month.
 
So we're in the mid
dle of the journey here. We expect to see continued ramp 
of the one
-
day selection availability for the next few quarters both in North 
America and international. International was up slightly in Q2, but for the 
most part, the improvement in delivery speeds
 
will be in future quarters 
there. On the cost side, we talked last time about $800 million estimate of 
transportation cost to supply one day, the additional one day in Q2. We were 
a little bit higher than that number in total cost.
 
We saw some additional 
transition costs in our warehouses. We saw some 
lower productivity as we were expanding rather quickly, both local capacity 
in the off
-
season also in our delivery networks.
 
We also saw some costs were moving 
--
 
buying more inventory and moving 
inventory ar
ound in our network to have it be closer to customers. And we 
built that not only that cost structure, but an accelerating cost penalty into 
our Q3 guidance that was released with our earnings today.
 
And as I said in other setting, we've seen this before. 
We have had large 
changes to our distribution and transportation network repeatedly in our 
history from going from media to a vast variety of different product lines 
hardlines non
-
sortable as we call them. The initial two
-
day Prime shipping 
offer that we l
aunched many years ago, the great expansion of our network 
to include FBA merchants and capacity for them and more recently, the first 
steps to increase one
-
day and same day although on a much smaller scale.
 
So, it does create a shock to the system. We're 
working through that now. 
We expect we'll be working through that for a number of quarters, but when 
the dust settles, we will regain our cost efficiency over time. As far as you 
asked about specific product lines, nothing really to share there. We have 
se
en lower ASP generally in Q2, higher unit growth versus revenue growth in 
North America and we could be that we're mixing into some lower ASP items 
as we launch one
-
day, but we haven't drawn that total conclusion yet.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question 
comes from Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs. 
Please proceed.
 
Heath Terry
 
Great. Thanks. Just wondering back on the AWS side of things, can you give 
us a sense of sort of what you're seeing from a volume perspective? 
Obviously, price is always a big 
component of growth in this, but just trying 
to understand whether or not you're seeing similar trends in terms of growth 
rate deceleration on the volume side of things.
 
And then to the extent that we're sort of thinking about the mix of either 
revenue or 
usage within that business. Are there any products or sort of 
product areas AI obviously being one that's been a major initiative for you 
that you're seeing particular either outside growth or under growth relative 
to the overall business that you would ca
ll out?
 
Brian Olsavsky
 
Yes, sure. On that second point, I'd say we're seeing a lot of increased 
adoption and machine learning services especially Amazon Sage Maker. 
We've had tens of thousands of customers who are now using AWS machine 
learning services an
d we'll continue to innovate on behalf of those 
customers.
 
We released more than 200 machine learning features and capabilities in 
2018 alone in this area. Database is also a multibillion
-
dollar business 
propelled by Aurora. So we're seeing a lot of streng
th. We're seeing strong 
usage growth that outpaces revenue growth as usual increased pace of 
enterprise migrations.
 
So, I would say that on a percentage growth basis again on a dollar basis, 
it's going very strongly. On a percentage growth basis, we are la
pping some 
very strong growth in the first half of last year. We were growing about 50% 
in the first half of last year. There's some particular unique customer 
volumes that were flowing through that some customers have really high 
usage tied to their busin
esses. But for the most part, we continue to grow 
usage and our expansion of our services with all of our customers. So very 
happy.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question is from Justin Post with Merrill Lynch. Please 
proceed.
 
Justin Post
 
Great. Couple of q
uestions. I guess, the first question is just happens with 
the customer behavior when they do have one
-
day availability? I'm 
assuming units go up, but can you give us any details on what happens or a 
category that switches to one
-
day what happens?
 
And the 
second question, we've heard from some smaller checks that some 
of the smaller merchants are moving to 3P, not getting orders on the one 
piece side as much. Is there any change in your business there to really kind 
of focus more towards third
-
party from fi
rst
-
party? Thanks a lot.
 
Brian Olsavsky
 
Sure. No, we don't have category specifics to really share with you today on 
the move to one
-
day. I did say that generally in Q2 the unit volume was 
greater than revenue volume. So we did see some lower ASPs. But I t
hink 
what you're saying is just a lot more products enter the consideration set for 
our customers.
 
So things that maybe they can't wait two days on, they can wait one day, 
and it lights up a whole separate usefulness for the Amazon site. I've noticed 
that 
personally myself that just 
--
 
with one
-
day shipments, it's here before 
you know it. So what categories that hits specifically, we'll have to see over 
time.
 
On your comment, I assume you meant vendors not merchants, but on the 
move from 1P to 3P, but no th
ere shouldn't be 
--
 
I can't highlight anything 
related shifting in channel there, but I would say that we remain in different 
on whether 
--
 
we're focused on price convenience and selection for our 
customers. And whether product is a retail offering or thir
d
-
party offering is 
not that important to us. As long as it's in stock, as long as it's priced 
competitively.
 
So, as you know our 3P selection has 
--
 
our 3P percent of units has been 
increasing over time and increased again in this quarter to 54% of units.
 
We 
continue to invest very heavily in our systems both for retail vendors and 
also for third
-
party merchants invest billions of dollars a year on behalf of 
then making Amazon a better place for customers to buy and increasingly 
not only vendor sales, but 
also third
-
party merchant sales.
 
In particular on Prime Day, I think you'll see that we had 
--
 
over in the press 
release, we had more than $2 billion of products were bought from small 
and medium
-
sized businesses. So when we win, we win together with our 
v
endor partners and also our seller partners.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question comes from Jason Helfstein with 
Oppenheimer. Please proceed.
 
Jason Helfstein
 
Thanks. So in the release you made a comment about automotive and 
Alexa, anything you want to el
aborate a little more that looks like that's a 
very interesting opportunity? And then with respect to India, there were two 
comments in the release, but anything you can comment on kind of getting 
past some of the issues that had impacted the business in t
he past? I know 
you're past that now. Thank you.
 
Brian Olsavsky
 
Yes. Let me start with India. So yes, continue to see growth in programs for 
both sellers 
--
 
for our sellers and delivery partners. In the last 18 months, 
we've doubled the number of paid Prim
e member, which we're very excited 
about. We've invested a lot in our global selling program, which helps Indian 
sellers not only reach customers in India, but also in other geographies 
around the world.
 
We started Amazon Flex in India, which helps our loc
al partners to deliver 
packages, gives them jobs, grows our delivery capacity for sellers and 
increases our speed of delivery. So it's a win
-
win.
 
We've also introduced package
-
free shipment program in nine cities. This is 
going to be a big part of our ship
ment zero program, a vision to make all 
Amazon shipment net carbon zero.
 
On the government side, our engagement with the Indian government 
makes us optimistic about partnering and collaborating to seek a stable 
predicable policy that allow us to continue i
nvesting in our technology and 
infrastructure. And it also helps us to create jobs and scale local businesses.
 
So, we think there's a lot of shared purpose there and a good quarter where 
we're looking forward to the Diwali holiday this year. The events we 
have for 
Diwali were all in Q4 last year some of them are in Q3 this year based on the 
timing of the holiday. So, that's factored into our international 

 
excuse me, 
our, revenue growth rate for the quarter.
 
Dave Fildes
 
Yes, Jason. This is Dave. Just quickly on the Alexa point and auto, Alexa is 
really a more and more place. I think the point you're probably referencing 
is, we're now seeing hundreds of third
-
party devices with Alexa built in. So 
that runs the gamut from s
mart thermostat and another smart home 
devices, headphones, but also vehicle.
 
So we've seen a lot of good partnerships and arrangements with companies 
like BMW and Mini and not just in the U.S., but in places like Europe as well. 
So a lot of this of course
 
is just around the great power of Alexa and being 
able to offer even greater convenience and touch points where customers 
can interact with that and we're seeing a lot of good momentum with usage 
and how customers are interacting with Alexa.
 
But also when
 
you look at the broader environment of third
-
party devices, 
devices that we're rolling out in all of those things it's 
--
 
we're seeing a lot of 
good momentum there. And I think it's underpinned by the fact that Alexa is 
always getting smarter and so custo
mers are enjoying the benefit of that 
enhanced experience.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question comes from Youssef Squali with SunTrust. 
Please proceed.
 
Youssef Squali
 
Great. Thank you very much. Two quick questions for me please. Can you 
quantify the cos
t of one
-
day shipping to Q3 guidance kind of similarly to 
what you did into 4Q too with that $800 million? And if they plateau how 
should be thinking about it, as we map it out over the next several quarters?
 
And then you guys made a very intriguing acquis
ition, the Sizmek acquisition 
sometime back. I'm just wondering, how does it fit in the overall strategy? 
And is the idea to try to build may be a double click like
-
minded model, 
sorry using that platform? Thank you.
 
Brian Olsavsky
 
Hi, Youssef. Let me star
t your question on one
-
day. I'm not breaking out the 
specific cost this quarter as I did last year 
--
 
last quarter. Some of this is 
because it's very hard to pinpoint exactly the lines between one
-
day and 
other cost issues. So we're always working within a
 
range. We're confidently 
we were near but just above our $800 million estimate in Q2.
 
And as I said, this is going to take multiple quarters to play out. We had a 
meaningful step up in North America in Q2 and it was accelerating through 
the quarter. We'll
 
see more cost in Q3. We'll see about Q4 when we talk and 
everything we know about or anticipate about Q3 is built into our guidance.
 
So I wouldn't break out the dollar term. I will tell you at the end of the 
quarter kind of what we're seeing on cost and h
ow it looks for Q4 as well. 
And the other thing I would point out on the trajectory is that, we're just 
getting started in international and most of that work is ahead of us 
although the speed that tick up a bit in Q1 
--
 
excuse me Q2 but 
--
 
and will 
do eve
n more so in Q3 in future quarters.
 
Dave Fildes
 
Yes. And then just on Sizmek quickly. We are excited to have acquired the 
Sizmek ad server and then Sizmek's dynamic creative optimization or DCO. 
Customers are going to be able to continue to use those prove
n products 
and services. We're invested in the long
-
term success of Sizmek. And again, 
Amazon advertising and Sizmek has many mutual customers, so we know 
how valued these prudent solutions are to the customer base.
 
So we're looking forward to work with th
at team and we'll share more 
updates as we invent and create new opportunities to serve advertisers in 
the future.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital 
Markets. Please proceed. Sir, your line is live.
 
Mark Mahaney
 
Sorry about that. Hey Brian could you talk a little bit about the elasticity 
you're seeing 
--
 
you expect to see in international markets with the rollout of 
one
-
day? And I just 
--
 
the commentary in the press release about this 
acceleration from one
-
day, so
unds great. It's a little surprising that you 
would see the reaction that quickly. But maybe this really is 
--
 
well you're 
obviously seeing it. You're confident you'll also see it as you roll out into 
international markets, if you could just comment on tha
t? Thank you.
 
Brian Olsavsky
 
Sure. The 
--
 
of course the proportion of one
-
day shipments is higher in 
international to begin with in a lot of our countries. So we will 
--
 
we expect it 
to be very valuable to customers as we add selection into that one
-
day 
ca
tegory. But we think the biggest elasticity is probably in North America 
where the standard has been 2
-
day shipping for Prime.
 
So yes, I would say, you're faced with the 
--
 
you see it every time you go to 
our site. It's automatically built in. You're surpr
ised by the speed. It's not 
like you have to search one
-
day shipping specifically to find out what's 
available. It's growing and it's pervasive.
 
So I think what that does is, again it strengthens your purchase decision, it 
strengthens the need to not have 
to go elsewhere to buy a product because 
you need it quickly. So I think it's becomes a part of your routine. At least 
that's what we're seeing in North America. And we hope again as we build 
this capacity to more and more regions and more and more ZIP cod
es and 
adding more and more selection that everyone will see the same thing that 
we see already in major cities.
 
I do want to add one point though because when we talk about operating 
income in both in Q2 and Q3 and we talk about the cost and penalty of on
e
-
day, I would like to highlight there's some other investment areas that are 
certainly going on here. If you look at Q2, our marketing expense was up 
48% year
-
over
-
year and that's a combination of a few things.
 
First, we're continuing to add our AWS sales
 
and marketing teams. We see 
great opportunity there to help customers engage with our services and 
migrate to our products. So we continue to build out our sales force and our 
marketing programs. We're also adding more and more advertising as we 
roll out 
devices and Prime Video 
--
 
new Prime Video content in particular 
internationally.
 
So we're seeing higher marketing costs. We're also seeing a higher stock
-
based compensation expense. That was up 36% year
-
over
-
year. And you'll 
see that our headcount grew 13
% year
-
over
-
year.
 
So when you look at some of our most quickly growing areas things like 
Alexa and AWS and also teams working on machine learning and other high
-
end technical projects, our technical headcount actually grew twice that rate 
or nearly twice t
hat rate based on total headcount. So there's a lot of 
moving parts within our headcount number, but there's a very strong 
investment going on in AWS devices and videos in particular.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question comes from Ross Sandler with 
Barclays. 
Please proceed.
 
Ross Sandler
 
Hey guys, just two questions. The North America retail acceleration was 3.5 
points and you mentioned international is about one. So can we attribute the 
difference to one
-
day? Or was there other organic acceleration i
n North 
America happening aside from the move to one
-
day?
 
And then Brian related to that investing question, AWS operating margin 
came down a bit. I know they had a tough comp. But anything you would 
call out aside from the headcount stuff that you just me
ntioned that may 
have been lumpy in the quarter on AWS? Thanks.
 
Brian Olsavsky
 
Sure. Let me start with that second question. So yes 
--
 
sorry, the operating 
margin in AWS, just like the revenue rate it's such a rapidly growing 
business with different timing
 
of investments and global expansion in 
investment in marketing and other infrastructure that is going to vary 
quarter
-
to
-
quarter.
 
We had a 
--
 
we've come off a period where if you remember last year we 
had less investment needed in infrastructure both for 
AWS and for Amazon 
in total. The 
--
 
I don't have the number directly in front of me, but anyway 
we grew finance leases, which is essentially our props for capital leases for 
infrastructure by 9% in Q1 and it was 10% all of last year coming off a year 
in 20
17 where we had growth of 69%. So we had that dynamic.
 
Our trailing 12
-
month growth in that number is 21% after Q2. So it's 
stepped up from 9% to 21%. So we are starting to see as I mentioned in 
earlier calls that the investment will be stepping up in 2019
, so started to 
see that in Q2. But the biggest, I would say the biggest impact in this 
operating profit was the addition of sales and marketing personnel in AWS 
and also to a lesser extent the stock
-
based compensation, which certainly 
hits across all of o
ur businesses.
 
Your comment on revenue growth differential, I mean there's so many 
different factors going on in every country that's hard to compare North 
America to international. But I would say that we are attributing a good bit 
of the revenue growth a
cceleration from 17% in Q1 to 20% in Q2 to the 
rollout of one
-
day and the impact of that.
 
If there's other things, obviously, we continue to add selection and we have 
again lots of engagement points of customers through Prime Benefits and 
video and devices
 
that certainly contribute to our revenue run rate in our 
retention of Prime members. But if we're going to point to one thing in Q1 
that's different 
--
 
Q2 excuse me, that's different it was obviously the start of 
the 
--
 
and the step up in one
-
day shipment
s.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark May with Citi. Pleased 
proceed.
 
Mark May
 
Thanks for taking my question. I appreciate it. First I guess sort of an 
organizational question, but some of the feedback I've heard from the 
ecosystem is th
at it appears that the combination of the way Amazon's 
organized internally and just rapid growth in the ad business 1P, 3P that at 
times there are signs that kind of these teams internally are not always 
aligned and maybe that creates some issues.
 
And jus
t wonder first do you generally agree with this? And if so, what is the 
company doing to kind of better optimize these increasingly related functions 
that maybe in the past haven't always been organized internally that way?
 
And then secondly in terms of su
bscription revenue where are we in terms of 
the benefit from the price increase announcement announced last year and 
rolled through to existing members throughout the last year and will this 
have any meaningful impacts in that lines growth say in Q3 of the
 
back half 
of the year? Thanks.
 
Brian Olsavsky
 
Sure. So, I assume your first question is about the coordination of advertiser 
with teams that are interacting with vendors and sellers, perhaps is that 
what you meant?
 
Mark May
 
Exactly. Yes.
 
Brian Olsavsky
 
Ok
ay. Yes, so, first, I'd say we're customer
-
focused first and primarily, but 
we need to have good coordination across our teams and we grow fast and 
we add new things. So, there's always learnings that we have that's why we 
say it's still day one here. But 
we're trying to minimize the negative impact 
on any vendor or seller out there.
 
So, I can't comment on any certain 
--
 
on exactly what issues you might be 
talking about. We have teams dedicated to the seller experience and the 
vendor experience and we think
 
they do a good job of selling the whole suite 
of products including advertising 
--
 
with the advertising teams at Amazon.
 
But as you say they're separately run and they can meet at different points 
and sometimes at certain vendors perhaps that may get out 
of hand are get 
out of sync. But hopefully that is a temporary condition.
 
On subscription revenue, yes, we 
--
 
you remember we raised the price of 
Prime in the U.S. last June from $99 to $119. So, the largest impact 
--
 
favorable impact from that at least fr
om a subscription revenue standpoint 
would have happened in the subsequent four quarters, less in Q2, more in 
Q3 through Q2 of this year.
 
So, yes, that will be a factor that we're comping for the next 12 months. Its 
offset by the growth in the Prime progra
m itself and the expansion of Prime 
Benefits or the Prime program globally. You may see that 
--
 
may have seen 
we have launched Prime in United Arab Emirates this quarter. So, it's not 
something 
--
 
it's something we've certainly seen in the past with timing
 
of 
price increases, but it's built into the Q3 guidance that I've given.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question comes from Colin Sebastian with Robert W. 
Baird. Please proceed.
 
Colin Sebastian
 
Great. Thanks. I guess first up curious just a 
follow
-
up on the ASP 
comments if those were 

 
if that shift within the same categories or just 
lower ASPs imply diversification into new categories. But my main question 
is just looking ahead of the holiday period given some of the moving parts 
and 3PL and
 
shipping ecosystem and then of course with the transition to 
one
-
day, are you confident that there is enough capacity from your own 
first
-
party logistics as well as third
-
party partners to meet that seasonal 
demand and should we now expect a faster ramp i
n Amazon Air as the 
means to move cargo between fulfillment centers? Thanks.
 
Brian Olsavsky
 
Yes. So, I would say the first time we started discussing the rollout of one
-
day our first thoughts went to Q4 this year and our capability for holiday and 
as much 
as Q2 and Q3. So we are confident that we will have the ability to 
handle seasonal demand. We are working very hard to expand our one
-
day 
capacity, add carriers, add delivery partners at our own AMZL capability and 
have our partners expand their capabiliti
es as well.
 
So we're feeling good about Q4. It's a little early to discuss that now, but we 
certainly had a really good test on Prime Day. It was the two biggest days 
we've ever had. A lot of good work went into Prime Day, a lot of benefit for 
customers, a
 
lot of benefit for our selling partners, the small business 
merchants as well. So it was a good test for us.
 
And, sorry, your question on low ASP, I think we're still figuring that out a 
bit. I mean they 
--
 
what I'm reacting to is the high unit growth rel
ative to 
good growth in revenue, but unit growth grew faster. I'm always a little vary 
to put too much into the unit growth number.
 
As I've talked in other quarters, it's a number that's excludes AWS 
subscription services, advertising and Whole Foods, whic
h are some of the 
fastest growing areas and we also have 

 
are actively selling subscription 
services like Kindle Unlimited and Amazon Music Unlimited, which can 
cannibalize unit sales. So there's a lot of moving parts, usually our 
headwinds to our unit gr
owth number, but again happy with the 800 basis 
point quarter
-
over
-
quarter jump in that.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question comes from Brent Thill with Jefferies. Please 
proceed.
 
Brent Thill
 
Thanks. Brian just on the op income guide for the next quarter
, it's 
significantly below where many of us are at. I'm curious if you could just talk 
to any changes around expenses and the success of one day just doubling 
down or can you just walk through what's transpires in the next quarter? 
Thank you.
 
Brian Olsavsk
y
 
Yes, sure. So again the biggest individual item is the one
-
day shipping. As I 
said earlier, we had a meaningful step up in shipments in Q2 versus Q1, but 
we're still on our way and Q3 will be a step up over Q2 in North America and 
we'll see more in inter
national. So it's 
--
 
that increase in one
-
day shipping 
and all the associated cost of additional transportation and getting capacity 
in place. As I mentioned earlier new costs and things like expanding 
inventory, getting it closer to the customer.
 
Just a l
ot of things moving 
--
 
a lot of moving parts in the fulfillment center 
world right now and our transport networks. So that is the biggest individual 
contributor but as I mentioned in Q2's results, some of the investments in 
marketing, the step up in infras
tructure spending that should continue.
 
We certainly have a lot of areas where we continue to invest not the least of 
which is our AWS business, devices, video, the global expansion of a lot of 
our Prime Benefits and things like stores and grocery delivery
 
through Whole 
Foods, Prime Now and AmazonFresh.
 
So I would say, yes, we had 
--
 
as we've mentioned the last couple of calls, 
we had some lessening of expenses in some key areas last year, mostly tied 
to headcount growth, infrastructure and fulfillment capa
city.
 
We expected a step up in 2019. We didn't see as much of it in Q1, mainly 
because of the timing of the seasonality of the year and getting things going.

Thank y
ou. Our final question will come from Eric Sheridan with UBS. Please 
proceed.
 
Eric Sheridan
 
Thanks so much. Maybe a few small questions on the advertising side of the 
business if I can. How much of the advertising business would you be willing 
to say is 
driven by domestic sellers and domestic brands versus the 
international side?
 
Two, how do you think about the video ad revenue opportunity? We continue 
to hear from a lot of people in the advertising industry that you might be a 
bigger player in video adve
rtising later this year or more into next year, how 
do you think about making investments against that possibility or even just 
possibility of being a driver in your platform overall? Thanks so much for the 
color guys.

Yes, Eric this is Dave. I
 
think started with the video advertising that one 
focus areas for us is expanding our video and over the top offerings for 
brands. We've taken some steps with live sports and then IMDb TV, but we'll 
continue to do things like add more OTT video supply, ju
st things like 
Amazon Publisher service integrations and simplifying access for third
-
party 
apps and add more inventory through things like Fire TV apps and IMDb TV. 
So some interesting areas that we're continue to put a lot of focus into.
 
Now the first pa
rt of your question, in terms of geographical mix, I mean, 
fair to assume that like a lot of our business, advertising in the North 
America segment is the bigger piece of that, but I think we're really excited 
about the international opportunity.
 
A lot of 
the tools that we've rolled out introduced in places like the United 
States aren't available in many of the international regions. And so, it's a 
matter of continuing to work with advertisers and brands and kind of 
buildup, not only awareness but just how 
those 
--
 
add things like sponsored 
products interact with customers and how they receive 
--
 
building up the 
things we talk about many times here around improving relevancy on each 
of those geographic websites is an important thing that we're measuring. So,
 
expected to continue see us look for new ways to be able to roll that out.

Thank you for joining us on the call today and for your questions. A replay 
will be available on our Investor Relations website, at least through the end 
of the quarter
. We appreciate your interest in Amazon and look forward to 
talking with you again next quarter.

Greetings. Thank you for standing by. Good day, everyone and welcome to 
the Amazon.com Q1 2015 Financial Results Teleconference. At this time, all 
participants are in a listen
-
only mode. After the presentation, we will 
conduct a 
question
-
and
-
answer session. Today's call is being recorded.
 
For opening remarks, I will be turning the call over to the Director of 
Investor Relations, Phil Hardin. Please go ahead.
 
Phil Hardin
 
Hello and welcome to our Q1 2015 financial results conference
 
call. Joining 
us today is Tom Szkutak, our CFO and Brian Olsavsky, Vice President and 
CFO of our Global Consumer Business. We will be available for questions 
after our prepared remarks.
 
The following discussion and responses to your questions reflect 
mana
gement's views as of today, April 23rd, 2015 only and will include 
forward
-
looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional 
information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is 
included in today's press relea
se and our filings with the SEC, including our 
most recent Annual Report on Form 10
-
K.
 
As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press 
release in front of you, which includes our financial results, as well as 
metrics and commen
tary on the quarter. In addition, the release includes 
historical financial results of our North America, International, and Amazon 
Web Services reportable segments for 2014 and 2013.
 
During this call, we will discuss certain non
-
GAAP financial measures. I
n our 
press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the 
SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional 
disclosures regarding these non
-
GAAP measures, including reconciliations of 
these measures with comparab
le GAAP measures.
 
Finally, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against 
our results for the comparable period of 2014.
 
Now, I'll turn the call over to Brian.
 
Brian Olsavsky
 
Thanks, Phil. I'll begin with comments on our first quarte
r financial results. 
Trailing 12
-
month operating cash flow increased 47% to $7.84 billion. 
Trailing 12
-
month free cash flow increased to $3.16 billion.
 
In the supplemental financial information and business metrics portion of our 
earnings release, we inclu
ded a few additional free cash flow measures. We 
believe these measures provide additional perspective on the impact of 
acquiring property and equipment with cash into capital and finance leases.
 
Trailing 12 month capital expenditures were $4.68 billion. C
apital 
expenditures do not include the impact of property and equipment acquired 
under capital and finance lease obligations.
 
Return on invested capital is 14%, up from 9%. ROIC is trailing 12 month 
free cash flow divided by average total assets minus curr
ent liabilities, 
excluding the current portion of long
-
term debt over five quarter ends. The 
combination of common stock and stock
-
based awards outstanding was 483 
million shares, compared with 476 million one year ago.
 
Worldwide revenue grew 15% to $22.72
 
billion or 22%, excluding $1.3 
billion unfavorable impact from year
-
over
-
year changes in foreign exchange. 
Worldwide paid unit growth was 20%. Active customer accounts was 
approximately 278 million.
 
Excluding customers who only had free orders in the prec
eding 12 month 
period, worldwide active customers were approximately $260 million, up 
from approximately $230 million in the comparable prior year period. 
Worldwide active seller accounts were more than 2 million. Seller units 
represented 44% of paid units
.
 
Now I'll discuss operating expenses excluding stock
-
based compensation. 
Cost of sales was $15.40 billion or 67.8% of revenue, compared with 71.2%. 
Fulfillment, marketing, technology and content and G&A combined was 
$6.62 billion or 29.1% of sales, up app
roximately 290 basis points year
-
over
-
year.
 
Fulfillment was $2.67 billion or 11.7% of revenue compared with 11.3%. 
Tech and content was $2.52 billion or 11.1% of revenue compared with 
9.2%. Marketing was $1.05 billion or 4.6% of revenue compared with 4.3%.
 
Now I'll talk about our segment results. Beginning in the first quarter we 
changed our reportable segments to report North America, International and 
Amazon Web Services. In addition we have provided historical results for 
these segments for 2014 and 2013
 
with our earnings release filing today. 
Consistent with prior periods we do not allocate to segments our stock
-
based compensation or the other operating expense line item.
 
In the North America segment, revenue grew 24% to $13.41 billion. Media 
revenue gre
w 5% to $2.97 billion. EGM revenue grew 31% to $10.25 billion, 
representing 76% of North America revenues.
 
North America segment operating income increased 79% to $517 million, a 
3.9% operating margin. Excluding the favorable impact from foreign 
exchange, 
North America segment operating income increased 77%.
 
In the international segment, revenue decreased 2% to $7.74 billion. 
Excluding the $1.3 billion year
-
over
-
year unfavorable foreign exchange 
impact, revenue growth was 14%. Media revenue decreased 12% to
 
$2.32 
billion or increased 2%, excluding foreign exchange. EGM revenue grew 4% 
to $5.38 billion or 21%, excluding foreign exchange. EGM now represents 
69% of international revenues.
 
International segment operating loss was $76 million, compared to a loss 
of 
$33 million in the prior year period. The unfavorable impact from foreign 
exchange, international segment operating loss was $78 million.
 
In the Amazon Web Services segment, revenue grew 49% to $1.57 billion. 
Amazon Web Services segment operating income
 
increased 8% to $265 
million, a 16.9% operating margin. Excluding the favorable impact from 
foreign exchange, AWS segment operating income decreased 13%.
 
Consolidated segment operating income increased 41% to $706 million or 
3.1% of revenue, up approximat
ely 60 basis points year
-
over
-
year. 
Excluding the unfavorable impact from foreign exchange, CSOI increased 
45%.
 
Unlike CSOI, our GAAP operating income includes stock
-
based compensation 
expense and other operating expense. GAAP operating income was $255 
mil
lion compared to $146 million in the prior year period.
 
Our income tax expense was $71 million. GAAP net loss was $57 million or 
negative $0.12 per diluted share, compared with a net income of $108 
million and $0.23 per diluted share.
 
Turning to the 
balance sheet. Cash and marketable securities increased 
$5.12 billion year
-
over
-
year to $13.78 billion. Inventory increased 10% to 
$7.37 billion and inventory turns were 8.8, down from 9.1 turns a year ago, 
as we expanded selection, improved in
-
stock level
s and introduced new 
product categories. Accounts payable increased 13% to $11.92 billion and 
accounts payable days increased to 70 from 68 in the prior year.
 
I'll conclude my portion of today's call with guidance. Incorporated into our 
guidance are the or
der trends that we've seen to
-
date and what we believe 
today to be appropriately conservative assumptions. Our results are 
inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, 
including a high level of uncertainty surrounding exchange r
ate fluctuations, 
as well as the global economy and consumer spending. It's not possible to 
accurately predict demand and therefore our actual results could differ 
materially from our guidance.
 
As we describe in more detail in our public filings, issues su
ch as settling 
intercompany balances in foreign currencies amongst our subsidiaries, 
unfavorable resolution of legal matters and changes to our effective tax 
rates can all have a material effect on guidance.
 
Our guidance further assumes that we don't concl
ude any additional 
business acquisitions, investments, restructurings or legal settlements, 
record any further revisions to stock
-
based compensation estimates and that 
foreign exchange rates remain approximately where they've been recently.
 
For Q2, 2015 we
 
expect net sales of between $20.6 billion and $22.8 billion 
or growth of between 7% and 18%. This guidance anticipates approximately 
750 basis points of unfavorable impact from foreign exchange rates.
 
GAAP operating income or loss to be between a $500 mil
lion loss and a 
positive $50 million of income, compared to $15 million loss in second 
quarter 2014. This includes approximately $600 million for stock
-
based 
compensation and amortization of intangible assets.
 
We anticipate consolidated segment operating i
ncome, which excludes stock
-
based compensation and other operating expense to be between $100 
million and $650 million, compared to $404 million in the second quarter of 
2014.
 
We remain heads down focused on driving a better customer experience 
through pri
ce, selection and convenience. We believe putting customers first 
is the only reliable way to create lasting value for shareholders.
 
Thanks. And with that, Phil, let's move on to questions.
 
Phil Hardin
 
Great. Thanks, Brian. Let's move on to the Q&A portion
 
of the call. Operator, 
will you please remind our listeners how to initiate a question.
 
Question
-
and
-
Answer Session
 
Operator
 
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Brian Pitz 
with Jefferies and Company. Please proceed. Your line 
is live.
 
Brian Pitz
 
Thank you. Can you share with us any updated metrics for Prime Now, how 
sticky is it in terms of repeat customers, average order value or other 
details? And also any update on your fulfillments center plans for the year, if 
you can disc
lose specific numbers, maybe you could just qualitatively tell us 
your focus either domestic versus international or sortation versus traditional 
FC build out? Thanks.
 
Tom Szkutak
 

B
ut we have expanded to seven cities with more on the way. Customers are 
really enjoying the one hour and two delivery of tens of thousands of daily 
essential products.
 
So the response has been great. We will point out that our operations 
network that was 

 
has been building for the last 20 years helps make Prime 
Now a viable proposition for us and scale makes a possible. So really so far 
customer responses are great.
 
Brian Olsavsky
 

r 
and as we progress through the year we'll give you some updates on how 
many. But as a reminder we ended the year with 109 fulfillment centers 
around the world and we'll update you as we go.
 
Operator
 
Our next question comes from Ross Sandler with Deutsche
 
Bank. Please 
proceed.
 
Ross Sandler
 
Great. Thanks for the new disclosure guys, really helpful. I guess, just 
speaking, you know, now a little bit we all understand the investments you 
are guys are making on international, retail, and maybe with our margins
 
been declining.
 
Can you give us a little color on what's driving up the North America retail 
segment margin and I guess in the context of that, just talk about the 
impact that Prime is having on the retail margin for both North America and 
International? 
Thanks.
 
Brian Olsavsky
 
Yes, sure. So North America operating margin up a 120 basis points year
-
over
-
year to 3.9%. Lot of good cost efficiency, but again we're continuing to 
invest so actively as we build the Prime platform and that we have 
customers. So yo
u'll see lot of invention definitely to see the Prime platform, 
which things like Video Content, Prime Music, as we talk about Prime Now 
devices that will continue to build fulfillment centers for selection and 


 
its generally w
hat's driving the operating 
margin in North America.
 
Tom Szkutak
 
And just to add on to that, we're 

 
we gave metrics last quarter about 

certainly common thing with 
category expansion, new FCs, original content, 
Prime Instant Video devices, Prime Now. The common theme is they are all 
really intertwined with Prime and inextricably to our consumer business in 
Prime.
 

r we gave an indication 
of the growth rates after being added for 10 year. So we're super excited to 
have the platform and to continue to invest in it.
 
Ross Sandler
 
Great. Thanks guys.
 
Operator
 
Our next question comes from Douglas Anmuth with JPMorgan.
 
Dou
glas Anmuth
 
Thanks for taking the question. Can you guys talk a little bit more just about 
the international business and kind of the key initiatives here in terms of 
getting the growth to reaccelerate some of these levels?
 
And then also perhaps little bit
 
more on your strategy. In China how you are 
thinking about the cost structure there, relative to previous years and some 
of the key ways you might be able to rationalize things there? Thanks.
 
Brian Olsavsky
 
Yes, let me start with China. So, I think you'll
 
see a lot invention, you're 
seeing a lot of invention from us in China right now. Amazon is trusted 

doubling down on now with a Amazon global store on our own site, which 
gives C
hinese customers access to over 1 million Amazon products globally.
 
And then the team of flagship store for international brands which you've 
heard about giving thousands of direct imported products access to 

 

 
happen to be stocked and 

benefit. 25% of those are exclusive 

 
over 25% of those exclusives to 
Amazon.
 
So we continue to be selective in our investments there, but we're taking the 
lo
ng
-
term view and we have hopes for the new initiatives along the global 

 
with the global store and the team of flagship store.
 
Tom Szkutak
 
In terms of the growth for total international, just maybe some comments 
first about the current quarter and then I'
ll elaborate little bit further. But 
the growth was down 2% on a dollar basis, up 14% on local currency basis. 
So we did see a little bit of improvement in terms of growth rate acceleration 
versus last couple of quarters.
 
And in addition to the things that
 
Brian mentioned earlier about the Prime 


 
all those things we're working on globally. So those are things that at least 
in most geographies we have today.
 
One thing to keep in mi
nd also, as you look at growth rate for Q1, is last 
year Q1 we talked about in April 1st there was a consumption tax increase in 
Japan. We had some 

we think some pre
-
buys in Q1 and we're overlapping 

 
about it for Q1.
 
But we're looking 

 
we think there is still a big opportunity, as we mentioned 
last call, big opportunity with Prime. Prime is growing at a faster rate. We 
think there is still a great opportunity to add unique selection to 

 
for 
category
 
expansion. And again, so we're going to continue feed the Prime 
platform as we talked about, continue to add selection in a lot of categories.
 
We're also very excited about India, if you take a look at our results for 

 
from an operating profit standpoint
, you see that it was approximately 

approximately breakeven, included in there we certainly have a sizeable step 
up in investment in India. And we're super excited from what we see ther
e 
right now. We think its very big opportunity and we're investing 
appropriately for that big opportunity.
 
So those are some of things that we're working on and we think there 

 
we 
still have a lot of opportunity there moving forward.
 
Operator
 
Our next que
stion comes from Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley.
 
Brian Nowak
 
Great. Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. The first one is on the 
new inter US [ph] disclosure. Can you just help us on accounting question. 
The AWS data center costs related to the cor
e e
-
commerce business, are 
those being allocated to North America and International, are those being 
fully embedded into the AWS segment?
 
And then a second question goes back to China. I guess any early learnings 
from the team of [ph] partnership and wheth
er you have any thoughts or 
potentially a lower capital intensive grow strategy in China?
 
Tom Szkutak
 
To answer you first question, yes, they are, the associated infrastructure 
cost to run our North America and International consumer business those 
costs, 
those infrastructure costs are being allocated to those segments.
 
The second question in terms of China, its early, we're liking 

 
certainly 
some of things that we're seeing there, but there is not a lot I can add to 
that at this stage.
 
Brian Nowak
 
Thank you.
 
Operator
 
Our next question comes from Colin Sebastian with Robert Baird.
 
Colin Sebastian
 
Great. Thanks. Maybe just another follow up on the new segment 
disclosures. Thanks for breaking it out. You know if we assume that the 
advertising segment i
s reasonably profitable than the implication is then that 
the core retail business is very modestly profitable close to breakeven.
 
And just wondering what the thought process and strategy is behind that. If 
in a sense there is some subsidy to the retail si
de being used as you build 
market share in the core business? Thanks.
 
Tom Szkutak
 
Yes, I think the best way to think about it is, we certainly have an 
advertising part of our North American consume segments. But the way you 
should think about it is, we are
 
making some great investments for the long
-

seeing in terms of 

 
so it is certainly impacting the operating margins both 
for North American and International.
 

that we 

 
both Brian and I talked about that we're doing 
globally to support Prime platform all of those things that we mentioned, 
video content, original content, Prime Now, category expansion, investing on 
behalf of FBA, which also helps Prime devices. T
hose are all intertwined and 
certainly part of that. And then some of the things outside of that are more 
specifically related to International in addition to those are some of 
geographic stuff that we talked about.
 
So I think you should think about it tha
t way that certainly think its big 
opportunity and again, one of the reasons I want to give you an update, last 


t you 
see also and certainly results that you are seeing today.
 
Colin Sebastian
 
Very helpful. Thanks very much.
 
Tom Szkutak
 
Sure.
 
Operator
 
Our next question comes from Mark May with Citi.
 
Mark May
 
Thanks for taking my questions. On the international revenu
e I believe there 
is probably 

 
there's a real distinction here between some of your more 
established countries and some of your more emerging countries. I wonder if 
you could talk a little bit about for Germany and the UK and Japan and some 
of the more es
tablished markets, what the profit profile of those markets 
look like and just how much of the international segment results are being 

 
losses being held back by a handful of the more emerging markets.
 
And then a question on AWS pricing. It seemed like th
e pricing environment 
was pretty competitive last year. What are you seeing in the market this 
year and what are your expectations going forward? Are you expecting a bit 
more of a stable pricing environment? Thanks.
 
Tom Szkutak
 
Yes, in terms of Internation
al, we're not breaking out individual country 
results. The one thing that could mentioned around from a country 
perspective was India in terms of which 

 
it certainly stepped up our 
investment. And if you look at it year
-
over
-

ected 
in the numbers that you are seeing.
 
In terms of AWS, we've had 48 price decreases since inception. The team is 
doing a terrific job in terms of working on behalf of customers to pass on 
savings as they see it. But in terms of any comment on what to e
xpect going 
forward there is not really much to add there.
 
Brian Olsavsky
 
Its probably is worth adding that, although prices are factor, the primary 
factor for customers choosing with AWS is really around their ability to move 
quickly and to be nimble and 
agile.
 
And so we're very pleased with the kind of continued adoption and usage 
growth we've seen and obviously the benefits of AWS around their ability 

 
customers ability to be nimble as a primary factor there.
 
Operator
 
Our next question comes from 
Carlos Kirjner with Bernstein.
 
Carlos Kirjner
 
Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I have two. My first question is about the 
profitability of the North America segment. You mentioned a few minutes 
ago that investments in Prime were part of the 

 
most of the
 
explanation for 
what is a relatively low 3.9% margin in North America. Which are much 
lower than the 5% to 6% EBIT margin that [indiscernible] retailer books? 
Despite a large benefit of booking repeat net.
 
Here's the question. Prime is not new in North Am
erica. You probably have 
tens of millions of Prime users in the US, 30, 40, 50 million. Yet margins are 
still low. What gives you confidence that the investments that you are 
making will pay off?
 
Second question on AWS, if you look at expenses like R&D, pe
rhaps even 
the fixed component of marketing and sales, which presumably one day will 
be really fixed, are this still growing significantly? In other words, is there 
room for significant margin expansion at some point in the future when 

to 5 or 10 times its current size or do you expect the 
need to scale up at the same rate as revenues? Thank you.
 
Tom Szkutak
 
In terms of your first question, specifically related to North America, one of 
the 

 
our comments we made last quarter that we disc
losed was, we 
disclosed the growth rate globally, as well as the growth rate in the US. And 
the growth rate in US after 10 years is up 50%, it was 50% year
-
over
-
year. 

price increase on
 
Prime from 79 to 99.
 
And so, it gives you a feel for the work that we put into Prime to make that 
experience great for customers and the value that we are giving them. So 


 

things t
hat gives us comfort, but when we look at the individual pieces we 
like what we see, so in other words, some of the investments we're making, 
I think as we've talked about in the past, I'll give one example would be 
video content, both original and license
 
content.
 
We mentioned last call that we spent approximately $1.3 billion on content 
globally for Prime customers and what we've seen and to date is was 
certainly still an investment for us, its certainly impacting our operating 
results, but we like what w
e see. We see customers who come in through 
our free trial pipeline if you will for video content. They convert it at a higher 
rate. We see 

 
we have a great retention of Prime members, but those who 
scream actually, we retain those at a higher rate and we
 
bring in new 
customers through our video pipeline.
 
The purchasing pattern that we have for those customers is very similar to 
those who come in from other pipeline. So in other words, they are buying 
very good from a physical product standpoint, as well a
s digital. So they are 
buying a diverse set of products.
 
So in other words, this video content that we're spending is helping us 
customers who buy consumable from us, they will buy clothing from us, they 
will buy shoes from us, they will buy electronics, t
hey will buy media items.
 

early. We'll have to over time how efficient they are, but each period we go 

example
.
 


 
the 

I mentioned earlier all these things we're investing in are very intertwined.
 
Brian Olsavsky
 
And 
Carlos, I think you had a question about AWS. From our perspective its 

us we believe. And so you can see we're putting a lot of CapEx obviously 
there and including capital l
eases and we think over time we will be able to 
generate significant free cash flow with stronger ROICs.

Our next question comes from Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets.
 
Mark Mahaney
 
Thanks. Thanks. I want to go back on North America retail mar
gins and just 
I want to try to figure out, I know you're not going to go, where they could 
go, but if we look in the past, I assume that if the base o2014 and in full 
year 2013 was probably depressed for North American retail margins, North 
American segmen
t margins and if we look back five or six years, it's 
probable that that was running at kind of mid to high single digits CSOI 
margins. Kind of similar to the incremental margins you just reported for 
that segment 8.7%.
 
So I guess the big question I want t
o ask is, is there a structural change in 
the North American retail business over the next 

 
this year and the next 
couple years versus what you had call it in 2004 to 2009 when the margins 
were 

 
I think were pretty clearly higher and now you're going to 
be 
recovering to those levels. That's what I'm trying to get at. Any color would 
be great? Thanks.
 
Tom Szkutak
 
Yes, the 

 
thanks for the question Mark. Just in terms of going forward, 
we're not giving any specific guidance, beyond the current quarter. So I
 
can't predict for you what could happen. But what you mentioned is, and 
some of the periods you were describing as you mentioned what our 
business look like, several years ago when we Prime was nascent and we 
were early 

 
a bit earlier business.
 
And so we
 
go through different cycles. We're certainly still investing very 
heavily. That being said, we 

 
as I mentioned last quarter, we're spending 
time on making sure that we get productivity. So we're working on both 
investing heavily in the business, we're wo
rking on fixed and variable 
productivity in other areas, putting a lot more energy into it.
 

terms of operating margins year
-
over
-

aspects, but certainly m
ix of business and some productivity is certainly 
impacting that.
 
But again we think there is opportunities to improve margins over time, 
you'll have to stay tuned on that to see what it looks like. But we certainly 
as you can see from not only results, bu
t some of the data points that we've 
given over the last several quarters we are investing heavily in the business, 
again, because we like what we see and Prime growing so dramatically 

at 
platform to feed.
 
Mark Mahaney
 
Okay. Thanks, Tom.
 
Operator
 
Our next question comes from Justin Post with Merrill Lynch.
 
Justin Post
 
Hey, couple of questions on margins. First on AWS a think those are higher 
than most of us were thinking. 
Appreciate the disclosure. What is driving 
your margin versus your pricing decision? How do you think about passenger 
cost efficiencies or potential margin growth through your customers.
 
And then secondly on international margins you know, clearly below hi
story, 
below the US, what kind of things need to happen to get those at least to 
where the US is today much less back to where they were six or seven years 
ago? Thank you.
 
Tom Szkutak
 
Justin I'll take the AWS portion of the question first. So our model ove
r the 
long
-
term really has been to innovate and to use our scale and position to be 
able to pass savings along to customers. And so we've had 48 price 
decreases since we launched.
 

but the primary motivator is really around the innovation that AWS enables 
and the ability for developers to move really quickly.
 
Brian Olsavsky
 
And in terms of international, again as you mentioned Justin, we are 
investing a lot right now which impacts th
e margins there again ex
-
exchange 
think of it as approximately breakeven for the quarter. And so again, we're 
continuing to invest. We're investing in all the things that we talked about 
related to the platform, continue invest in some emerging geographies
, most 
notably certainly India with the step up given the experience we have.
 


about the opportunity a

there.
 
Operator
 
Our next question comes from Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs.
 
Heath Terry
 
Great. Thanks. Just wondering if you could give us a sense of how we should 
think about the run rate of CapEx and 
capital lease obligations in the quarter 
as any sort of indication for full
-
year and the trajectory of investment in 
fulfillment and data centers.
 
And then just on the question of a Prime and Prime Video, as we think about 
the way that media growth is tren
ding now, is there a point where you start 
to think of allocating Prime, some of those Prime revenues to media to 
account for the 

 
as Prime Video usage increases?
 
Brian Olsavsky
 
Yes, in terms of the CapEx question, there is certainly two pieces of that, 
t
here is the consumer, the North American, International piece, is a number 
pieces, but certainly two largest pieces which certainly be the CapEx 
associated with fulfillment and the second would be infrastructure. And again 

, and International.
 
I'll take the North America and International first. We're seeing good growth 
and year
-
over
-
year in terms of overall unit growth, in terms of revenue 
growth, certainly ex
-

So we 
do every year we'll continue to monitor the growth there. We're 
making plans for the rest of the year and we'll get back to you as we 
progress throughout the year in terms of what fulfillment capacity will need 
to support that growth this year.
 
In terms of
 

some acceleration of growth from a revenue perspective. Over the last few 
quarters here, usage is growing faster than that, so we will be deploying 
more capital as we go there.
 
In terms of the am
ounts, specific amounts, we're not giving guidance on 
that today and one of the reasons it is growing so fast that we wan to make 
sure we put the right amount of capital in place and the teams has done a 
great job doing all the planning and the execution a

what we're doing there.
 
In terms of media, I am not fully sure I understood the question, but as it 

 
Heath Terry
 
Right. Was just getting a sense of as video becomes such 
a 

 
becomes a 
bigger part of the Prime value proposition, do you start to allocate some of 
the annual revenues from Prime more directly into that media segment. 
Because of the level of usage associated with Prime Video versus the 
shipping benefits of Prime
?
 
Tom Szkutak
 
Heath, we do allocate some Prime to account for the video.
 
Heath Terry
 
Okay. Great. Thank you.
 
Tom Szkutak
 
Thanks for the question.

Our next question comes from Gene Munster with Piper Jaffray.
 
Gene Munster
 
Good afternoon. Could 
you talk little bit about the focus on the same day 
and same hour and specifically about the incremental investments and just 
some context to how big of those investments are and separately is what the 
strategic advantages, there is something ultimately ob
viously to improve the 
experience. But do you see in any of your data that this opens you up to be 
more competitive with traditional retailers? Thanks.
 
Tom Szkutak
 
Yes, I'll take that one. We certainly as I said earlier, we see this as a natural 
extension 
of our existing infrastructure investments we've 

 
the 109 
fulfillment centers, again very close to customers. It allows us and locks for 
a same day and next
-
day deliveries. And to its extreme one hour and two 
hour deliveries as you've seen with Prime now.
 
So we're not forecasting or giving much more on that, but we definitely see 

smaller number of azans [ph] ten to thousands of azans are available for 
one, two hour delivery and genera
lly in the category, essential products that 
you would need in short time period.
 
Brian Olsavsky
 
And one thing I would add to that as Brian mentioned, earlier as well, we are 

many, 
but you should be definitely expecting more to come and we're 
excited to do that.
 
Operator
 
Our next question comes from Robert Peck with SunTrust Robinson 
Humphrey.
 
Robert Peck
 
Yes, thank you. I was wondering Tom, could you give us an update on your 
retail
 
store strategy. Should we expect stores to open up across the US or is 
that limited to China, New York.
 
And that number two, India has come up a couple of times on the call today. 
China had several structural challenges based on the market there. I was 
cu
rious if you could differentiate what you are seeing that's different in India 
versus the China challenges? Thank you.
 
Tom Szkutak
 
Yes, in terms of our consumer business, we love the business that we have 
today. We love 

 
we think there is a great opportun
ity to do that to continue 
to expand the existing business that we have. In terms of other things we 
have long standing practice of not talking about what we might or might not 
do there. In terms of the second part India, and China could you repeat that 
pa
rt, I am sorry?
 
Robert Peck
 
Sure. So you talked about India a couple of times today on the call. 
Obviously it's big area of investment focus for the company. China has some 
structural challenges based on how the marketplace is. I was wondering if 
you could
 
differentiate what you are seeing in India that makes you 
optimistic there versus some of the challenges you faced in China?
 
Tom Szkutak
 
Yes. Thank you for the question. They are very different, you'll see the 
growth rate in India is very rapid. We talked
 
about last year and its 
increasing investment. I think the biggest differences there focused on 
sellers and the connection of sellers.
 
A big part of the challenge there is helping sellers all across India to succeed 
and grow their online businesses, you'l
l see from our press release that 
we've launched a new apps for that. So that helps them manage our 

the biggest difference that we see between India and China. But and still 
very, v
ery early on in India.
 
Operator
 
Our next question comes from Jason Helfstein with Oppenheimer.
 
Jason Helfstein
 
Thanks. So can you talk about how the impact on available third
-
party SKUs 
impacts the business, particular in Europe and ultimately what you cou
ld do 
to drive more SKUs through the platform, whether it's lowering third
-
party 
rates or is it other factors to try to get more SKUs on their after a third
-
party?. Thanks.
 
Tom Szkutak
 
We spent a tremendous amount of time on our seller business over the 
ye
ars and trying to improve both the experience for sellers, as well as 
customers. And we've done a lot of interesting things to help sellers and 

today, as of this quarter, our third par

points from last year.
 

fulfillment by Amazon. And so the benefit for sellers is they get to take 
advantage of our multi newer 
fulfillment network globally, we have a 109 
fulfillment centers globally, as well as our customers get to take advantage 
of that as prime numbers where we offer in those geography.
 

for 
customers and we believe good for share owners too. So again, we're very 
excited, number of different things we're working on, but certainly one of 
the drivers along with all of the things that I mentioned is certainly FBA is 
very helpful.
 
Operator
 
Our
 
next question comes from Mark Miller with William Blair and Company
 
Mark Miller
 
Hi, good afternoon. Looking at the service sales less the AWS revenues 
you've got a $4 billion in fees mostly coming from the marketplace off a 
strong mid
-
30%. Help us think a
bout the cost that go against those 
marketplace fees and specifically within fulfillment if you could help us 
understand how much of the cost is going against 3P are basically FBA 
fulfillment, perhaps percent of units part of the FC's that are going to 3P?
 
Tom Szkutak
 
So Mark, I can't comment on the derive number, but I can say that FBA 

third party mix over the years. I think we gave you an update in Q4 that it 
was more than 40% of o
ur third party units.
 
Obviously in the fulfillment line there is cost associated with that as well, as 
our other third party units as well I think like payment processing and other 

that.
 
Mark Miller
 
If I can insert a second question, given the upside and profitability in the 
first quarter, the guidance for the second quarter quite a bit lower. What are 
the factors you see that are negatives or I guess otherwise people can I 
think you
 
are sandbagging? Thanks.
 
Tom Szkutak
 
Let's take a look at the guidance that we gave, again, we gave as we have in 
previous quarters, we gave the wide range and from a consolidate segment 
operating standpoint we gave a 100 to 650, the implied margin at the
 
lower 
end, the higher end is approximately 50 basis points upwards to 2.9%.
 
This quarter in Q1 we were up 60 basis points year
-
over
-
year in total at the 
upper end of that forecast implied would be up 80 basis points, so again, 

k its appropriate range for Q2.
 
Operator
 
Our final question comes from Ron Josey with JMP Securities.
 
Ron Josey
 
Great. Thanks for taking the question. Just going back to margins a little bit 
more on AWS. As a look at the seasonality, I'm wondering if there
's any 
seasonality in margins because it looks like margins 2Q and 3Q came in sub 
10% versus mid teens in 4Q and 1Q and then sort of looking at it a different 
way, maybe given the different profitability into 2Q of last year, did that 
have any impact on th
e pricing cuts in April?. Thanks very much.
 
Tom Szkutak
 
So, let's start with the increase you saw sequentially in margin from Q2 or 
Q3 to Q4 of 2014, so revenue grew by about 21.5% sequentially and 
expense grew by around 10% so obviously we were growing fa
ster in top 
line and expenses.
 
Over the long
-
term improvements and efficiency and innovation allow us to 
drive that kind of cost out of the business. I mean there is certainly was an 
impact with pricing changes and you probably saw some of that in Q2 as 
we
ll, but over the long
-

 
Ron Josey
 
Great. Thank you.
 
Tom Szkutak
 
And with that, thank you joining us on the call today and for your questions. 
A replay will be available on investor relations website at least through the 
end o
f the quarter. We appreciate your interest in Amazon.com and look 
forward to talking with you again next quarter.

Thank you for standing by. Good day, everyone, and welcome to the 
Amazon.com First Quarter 2019 Financial Results Teleconference. At this 
time, all participants are in a listen
-
only mode. After the presentation, we 
will conduct a 
question
-
and
-
answer session. Today's call is being recorded.
 
For opening remarks, I will be turning the call over to the Director of 
Investor Relations, Shelly Kay Pfeiffer. Thank you. Please go ahead.
 
Shelly Kay Pfeiffer
 
Hello, and welcome to our Q1 2019 
financial results conference call. Joining 
us today to answer your questions is Brian Olsavsky, our CFO; and Dave 
Fildes, Director of Investor Relations. As you listen to today's conference 
call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, 
which 
includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the 
quarter. Please note, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will 
be against our results for the comparable period of 2018.
 
Our comments and responses to your ques
tions reflect management's views 
as of today, April 25, 2019 only, and will include forward
-
looking 
statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information 
about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in 
to
day's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent 
annual report on Form 10
-
K and subsequent filings.
 
During this call, we may discuss certain non
-
GAAP financial measures. In our 
press release, slides accompanying this webcast and 
our filings with the 
SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional 
disclosures regarding these non
-
GAAP measures, including reconciliations of 
these measures with comparable GAAP measures.
 
Our guidance incorporates the order tren
ds that we've seen to date and 
what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are 
inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, 
including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic 
condit
ions and customer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the 
Internet, online commerce and cloud services, and the various factors 
detailed in our filings with the SEC.
 
Our guidance also assumes, among other things, that we don't conclude any 
additi
onal business acquisitions, investments, restructurings or legal 
settlements. It's not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and 
services, and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our 
guidance.
 
With that, we will move to
 
Q&A. Operator, please remind our listeners how 
to initiate a question.
 
Question

and

Answer Session
 
Operator
 
At this time, we will now open the call up for questions. [Operator 
Instructions] Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Mark 
Mahaney
 
from RBC Capital Markets. You're now live.
 
Mark Mahaney
 
Okay. Hey, I'm going to ask two questions, because the first one is really 
simple. Unit growth of 10%, is this a meaningless metric, just talk through 
that number. I think it's the lowest unit growth
 
I think we've ever seen, but 
just talk to us a little bit about that.
 
And then international sales growth decelerated 16%, I know last 
-
 
ex
-
FX. I 
know last quarter you talked about some challenges in the India market. 
Just give us some color, please, arou
nd that growth rate, how do we think 
about the sustainability of that? Was that negatively impacted by 
developments in India? Thanks a lot.
 
Brian Olsavsky
 
Sure, Mark. Thanks for your questions. I'd start on unit growth. So unit 
growth was 10%. Again, as I 
mentioned last quarter, it is a measurement, 
excludes a lot of our fastest growing businesses, things like AWS, 
advertising, subscription services, which cannibalize the unit calculation, 
things like Kindle Unlimited and Amazon Music Unlimited. And then, a
lso it 
doesn't include Whole Foods Market.
 
So while it is meaningful, it needs to be understood and caveated. So your 
question was on international growth. Yeah, talking more about specifically 
India, so India, for those of you on the call last quarter, we
're just heading 
into an uncertain period with the PN2 ruling. We did make some changes to 
our structure to stay in compliance with all regulations. There were a few 
days of downtime for some of our selection. But for the full quarter the 
impact was minima
l. And we're in compliance and very, very happy with the 
progress of the business in India.
 
So as far as the growth is concerned in international, we had some noise in 
Q3 and Q4, if you'll remember with the timing of the Diwali holiday. But we 
feel pretty 
good about the Q1 growth there, even despite some downtime in 
India.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Doug Anmuth from J.P. 
Morgan. You are now live.
 
Doug Anmuth
 
Thanks for taking the questions. I'll also ask two, if I can. Just
 
first, Brian, 
can you just talk about the outperformance in operating income in 1Q? 
Increased significantly there, it looks like cost of sales and the fulfillment, 
but hoping you can provide some more color. And then why would the 
margin be materially low
er in 2Q as you're guiding? And then just second, 
on the outlook for revenue in the second quarter on an FX
-
neutral basis, the 
higher end implies a nice acceleration, so curious what gives you the 
confidence in that. Thank you.
 
Brian Olsavsky
 
Sure, Doug. Y
eah, let's start with Q1. So you remember last quarter, I made 
the point that 2018 saw lower growth in some of our key cost areas. Things 
like fulfillment capacity, which have been growing over 30% a year in 2016 
and 2017, dropped to 15% last year. Headcou
nt growth was 48% in 2016, 
38% if you exclude Whole Foods and Souq acquisitions in 2017. That 
dropped to 14% last year. And then, financial leases for infrastructure, which 
are good proxy for capital investment and infrastructure, after growing 69% 
in 2017
, grew 10%.
 
So all of those trailing 12
-
month metrics actually stayed the same or slightly 
declined in Q1. So we had continued efficiency. We didn't put a lot of new 
fulfillment center capacity or infrastructure into place at least compared to 
Q1 of last y
ear. And hiring was moderate; we actually are down to 12% on a 
trailing 12
-
month basis.
 
So I would say that is a continuation of last year. But my point from the last 
call still holds in that, we do expect those growth rates to be higher for all of 
2019. So most of that will happen in the next three quarters, and we have 
that built into the Q2 guidance. We also hit the high
-
end of the revenue 
range, which is always good from an efficiency standpoint and the drop
-
through on the higher end of the reven
ue.
 
So now turning into Q2, I would like to tell you a bit about why that's lower. 
So we have 
-
 
we're currently working on evolving our Prime free Two
-
Day 
Shipping program to be a free One
-
Day Shipping program. We're able to do 
this, because we spent 20 pl
us years expanding our fulfillment and logistics 
network, but this is still a big investment and a lot of work to do ahead of 
us.
 
For Q2 guidance, we've included approximately $800 million of incremental 
spend related to this investment. And just to clarif
y, to give a little more 
information, we have been offering, obviously, faster than Two
-
Day Shipping 
for Prime members for years, one day, same day, even down to one to two 
hour delivery for Prime Now. So we're going to continue to offer same day 
and Prime
 
Now selection in an accelerated basis.
 
But this is all about the core free Two
-
Day offer morphing into 
-
 
or evolving 
into a free One
-
Day offer. We've already started down this path. We've in 
the past months significantly expanded our one
-
day eligible sele
ction and 
also expanded the number of zip codes eligible for one
-
day shipping.
 
So we're taking a significant step. It wasn't showing up in Q1. It was 
minimal in Q1's results. It's a significant step and it will take us time to 
achieve. And we want to ensur
e that we have good delivery experience for 
our customers as we evolve this offer.
 
And lastly, I would say in Q2, as a reminder, each year, we 
-
 
Q2 is a time 
when we grant RSUs to employees. And we traditionally see a step
-
up in 
stock
-
based compensation ex
pense in Q2, and we're seeing the same thing 
this year.
 
Doug Anmuth
 
Thank you.
 
Brian Olsavsky
 
And that 
-
 
sorry, and that's also tied in with your question about revenue 
acceleration. We do believe that, although there's not explicit lift built in for 
the f
aster shipping, we have seen good order trends month to date. And we 
expect 
-
 
we built the Q2 range about 
-
 
around what we've seen.
 
Operator
 
Our next question is from Justin Post from Merrill Lynch. You are now live.
 
Justin Post
 
Great. Thank you. As users 
consume more services and maybe get less 
boxes, although I guess you could see a pickup in Q2, what does that mean 
for customer stickiness? How are you thinking about getting more 
advertising and getting more subscription services? And maybe you could 
just
 
give us a little insight into what you're seeing with Prime churn 
especially in the more mature U.S. market? Thank you.
 
Brian Olsavsky
 
Yeah. Sure. Justin, I would say, as I said, I believe, on the last call, we had 
more people sign up for Prime in 2018 th
an any other year before. So we 
are very happy with the 
-
 
not only the absolute membership levels of the 
Prime program, but also the engagement. Our engagement in video benefit 
-
 
excuse me, Prime benefits, shipping, hours watched on video, hours listened 
t
o on music, all of them are trending in the right direction and continue to 
get more and more sticky.
 
So while I can't share 
-
 
I wouldn't share with you today the Prime 
-
 
any 
Prime 
-
 
specific Prime statistics about churn, it does remain a very 
compelling p
rogram. I think, the announcement I just made about morphing 
to a one
-
day free shipping offer will make it even more the best deal in 
retail, as we say.
 
Operator
 
Our next question comes from Eric Sheridan from UBS. You're now live.
 
Eric Sheridan
 
Thanks for
 
taking the question. The advertising business saw what looks like 
a little bit of a step
-
down again in Q1 versus Q4. Q4 was a fairly big step
-
down, when you strip out the accounting benefit or the last quarter, the 
accounting benefit. Can you talk a littl
e bit about the supply and demand 
dynamics in the advertising business? How much of that will you might be 
controlling to making decisions about ad load versus the demand to 
advertise among sellers on the platform?
 
And any color you could give us on what y
ou might be seeing in the 
advertising business domestically versus internationally would be helpful. 
Thanks so much.
 
Brian Olsavsky
 
Sure. Yeah, we are seeing 
-
 
as you can see in the operating margin, we're 
seeing a good advertising growth both in North Ame
rica and also 
internationally. While I can't get into some of the questions about ad loads 
and inventory, I would say really what we're focused on right now is driving 
relevancy, ensuring that we service the most useful ad as possible. I think 
that's going
 
to be the best experience for customers and also for advertisers.
 
So most of our focus has been on again adding more functionality, adding 
more products and adding 
-
 
reporting for businesses and advertisers, so 
they can understand the incremental customer
s they're seeing on Amazon 
through advertising with Amazon. So it's more right now about tools and 
making better recommendations, making it easier to use our Amazon 
demand
-
side platform, things like that, operational improvements.
 
And then, I guess, we're 
very focused on serving brands as well. That's 
another theme that we have. These brand stores that we have are easy to 
create, customize, and we've had great pickup on that from brands, but they 
can show shoppers who they are and tell their story. So it bu
ilds a better 
engagement for the brand and the customer. It builds better customer 
loyalty both to that brand and also to Amazon.
 
And then on the brand side itself, we have new reporting 
-
 
excuse me, 
where we're again looking to measure the new to the bran
d shoppers and 
what lift they're seeing. So I would say right now, it's more about efficiency 
and also performance of the advertisement themselves. The other revenue 
growth that you see does include some non
-
advertising things as well. So 
while other reven
ue grew 36%, and it is principally advertising, advertising 
grew a bit higher than that.
 
Operator
 
Our next question is from Stephen Ju from Credit Suisse. You're now live.
 
Stephen Ju
 
I'm sure you can share in regards to the Prime users' awareness of the 
availability of stuff from Whole Foods. Is the order flow coming in from a 
wide number of users? Or is the activity coming in from a small, but very 
dedicated number of customers? Thanks.
 
Brian Olsavsky
 
Yeah. Thanks, Stephen. I would say that we're very 
-
 
it's widespread and 
more Prime members have adopted the Whole Foods benefit than almost 
any other benefit we've offered them, and they're saving, as a result, 
hundreds of millions of dollars. We continue to expand the coverage for 
delivery. We have deliver
y from 75 
-
 
into 75 U.S. metros through the Prime 
Now app, and we also have pickup in over 30 metros also through the Prime 
Now app.
 
So we're very 
-
 
excuse me, the other point I'll make is just like last quarter, 
I'll remind you that the physical stores re
venue is principally Whole Foods 
revenue, but it excludes the online ordering component where people order 
on the Prime Now app and it's delivered to them. That shows up in our 
online stores classification.
 
So last quarter, I told you that our growth in st
ore sales, including both 
shopping and also online deliveries, was closer to 6% in Q4, and it's a 
similar number in Q1. So again, we're very happy with both the Prime 
adoption of the 
-
 
or the recognition of the Prime benefits by 
-
 
at Whole 
Foods, and also 
the purchases. And you may have also noticed that we 
lowered prices for the third major round of price cuts, since we joined forces 
with Whole Foods in the summer of 2017.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question is from Dan Salmon from BMO Capital 
Markets. Y
ou're now live.
 
Daniel Salmon
 
Great. Good afternoon, everyone. Maybe, Brian, just to return to the 
advertising business for a moment. It does sound like, as Eric noted, that 
there was a bit more of a slowdown again. I mean, I guess, I'll ask it this 
way. D
o you believe that some of the improved relevance, some of the 
improved focus on brands as well as some of the new products can lead that 
business to reaccelerate at some point again? Or is it facing law of large 
numbers?
 
And then just a follow
-
up, just to
 
return to the $800 million investment to 
improve one
-
day shipping, it sounds like that investment is underway 
already and that 
-
 
in noting that it'll help contribute to the high
-
end of the 
guidance this quarter, it sounds like the timing of that is fairly
 
quicker. I 
would imagine, it's just simply expanding availability and that $800 million is 
largely related to shipping cost. But I just want to make sure, we're 
understanding that quickly that 
-
 
this investment rolled out relatively quickly 
and starts to 
take effect relatively quickly.
 
Brian Olsavsky
 
Yeah. I'm glad you asked that. I would say that while our 20
-
year head start 
in investments in logistics and fulfillment capacity and partner networks that 
we've built are helping us, we also do have a network
 
that is tuned to two
-
day delivery right now, principally for two
-
day delivery.
 
So we do need to build out more one
-
day capacity along with our 
transportation partners, but we're moving quickly and we've got a good 
head start. There is a certain tranche th
at we can dial up quickly, and we've 
started to do that and you'll see that very quickly in Q2. And then stay 
tuned, because we'll be building this 
-
 
most of this capacity through the year 
in 2019.
 
And then your question about advertising, I wouldn't comme
nt on 
acceleration or deceleration of growth. I would just say, we're early on in 
this venture. There's a lot of 
-
 
it's having a lot of pickup by both vendors, 
sellers and also authors. So again, we feel like if we work on the inputs on 
this business and c
ontinue to grow traffic to the site, we will have a good 
outcome in the advertising space.
 
Operator
 
Our next question is from Anthony DiClemente from Evercore. You're now 
live.
 
Anthony DiClemente
 
Thanks very much. A couple of questions. In the shareholder 
letter, Jeff 
wrote third
-
party sellers are kicking our first
-
party butt, and we read 
through that, but as we kind of look at the trending and the pacing of the 3P 
business, you can see a little bit of a deceleration in the 3P sellers services 
line and then
 
3P unit slowdown might suggest that the third
-
party GMV 
expansion may not be happening quite as fast. So maybe just talk a little bit 
about that. Is this just law of large numbers as time goes by? What is 
Amazon doing to sort of sustain that growth rate i
n the third
-
party 
marketplace business?
 
And then second question is maybe just quickly on media spend. Just update 
us on how you're thinking about the trajectory of video content spend. Any 
strategic changes there in terms of library versus originals versu
s films or TV 
content? Thanks.
 
Brian Olsavsky
 
Yeah. Let's step back on the third
-
party question. So again, let me reiterate 
our approach. So main goal here is that it will allow customers to have the 
broadest selection, the best available price and also th
e most convenient 
options on how they receive the item. If we're delivering on those three 
elements, we're indifferent as to whether it's sold by us or a third
-
party. We 
actively recruit sellers to sell on our platform, it's because it adds selection. 
It a
dds 
-
 
if it's in the FBA program, it adds Prime eligible selection.
 
We spend billions of dollars a year, as Jeff said, on infrastructure, tools and 
services, not only to allow sellers to sell, but to help themselves more 
successfully. So we have a vested i
nterest in the success of our sellers. Any 
growth acceleration or deceleration that you see can be very much tied to 
the total sales of the customer 
-
 
that we have the customers in any country.
 
So you'll still see the percentage of third
-
party units increa
sed and has been 
steadily over the last few years. So again, the sellers are as important to us 
as anything for servicing the customers' need for price selection and 
convenience. The elements I just talked about of investment, further 
investment in one
-
day
 
shipping is directly going to be a cost that we bear 
and it's also going to be a direct benefit to sellers as well as the Prime 
eligible selection in our warehouses.
 
Dave Fildes
 
Yeah. And then, Anthony, just real quick, this is Dave, on your 
question 
around media and probably more particularly the video strategy and what 
we're investing in, I mean, we are continuing to invest meaningfully in 
digital video. It's an area where we're very excited about. Lots of very 
popular, critically acclaimed 
shows have obviously come out, things like 
Homecoming, Jack Ryan, more recently Hanna, Guava Island, and some 
great titles.
 
So I think look for us to continue to invest there. There was 
-
 
on the 
accounting side, we did adopt an accounting standard in Janua
ry that 
amended our accounting for how we cap for produced original video content. 
And under that new guidance, we capitalize production cost for original video 
content. Previously, we only capitalized a portion of those costs. So the net 
impact for the fi
rst quarter to operating income wasn't material. It was 
-
 
for 
Q1, the impact of a change was a decrease of about $130 million to cost of 
sales due to the capitalization change.
 
As we go through 2019, though, we would expect the impact to increase in 
the la
tter part of the second half of the year, in line with our production 
schedule as it grows throughout the year.
 
Operator
 
Our next question is from John Blackledge from Cowen and Company. You're 
now live.
 
John Blackledge
 
Great. Thanks. Just coming back to t
he Prime one
-
day delivery, will it be 
available to most of the U.S. by the holidays or by the end of the year? And 
I think you had about 100 million items available for two
-
day delivery, Prime 
delivery. As the one
-
day program starts, how many SKUs will be 
available? 
And would you expect to get the entire 100 million SKUs for one
-
day at 
some point?
 
And then second question, just on grocery, just curious the upside for 
further expansion outside of kind of all the enhancements you're doing with 
Whole Foods. Th
ank you.
 
Brian Olsavsky
 
Sure. So, yes, on the one
-
day free shipping versus the two
-
day free 
shipping, our goal is to evolve the two
-
day free shipping program into a one
-
day free shipping program and we're making strides on that. It got into a 
little bit ab
out the capacity we have to add and changes we have to make to 
our supply chain in order to deliver on that. We expect to make steady 
progress quickly and through the year.
 
We'll have more for you at the end of Q2 obviously. There's a lot of error 
bars aro
und this program, especially from the cost side. We feel we're doing 
something very important for the customer. And we have 
-
 
again trying to 
take advantage of the fulfillment capacity and transportation capacity 
especially with third
-
party partners that w
e have. And we'll just have to see 
what changes have to be made to get more and more selection into that 
one
-
day category.
 
Dave Fildes
 
And then, this is Dave again. Just on the grocery side of it, as you 
mentioned, Brian talked a bit about the Whole Foods 
Market growth over 
500 stores, 75 metros with delivery capability, so continuing to grow that 
out. We are also continuing to invest in our other grocery initiatives. Amazon 
Fresh, Prime Now, which offers grocery as one of the components of the 
selection th
ere for the two
-
hour or even one
-
hour delivery capabilities.
 
And so I think, we'll keep investing in those areas. I mean

 
and in other 
initiatives as well, where we can get food through Pantry, Go, there's a 
number of initiatives there. So excited about wh
at we'll be able to continue 
to bring to customers on that space.
 
Operator
 
Our next question is from Ben Schachter from Macquarie Group. You're now 
live.
 
Ben Schachter
 
So more on the one
-
day shipping. Should we expect that to rely mostly on 
USPS, UPS or ot
her shipping services or you're really going to try to build 
out more your Amazon owned and operated shipping? And on the numbers, 
$800 million for the quarter, how should we think about that ramping into 
the back half of the year? Thanks.
 
Brian Olsavsky
 
Y
eah. Sure, Ben. I would say, we're going to be using all of the available 
levers that we have right now, both AMZL and also third
-
party carriers, and 
we'll just see how it develops going forward. But we're going to need 
definitely continued support of our 
external transportation partners. So 
outside of the ramp, I would say that the $800 million is what I have for you 
today. We will see where we stand at the end of the quarter, and I'll give 
you insight as to what we just saw and what our outlook is for fut
ure 
quarters at that time.
 
I would like to 
-
 
as I don't want to run out of time here. So I'm going to ask 
a question for myself about AWS, because I want to get some information to 
you. Most of the questions I can tell around one
-
day are topical and 
import
ant. I do want to highlight the AWS performance in Q1. We're now 
over $30 billion annualized run rate, 42% FX
-
neutral growth and $2 billion 
more of revenue this Q1 versus last Q1.
 
The operating margin has also expanded in that time period by 320 basis 
poin
ts as a result of a lot of the good work on infrastructure and efficiencies 
that I talked about earlier in the call, because this is against a backdrop of a 
very large expansion of our tech teams and our sales teams that supports 
this business.
 
We're conti
nuing to engage with many large customers globally. I'm 
particularly happy about the Volkswagen alliance that we've joined up with 
them to power their Volkswagen Industrial Cloud. That's going to integrate 
more than 30,000 facilities and 1,500 suppliers an
d partners in Volkswagen's 
global supply chain over time.
 
We have deals going with Ford on powering the cars of the future, Lyft, 
Gogo, a lot of really good customer wins in the quarter. And I think just 
more broadly, we're seeing continued momentum in ent
erprise migrations to 
AWS, and people are moving their workloads to AWS at a faster pace. Usage 
growth continues to be higher than revenue growth rates.
 
Operator
 
Our next question is from Mark May from Citi. You're now live.
 
Mark May
 
Thank you. And 
actually a follow
-
on to AWS, the growth clearly impressive, 
but we did see, I think sequentially, and I apologize I'm not in front of 
model, but I think the growth was somewhere at 3%, 4% sequentially. 
There was a little bit of a slowdown in the quarter. J
ust wondered if there's 
anything that you'd call out there, pricing or any other factors that you could 
call out, that may have contributed to that.
 
And apologize, but another one
-
day shipping question here. In terms of the 
$800 million, just curious where
 
that gets you to, in terms of coverage of zip 
codes and SKUs? I assume right now this is a project that's in the US. And 
where that gets you from a coverage standpoint? And is this something that 
you expect to be a near
-
 
to medium
-
term priority in some of
 
your other 
developed markets like the UK, Germany, et cetera? Thanks.
 
Brian Olsavsky
 
Yeah. So I'm glad you asked that. So, Mark, it's 
-
 
let me start with that 
second question. The program will be global. Most of the spend that we are 
seeing in Q2 is start
ing in North America. But this is intended to be a global 
improvement in speed tied to our Prime program. So you will see more 
going forward.
 
I can't give you exact percentages of selection and all that, mainly because 
we are still again working through th
at. And while we have ratcheted up a 
significant 
-
 
we turned the dial significantly in April. And so we'll see the cost 
impact almost immediately in the quarter. We're really going to have to see 
how it goes this quarter, both on our pace of selection addi
tion and 
expansion of one
-
day, and let you know probably at the end of the quarter.
 
I would say in the short run, it's also expanding and increasing our speed on 
all of our orders quite frankly. On AWS revenue, let me just remind you that 
quarterly growth 
last year on an FX
-
neutral basis, so Q1 was 48%, then 
49%, then 46% and 46%. So in the first half of the year, we have a tougher 
comp, if you will, versus some strong growth in the first
-
half of last year.
 
This is always going to be a lumpy business. It's 
not only dependent on us, 
it's also dependent on the companies that are adopting Amazon, so there's a 
-
 
or excuse me, AWS. So there are differences in sales cycles. There are 
differences in adoption of the cloud. There are differences in migration 
patterns
 
that will make any quarter
-
to
-
quarter movements lumpy, as I said. 
So we're happy with the growth, 42% on an FX
-
neutral basis and again a 
$30 billion 
-
 
greater than $30 billion annualized run rate.

Our next question is from Heath Terry from Goldma
n Sachs. You are now 
live.
 
Heath Terry
 
Great, thanks. I guess somewhat along those lines or at least along the lines 
of growth, we saw CapEx spending and investment in capital leases 
decelerate to the lowest rate that it's been in several years, maybe even
 
the 
lowest rate ever. And you guys have said in the past that generally CapEx 
sort of tracks your 
-
 
that you're investing at the level of growth that you 
expect.
 
I'm sure that's not representative of what you expect growth to look like. So 
just trying to 
understand sort of where the disconnect is there, and to the 
extent that your 
-
 
the level of investment in physical infrastructures says 
anything about your expectations for future growth, what the right way to 
read that is?
 
Brian Olsavsky
 
Sure. Thanks for
 
that question, Heath. No, I would say, A, we're not 
expecting diminished returns in any of our businesses or growth rates nor 
are we restraining the business or constraining the business in any way with 
our capital. I would point you back again to the inv
estments that we made in 
2016 and 2017. So we did front
-
load a lot of the investment both in 
fulfillment centers and also infrastructure.
 
But more than that, it's more than kind of leading through excess capacity. 
We have some really, really impressive gai
ns and efficiencies in both the 
warehouses and also the data centers. We talk efficiency. And every 
percentage utilization in our data centers is worth tens and more millions of 
dollars. So again, that's a big part of our model. It is not only investing, b
ut 
also working on efficiencies, adding new products and features for 
customers.
 
And as we lower costs, we pass those along to customers, either through 
new rates or new deals that we have. So I would say that I would look back 
on the performance in 2018 a
nd say that that was great work with a 
-
 
on a 
lot of efficiency as we also banked a lot of capacity that had been built 
previously.
 
Moving forward, that's why I say it will be increasing as we move through 
the year. And that will be a constant battle betwe
en, again, growth, 
geographic expansion in AWS and also efficiencies to limit how much we 
actually need. I think we're also getting much better at adding capacity 
faster, so there's less need to build it 6 to 12 months in advance, I would 
say.
 
Although, we
 
did just launched our Hong Kong region today as well and I 
want to point that out. The business in China is going really well and we 
continue to see strong growth there. And, launching the Hong Kong region 
gets us to a footprint of 19 cities in China. So 
it continues to be a really good 
story for us.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our final question will come from Brian Nowak from Morgan 
Stanley. You are now live.
 
Brian Nowak
 
Thanks for taking my question. I'll go to a new topic, one
-
day shipping. So 
Amazon, the firs
t principle is customer obsession. And, Brian, you talked 
about record Prime sub
-
growth last year. I guess the question is what are 
the signals or the key strategic rationale behind investing in one
-
day? Are 
there certain types of users, demographics of us
ers, categories of products, 
countries you think this will help you attract and retain?
 
It seems like Prime is growing pretty well. Just talk us through what you see 
as the big opportunity to invest in one
-
day? And then the second one, just 
maybe talk to u
s a little bit about the early learnings on the healthcare 
industry side of potentially trying to move larger into healthcare? Thanks.
 
Brian Olsavsky
 
Great. Yeah, Brian, I would say it's as simple as price selection and 
convenience, which is the 
mantra that we talk about quite often. By going to 
one
-
day, it increases the convenience and it increases the available selection 
into the consideration set. Although, we have many items that are available 
in one to two hours, and also same day, the vast m
ajority of our selection is 
available to you in two days.
 
If we get that to one
-
day, we literally cut it in half, that's tough math for 
you. I'm sorry to do that. But the 
-
 
we think that that will open up a lot of 
potential purchases that 
-
 
and it will ope
n up convenience to those 
customers. So we've been experimenting on a lot of different formats as you 
know, two
-
day, one
-
day, same
-
day, two
-
hour, stores, there's all types of 
-
 
points of being there for the customer, when they need us at different points 
i
n their consideration set.
 
So we really think it's going to be groundbreaking for Prime customers. And 
we're very excited to add this capability. And, again, part of this is we have 
the capability, because we've been at this for over 20 years and continue 
to 
invest in our fulfillment capacity, our logistics capacity and also fine
-
tune it. 
But I thank you for your question.
 
Dave Fildes
 
Yeah, Brian, and this is Dave. Just briefly on healthcare, I mean, that term 
can touch upon any number of different 
parts of our businesses. Of course, 
we've talked in the past about how Amazon Business serves many other 
companies, including the healthcare industry and providing them some great 
selection. And fast delivery is part of that 
-
 
the business program there. S
o 
-
 
and that continues to do well and it's a focus of Amazon Business amongst 
other verticals there that they serve.
 
PillPack, we're probably around 6 months or so in since that acquisition 
closed, and continuing to support them in their mission and learn 
from them 
certainly. So no real update on that, but excited about the potential there to 
be sure.
 
Thanks for joining us today on the call and for your questions. A replay will 
be available on our Investor Relations website at least through the end of 
the q
uarter. We appreciate your interest in Amazon and look forward to 
talking with you again next quarter.

Thank you for standing by. Good day, everyone, and welcome to the 
Amazon.com Q4 2017 Financial Results Teleconference. [Operator 
Instructions]. Today's call is being recorded. For opening remarks, I'll be 
turning the call over to the 
Director of Investor Relations, Dave Fildes. 
Please go ahead.
 
Dave Fildes
 
Hello, and welcome to our Q4 2017 financial results conference call. Joining 
us today to answer your questions is Brian Olsavsky, our CFO. As you listen 
to today's conference call, w
e encourage you to have our press release in 
front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and 
commentary on the quarter. Please note, unless otherwise stated, all 
comparisons in this call will be against our results for the compara
ble period 
of 2016. Our comments and responses to your questions reflect 
management's views as of today, February 1, 2018, only and will include 
forward
-
looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional 
information about factors that cou
ld potentially impact our financial results is 
included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our 
most recent annual report on Form 10
-
K and subsequent filings.
 
During this call, we may discuss certain non
-
GAAP financial measures
. In our 
press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the 
SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional 
disclosures regarding these non
-
GAAP measures, including reconciliations of 
these measures with compa
rable GAAP measures.
 
Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we've seen to date and 
what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are 
inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, 
including fluctuations
 
in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic 
conditions and customer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the 
Internet, online commerce and cloud services and the various factors 
detailed in our filings with the SEC. Our guidance also as
sumes, among 
other things, that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, 
investments, restructurings or legal settlements. It's not possible to 
accurately predict demand for our goods and services, and therefore, our 
actual results could dif
fer materially from our guidance.
 
I'd also like to update you on the impact of the recent U.S. tax reform 
legislation. In our fourth quarter results, we recorded a provisional tax 
benefit for the impact of the new tax legislation of approximately $789 
mill
ion, which is primarily driven by the remeasurement of federal net 
deferred tax liabilities, resulting from the permanent reduction in the U.S. 
statutory corporate tax rate to 21% from 35%. As we complete our analysis 
of this new legislation, we may make a
djustments to the provisional 
amounts. Those adjustments may materially impact our provision for income 
taxes in the period in which the adjustments are made.
 
With that, we will move to Q&A. Operator, please remind our listeners how 
to initiate a question.
 
Question
-
and
-
Answer Session
 
Operator
 
[Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Mark 
Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets.
 
Mark Mahaney
 
I'd like to focus on the North American retail operating margins. That 4.5% 
was the highest, I thin
k, we've seen in a couple of years, maybe the highest 
since you've actually broken that segment out. So could you just go through 
the drivers behind that? I know you called out Alexa as being better than 
expected. Was that one of the factors? Was it the fu
ll quarter of the Whole 
Foods impact? Was it advertising revenue? Just what drove that result and 
how sustainable is it?
 
Brian Olsavsky
 
Sure, Mark. Let me address your question by answering the entire company 
on noteworthy North America elements are strong
est. So for the quarter, we 
came in at the highest end of our revenue range, $60.5 billion, 26 
--
 
36% 
FX
-
neutral growth and 25% FX
-
neutral growth, excluding the Whole Foods 
acquisition. So the fact that we came in at the high end of the range, volume 
was h
igh, especially in North America, and a lot of times in Q4 and other 
quarters actually, we see better efficiencies when the warehouses were 
busy. So it's a very clean operational quarter, I would say. The ops team did 
a great job handling record volumes in
 
Q4 and also incorporating all the new 
capacity we had opened in 2017. If you remember, we have added over 
30% to our fulfillment square footage in 2017, coming off the similar 
increase in 2016. So amid all these opening of new buildings, many of them 
late
 
in the year, the ops team did a fantastic job.
 
Advertising was also a key contributor as we're continuing to make more 
value 
--
 
the offering's more valuable, both to customers and advertisers 
alike, and that was particularly strong in North America, altho
ugh not in the 
North America segment. I would also point out, AWS had a strong quarter, 
accelerating growth versus Q3 and also expanding operating margins by 100 
basis points. So particularly in North America, I would say there's the 
volume 
--
 
the strong v
olume 
--
 
top line volume, combined with increased 
advertising revenues and also very clean operational performance. 
Obviously, there's a lot of things that can happen in Q4 from weather to 
demand patterns changing. We've seen additional costs creep in, in 
the 
name of customer experience in prior years, and this was, in hindsight, 
probably one of the cleaner Q4s recently.
 
Operator
 
Our next question comes from the line of Douglas Anmuth with J.P. Morgan.
 
Douglas Anmuth
 
Brian, I was hoping you could talk about
 
how you're thinking about your 
primary investment areas in 2018 and perhaps if you could put it in context 
of '17. There things that are notably different this year relative to last year 
and also, how you think about the margin trajectory relative to what
 
we saw 
last year.
 
Brian Olsavsky
 
Sure. I will be giving you guidance quarter by quarter, but I can talk to the 
general trends in the large investment areas. Let me start with AWS 
infrastructure and the growth in technical and sales teams. That will 
contin
ue. We're [indiscernible] $20 billion run rate in top line revenues for 
AWS, up from 18% 
--
 
actually $18 billion last quarter. So we're very happy 
with both the progression in new services and features that we've been able 
to bring to customers and also th
eir response with continued geographic 
expansion and continuing to again build on our tech teams and our sales 
teams. So that would 
--
 
that expense is going to continue and likely 
increase. Prime benefits will continue to increase as well. Prime Now 
--
 
exc
use me, Prime Video, Prime Now, AmazonFresh, all of our major Prime 
benefits, we continue to expand globally.
 
Devices, as Jeff said in the press release, we are very happy with the results 
of Alexa. It's a very positive surprise for us both on a 
--
 
adding 
a little bit 
more to that, we had record device sales with very high levels of customer 
engagement, including increased levels of voice shopping, growth in 
functionality, growth in our partner, partners we work with, skills that we've 
increased rapidly, we
're over 30,000 skills for Alexa. We've got 4,000 plus 
smarthome devices from 1,200 unique brands. So that 
--
 
the relationships 
we're having with external companies is actually helping to accelerate the 
adoption of Alexa with customers. So really strong us
age of 
--
 
excuse me, 
Alexa with our devices. Obviously Echo, Echo Show and the Echo family all 
directly tied to Alexa, but also Fire TV and tablets and we're seeing more and 
more engagement. Alexa usage on Fire TV is up 9x year
-
over
-
year.
 
Music listening t
ime on Alexa was 3x higher this holiday season. So that's 
what we mean when we said far exceeding our expectations. Those are the 
things that I would point to. And that is an area again where we'll continue 
to invest heavily, and as you say, double down on
 
that. Fulfillment, again, is 
--
 
fulfillment capacity, especially the fuel strong top line growth and growth 
in Amazon fulfilled the units, which, again, is growing much quicker than our 
unit growth rate. We expect that and hope that to continue as well in
to 
2018. Video content, we spoke about on the last call. We do like the results 
we're seeing with engagement on customers, their buying habits, their 
engagement with the Video content, their use of it on devices and we will 
continue to increase our budget 
in that area. But I'd be really 
--
 
I'd 
incorporate that into the guidance each quarter as we move through the 
year.
 
Operator
 
Our next question comes from the line of Ross Sandler with Barclays.
 
Ross Sandler
 
Hey guys, just two questions. AWS reaccelerated a
gain this quarter. Can you 
just give us some color on what are the key drivers there? Was it lapping 
some of the price activity from a year ago? Was it higher utilization, moving 
up the stack? Any color there would be helpful. And then a question on 
shippi
ng costs. So it looks like it grew about 31% up on shipping costs in the 
quarter, and that's been kind of moving in tandem with the Amazon fulfilled 
unit growth. Is that the right way to think about it? It looks like it might be 
getting a little bit of lev
erage in the model right now what's driving that, the 
shipping cost leverage?
 
Brian Olsavsky
 
Sure. Let me start with that last one. Yes, the shipping costs are going to be 
very tied to AFN unit growth and also the impact often greater Prime 
adoption and faster shipping methods. So we consider that a very strong 
quarter as down sequentially in the 
growth that we've seen recently. That 
will fluctuate quarter to quarter. Again, it was a very strong operational 
quarter in Q4, and we've expanded the number of items that shipped free. 
There are now over 100 million items in the U.S. So shipping cost is a
lways 
going to be a strong part of our offering, and we're 
--
 
it's going to be 
increasing due to our business model, and we, at the same time, look then 
to minimize the cost by getting more and more efficient in that area, AWS, 
yes, if you remember last ye
ar, we did have price increases in December of 
last year towards the end.
 
So it had a partial impact on the quarter. But generally, just strong usage 
growth 
--
 
usage growth continues to be strong growing at a higher rate than 
our revenue growth rate, and c
ustomers continued to add workloads and 
expand. And as I said, we're adding new services and features all the time, 
over 1,400 in 2017 alone. So it's a number of factors, I would say. It's not 
as simple as lapping a cost error 
--
 
excuse me, price decrease 
last year, but 
we're very happy with the performance in the AWS business. Now over a 
$20 billion run rate.
 
Operator
 
Our next question comes from the line of Mark May with Citi.
 
Mark May
 
Brian, if you look back historically, your Q1 operating income guidanc
e is 
typically about $300 million, $400 million lower than your Q4. Obviously, it's 
significantly greater than that this quarter. Maybe if you could shed a little 
light on why that is so and what are some of the key drivers there. And AWS 
and cloud pricing
 
appears to have been more subtle in the recent quarters. 
Maybe if you could talk a little bit about the pricing environment and why 
that has been the case at least compared to trends from back in '14, '15, 
previously.
 
Brian Olsavsky
 
Sure. Let me start wit
h guidance. So yes, the operating income guidance is 
$300 million to $1 billion. Operating income last year was $1 billion. Q1 is 
generally when we see the volume drop off from Q4 obviously, but a lot of 
the cost remain from the year
-
over
-
year build up in 
cost, particularly in the 
fulfillment network. So it's generally a headwind every Q1. It's 
--
 
given the 
30% plus growth in square footage last year that we've built, that's 1 major 
headwind from Q4 to Q1. But we also continue to invest, particularly in 
Ale
xa and our device area. As I mentioned in a number of comments earlier, 
we're very happy with the results, the customer adoption, the device sales 
that we're seeing and the general customer acceptance there. So we will 
continue to invest there. That's prob
ably the 2 largest factors in Q1, I would 
say.
 
Dave Fildes
 
This is Dave. Just on the second piece on pricing. I think on the pricing 
environment, nothing really to call out there. I guess, just a reminder on our 
pricing philosophy for AWS, I mean periodic 
price reductions are a normal 
part of our business where reduced prices more than 60x with AWS since 
launching. So really, our kind of goal philosophy here is to drive efficiencies 
in our ops and pass those savings on to customers, and some of that's 
throu
gh, again, with the more than 60 price reductions, but also finding 
through new service and future launches, better options for customer that 
--
 
customers to present more efficient features for them to be able to run their 
businesses.
 
Operator
 
Our next que
stion comes from Dan Salmon with BMO Capital Markets.
 
Daniel Salmon
 
First, Brian, any comments on the impact of ASC 606 accounting changes on 
your first quarter guidance here? And then just second on the advertising 
business, in particular, the ads that we
 
see in the search results on the site, 
you have line search product sponsored ads, do you aim for certain 
particular ad load across the entire platform? Do you look at sort of tailoring 
it based on users activity, maybe a combination of both? I would just
 
be 
interested in your thoughts on that.
 
Dave Fildes
 
Yes, this is Dave. I'll take the first part of that question just around the new 
revenue recognition standard. We did adopt a new standard in January 1 of 
this year, 2018, and you'll see that reflected i
n our financials for the first 
quarter coming up. There are 
--
 
it touches on a number of different parts of 
our business in terms of how we recognize revenue in terms of any 
aggregate, the impacts to our expectations for the revenue guidance for the 
first 
quarter. It's not material. There's a number of different areas, at least, 
that we've called out in our filings with the 10
-
Q in the past and the 10
-
K 
that will be on file shortly that talk about the different areas that are 
impacted us. But again, not mat
erial in the aggregate.
 
Brian Olsavsky
 
And on advertising, I would say our strategy is to make the customer 
experience additive by the ad process. We want customers to be able to see 
new brands and have easier time discovering products that they're looking
 
for. For brands, we think the value proposition is that we can find ways for 
them, especially emerging brands, to reach new customers. So we're 
working with advertisers of all types and sizes to help them reach our 
customer base and the goal of driving br
and awareness, discovery and 
better purchase decisions by the customer.

Our next question comes from Justin Post with Bank of America Merrill 
Lynch.
 
Justin Post
 
I think I have two questions. First, your Whole Foods, you've got over a 
quarter under
 
your belt. How's it going versus your expectations? And what 
can Amazon really bring now that you've been there for a while, how are you 
thinking about that? And then secondly, your international decelerated a 
little bit this quarter, just wondering if th
ere was any country to call out or 
anything going on there? And we know that you spent about $3 billion on 
International investment, I guess, last year. Where do you think the high 
watermark is on that? So just maybe a little more color on your internation
al 
about business.
 
Brian Olsavsky
 
Sure. Let me start with the Whole Foods question. We're continuing to be 
very excited about the opportunities we have to innovate with the Whole 
Foods and Amazon teams together. In our physical stores, it feels there are 
s
upplemental disclosure that physical stores revenue was $4.5 billion in Q4, 
which is primarily comprised of Whole Foods and was slightly better than 
what was built into our guidance that I gave you last call. So, so far, our 
focus has been on continuing to
 
lower prices even beyond the initial ones 
that we discussed at the close of the deal in late August. We've launched 
Whole Foods products on our Amazon website, and we're 
--
 
the technical 
work continues to make Prime the Whole Foods customer rewards progra
m 
and we expect to have more on that later in the year.
 
We've also added Lockers, and much more to come. So we're very happy 
with the initial results out of the team in Whole Foods down in Austin. Also, I 
will mention that we did see a small operating inco
me loss for the quarter 
from Whole Foods. At the time of the acquisition, we had stepped up the fair 
market value of certain assets on the balance sheet. This is going to increase 
the amortization. It's a noncash charge, but it will increase the amortizati
on 
over the useful life, and a lot of that is forward frontloaded, so we'll see 
higher amortization in the first few years, and then it reverse later. So 
excluding this noncash expense items, Whole Foods had a positive operating 
income in Q4, but you'll se
e in the 10
-
K that the operating income, including 
the charges, was slightly negative in Q4. International growth, your 
comment about slowing down, I think there's a slowdown versus Q3, if that 
was your point. 28% growth in Q3, FX neutral, was helped quite
 
a bit by 
Prime Day and kind of the strengthening of Prime Day in a number of 
locales.
 
Although we've had Prime Day in most of those countries, it's really starting 
to gain more and more traction there. So that is probably more of a help to 
Q3 than a discu
ssion of any weakness in Q4. So we're 
--
 
continue to be 
pursuing the same strategy as we have in North America, adding Prime 
benefits, adding devices, adding video content, adding AmazonFresh, Prime 
Now, giving a lot of value to the Prime customers in the 
international 
countries as well and also in that numbers. In India, India continues to be a 
good story for us. We feel that it's had a lot of growth in the past year. In 
fact, more Prime members joined India's Prime program in the first year 
than we've see
n in any other country in the history of the world, our world. 
So the selection is also increasing Prime eligible selection is up over 25 
million items, launching Video there and also continuing to add other Prime 
benefits such as Prime Music will be comin
g soon, Amazon Family is there, 
as I said, Prime Video, and we had our first Prime Day in India. So that's a 
little bit on international growth.

Our next question comes from Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley.
 
Brian Nowak
 
I have two. First one, in 
the press release, you talked about the strength of 
the Prime member growth in 2017. Could you talk a little bit about to the 
--
 
what you're seeing in growth in Prime subscribers in the United States at 
this point? And are you still seeing a similar tick u
p in consumer spending as 
they come into Prime as you have in the past? And the second one , Brian, 
to go back to an earlier question on areas of investment this year, you didn't 
talk a whole lot about kind of new categories to expand into beyond the old 
r
etail business. I'd be curious to hear about your investment needed to go 
into logistics, health care and kind of new areas you haven't really cracked 
into as hard yet.
 
Dave Fildes
 
Yes, this is Dave, thanks for the answer the question, Brian. Just on the f
irst 
piece, in terms of just Prime membership and Prime behavior, we continue 
to see that we're seeing sign
-
ups from memberships at a strong clip. When 
we look at the year
-
over
-
year growth in paid Prime members on a global 
basis, it's been consistent in Q4
 
year
-
over
-
year, similar growth rates year
-
over
-
year to what we've seen in some of the earlier quarters of this year. So 
that's, of course, a mix of strength in the U.S. and also strength in some of 
the newer markets that we've launched or introduced the P
rime program in. 
We continue to see that as Prime members sign up and engage into the 
program, their purchasing patterns of change and they do spend more as 
they move into the program. And of course, our focus is 
--
 
continues to be 
on adding some of the fe
atures around Prime that Brian's been talking 
about, but also importantly, making sure we're adding more selection to the 
offering through our own efforts, first party, but also programs like 
Fulfillment by Amazon, which continues to be a fast grower for u
s.
 
Brian Olsavsky
 
Yes, and on new businesses or expansion of categories, as you discussed, I 
would not talk to anything that's not been publicly announced, but on some 
of the ones you mentioned, they are underway and are continuing. I've said 
logistics, we
 
will continue to build our logistics capability both 
--
 
and that will 
be all the way to end delivery. We've been able to increase service levels in 
many cases by delivering ourselves. And although we have a strong partner 
network here, we will always be a
ble to leverage our strength and our 
knowledge about where shipments are going, both within our network and to 
final customers that will create opportunities for us there as we increase or 
better the customer experience as well.
 
I would say on the category
 
side, that the biggest effort will be on continuing 
to be on groceries and consumables with the Whole Foods acquisition and 
again, we continue to look at our whole offering of AmazonFresh, Prime 
Now, Whole Foods, how can they work together to create bette
r and better 
offerings for our customer base. And to a lesser extent, versus grocery, I 
would say we continue to build our business, B2B businesses, and very 
happy with the initial performance there with a number of the companies 
and universities that we'v
e been working with and their initial results.

Our next question comes from the line of Scott Mushkin with Wolfe 
Research.
 
Scott Mushkin
 
Hey, guys, so I wanted to go back to, and I think you said one of the biggest 
focuses of the year is going to 
be on the consumables now, Fresh, Whole 
Foods. There's been a lot of press on the Whole Foods front, the out
-
of
-
stock 
issue and then clearly, in the Now, as we've been testing it, the Fresh has 
the same issue. So I was wondering if you guys could talk abou
t what the 
company plans to do. I mean, there is obviously the reputational risk that 
could come from that to kind of correct some of these issues and kind of 
what the view of the company is on the out
-
of
-
stock issues. Not just the 
Whole Foods but just gen
erally across the consumables business in Fresh 
and Now.
 
Brian Olsavsky
 
Yes, let me just back it to a more general statement. I'd say Whole Foods is 
not less in their commitment to providing the best selection of high
-
quality 
products and having them in st
ock for customers. We've made no changes 
post acquisition that would have impacted anything related to in stock, 
except perhaps the fact that the price decreases have brought up demand 
and there's an amount of rebalancing related to that. So I think the ou
t
-
of
-
stock issue is that 
--
 
may be getting press or tied more to the increased 
demand that we're seeing and also selective weather
-
related restocking 
issues.
 
But stepping beyond any short
-
term issues, the commitment is 
--
 
remains to 
have healthy, high
-
qual
ity selection in stock for products. That's what the 
Whole Foods team is committed to. That's what the Amazon team, with 
them, is committed to, and also across any delivery channel that we have, 
AmazonFresh, Prime Now or Whole Foods. So where there's issue
s, they'll be 
corrected. Where there's areas we can improve our selection and delivery for 
customers, we'll do so. But it be something we're working on. So the 
immediacy, the perishability are all challenges everyone has in this area, but 
we're confident t
hat we will have a good service and continue to delight 
customers.

Our next question comes from the line of Youssef Squali with SunTrust 
Robinson Humphrey.
 
Youssef Squali
 
We've seen that the number of private label products on the site has 
increas
ed pretty dramatically over the last 12 to 18 months. Could you 
speak to your private label strategy, in general? How big is that segment 
today? How big can it become? And just broadly speaking, how are the 
margins in that segment versus comparable third
-
p
arty products?
 
Dave Fildes
 
Yes, thanks for the question. This is Dave. I think broadly, when we look at 
our strategy, it's focused on, number one, providing a broad selection for 
customers across a number of categories, so that they can find and buy 
exactl
y what they're looking for. When you look at private brands, it's very 
much meant to supplement that great selection, and we look for ways to be 
able to find private label items that have a high
-
caliber of quality, but also 
can bring that selection and tha
t convenience for customers and really 
supplement what vendors and sellers are already providing the customers in 
many cases. We've not broken out kind of how significant or how large that 
is. I think for a lot of these initiatives, when you look across ca
tegories that 
would offer, many of them are still earlier stage and have been around even 
from kind of infancy for shorter period of time, a year, a couple of years, in 
some cases.
 
Amazon Fashion is one area where you're seeing us offer a number of 
private
 
apparel brands and some of the more popular lines with customers 
things like Good Threads, Amazon's Essentials, which is men's and women's 
basics; consumables, is, of course, another big area where we have the 
benefit of working with some of the Whole Foo
ds private label, but also 
doing some of our other Amazon brands, things like Happy Belly and 
[indiscernible] Prime and others. So I think we'll continue to iterate on those 
and try to find different areas. And certainly there's other verticals that I 
didn
't mention there that we're interested in continuing to kind of learn from 
customers what they want and what they're looking for there, and so we'll 
keep adding selection.
 
Operator
 
Our next question comes from the line of Ken Sena with Wells Fargo.
 
Kenneth
 
Sena
 
Maybe if you could just remind us of the thinking that behind keeping AWS 
and Retail under 1 corporate structure, and does it make sense given the 
scale of where AWS is right now? And then 
--
 
and I'm sorry if I have a little 
bit of an echo, I don't k
now why, but 
--
 
and we're hearing from marketers 
just how important Amazon is to their media strategy, so I don't know if you 
could just maybe talk about that a little bit more broadly in terms of the 
approach in your philosophy to that business.
 
Dave Fild
es
 
Sure, we see a lot of value in all of our businesses. And AWS is a key 
component, as is the physical consumer business. The 
--
 
what I'll point out 
is, the management team is a common management team. The consumer 
business, if you will, is, if not the bi
ggest, one of the largest customers of 
AWS. So we see a lot of commonality there where we, as depending on the 
position in the company, on the consumer side, the use of AWS is 
--
 
has 
driven great infrastructure efficiencies just like other companies see wh
en 
they use AWS, turning fixed costs into variable costs and pooling resources 
and not having a lot of trapped capacity throughout the company and taking 
advantage of all the new services and features. So as an internal customer, 
the consumer business is v
ery happy with AWS. And I think AWS is also very 
benefited by the fact that they have a large internal beta customer that tries 
out and uses a lot of their products and services. So it's a good combination 
for a lot of reasons, and we see no reason to chan
ge the structure that we 
have.
 
Brian Olsavsky
 
Yes, and sorry, Ken, your second question was?
 
Kenneth Sena
 
Yes, the second question was just on the advertising side. And we're just 
hearing so much more how important Amazon is to broader media 
budgets. 
And so just hoping to get maybe a little bit more color just on your approach 
to the business right now, some of the drivers behind the recent success and 
just maybe just more of a sort of, as you look out over the next few years, 
kind of how impo
rtant do you see this business becoming in the grand 
scheme of things?
 
Dave Fildes
 
Yes, I mean, I think right now, we're really just focused on finding ways to 
work with those companies, whether it's vendors or sellers that are coming 
to us, and offer 
them a great experience on the website and ability to be 
able to reach customers. So I think there's more to come on that side. As we 
said, we're definitely seeing some strong growth in our advertising revenues 
as part of the other revenue line item. And I
 
think we're going to keep 
building more and new tools based on what we're learning from our 
customers there to better serve in the future.
 
Brian Olsavsky
 
Yes, I think we're also point of a key lien in from brands and agencies into 
the e
-
commerce marketing
 
space. So it's other side, search or social 
marketing, it's really helping them engage customers on a high, efficient, 
highly efficient manner.

Thank you for standing by. Good day, everyone, and welcome to the 
Amazon.com Q4 2015 Financial Results Teleconference. At this time, all 
participants are in a listen
-
only mode. After the presentation, we will 
conduct a 
question
-
and
-
answer session. Today's call is being recorded. For 
opening remarks, I will be turning the call over to the Director of Investor 
Relations, Phil Hardin. Please go ahead.
 
Phil Hardin
 
Hello and welcome to our Q4 2015 financial results conference
 
call. Joining 
us today is Brian Olsavsky, our CFO. We will be available for questions after 
our prepared remarks.
 
The following discussion and responses to your questions reflect 
management's view as of today, January 28, 2016 only, and will include 
forwa
rd
-
looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional 
information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is 
included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our 
most recent annual report
 
on Form 10
-
K. As you listen to today's conference 
call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which 
includes our financial results, as well as metrics and commentary on the 
quarter.
 
During this call, we will discuss certain non
-
GAAP 
financial measures. In our 
press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the 
SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional 
disclosures regarding these non
-
GAAP measures, including reconciliations of 
these m
easures with comparable GAAP measures. Finally, unless otherwise 
stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the 
comparable period of 2014.
 
Now, I'll turn the call over to Brian.
 
Brian Olsavsky
 
Thanks, Phil. I'll begin with comment
s on our fourth quarter financial results. 
Trailing 12
-
months operating cash flow increased 74% to $11.9 billion. 
Trailing 12
-
month free cash flow increased to $7.3 billion, up from $1.9 
billion.
 
Trailing 12
-
month free cash flow less lease principle repaym
ents increased to 
$4.7 billion, up from $529 million. Trailing 12
-
month free cash flow less 
finance lease principle repayments and assets acquired under capital leases 
increased to $2.5 billion, up from an outflow of $2.2 billion. Trailing 12
-
month capital
 
expenditures were $4.6 billion.
 
Capital expenditures does not include the impact of property and equipment 
acquired under capital and finance lease obligations. These capital 
expenditures and capital leases reflect additional investments in support of 
con
tinued business growth, due to investments in technology infrastructure, 
the majority of which is to support AWS, and additional capacity to support 
our fulfillment operations.
 
The combination of common stock and stock
-
based awards outstanding was 
490 mill
ion shares, compared with 483 million one year ago. Worldwide 
revenue increased 22% to $35.7 billion, or 26% excluding the $1.2 billion 
unfavorable impact from year
-
over
-
year changes in foreign exchange. 
Worldwide paid unit growth was 26%.
 
Worldwide active
 
customer accounts were approximately 304 million. 
Excluding customers who only had free orders in the preceding 12
-
month 
period, worldwide active customer accounts were approximately 280 million, 
up from approximately 254 million in the comparable prior y
ear period.
 
Worldwide paid Prime members increased 51% year
-
over
-
year. Worldwide 
seller units represented 47% of paid units. Fulfillment by Amazon or FBA 
units represented nearly 50% of seller units. Worldwide active Amazon Web 
Services customers exceeded 
1 million.
 
Now I'll discuss operating expenses, excluding stock
-
based compensation. 
Cost of sales was $24.3 billion or 68.1% of revenue, compared with 70.5%. 
Fulfillment, marketing, technology and content and G&A combined was $9.7 
billion or 27.1% of sales
, up approximately 100 basis points year
-
over
-
year.
 
Fulfillment was $4.4 billion or 12.3% of revenue, compared with 11.3%. 
Tech and content was $3.2 billion or 9% of revenue, compared with 8.2%. 
Marketing was $1.7 billion or 4.8% of revenue, compared with 
5.1%.
 
Now I'll talk about our segment results. As a reminder, in the first quarter 
we changed our reportable segments to report North America, international, 
and Amazon web services. Consistent with prior periods, we do not allocate 
to segments, our stock
-
based compensation, or the other operating expense 
line item.
 
In the North America segment, revenue grew 24% to $21.5 billion. Media 
revenue grew 11% to $3.9 billion or 12% excluding foreign exchange. EGM 
revenue grew 28% to $17.3 billion.
 
North America se
gment operating income was $1 billion, a 4.7% operating 
margin, compared with $733 million in the prior year period. North America 
segment operating income includes $6 million of favorable impact from 
foreign exchange.
 
In the international segment, revenue
 
grew 12% to $11.8 billion. Excluding 
the $1.1 billion year
-
over
-
year unfavorable foreign exchange impact, 
revenue growth was 22%. Media revenue decreased 3% to $3.3 billion or 
increased 5% excluding foreign exchange. EGM revenue grew 19% to $8.5 
billion o
r 31% excluding foreign exchange.
 
International segment operating income was $60 million, compared with $65 
million in the prior year. International segment operating income includes 
$47 million of unfavorable impact from foreign exchange.
 
In the Amazon We
b Services segment, revenue grew 69% to $2.4 billion. 
Amazon Web Services segment operating income was $687 million, a 28.5% 
operating margin, compared with $240 million in the prior year period. AWS 
segment operating income includes $60 million of favorab
le impact from 
foreign exchange.
 
Consolidated segment operating income was $1.8 billion or 4.9% of revenue, 
up approximately 140 basis points year
-
over
-
year. CSOI includes $20 million 
of favorable impact from foreign exchange.
 
Unlike CSOI, our GAAP operati
ng income includes stock
-
based compensation 
expense and other operating expense. GAAP operating income grew 88% to 
$1.1 billion.
 
Our income tax expense was $453 million. GAAP net income was $482 
million or $1 per diluted share, compared with a net income o
f $214 million 
and $0.45 per diluted share.
 
Now I'll discuss the full year results. Revenue increased 20% to $107 billion 
or 26% excluding year
-
over
-
year changes in foreign exchange. North 
America revenue grew 25% to $63.7 billion or 26% excluding year
-
ove
r
-
year changes in foreign exchange. International revenue grew 6% to $35.4 
billion or 21% excluding year
-
over
-
year changes in foreign exchange.
 
Excluding year
-
over
-
year changes in foreign exchange, Germany revenue 
grew 18%. Japan revenue grew 19%, and UK r
evenue grew 16%. AWS 
revenue grew 70% to $7.9 billion.
 
Consolidated segment operating income was $4.5 billion or 4.2% of revenue, 
up approximately 220 basis points year
-
over
-
year. CSOI includes $16 [ph] 
million of favorable impact from foreign 
exchange. GAAP operating income 
was $2.2 billion, compared with $178 million in the prior year.
 
Turning to the balance sheet, cash and marketable securities increased $2.4 
billion year
-
over
-
year to $19.8 billion. Inventory increased 23% to $10.2 
billion. A
nd inventory turns were 8.5, down from 8.6 turns a year ago, as we 
expanded selection, improved in
-
stock levels, and introduced new product 
categories. Accounts payable increased 24% to $20.4 billion, and accounts 
payable days increased to 77 from 73 in th
e prior year.
 
I'll conclude my portion of today's call with guidance. Incorporated into our 
guidance are the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe 
today to be appropriately conservative assumptions.
 
Our results are inherently unpredictab
le, and may be materially affected by 
many factors, including a high level of uncertainty surrounding exchange 
rate fluctuations, as well as the global economy, and customer spending. It's 
not possible to accurately predict demand, and therefore our actual
 
results 
could differ materially from our guidance.
 
As we describe in more detail in our public filings, issues such as settling 
intercompany balances in foreign currencies among our subsidiaries, 
unfavorable resolution of legal matters, and changes to our
 
effective tax rate 
can all have a material effect on guidance.
 
Our guidance further assumes that we don't conclude any additional 
business acquisitions, investments, restructurings or legal settlements, 
recording further revisions to stock
-
based compensat
ion estimates, and that 
foreign exchange rates remain approximately where they have been 
recently.
 
For Q1 2016, we expect net sales of between $26.5 billion and $29 billion or 
growth of between 17% and 28%. This guidance anticipates approximately 
130 basis
 
points of unfavorable impact from foreign exchange rates.
 
GAAP operating income to be between $100 million and $700 million, 
compared with $255 million in first quarter of 2015. This includes 
approximately $600 million for stock
-
based compensation and oth
er 
operating expenses net.
 
We anticipate consolidated segment operating income, which excludes stock
-
based compensation and other operating expense net, to be between $700 
million and $1.3 billion, compared with $706 million in the first quarter of 
2015.
 
W
e are grateful to our customers and remain heads down focused on driving 
a better customer experience. We believe putting customers first, is the only 
reliable way to create lasting value for shareholders.
 
Thanks. And with that, Phil, let's move on to ques
tions.
 
Phil Hardin
 
Great. Thanks, Brian. Let's move onto the Q&A portion of the call. Operator, 
will you please remind our listeners how to initiate a question?
 
Question
-
and

Answer Session
 
Operator
 
[Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question is c
oming from analyst 
Stephen Ju with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.
 
Stephen Ju
 
Hey, thanks. So Brian, I think in the past you've given some indication as to 
what usage growth may be at AWS. I was wondering if you have an update 
for that in
 
the fourth quarter.
 
And secondarily, is there any way to characterize what the pricing 
environment is right now for AWS as well? Thank you.
 
Brian Olsavsky
 
Yes, thanks, Stephen. No, I don't have a usage growth number for you. We'll 
say we're 
-
 
it's been ve
ry strong. And AWS revenue is on a, just short of a 
$10 billion run rate at the end of Q4.
 
As far as pricing is concerned, we had a price reduction in January for our 
EC2 services. It was our 51st price reduction since we launched AWS years 
ago. And genera
lly what we find is that price is important. But so is speed 
and agility for customers and the ability to deliver services and features that 
were beneficial to them.
 
I will point out that we added 722 new features and services in 2015 and 
that was up 40% y
ear
-
over
-
year. So we feel we have a lead in this space 
and we don't take it for granted and we want to serve customers better each 
year.
 
Stephen Ju
 
Thank you.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question is from analyst Jason Helfstein with 
Oppenheimer. Please pr
oceed with your question.
 
Jason Helfstein
 
Thank you. Can you talk a little bit about the dynamics in fourth quarter 
eCommerce, particularly in the US? Did we see more aggressive promotional 
activity and maybe talk about how you tried to work that to 
continue to drive 
the Prime number of members going forward? Thanks.
 
Brian Olsavsky
 
Sure. Well, what I can say is our approach to pricing has not changed. And 
through Q4 [ph] we did everything we could to have the best prices 
available for customers and in
 
stock in time for the holiday.
 
Another dynamic of Q4 was that it was a huge FBA quarter, nearly 50% of 
our third party units were FBA and our third party units were also up to 47% 
of our paid units, up 400 basis points year
-
over
-
year.
 
So a really strong q
uarter for our FBA sellers using our FBA services. It did 
put a lot of demands on our warehouses and we were full. It was a very 
busy quarter and it did increase some of our variable costs as a result, 
primarily in the US, but a very strong quarter for FBA
. It exceeded our 
-
 
even our expectations.
 
Jason Helfstein
 
Perhaps how are you able to integrate that into holiday promotions?
 
Brian Olsavsky
 
I'm sorry. You cut off there. Could you repeat your question?
 
Jason Helfstein
 
Sure. Just any additional color arou
nd Prime and how you were able to 
integrate that into holiday promotions?
 
Brian Olsavsky
 
Nothing specific. I will say, you know, one interesting enhancement this year 
was our Prime Now service, which allowed people order in selected markets 
up until 11.59 
on New Year, excuse me, Christmas Eve. So that was a 
valuable service to many late shoppers, last
-
minute shoppers.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question is from Aram Rubinson with Wolfe Research. 
Please proceed with your question.
 
Aram Rubinson
 
Hey. Thanks
 
very much. Two questions both on the logistics side. It seems 
pretty clear that you guys are trafficking in some old world assets, like truck 
trailers and ship lanes and air fields.
 
Can you help give us a sense as to maybe what we're trying to accomplish 
with that, if it's defensive to protect your service to your existing customers 
or if you're looking to maybe start new businesses with those assets?
 
Brian Olsavsky
 
Sure, Aram. Thanks for your question. I would say what we've found is in 
order to serve 

 
p
roperly serve our customers at peak. We've needed to add 
more of our own logistics to supplement our existing partners. That's not 
meant to replace them.
 
And those carriers are just not 
-
 
no longer able to handle all of our capacity 
that we need at peak. T
hey have been and continue to be great partners. 
And we look forward to working with them in the future.
 
It's just we've had to add some resources on our own. You mentioned 
trucks. The Amazon trucks, we did invest in those 
-
 
this past year. We use 
those pr
imarily for movement between our warehouses and our source 
centers.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Nowak with 
Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.
 
Brian Nowak
 
Thanks for taking my questions. I've got two. T
he first one is just on gross 
margins. I think they were down of about 200 basis points sequentially. It's 
the biggest fall in the fourth quarter in quite sometime. Anything you call out 
there, is the devices are more 
-
 
sortation center, is anything pressu
ring 
gross margins we should think about in the fourth quarter?
 
And then on the fulfillment line, you mentioned FBA being a big driver of the 
growth in the fulfillment costs. Anything else you would call out leading to 
incremental fulfillment costs, 
maybe India or something else? Thanks.
 
Brian Olsavsky
 
No. And again, keep in mind that the fulfillment as a percent of revenue is 
impacted by the calculation of FBA revenue being a net number as opposed 
to a full revenue number. But our fulfillment costs p
er unit actually 
decreased year
-
over
-
year. It just we are now shipping more and more of 
our, other demand out of our warehouses, because of the strength in retail 
and FBA.
 
On gross margin, I would 
-
 
first I'll caution you and say, we would 
encourage you to
 
look at free cash flow, which was 

 
grew at minimum of $4 
billion on each of the metrics that we point out and our profit which was up 
88% year
-
over
-
year.
 
If you look sequentially, also keep in mind that in Q3 when it was up 500 
basis points year
-
over
-
yea
r, that was lapping the write
-
down of our Amazon 
phone [ph] inventory the prior year. So there is a little bit of noise in the Q3 
number.
 
But generally, again, we're happy with the ability to service customers, the 
reaction of customers in Q4, and the bott
om line results that we had.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Colin Sebastian with 
Baird Equity Research. Please proceed with your question.
 
Colin Sebastian
 
Great, thanks. One follow
-
up and then another question. On the logistic
s and 
transportation side, I was curious if that's to date just to supplement some 
of the other carriers. But more broadly or longer term, is there an ambition 
from the services side to perhaps provide capacity to other companies.
 
And then on AWS margins, 
I was just wondering if we should expect more 
leverage there going forward and whether Q1, whether that should 
demonstrate some seasonality versus what we've seen in terms of 
sequential growth in prior years? Thank you.
 
Brian Olsavsky
 
Sure. Let me work bac
kwards. We don't give guidance by segment. So we 
cannot really comment on AWS specifically in Q1. And the operational 
improvements, excuse me, the gross margin, operating margin year
-
over
-
year that we've seen in the AWS business has been heavily driven by 
operating efficiencies, both purchase reductions and purchase prices and 
also efficiency in driving greater utilization of the assets that we have.
 
So we're very happy with that. Keep in mind that we did have a 
-
 
although 
the year
-
over
-
year increase in cap
ital expenditures and capital leases was 
not as great as we saw in 2013 to 2014, we did spend over $9 billion on 
those, on capital expenditures and capital lease obligations, up from prior 

 
Operator
 

 
Brian O
lsavsky
 
Sorry, let me finish my answer to him, please. We grew up 

 
we grew from 
in the $5 billion range in 2013 to $8.9 billion in 2014 and now over $9 billion 
in 2015.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ken Senna with 
Evercore I
SI. Please proceed with your question.
 
Ken Senna
 
Hi. So lot of headlines around Amazon's activity at Sundance I just was 
hoping you could maybe expand once more on the video strategy and 
specifically are you seeing an inflection in Prime Video usage. And m
aybe 
just also on your streaming partners program, what the general reception is 
like? Thank you.
 
Brian Olsavsky
 
Sure. We're very thrilled with the customer response to Prime Video. Again, 
when Prime Video is used by our Prime members, it drives adoption a
nd 
retention, higher free trial conversion rates, and higher renewal rates for 
subscribers. So what we were encouraged by in Q4 was that globally we 
doubled the number of 

 
our Prime members doubled the number of viewing 
hours of the Prime Video year
-
over
-
year. And internationally, we had twice 
as member Prime members streaming year
-
over
-
year. So very encouraged 
by the pickup and the response of customers.
 
The other comment I would say about video is we're very happy with the 
Amazon Studios content, in part
icular. We've had some great success in 
2014 and 2015. As you probably know, Transparent has won multiple 
Golden Globes and Emmys, both for actors and for the show itself. Mozart in 
the Jungle just won two Golden Globe Awards.
 
So very, very pleased with th
e critical acclaim to the Amazon Studios 
content and we've got a lot of new content coming out this year. 
Catastrophe Season 2, Bosch Season 2, we're all looking forward to.
 
And in February, we will have Chi
-
Raq, our first original movie that we got to 
wor
k with Spike Lee on, which won many critical, made many critics' best 
film list in 2015. That will be coming to Prime Video in February.
 
Phil Hardin
 
Just to add, this is Phil. On the question about the streaming partners 
program, so that's our new over 
the top streaming subscription program for 
Prime Members. We think it's a really convenient way for them to access 
additional content, content sources like Showtime and Starz. And it's really 
early, so it's just out of the gate. But we've been very pleased
 
with what 
we've seen so far.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney with 
RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.
 
Mark Mahaney
 
Two things, please. Any callouts on the macro side? Occasionally you called 
th
ings out, anything this time? And then can you talk a little bit about 
Amazon business, I know, there is a little bit of a line in the press release on 
it. I know you've had this for a couple of years. But any indications to 
materiality of that, the kind o
f momentum it's gaining, the kind of traction 
it's gaining? Thank you.
 
Brian Olsavsky
 
Sure, Mark. Thanks for your questions. No macroeconomic comments. 
Again, we feel we're very encouraged by the customer response to our 
offerings in Q4. Amazon business, y
es, in April you may remember we 
launched it as a marketplace with specific features and benefits for 
businesses.
 
That 
-
 
Amazon business now serves more than 200,000 businesses from 
small organizations to Fortune 500 companies. So it's still early, but we'
re 
encouraged and we think we're creating some value, a lot of value for our 
business customers.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark May with Citi. 
Please proceed with your question.
 
Mark May
 
Thanks. Brian, question on interna
tional retail business. I think you added 
well over a billion in revenue year
-
on
-
year in the quarter, but from a CSOI 
perspective, you really didn't see any improvement there. I'm sure there is, 
there are a lot of different things going on.
 
I just wondered
 
if you could unpack that a little bit and give us a sense of, 
you know, what profitability looks like maybe in some of your more mature, 
established countries and regions, relative to the investments you were 
making in other countries, so that we can kind
 
of get a better picture of 
what's actually going on under the hood there? Thanks.
 
Brian Olsavsky
 
Sure, Mark. Thanks for your question. We are very pleased by the 
international growth, 22% FX neutral, was up 1000 basis points year
-
over
-
year. We saw that th
e 
-
 
we told you the Prime growth, Prime membership 
growth of 50% in
--
 
excuse me, 51% globally, 47% in the US means that the 
international Prime programs grew at a faster clip than that.
 
So very pleased with the up
-
tick. We rolled out a lot of additional Pr
ime 
features internationally as well this year, from FREE Same
-
Day to Prime Now 
to Prime Music and Prime Video in Japan, to name a few. So very happy with 
that.
 
But in general, if I step back, our investments in national are twofold. First, 
there's the Pri
me platform and all the features that I just mentioned, 
including the fulfillment, adding more fulfillment resources to handle higher 
and higher retail volumes and very strong FBA program as well.
 
And then the remainder 
-
 
the biggest other investment area 
is obviously 
India. And we like 

 
we continue to see, like what we see in India. In Q4 
Amazon India was the top e
-
commerce site in India throughout the very 
busy diwali shopping season, including the shopping season, according to 
comScore. And sales by sel
lers in Q4 were greater than all of 2014 combined 
in Q4.
 
So seeing great progress with downloads, innovations for sellers and 
customers alike. And we like the ramp there and we're continuing to invest 
in India.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question comes f
rom the line of Douglas Anmuth with 
JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.
 
Douglas Anmuth
 
Thanks for taking the question. Two things. Just first, on the North America 
EGM growth, if you could just talk about the 28% there and the decel on an 
easier c
omp and whether there's any particular factors within that we should 
be thinking about and perhaps if there was any weather and apparel impact 
there?
 
And then second, last quarter, and I don't want to misquote you, but you 
said something along the lines of
 
being able to invest as you'd like and also 
deliver good profit and that the pendulum wouldn't swing as far perhaps as 
it has in the past. Is that statement and thought still hold as you head into 
'16? Thanks.
 
Brian Olsavsky
 
Sure. Let me start with EGM. S
o EGM growth, North America EGM growth of 
28% was actually also the highest in the last 4 years. So we're happy with 
that. The deceleration you're seeing of 700 basis points is more a function of 
the Prime Day that we had in Q3, if you remember. We didn't 
break it out by 
segment, but we said that Prime Day contributed 200 basis points to our Q3 
run rate, revenue growth rate.
 
So sequentially last year, any North America EGM we dropped from 31% to 
27%. This year, it's 35% to 28%. So there is always a 
-
 
generally a 
sequential drop in Q4. But certainly very happy with that business and its 
role in Prime as well, total customer satisfaction.
 
Your other question, investments. Yes. We continue to have healthy 
investments as we've stated across the globe. To s
tep back again on that, 
our general philosophy is we want to find things 
-
 
businesses that customers 
love, that can grow to be large, will provide strong financial returns, and are 
durable that can last for decades.
 
We think Prime is that. We think marketp
lace is that. We think AWS is that. 
And we are constantly looking for a fourth or fifth business that fits that 
criteria. So 
-
 
but as we continue to invest, primarily in.
 
As I said in Prime, the Prime platform, Prime features for customers, 
expansion for f
ulfillment capacity as we build out to support 26% unit 
growth in Q4, for instance and much greater FBA share, and not to mention 
all the investments in AWS, we are constantly looking for cost efficiencies 
and fixing variable productivity.
 
I think a thing 
to think about is the investments will ebb and flow over time, 
but our focus on cost reductions and improvement on customer experience 
will be constant.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Heath Terry with 
Goldman Sachs. Please pro
ceed with your question.
 
Heath Terry
 
Great, thanks. I was wondering if you could give us a sense, you know, as 
we look at the slowing growth in AWS, obviously still from an incredibly high 
level and still very strong growth there. But take 
-
 
try and take t
hat into 
context with the growth in margins that you keep seeing in that business to 
levels that certainly seem a lot higher than you would anticipate for an 
Amazon business.
 
Is there any capacity constraint or management that, that's driving pricing 
strat
egy in AWS? We've heard the comments about the number of 
availability zones that are being launched this year, which is obviously 
about, a big part of driving incremental capacity in that business and just 
trying to balance those, think about how we should
 
balance those three 
things?
 
Brian Olsavsky
 
Sure. Let me work backwards from your footprint question or comment. We 
have 
-
 
we just announced Korea as a region and we'll be adding five more 
regions in the next, in the future, in the near future, as we 
mentioned.
 
CapEx, let me start with that first. CapEx, we've seen great efficiencies in 
capital expenditures, particularly in AWS. And we continue to work on better 
purchase efficiencies and driving utilization rates in our data centers. CapEx, 
as I mentio
ned, grew quite a bit in 2014 and grew even more to over $9 
billion across all of our capital expenditures and capital leases in 2015.
 
From the new regions, they are not the major driver in any way. Most of our 
capacity and capital and capital leases in AW
S is to service existing regions 
and existing customers demand growth. But there is certainly expenditures 
when we open up new regions. Some of that is not always in the year that 
we open the region. So we spent a good bit on those new regions already in 
2
015.
 
But as far as pricing, there's no capacity constraint, and I would a little bit 
dispute the deceleration comment on, yes, on a percentage basis, 69% is 
lower than Q3. But as I said before, we're approaching a $10 billion run rate 
in this business.
 
On 
a dollar basis, we continue to grow 

 
we saw the greatest growth year
-
over
-
year and quarter
-
over
-
quarter and, again, we continue to invent, now 
with our price, we continue to innovate on behalf of customers and see great 
customer response.
 
Heath Terry
 
Sure
, sure. Got it. Thank you.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kerry Rice with 
Needham & Company. Please proceed with your question.
 
Kerry Rice
 
Thanks a lot. First question is if you can provide maybe some context around 
linearity 
within Q4, more as a, you know, compares to your expectations, 
obviously you have a ramp up into the holiday season, but was 
-
 
did 
December tail off faster than expected or did the ramp up, did it spike higher 
than you expected?
 
And then just on the follow
-
up, maybe can you add some context about how 
the mobile played a role in the holiday season for Amazon? Thanks.
 
Phil Hardin
 
So in terms of 
-
 
this is Phil. In terms of expectations, I think we were 
pleased with what we saw this Q4 and, you know, if you loo
k at what we 
gave for guidance, we were in the upper half of the range there for revenue. 
So no real callouts there. I think, what was your second part of your 
question?
 
Oh, and mobile, we said for a long time continues to be a tailwind for the 
business. W
e're working very hard to make sure that it's very easy for 
customers to buy the things they want to buy and access, a lot of the 

focused on the convenience factor.
 
And if you look at s
ome of our new offerings like Prime Now that's available 
through a mobile app and very convenient for customers. As Brian's 
mentioned, allowed them to shop even up to Christmas Eve and then have 
their items delivered in two hours.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. 
Our next question comes from Carlos Kirjner with Bernstein. 
Please proceed with your question.
 
Carlos Kirjner
 
Thank you. I have two. I want to go back to AWS margins. You talked briefly 
about purchasing an asset utilization. But do these explain the 800 bp
s on a 
year
-
on
-
year margin expansion? And are you seeing anything else? Like, is 
there any impact of scale driving leverage over fixed costs? Is there some 
benefit from revenue mix shift, like services like Aurora and Redshift growing 
faster than EC2 or is
 
all the margin expansion due to purchasing and asset 
utilization? So that's the first question.
 
And the second, I have a question about your streaming content expenses 
or cost of revenues to be more precise. Last year you told us they were $1.3 
billion, b
ut if you can give us a figure for '15. In lieu of that, can you 
comment on whether 4Q saw higher than usual costs for streaming content 
compared to other quarters in the year? Thank you.
 
Phil Hardin
 
Carlos, this is Phil. So your question about the AWS mar
gins, that business 
as they continued to learn and as we continue to invent and get better at 
designing and operating the infrastructure and assets, we have been able to 
drive costs out of that business. So that's one of the primary drivers of the 
improvem
ents that you see in margin year
-
over
-
year.
 
There's also an FX tailwind in there as well, which I think was about $60 
million this quarter, which would contribute on a year
-
over
-
year basis, which 
really arises because we're largely priced in dollars, but h
ave assets with 
local currency costs throughout the world.
 
As for the streaming content, we haven't given another update this year and 
haven't given any commentary on the profile quarter
-
to
-
quarter.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. The next question comes from Brian Pi
tz with Jefferies. Please 
proceed with your question.
 
Brian Pitz
 
Thank you. You mentioned Amazon Dash in the press release. Can you give 
us some color around how you're viewing the traction there both with 
customers and with brands and devices? And then ma
ybe any update on 
Twitch. How is traffic and user engagement been trending on that site? 
Thanks.
 
Phil Hardin
 
This is Phil. So on the Dash Buttons, we're really excited about what we're 
delivering there. I think, as you saw in the release, there are some ne
w 
devices that take advantage of the underlying service that we think will be 
really convenient for sellers and interesting for device makers. So we're 
excited about what we're building there. Don't have any stats for you today.
 
On the Twitch side, we cont
inue to let Twitch do what Twitch does best. And 
so don't have any updates on numbers there. But they continue to really 
engage customers and offer a really unique experience, which was one of 
the reasons we were attracted to them to start with.
 
Brian Pitz
 
And maybe just quickly, end of year fulfillment and sortation centers?
 
Brian Olsavsky
 
Yes. I'll take that. So we ended the year at 123 fulfillment centers, up a net 
14, and we have 23 sortation centers in the US, up four year
-
over
-
year.
 
Operator
 
Our next 
question comes from the line of Gene Munster with Piper Jaffray. 
Please proceed with your questions.
 
Gene Munster
 
Hey, good afternoon. I want to just quickly revisit the margin pendulum 
question and some of your comments, as you mentioned that to kind of 
e
xpect it to ebb and flow. Could you tell us if you expect it to ebb and flow, 
but moving higher or is ebb and flow just mean that, that it's kind of 
undetermined in 2016?
 
And then second follow up is the Robotics, any update in terms of number of 
robots or
 
how you see that expansion going forward? Thank you.
 
Brian Olsavsky
 
Yes, my comment on ebb and flow was more about the investment and also 
including capital expenditures and capital leases, so not around gross 
margins. And merely I was pointing out that, 
again, we've laid out all the 
invested areas where we're seeing heavy investment.
 
We continue 
-
 
we see continuation of that certainly into 2016 and beyond. 
There are quarter
-
to
-
quarter and even year
-
to
-
year fluctuations in some 
accounts, and some 
investment areas.
 
But generally we're pretty transparent on where we're investing our dollars. 
And then against that backdrop, we are always looking for efficiency and the 
nice thing about growing the top line at such a high clip is we have a lot 
more area
s for opportunity to save money year
-
over
-
year and we always 
look to do that.
 
Phil Hardin
 
And this is Phil. On the Kiva question, the last update we've given is more 
than 30,000 robots. We continue to be really pleased with the program and 
like what it doe
s in the warehouse, both from a density of storage, as well as 
from making the jobs easier for the associates who are picking packages, by 
bringing the packages actually to the associates. But no new numbers on 
that.
 
Operator
 
Our next question comes from t
he line of Justin Post with Bank of America 
Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.
 
Justin Post
 
Thank you. Two questions. Was there any category mix impacts in the 
quarter on gross margins, that's just a quick one? And then secondly, as you 
look 
back at last year, you had some quarters where you really exceeded 
your guidance on the CSOI line.
 
Maybe looking back or just looking forward, what are the types of things that 
causes you to come in at the high end versus maybe the low end when you 
look ba
ck or when you look forward? Thank you.
 
Brian Olsavsky
 
Sure. First, on guidance, we keep it pretty consistent process on how we 
look at guidance and how we value or how we estimate the near
-
term view 
of the business. I will point out that Q4 is obviously a
 
very large quarter, the 
largest revenue quarter by far of the year.
 
There's a lot of demand that comes in the last six weeks of the year as well. 
So very, very little visibility at the time of guidance when we do recall. So 
reason our best projections on 
a lot of fronts. We think it's a similar 
-
 
we 
know it's a consistent process and there are times when we under run and 
sometimes we over run it.
 
Phil Hardin
 
On the 
-
 
this is Phil. On the category mix question, you know, obviously 
category mix does play a r
ole in the gross margin. I would say, though, that 
we're much more focused on operating profit dollars and free cash flow 
dollars, as we've probably talked about before.
 
The gross margins are impacted by first party versus third party mix, as well 
as AWS m
ix if you're looking at the total for the company. So we're much 
more focused on the dollars. And no specific categories we're calling out as a 
driver for gross margin because, again, we're much more focused on the 
profit dollars.

Thank you. Our n
ext question comes from the line of Paul Vogel with 
Barclays. Please proceed with your question.
 
Paul Vogel
 
Great. Thanks. Just wonder if you could give an update on the strategy 
around same
-
day shipping. How we should think about kind of further 
expansion
 
of that and kind of what parameters do you guys use to 
determine what markets to go in? Is it density of the market? Is it proximity 
of your distribution facilities? Just some color on that would be great.
 
Brian Olsavsky
 
So we deliver, really quickly, a c
ouple of ways. One is the same
-
day that 
you've seen us rollout in number of markets here in the US. There is Prime 
Now and we're now in more than 25 metropolitan areas for Prime Now. And 
delivering for free in two hours is difficult and expensive, but cust
omers love 
it.
 
So we feel like this is the natural evolution of our delivery and we're happy 
to invest in that service. You know, we like what it does for Prime members. 
We like the convenience factor. And so we're taking a long
-
term approach 
and doing wha
t we normally do, which is really focus on continuing to drive 
greater and greater efficiency.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ron Josey with JMP 
Securities. Please proceed with your questions.
 
Ron Josey
 
Great. Thanks for takin
g the questions. So I wanted to ask little more about 
North American operating margins. Because I think they expanded just 
under 50 bps this quarter to 4.7%. And that compares to an average of 200 
basis points, thereabouts, expansion of the prior three qua
rters.
 
So I'm just wondering if in 4Q maybe higher FBAs cost or something else in 
there that led to maybe an expansion not as great as we saw in prior 
quarters. And then following up on the Prime Now question, just now, I'm 
wondering how hour
-
delivery or t
wo
-
hour delivery has changed customer 
perception of just delivery overall? Thank you.
 
Brian Olsavsky
 
Sure. Yes, again, I'll point out that the demand for FBA services was very 
high, nearly 50% of our third party units, again, were FBA. And the demand 
for space and services was very large by our seller base, which was great 
from a lot of standpoints, but did exceed our expectations. But did make our 
warehouses rather full and did cause us to incur some additional variable 
costs in the US.
 
And there is a
lso the dynamic that we were fulfilling more of these units 
ourselves at our warehouses because of the FBA growth and the retail 
growth.
 
Phil Hardin
 
On the speed of delivery, this is Phil, you know, all I can say is the 
customers love the service. It's ver
y convenient, and it gives them flexibility 
and the ability to get products really quickly.
 
I don't know if there is any big trends we are ready to call out at this point, 
but they seem to really, really like it. So we're encouraged by that. We're 
excited 
to invest in it and excited with what we can do for our Prime 
members.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Neil Doshi with Mizuho. 
Please proceed with your question.
 
Neil Doshi
 
Great. Two questions, please. And one, it seems like t
he Echo did perform 
well. Can you talk more broadly about your Internet of Things ambitions and 
kind of how Echo plays into that strategy?
 
And then secondly, just wanted to know a little bit more about restaurant 
delivery. It seems a little bit outside of 
the wheelhouse. What's the impetus 
behind doing more in terms of food delivery and what are your ambitions 
there? Thanks.
 
Brian Olsavsky
 
So on the Echo, we like what 
-
 
how Echo has done. We're really excited 
about the ecosystem and some of the skills that 
are being added to Echo, as 
well as some of the other devices that are taking advantage of Alexa, which 
is kind of the brains behind Echo.
 
So we like our device business in general. As you probably saw from the 
press release, we had a good Q4, where we did
 
almost doubled, or double 
what we did last year. So very excited about the devices. We like that they 
pump more energy into Prime and really the whole ecosystem.
 
Not sure on the Internet of Things, but it's very exciting for devices 
standpoint. And the br
ains of Echo are in the AWS cloud. And so, Echo gets 
new capabilities all the time as Alexa gets better and better.
 
On the restaurant delivery, it's just another great service we can offer for 
our Prime members. This is tied in with the Prime Now offering 
in a handful 
of cities at this point. And so we have the delivery people going out and 
making the deliveries in the neighborhoods. And so this is one more really 
valuable convenient service we can offer for our Prime customers.

Thank you. Our fina
l question will come from John Blackledge with Cowen & 
Company. Please proceed with your question.
 
John Blackledge
 
Great, thanks. Two questions. First one, shipping costs were higher than we 
expected. I think it was 12.5% of net revenue versus 11% last yea
r. Just 
any color on the higher shipping costs? And is that percentage of net 
revenue a new normal as we are in 2016 now and as we look out?
 
And then the second question on Prime Now, in 25 markets globally, how 
should we think about the total number of ma
rkets that 
-
 
additional markets 
you can enter with the Prime Now offering in 2016? Thanks.
 
Brian Olsavsky
 
Sure. As you say, net shipping margin was up 70 basis points year
-
over
-
year. Again, this is all tied in with the increase in FBA growth and the 
demand
 
from Prime members. We're shipping more units 

 
more of our 
units, so this ripples through our ship cost per unit, and again, the 
calculation of ship costs as margin is a percent of revenue and that is 
impacted by the denominator effect on the FBA sales, 
being booked at a net 
revenue.
 
Phil Hardin
 
Related to your Prime Now question, this is Phil, we're in more than 25 
metropolitan locations. It's 
-
 
if you've been watching, this rollout's really 
happened in the last year. So it's been a pretty rapid rollout.
 
And we're excited to bring it to more places. We don't have a target for you 
today, but we are working hard to bring it to more and more places. We're 
outside the US now in a handful of countries in the UK and Japan, and Italy 
and working to expand. So it
's a program we're really excited about and 
we're happy to bring it to more customers.
 
Phil Hardin
 
Thank you for joining us on the call today and for your questions. A replay 
will be available on our Investor Relations website at least through the end 
of the quarter. We appreciate your interest in Amazon.com and look forward 
to talking with you again ne
xt quarter.

Thank you for standing by. Good day, everyone, and welcome to the 
Amazon.com Q1 2017 Financial Results Teleconference. At this time all 
participants are in a listen
-
only mode. After the presentation, we will 
conduct a 
question
-
and
-
answer session. Today's call is being recorded.
 
For opening remarks, I'll be turning the call over to the Director of Investor 
Relations, Darin Manney. Please go ahead.

Hello, and welcome to our Q1 2017 financia
l results conference call. Joining 
us today to answer your questions is Brian Olsavsky, our CFO. As you listen 
to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in 
front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics a
nd 
commentary on the quarter.
 
Please note, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be 
against our results for the comparable period of 2016. Our comments and 
responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, April 
27, 2
017, only and will include forward
-
looking statements. Actual results 
may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could 
potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release 
and our filings with the SEC, includi
ng in our most recent annual report on 
Form 10
-
K and subsequent filings. During this call, we may discuss certain 
non
-
GAAP financial measures.
 
In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with 
the SEC, each of which is posted on o
ur IR website, you will find additional 
disclosures regarding these non
-
GAAP measures including reconciliations of 
these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Our guidance incorporates 
the order trends that we have seen to date and what we believe today 
to be 
appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may 
be materially affected by many factors, including fluctuations in foreign 
exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer 
spending, world events, the rate of
 
growth of the Internet, online commerce, 
and cloud services and the various factors detailed in our filings with the 
SEC.
 
Our guidance also assumes among other things that we don't conclude any 
additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings
, or legal 
settlements. It's not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and 
services, and therefore our actual results could differ materially from our 
guidance.
 
Before moving to Q&A, I would like to draw attention to a new accounting 
rule tha
t we implemented in Q1. The new rule requires excess tax benefits 
from stock
-
based compensation to be presented as an operating activity in 
the consolidated statements of cash flows. We retrospectively adjusted our 
consolidated statements of cash flows to 
re
-
classify excess tax benefits from 
financing activities to operating activities. And as a result, you will see an 
increase in our free cash flow measures for prior periods.
 
Additionally, beginning January 1, 2017, the excess tax benefit or deficiency 
for
 
stock
-
based compensation is recognized as a component of tax expense 
rather than equity. This change resulted in a decrease to our tax expense for 
the quarter and a corresponding increase to our net income and earnings per 
share. Specific changes are pres
ented in the footnotes to the consolidated 
statement of cash flows and related metrics provided in our press release. 
Further disclosure of the impact of the adoption of this accounting change 
can be found in our Form 10

Q.
 
With that, we will move to Q&A.

Got it. I saw on the front page of the release you're really focused on India. 
Can you give us a progress update on how you're doing? Any thoughts on 
how far you're willing to take the investment l
evels there? And what are 
your thoughts on maybe when international margins can start to make 
progress? Thank you.
 
Brian T. Olsavsky

Amazon.com, Inc.
 
Sure, Justin. Thank you. Yes, I think Jeff's comments were pretty dead on. 
The launch of Prime last year
 
was a big turning point. We've increased Prime 
selection by 75% since launching that nine months ago in India, also 
increased the fulfillment capacity for sellers by 26% this year. On the 
content side, we've announced A
-
Team in the original TV series and 
we're 
customizing the content, so it's a really vast selection of local and global 
movies and TV shows that are available to the Indian public.
 
You'll also notice that the Fire TV Stick was 

 
a new version of it was 
launched in India with some important fe
atures there such as the ability to 
search in Hindi and in English, free data usage for three months and also 
data monitoring, which is important there. So again, we continue to be 
encouraged by both the response from customers and sellers. As far as level
 
of investment is concerned, it is certainly one of our important investment 
areas. We see a lot of potential for the country and our business there.

Any thoughts on how much it is impacting your international p
rofitability?
 
Brian T. Olsavsky 
-
 
Amazon.com, Inc.
 
Sure. I can't quantify it, or break it out specifically, but I will say it's a large 
factor as well as a couple other things in the international segment. So, keep 
in mind that we launched Prime Video in t
he fourth quarter, and now we 
have that in over 200 countries and territories.
 
We're spreading a lot of the Prime benefits that we see in North America to 
other countries. We just opened up Amazon Fresh in Tokyo last weekend, 
but also Prime Now. You saw ot
her things like our business B2B business 
just opened up in the UK. We have Amazon Devices. So there's a lot of 
moving parts here. The other big influence is the same trends are happening 
in international with respect to FBA growth and the fact that our Am
azon 
fulfill network, or the units we shipped, are growing at a much faster clip 
than our paid unit growth.
 
Last year we said that was a 40% 

 
nearly 40% growth worldwide. So we're 
making the investments in warehouses, fulfillment capacity and delivery 
cap
acity to handle that. So there's a lot going on in international. We are 
very encouraged with the growth of the Prime program, and we're hopeful 
for the Prime Video that we launched in the fall.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Mahaney
 
with RBC Capital 
Markets. Please proceed with your question.
 
Mark Mahaney

Okay. Two questions. The North American operating margins seem to come 
down like 70 bps year
-
over
-
year, and I know it's not big books view of the 
margins, I get that. But it's sort of a change. You've had margins be flat or 
up year
-
over
-
year for quite some time, and then they dipped down. Just 
could you explain that?
 
And then secondly on these 

 
on the Echo devices, the Echo family, Alexa 
devices th
at are coming out, could you comment at all about what kind of 
impact you're seeing in terms of increased wallet or per share within 
households? Are you seeing it have an impact in terms of Amazon customers 
more likely to spend more once they have these de
vices in particular 
categories like groceries or household products, pantry products that they're 
more likely to spend because they have these devices in their houses, in 
their kitchens, in their living rooms? Thank you.
 
Brian T. Olsavsky 
-
 
Amazon.com, Inc
.
 
Sure, Mark. Let me start with the Echo question first. So, yeah, we're very 
encouraged by the customer response to the Echo products. Not only the 
Echo products but the ability to use tablets, our tablets now as Echo devices, 
since we've spread the Alexa
 
technology to many of those devices. And 
we're also happy with the success we've had with developers. There's now 
over 12,000 Alexa skills. So we think that's all foundational. The 
monetization, as you might call it, is a theme of your questions.
 
That's n
ot our primary issue right now. It's about building great products 
and delighting customers. We think as engagement 

 
as we pick up 
engagement with the devices, it helps the engagement with Amazon as a 
whole. So whether someone is ordering off their Alexa 
device or whether 
they're going to their phone, or going to their computer, it all has the same 
effect for us. So, very pleased with the initial progress. We see a lot of 
momentum there and we continue to invest. And that's one of the answers 
to your secon
d question on North America operating margin.
 
So if I step back, let me just talk generally about investments. So right now, 
we're just seeing a lot of great opportunities before us. And we're continuing 
to ramp up the investments in pursuit of those oppor
tunities. And the big 
picture is, again, as we've said customers 

 
the things customers love can 
grow to be large, we'll have strong financial returns and they're durable and 
can last for decades.
 
So in that category, and some of the things that we're inve
sting the most in 
are as you say the Echo and Alexa devices. We're doubling down on that 
investment, video content and marketing, not only in the U.S. but globally 
with the launch of our Prime Video in the fall.
 
So, we're building global scale in that busi
ness in both content and 
marketing. As I said earlier, we're expanding Prime benefits in the U.S. and 
also globally. Things like Prime Music, Prime Now, Amazon Fresh, all 
expanding globally. And we have launched Prime in India, China and Mexico. 
I know I'm
 
drifting a bit from North America, but it's all part of the same 
theme. We also have this trend going on in our fulfillment networks where 
strong FBA growth and high growth in Amazon fulfilled unit is resulting in a 
large increase in fulfillment capacity.
 
We're also investing in new technologies such as artificial intelligence, 
machine learning. You're starting to see some of that show up in things like 
Amazon Go, our beta store that we have developed in Seattle, drones. We 
use those technologies a lot in 
our internal businesses and we're also 
developing services for AWS customers. So 

 
and that's of course another 
area is AWS continues to grow and add services and features and doing so 
at an accelerating rate. So there's a long list, and I can keep going. 
But I 
think the general theme is there's a lot of investment in front of us that 
we're optimistic about, and we continue to ramp those investments. In North 
America, that manifests itself mostly in the device area, the content area 
and also the expansion o
f the fulfillment networks.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Nowak with Morgan

Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. The first one, Amazon always
 
had a pretty big focus on efficiencies. I'd be curious if you could talk about 
examples or areas where you have been able to iron out inefficiencies in the 
fulfillment process. And any still existing examples where you see low 
hanging fruit to really impr
ove fulfillment efficiency?
 
And then back to the point on investment. You didn't mention brick and 
mortar at all. There's been a lot of mention in the press about Amazon brick 
and mortar. I guess it would be curious to hear how you think about the 
importan
ce of an Amazon brick and mortar presence and how that fits into 
the long
-
term strategy?
 
Brian T. Olsavsky 
-
 
Amazon.com, Inc.
 
Sure thing. So, particularly as it pertains to our fulfillment center networks, I 
think the biggest areas of efficiency right now 
are in our Amazon Robotics 
areas. That technology continues to improve, and we have 

 
we're now 
multiple generations down. We just launched am Amazon Robotics 
fulfillment center in the Tokyo area recently, and I toured that last month, 
and it's just amazin
g to see the strides that Amazon Robotics has taken and 
the efficiency we're getting in our warehouse as a result.
 
The other efficiencies that we're seeing are network efficiencies, especially 
as we add things like sort centers. It's a collaboration and th
e movement 
between warehouses and sort centers and then to the end customer. The 
ability to have control through our sort centers has allowed us over the last 
few years to extend our cutoff times from 3:00 p.m. in most cases till 
midnight. So, greater cont
rol of our processes. If we do it cost effectively 
can also have favorable benefits both for our warehouse flow and also for 
our customers and their ordering pattern.
 
So, there's a lot of efficiencies that are going on day
-
to
-
day around here. 
One of the be
nefits of rapid growth is the ability to create leverage on 
purchases and a lot of the processes that we run.
 
So, your second question was on stores. Yes, I think you're seeing the 
expansion of our bookstores. We have six bookstores right now, and we 
have 
announced another six. The Amazon Go is in beta in Seattle, and while 
that's not large and only one site, we're excited about the potential there 
and the use of the technologies of computer vision, sensor fusion and deep 
learning. We think that has a lot o
f potential. Again, it's only one location 
that's still in beta. But along with the bookstores, we also have 

 
you'll see 
us in pop
-
up stores and college pickup points. So, for us it's another way to 
reach the customer and test what resonates with them, an
d we're pleased 
with the results.

Great. Thanks for taking the question. Brian, I think you mentioned th
e 
accelerating growth within AWS on new products and last year you added 
about 1,000. Can you just talk about maybe the plans for AWS and product 
growth going forward here in 2017 and the focus on innovation? Thanks
 
Brian T. Olsavsky 
-
 
Amazon.com, Inc.
 
Sur
e. Yes, we haven't updated that number, but suffice to say the innovation 
pace continues to accelerate. We are very proud of the launches in Q4. The 
Amazon Connect, which we think will provide customer service capability to 
customers, and Amazon Chime, whi
ch we also believe will resonate with 
customers. We've had a lot of adoption of our new services. We've had 

 
customers migrated more than 23,000 data basis using the AWS Database 
Migration Service since that launched last year. And just generally we 
conti
nue to expand geographically.
 
We have announced additional availability zones and regions worldwide. So, 
again, signed a number of big customers. I guess I would point out in the 
quarter, Liberty Mutual, Snap and Live Nation all starting relationships with
 
us or expanding their current relationship. We're now over a $14 billion run 
rate. We're happy with the business and the team, and again, for us 
innovation is going to be key as we move forward.

Hey. Good afternoon, everyone. Brian, I had a couple questions about your 
growing advertising business. We see more and more of it appea
ring on the 
site. And I was interested to hear a little bit more about how you expect that 
business to roll out internationally. I think it's largely U.S. based today, but 
be curious to hear about that. And then second, I think it's fairly obvious 
why some
one selling within the Amazon ecosystem would be interested in 
promoting on the platform, but maybe tell us a little bit about maybe over 
the long
-
term there are opportunities for sort of non
-
endemic advertisers 
within your platform. Thanks.
 
Brian T. Olsav
sky 
-
 
Amazon.com, Inc.
 
Sure. Yeah, it's pretty early in the days with advertising, but we're very 
pleased with the team we have and the results. Our goal is to be helpful to 
consumers and enhance their shopping or their viewing experience with 
targeted rec
ommendations, and we think a lot of the information we have 
and preferences of customers and recommendations help us do that for 
customers. We have a sponsored product, it's off to a great start, and it's a 
very effective way for advertisers to reach those
 
especially interested 
customers.
 
While you're on the topic of advertising, I thought I'd point out that in other 
revenue, advertising is in other revenue, as is co
-
branded credit card 
agreements and also some other advertising services. That decelerated f
rom 
99% in Q4 to 58% in Q1. But the fluctuation and the volatility was 
essentially in the co
-
branded credit card agreements and the other services, 
which can fluctuate quarter
-
to
-
quarter based on contract terms. And that's 
what happened. Advertising remain
ed strong and was consistent growth with 
Q4.

Thank you. So you periodically disclosed usage growth for AWS. But it has 
been some time since we saw one. So we're wondering if you can update us 
in terms of where you are now. If not, I mean, should we think about the 
growth in your cash deployment as
 
an indicator of the ongoing growth? 
Thank you.
 
Brian T. Olsavsky 
-
 
Amazon.com, Inc.
 
Yes. Sorry, I don't have a usage number to share with you today. If it will 
help, I will tell you that, again, we're now over $14 billion run rate. You 
clearly see our 

 
w
e break out very clearly our AWS segment revenue and 
operating income, and you'll also keep in mind that there's price decreases 
that are part of the business, and we're pretty public when we do those. And 
if you remember last call, I mentioned that we had
 
seven price decreases 
that were timed for December 1. So, about a third of the impact of those 
was seen in Q4, and then again that's one element of the sequential 
operating margin. But in general, we're very happy with that team and the 
progress they're m
aking. And we're deploying more capital as you can see to 
support the usage growth.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Douglas Anmuth with JPMorgan. 
Please proceed with your question.
 
Douglas T. Anmuth

Thanks for tak
ing the question. I just want to ask you about CapEx. It looks 
like CapEx including leases more than doubled year
-
over
-
year. So I know 
you listed kind of a long list of the many investment opportunities here, but 
can you just point out anything else in par
ticular that drove the pretty 
substantial increase there? Thank you.
 
Brian T. Olsavsky 
-
 
Amazon.com, Inc.
 
Sure. Yes, the CapEx, which is principally the fulfillment centers was 

 
grew 
51% year
-
over
-
year. As you'll remember, we added 26 warehouses last 

 
fu
lfillment centers last year, 23 in the second half of the year. Some of that 
cost of start
-
up is before the start
-
up some comes in a quarter afterwards. 
So there was some carryover from that. But generally, the biggest trend 
here is that the differential b
etween Amazon fulfilled network unit growth 
and paid unit growth.
 
So that nearly 40% growth in Amazon fulfilled units last year, and the 
continuation of the strong growth higher than the paid unit growth that we 
see in 2017 is resulting in a lot of fulfill
ment center capacity. And the 
fulfillment centers I'll also say with the robotics technology tend to be more 
capital intensive than prior versions of warehouses, and then they generally 
have much better operating efficiencies and variable costs following t
heir 
start
-
up.
 
On the capital leases, that grew 45%. A good deal of that is tied to the AWS 
business. As I just mentioned, a lot of that is tied to usage growth. But a 
caution; CapEx can fluctuate quarter
-
to
-
quarter, and if you look back to last 
year, the 
trailing 12 months was only 7% growth from the quarters through 
Q1 of last year. So certainly it was a bigger step
-
up in 2016 now carrying 
into 2017.

Ma
rk A. May

Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
 
Thanks. I know that we talked about over the last couple of quarters that 
part of the step
-
up in CapEx was to catch up from the under
-
investment in 
2015. Just curious if you'd say 

 
have you made a lot of progress
 
in terms of 
catching up with some of the fulfillment needs that you saw necessary in the 
business at the beginning of last year? And then I know you just said that 
you're 

 
it's still early days in terms of advertising, but there's a perception 
out there 
that over the last year or so that the company has sort of really 
begun to focus more on this business opportunity. Has something really 
changed at the business in the last year? And do you see advertising 
becoming a more meaningful part of the business ov
er the near to midterm, 
I guess?
 
Brian T. Olsavsky 
-
 
Amazon.com, Inc.
 
Sure. Let me start with advertising. So, yes, I think scale is helping. We've 
had great teams working on advertising for a while now. Our scale and 
number of customers, number of clicks,
 
number of eyeballs, and new 
content 

 
video content and other opportunities for advertising has really 
helped create some scale in that business. So we're very happy. I can't 
project it forward. But we're happy with the growth there. I think the 
sponsor p
roducts was a very inventive move for us, and I think that is 
having some really good impact on advertising growth.
 
On your second point about fulfillment capacity; here's how I'd generally 
generalize it. In Q4 of 2015, we were pretty vocal or pretty trans
parent 
anyway that we ran out of space in Q4, especially due to some very strong 
demand for FBA space and services. Last year we changed some of our 
incentives and worked with FBA merchants to try and have better 
throughput through our FCs, particularly in
 
Q4. That combined with the step
-
up in fulfillment centers that I mentioned, the 26 new ones, left us in a really 
good position. We had a very clean holiday, and we think it worked well for 
both customers, Amazon and also for sellers 

 
for FBA sellers.
 
So 
that leaves us now continuing to grow internationally as well because we 
continue to see strong FBA adoption, and it's a big part of our business, and 
it's a big part of our value with the additional Prime eligible ASNs that FBA 
provides. So, again, they'r
e self
-
reinforcing, the FBA program and also our 
Prime program. The Prime program attracts more people to Amazon, and 
they buy more including FBA products and conversely more FBA products in 
our warehouses helps our in
-
stock of things that people want to b
uy, Prime 
eligible in
-
stock, and that helps reinforce the Prime program.

Please proceed with your question.
 
Heath Terry

Goldman Sachs & Co.
 
Great. Thanks. I'm 
wondering if you could give us a sense of how we should 
think about the increase in unearned revenue. Obviously, this quarter 
biggest increase that you have seen from at least from a dollar perspective. 
What does that say about the way customers are changi
ng in the behavior in 
the AWS business? How should we think about the way that that might be 
impacting pricing, mix, near
-
term growth?
 
Darin Manney 
-
 
Amazon.com, Inc.
 
Hi, Heath. This is Darin. Yeah, on a deferred revenue balances, as we've said 
in the 
past, the primary drivers of that increase are both the activity that 
we're seeing with our AWS customers and the purchase of Reserved 
Instances and prepaid credits for their account, as well as Prime member 
purchases. We're not breaking out the specific g
rowth rates for Prime, but 
certainly it 

 
we like what we see in terms of the growth, and it's been 
consistent with what we have seen over the last quarter or so. Certainly, the 

 
part of that increase in deferred balances is related to Reserved Instances.
 
As customers get more comfortable and begin to put more sustained 
workloads into the AWS services through buying RIs, they're able to get 
fairly significant discounts on their usage. And so we like that model. 
Customers certainly like that model. And coll
ecting that through deferred 
revenue and then letting customers use that over time is very helpful.

p to 40 planes. So it's gone very well. The ability to control shipments 
within our network has gone up, and we think the cost is very good. So on 
that front, it's better control, better capacity control, especially search 
capacity, and also good costs. So
 
we have great relationships with third

Hi. Thanks. I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit about where you

And then secondly, also if you could just comment on the limitations and 
your willingness to invest more throughout LatAm the way you have more

previously discussed satisfaction with the measurements of success for the

Brian T. Olsavsky

Amazon.com, Inc.
 
Let me start with your middle question. I think it wa
s about Latin America 
growth. Let me step back and talk about international growth in general. So 
our approach varies by country, and if you look, historically we've taken 
multiple approaches. So in China, we bought an existing business Joyo.com 
and built 
off that base. In India, we started from scratch and have built a lot 
of things ourselves. And it's always going to depend on the country that the 
dynamics in that country both for retail, for online, and for foreign 
investment. But a real key factor in al
l of this generally is management 
bandwidth as well.
 
So, we pick our spots carefully. You'll see 

 
you heard in the quarter that 
we've announced the intention to buy Souq in the Middle East. Where does 
that fit into this strategy? Well, Souq's pioneered e
-
commerce in the Middle 
East, and they're creating great shipping experience for their customers and 
they're multiple countries, and they're doing a great job. So we see this as 
an example where we can learn from them, and also support their efforts 
with ou
r Amazon technology and global resources.
 
So we're in Mexico, but we're not in other parts of Latin America. We have a 
business in Brazil. But other countries we'll take on a case
-
by
-
case basis, 
again, bounded by what our management bandwidth can support a
nd 
prioritization versus other things. You obviously heard my long list of 
investments. All of those are pretty much gated by the need for people and 
software engineers and strong teams to approach them. So international 
expansion gets played off in the sa
me prioritization that other efforts do.

Thanks for taking the question. Maybe I can take two away from the press

-
over
-
quarter cadence. 
On the retail subscription services, that saw a pretty big jump up in the 
growth rate year
-
on
-
year in Q1 v
ersus Q4. I think that might be Prime 
memberships that come on to paid from trial. But just wanted to understand 
what maybe some of the driver was of that quarter
-
over
-
quarter in terms of 
the growth rate.
 
And net shipping costs actually grew at the slowest
 
rate by our count in a 
couple of years. It looks like you're starting to get some improvements there 
in terms of revenue over costs on the shipping line. Just wanted to know 
what that was in terms of what is driving that and can we expect that to 
possibly
 
continue. Thank you.

Sure. Let me start with the retail subscription services revenue. So there's 
multiple things in that category. The largest is Prime membership fees, but 
also other subscription services like audio 
books, eBooks, digital video, 
digital music, and other subscription services. So you're right, there was an 
acceleration, much like the comment I had on advertising and the other 
revenue category. The Prime membership growth rates for Q1 and Q4 last 
year a
re relatively consistent. So the volatility is in these other items. So I'm 
not quantifying the Prime membership or commenting on the growth rates, 
other than to say it's been very strong and Q4 strength has continued into 
Q1.
 
Your comment on shipping cost
s, yeah, that is going to 

 
it was lower unit 
volume as well, but generally, costs are going to be a combination of the tail 

 
the headwinds are obviously going to be FBA growth and shipping more 
products ourselves and this expansion of our Prime program a
nd the 
demand for products from our Prime customers. And the demand has been 
great. Again, there's over 50 million items that people can get delivered to 
their doorstep within two days or, in some cases, next day or same day. So 
it's going to be a big part
 
of our cost structure but it's an investment we 
work hard to reduce as far as rates, and we're glad to spend it to support 
our Prime program.

Thank you. And our final question will come from Greg Melich with Evercore 
ISI. Please proceed with your
 
question.

Hi. Thanks. I had a follow
-
up and then a new question. The follow
-
up is, 
would love an update. You talked a lot about the fulfillment centers, but 
could you update us on where we are in terms of rolling out Prime
 
Now 
facilities and sorting centers? You're just accounting a few 

 
you feel that 
scenario, it's a really ramped up investment this year or what you got last 
year is sort of what you need?
 
Brian T. Olsavsky

Amazon.com, Inc.
 
Sure. I'm sorry. You said Prim
e Now and what was the other thing?
 
Greg Melich

Evercore Group LLC
 
And the sorting centers.
 
Brian T. Olsavsky

Amazon.com, Inc.
 
Sort centers. Sort centers, right. Well, I don't have updated numbers for 
you, but the Prime Now is available in more than 45
 
cities across eight 
countries. The Same
-
Day is available in 30 cities in the U.S. So, that's a bit 
on the quantification of those. I can't tell you much more on sort centers.

But were you thinking about building out the ca
pacity? It sounds like last 
year, you had that big surge in fulfillment centers. There isn't a similar surge 
about to happen this year on some of those other areas?
 
Brian T. Olsavsky

Amazon.com, Inc.
 
Yes. I can't project that. We're still growing that an
d we're happy with the 
progress in Prime Now and the service that 

 
the value that it creates for 
Prime customers. And as I said, we have expanded internationally, which 
was a big goal of ours as well. So we will continue to grow that. I can't 
quantify it 
for you right now. The other similar like facility metric you might 
want is that AmazonFresh is now in 21 metro areas in the U.S. as well as 
London and Tokyo.

Thank you for standing by. Good day, everyone and welcome to the 
Amazon.com Q4 2019 Financial Results Teleconference. At this time, all 
participants are in a listen
-
only mode. After the presentation, we will 
conduct a 
question
-
and
-
answer session. Today's call is being recorded.
 
For opening remarks, I will be turning the call over to the Director of 
Investor Relations, Shelly Kay Pfeiffer. Please go ahead.
 
Shelly Kay Pfeiffer
 
Hello, and welcome to our Q4 2019 financial r
esults conference call. Joining 
us today to answer your questions are Brian Olsavsky, our CFO; and Dave 

call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which 
incl
udes our financial results, as well as metrics and commentary on the 
quarter.
 
Please note, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be 
against our results for the comparable period of 2018. Our comments and 
responses to your questions ref

January 30, 2020 only, and will include forward
-
looking statements. Actual 
results may differ materially.
 
Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our 

ress release and our filings with the 
SEC, including our most recent Annual Report on Form 10
-
K and subsequent 
filings.
 
During this call, we may discuss certain non
-
GAAP financial measures. In our 
press release, slides accompanying this webcast, and our fi
lings with the 
SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional 
disclosures regarding these non
-
GAAP measures, including reconciliations of 
these measures with comparable GAAP measures.
 
Our guidance incorporates the order trends tha

-
date and 
what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are 
inherently unpredictable and maybe materially affected by many factors, 
including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic 
conditions an
d customer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the 
Internet, online commerce and cloud services, and the various factors 
detailed in our filings with the SEC.
 

additional bu
siness acquisitions, investments, restructurings, or legal 

services, and therefore our actual results could differ materially from our 
guidance.
 
With that, we will move to Q&A. O
perator, please remind our listeners how 
to initiate a question.
 
Question

and

Answer Session
 
Operator
 
At this time, we will now open the call for questions. [Operator Instructions]
 
Our first question is coming from the line of Heath Terry with Goldman 
Sach
s. Please proceed.
 
Heath Terry
 
Great. Thanks. Really appreciate this. Just on the AWS business, as you look 
sort of at the strength that you saw in the quarter particularly represented 
by the amount of dollars added quarter
-
over
-
quarter, is there anything 
in 
particular that you would call out either in terms of specific types of 
workloads, regions, specific customer types, that you felt like drove the 
strength particularly relative to the directional 
--
 
direction of growth that we 
were seeing in the earlier
 
parts of the year?
 
Brian Olsavsky
 
Hi Heath. No, I would not isolate it to any one set of customers or products. 
I think it's been pretty broad
-
based, and it's kind of the culmination of a lot 
of work on adding new products and features, adding to our sale
s and 
marketing teams, and having better penetration in enterprise customers and 
hitting a lot of very different industries.
 
So, I think that's what you're seeing. We feel that our product set is 
--
 
leads 
the market, and we add to it at a quicker pace than
 
our competition, so 
actually the gap on capacity and features is growing as we speak.
 
We also think that there's a real network effect when you use AWS with the 
millions of active customers and tens of thousands of global partners. And 
we continue to expa
nd. We're now in 69 availability zones across 22 
geographic regions. So, I think it's the combination of increased sales 
support, more and better products that hit customers' needs, and also the 
geographic expansion is what you're seeing.
 
Operator
 
Thank yo
u. Our next question comes from the line of Colin Sebastian with 
Robert W. Baird. Please proceed.
 
Colin Sebastian
 
Great. Thank you. Was just hoping you guys could disaggregate a bit the 
strength in seller services, how much of that was third
-
party marketpl
ace 
commission specifically? And are you seeing more of an uptick in some of 
the other content and services? Thank you.
 
Brian Olsavsky
 
On seller services, I would say it was just a very strong quarter if that's what 
you're referring to 31% growth in revenu
e. It was strong on a unit basis. 
And as you said, there's probably additional strength in FBA which has 
higher fee set than MFN does.
 
So 
--
 
but in general, if you step away, I think what you're seeing is more 
and more participation of third
-
party sellers 
in our one
-
day delivery program 
as we move through the year. That was particularly strong in Q4, and I think 
you'll see that more as we move into 2020.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Justin Post with Bank 
of America. 
Please proceed.
 
Justin Post
 
Great. Thanks. Just wondering if you could go high level, what drove upside 
to your guidance on revenue in the quarter on the retail side? Anything there 
that you'd really call out?
 
And then on the AWS investments, obviously you
 
just talked about 
investments starting in 3Q. Where are you in that investment? Your margins 
are still below peak. Where are you kind of in that investment cycle? Thank 
you.
 
Brian Olsavsky
 
Sure. Well, as I said, on revenue we came in at $87.4 billion, whi
ch 
exceeded the high end of our range of $86.5 billion. $400 million of 
--
 
roughly $400 million of that was due to foreign exchange, but what we saw 
was essentially very strong holiday performance from the middle of 
November on.
 
We also had a very big upti
ck in response to the one
-
day availability that's 
been building through the year. I think Prime has been very strong. We 
mentioned that we have more than 150 million paid Prime members globally 
now. And we mentioned that more people joined Prime in Q4 than
 
any other 
quarter before.
 
So, a lot of good momentum there built up on the aggregation of benefits 
that we continue to add to the Prime program most recently the one
-
day 
--
 
expansion of one
-
day shipping.
 
On AWS, where are we in the cycle? I talked more in
 
2018 when the 
margins in AWS were closer to 30% about the efficiency of infrastructure 
spend and 
--
 
versus prior years. So, we continue to 
--
 
since that point, 
we've continued to add infrastructure capability and 
--
 
to support our global 
expansion as well
.
 
But what you're seeing probably more in the margins is the expansion of our 
sales and marketing effort at some of those costs as well as price decreases 
and longer
-
term contracts that we've signed with some of our customers.
 
You notice on our balance she
et that our future commitments on the 
multiyear deals now stands at $30 billion at year
-
end, and that's up 54% 
year
-
over
-
year. So, there's a lot of good momentum on the enterprise side 
as well.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of J
ason Helfstein with 
Oppenheimer & Co. Please proceed.
 
Jason Helfstein
 
Thanks. Just to ask about AWS again. I mean, the investors have become, I 
guess, recently concerned just about again the slowing AWS revenue and 
margin and whether it's a function of inc
reased competition.
 
So, maybe just talk about how you're reacting. You did talk about spending 
on sales and price cuts, but just any more you can talk about the 
competitive environment? Thank you.
 
Brian Olsavsky
 
Sure. I would probably argue a bit with the 
growth comments. As we see it 
here, we grew from a $30 billion revenue run rate at the end of 2018 to a 
$40 billion revenue run rate at the end of 2019. So, we continue to be happy 
with our top line growth. The 
--
 
in dollar terms as opposed to percentages,
 
we had a larger dollar increase in revenue both year
-
over
-
year and quarter
-
over
-
quarter. So, we're very happy with the progress of the revenue and our 
adoption and acceptance by customers.
 
As far as competitive set is concerned, we 
--
 
again, we think that
 
we have 
--
 
start with a very big lead in this space because of our many years of 
investment not only in capacity, but also in services and features that we 
provide to customers. We've learned from customers.
 
We just had a great re:Invent conference in Dec
ember where all of our 
--
 
it 
was a great aggregation of partners and customers and developers. And at 
those events, we not only get to present our new products and there were 
over 100 that were launched in December, but we also get to hear customer 
issues 
and help 
--
 
that helps to sign or educate our forward road map.
 
So, it's a great shared learning. I think customers react to it. Customers will 
be at different stages of their adoption curve. There's always different 
phases: first, moving to the cloud, the
n organizing on the cloud, and then 
growing further. So there's a lot of movement.
 
I said that repeatedly I think in the setting that any 
--
 
quarter quarter
-
to
-
quarter movement is going to be a little bumpy. But generally, what you're 
seeing is the converg
ence of a lot of investment, a lot of operational 
efficiency, and a lot of innovation on behalf of customers.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Ju with Credit 
Suisse. Please proceed.
 
Stephen Ju
 
Okay. So thank you. I wante
d to switch it up a little bit. I guess you guys 
called this out in your press release, but I'm wondering if you could talk 
about your efforts to get the SMBs and the micro SMBs online in India. What 
exactly is involved from a practical perspective? Do you
 
need to have door
-
to
-
door sales folks? And what can do to reduce friction between logistics 
payments and some of the other factors there?
 
And second, what are these SMBs selling? Is it like long
-
tail inventory? Is it 
merchandise that you can get to export
s to global buyer base? And do you 
think this could be content that could be exclusive to Amazon? Thank you.
 
Dave Fildes
 
Yes Stephen, this is Dave. Thanks for the question. As you said, I think as 
we mentioned this in the release, we're 
definitely continuing to improve the 
experience in India for customers and sellers, excited by some of the 
response we've seen. We are continuing to invest meaningfully in digitizing 
those say MSMBs micro
-
small and medium
-
sized businesses.
 
We did pledge to
 
invest $1 billion to help digitize traders and those micro 
and small businesses across India. And we've got a goal of bringing more 
than 10 million online by 2025. So, this $1 billion investment will help to 
enable $10 billion in cumulative Indian exports
 
by 2025.
 
A lot of different facets to those types of investments, won't go into too 
much for specifics, but a lot of work being done there. We're also focused on 
job growth, job creation over there. Since we launched over in India in 2013, 
we've created o
ver 700,000 direct and indirect jobs. So 
--
 
we also recently 
announced plans to create additional one million jobs in India by 2025.
 
So, a lot of 
--
 
I think innovation, ideas, investment. That team over there 
continues to do a great job locally of taking a
 
lot of the tenants that we've 
had at Amazon around innovation building and really run with that over 
there and done a great job of coming up with some interesting and new 
services and features that I think are specific to that region.
 
And hopefully, as we
 
continue to do that, we'll keep identifying areas over in 
India and tool sets features over in India that we can bring back to other 
regions to help benefit other sellers and the other websites more broadly.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question comes fro
m the line of Brian Nowak with 
Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.
 
Brian Nowak
 
Thanks for taking my question. I have two. Just, the first one Brian, I think 
on one of the media interviews, you talked about how you're becoming more 
efficient with one
-
day and yo
u continue 
--
 
with next
-
day delivery and 
continue to do so and talked about $1 billion of cost in that current quarter.
 
Maybe just sort of talk to us about some of the largest qualitative fix in 
variable costs sort of still associated with one
-
day and the 
processes and the 
opportunities for efficiency to really get that number down as we go 
throughout 2020. And then, maybe any specific product categories or good 
categories where you've seen an acceleration in demand from one day that 

 
Brian O
lsavsky
 
Sure. Let me make sure the numbers are understood. We had talked about 
last year about an initial step up in cost of close to $800 million in the 
second quarter. We 
--
 
that carried into Q3
--
 
was slightly higher in Q3. And 
then in Q4, last time on t
his call I mentioned that we estimated Q4 would be 
$1.5 billion penalty. It was slightly under that despite the higher volumes 
and revenue growth than was in our guidance.
 
And looking ahead to Q1, we estimate approximately $1 billion of additional 
costs ye
ar
-
over
-
year. And again, in Q2, we'll start to lap this. And that 
doesn't mean the delta goes to zero. It means that there'll be a step up as 
we grow and expand on a volume basis and then we'll see where our rates 
are on actually delivering and fulfilling 
one day. So, I will keep you posted on 
our results and guide in the future as to where we see those costs going.
 
If you look at the efficiency or the 
--
 
first the cost, they generally fall into a 
few buckets. It's obviously transportation where you're buil
ding out new 
transportation modes, you're adding new deliveries. Partners are adding new 
routes. Many times they start with subscale volumes and you build them 
out, you get more efficient, you get more volume, more package density and 
that creates efficien
cy.
 
When we started this, again, Q2 of last year, we also had abrupt change to 
our fulfillment network in that, when it's tuned for two
-
day delivery on the 
most part when you move to one
-
day in a lot of cases, it's advantageous 
from a cost and transportati
on standpoint to have that inventory closer to 
the customer. So, we've 
--
 
last year we're in the middle of that transition. 
We still are as we shift inventory to be more local, it will enable local 
deliveries to hit shorter cutoff times.
 
So, that will cont
inue to become more efficient. We do see 
--
 
we will have to 
scale our fulfillment center network further. We grew the square footage for 
fulfillment and transportation by 15% each of the last two years.
 
And we'll look ahead and see a step
-
up in that this y
ear as we start to build 
more capacity for the one
-
day. I haven't guided beyond Q1, but that's 
certainly something that will step up. But we get efficiencies as we learn and 
grow and handle more one
-
day volume.
 
Third area is foregone ship revenue just simp
ly, because we're having free 
shipment and not charging for it. That unfortunately doesn't leverage, but it 
--
 
we do start to lap after a while.
 
So, I would say that just as we've had other shocks to our warehouse 
system over the years from going to 
--
 
fro
m media to almost every product 
you can imagine, to having a cycle of increased third
-
party presence in the 
FBA program now to one
-
day, we have a history here where we can look for 
opportunities to be more efficient and lower the 
--
 
any cost penalties as w
e 
move forward.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Dan Salmon with BMO 
Capital Markets. Please proceed.
 
Dan Salmon
 
Thanks for taking the question guys. Brain, just to follow
-
up on one
-
day 
shipping. You noted that you begin to lap 
the beginning of the initiative here 
in the second quarter and that naturally costs can flow up with volumes. But 
just to be clear with you is the idea here is we anniversary at that sort of 
incremental expansion of one
-
day shipping either regionally or ce
rtain SKUs 
is functionally finished. I just want to make sure I understand that properly.
 
And then just 
--
 
we can see the other number reported. Just any color within 
there on the advertising business. And in particular would love to hear an 
update just a 
bit on some of your brand initiatives there. I know that 
probably wasn't the focus in the holiday season, but it seems to be an 
important growing part. Thank you.
 
Brian Olsavsky
 
Sure. Let me start on the one
-
day. So, yeah, we do see expansion of the 
one
-
da
y program as we move through the year. We've been expanding since 
we started this effort in Q2 of last year. Expansion means additional cities, 
additional routes, additional zip codes.
 
But more 
--
 
I think what you'll see more in 2020 is also an 
--
 
more eff
ort 
internationally, more costs internationally. We have greatly improved our 
selection of one
-
day in 
--
 
particularly in Europe and Japan.
 
We started with higher one
-
day percentage of our shipments in those 
geographies, but we do have to take steps and 
are taking steps to increase 
that. And we expect that to be 
--
 
it started to be a little more balanced cost 
globally as we move into 2020.
 
Dave Fildes
 
Yeah, Dan. In terms of your question around brands. We're focused on the 
certainly brands as an advertisi
ng customer set and a lot of focus on 
providing the products and tools that are going to help customers and really 
inspire them. So, things that we're really excited about stores, so a brand 
can customize and curate a multipage store. It allows them to bet
ter tell 
customers who they are share their story.
 
So, we can help deepen the brand engagement and the customer loyalty 
through that type of option. Some other things like posts, which helps 
customers discover products and brands. And it's through a curate
d feed 
that features the brand's lifestyle content and it's on a mobile detail page. 
And there's international expansion in some other areas.
 
I think broadly with advertising, so much of this is about having 
--
 
developing great relationships with these adv
ertisers, because I think they 
appreciate the fidelity we can provide around shopping outcomes. We're 
uniquely positioned to do this given our retail business.
 
On the advertising business, or rather I should say other revenue that line 
item grew about 41% 
year
-
over
-
year. Advertising is the biggest piece of 
that. Line item is growing at about the same rate. Advertising revenue is as 
a subset been growing at about the same rate year
-
over
-
year in the fourth 
quarter than it did in the third quarter.

Th
ank you. Our next question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan with 
UBS. Please proceed.
 
Eric Sheridan
 
Thanks for taking the question. Maybe a two part question on AWS if I can. 
You called out the depreciation change with respect to AWS going forward. 
Jus
t wanted to better understand some of the decisions that were made on 
useful life that drove that decision and how to think about that from a 
modeling perspective going forward?
 
And then the second part would be what does that mean in terms of the way 
you'
re thinking about forward CapEx cycles for the AWS business, if you're 
assuming useful life is moving out maybe than prior assumptions? Thanks so 
much.
 
Brian Olsavsky
 
Sure. Thanks for bringing that up. So, we as a practice monitor and review, 
the useful li
fe of our depreciable assets on a regular basis to make sure that 
our financial statements reflect our best estimate of how long the assets are 
going to be used in operations. In Q4 
--
 
and we've been looking at it in both 
the FCs, fulfillment centers and a
lso AWS annually.
 
As we looked in Q4 of 2019, we believe it's 
--
 
there's enough trend now to 
show that the useful life is exceeding four years. We have been 
--
 
for our 
servers and we had been depreciating them over three years. So, we are 
going to start de
preciating them on a four year basis.
 
It doesn't unwind any depreciation that's already been booked. It just takes 
the asset from its current status and extends the depreciation period and 
then new assets will be put into play will extend out for four year
s instead of 
three and we'll continue to revisit this. I do want to point out it's not just an 
accounting
-
related change. It's rather a reflection of the work that we've 
done to make our server capacity last longer.
 
We've been operating at scale for over 1
3 years in this business and we 
continue to refine our software to run more efficiently on the hardware. It 
then lowers stress and extends the useful life both through servers that we 
used in the AWS business and also the servers that we use to support our
 
own Amazon businesses.
 
So 
--
 
and despite that we give AWS customers and actually because of this, 
AWS customers continue to get access to the latest technologies more 
quickly than ever before. So, we are essentially reflecting the fact that we 
have gotten
 
better at extending the useful life here and now building that 
into our financials moving forward.
 
Yes, you're right. It should also impact our need and our timing of capital. I 
would say that it's also been part of the reason that we've been able to keep
 
capital relatively under in check the last two years in the infrastructure area. 
But its $800 
--
 
excuse me $800 million lower depreciation expense in the 
quarter and it will be consistent. It will change quarter
-
to
-
quarter. We will 
update you. But as you 
can see in our financial statements, it's about $2.3 
billion impact in Q2 2020.
 
Dave Fildes
 
Yes. This is Dave. Just kind of on the modeling point too on that the $800 
million is in Q1. We do think that the 
--
 
for that accounting impact 
effectively, we expe
ct that that amount will decrease as we go through the 
year. And it's tech infrastructure assets. So, it's 
--
 
I should say the servers 
are tech infrastructure assets. So, when you think about segments the 
majority of these relate to the AWS segment.
 
Operat
or
 
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ron Josey with JMP 
Securities. Please proceed.
 
Ron Josey
 
Great. Thanks for taking the question. Brian, I just want to ask a little bit 
more about the holiday season, given the beat on the top line and 
see if 
there's any way to quantify maybe the impact from the shortened holiday 
shopping season. I mean, it doesn't seem like much just given the better 
results and in online sales and retail third
-
party seller services. But is there 
any way to think about 
the six less days?
 
And then also you mentioned last quarter, an impact from the Japanese 
consumption tax. Any sort of impact? Did that go according to plan or any 
thoughts there would be helpful? Thank you.
 
Brian Olsavsky
 
Yes. First of all on the 
--
 
there 
were two items we discussed last quarter with 
the Japan consumption tax raising from 8% to 10% effective October 1. The 
net result was a pull forward of some purchases by Japanese customers into 
Q3 and also some negative elasticity effects post October 1.
 
The other item was Diwali timing, the Indian holiday which has a very large 
swing factor on international revenues is, it moved more into the third 
quarter this year versus 
--
 
in 2019 versus 2018. So, it was a help to Q3 and 
a penalty to Q4. Those two item
s impacted the Q4 growth rate negatively by 
about 300 basis points. That was our estimate and we believe that was the 
actual outcome.
 
Dave Fildes
 
On the international?
 
Brian Olsavsky
 
On the international segment excuse
 
me yes. The 
--
 
sorry the first question 
was for the holiday season. Yes, we don't see that as a factor actually. And I 
mentioned that last call as it wasn't incorporated into our guidance in a 
negative fashion. The way we look at it and the way we believe
 
it works at 
least in our business is that customers will have a holiday budget and they 
will spend it between generally the middle of November.
 
It's creeping up to the early part of November through the holiday season. 
And we do see obviously spikes in Bl
ack Friday and Cyber Monday and we 
also see relative tick
-
up in trends as we get closer to the holiday and for the 
shipping threshold cutoff.
 
So, there's a polarization of tends to be a polarization to early shipping 
--
 
or 
excuse me early purchase and late
 
purchases. As far as, the six days that 
sort of time period between Thanksgiving and the Christmas holiday, we 
don't see an impact on that. Perhaps it's a bigger issue for stores and foot 
traffic, but we don't notice it in our business.
 
Operator
 
Thank you
. Our next question comes from the line of Doug Anmuth with 
JPMorgan. Please proceed.
 
Doug Anmuth
 
Thanks for taking the question. I just want to shift gears to grocery. I know 
you added Amazon Fresh into Prime kind of removing the previous $14.99 a 
month c
omponent there and putting it into Prime and you talked about the 
2,000 U.S. cities and towns with two
-
hour delivery. Can you just talk about 
what the early impact there is of bundling kind of Fresh into Prime at this 
point?
 
And then just how you're thinki
ng about your grocery strategy as you're 
positioned now? Thanks.
 
Brian Olsavsky
 
Sure. Thanks for your question. So, early results are good. We 
--
 
our 
grocery delivery orders from the combination of Amazon Fresh and Whole 
Foods Market more than doubled in t
he fourth quarter year
-
over
-
year. So, 
we believe customers are starting to notice and take advantage of this.
 
We wanted to take 
--
 
we will see where people's tastes and preferences will 
take them. We are 
--
 
whether they go to the store, the Whole Foods Mar
ket 
store, whether they use Prime Now or Amazon delivery for their groceries. 
Right now, we're really just testing and reacting to the customer demand 
and the customers' preferences and we'll do so for the foreseeable future.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our final 
question will come from the line of Mark Mahaney with 
RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed.
 
Mark Mahaney
 
Okay. Thanks for including me. Then I'll throw off three quick ones. Just talk 
a little bit more about gross margins in the quarter. You had 
--
 
the year
-
over
-
year trend was negative last quarter, but it turned reverse and was up 
this quarter. So, if there 
are any unusual factors you'd want to call out 
there.
 
Second the 
--
 
I don't want to read over a lot into your guidance, but every 
year for the last five years you've always guided to operating profit down 
sequentially and then you may be delivered better t
han that, but you always 
guided down. This year your high end of your range is actually above what 
you obviously did in the fourth quarter.
 
Are you just trying to remind people, tell people, educate people on how the 
mix shift in the business towards AWS a
nd advertising is just changing the 
profit profile of the business? So, any more color there?
 
And then last one since Sunday is coming up. I know you talked about the 
AWS customers and you mentioned the Seattle Seahawks, but what about 
the 49ers? Thanks.
 
B
rian Olsavsky
 
Good luck 49ers. I'll get that out there first. Good luck Ken Sachse fan. 
We're indifferent. Let me start with your second one on 
--
 
sorry, the 
--
 
start 
with gross margin.
 
Dave Fildes
 
Yes. So, I don't think there's anything too surprising cau
ght there. I think we 
continue to see some good growth in the third
-
party business. You saw that 
accelerate some. We're continuing to see that trend of more FBA sellers 
signing and taking a larger percentage of the total 3P mix of units that are 
sold throu
gh, so that continues to do well. And as Brian mentioned earlier, 
we think some of that has to do with the program keeps getting better with 
faster shipping and whatnot.
 
We've invested many billions of dollars in that program to make it even 
better for sel
lers. AWS had a strong quarter of course so that helps on the 
gross margin side as well.
 
And then on transportation I think you saw the outbound shipping costs to 
grow around 43% year
-
over
-
year. So, certainly up a good deal versus the 
trend line we saw in 
2018. But of course that's reflective of one
-
day and 
overall relative to our expectations.
 
As Brian said with the $1.5 billion we guided to it came in a bit under that. 
So some of that was certainly part of some better
-
than
-
expected trends 
efficiencies.
 
Brian Olsavsky
 
And on the comment on seasonality of guidance and Q1 that 
--
 
I think the 
historic trend of peaking a bit in operating income in Q4 and then stepping 
down in Q1 has been broken up a little bit as we've had the balance of AWS 
and some other th
ings.
 
But if you actually look back to Q1 of last year, it was the highest operating 
income quarter on record. And that's one of the 
--
 
makes a difficult comp 
this year, because we had the 
--
 
if you remember the slowdown in 
expenditures in 2018 in things l
ike fixed 
--
 
adding of headcount, warehouse 
space, infrastructure costs, not to zero, but like down off of prior investment 
levels in 2016 and 2017. A lot of that continued 
--
 
that cost baseline 
continued into Q1 of 2019 and it actually was a super
-
efficie
nt quarter from 
a cost and profit standpoint.
 
Q2 of last year, we started to again make larger investments, particularly in 
one day. And so that's now something that is lapping in Q1 of this year 
because we didn't really have one
-
day in Q1 of last year. Bu
t 
--
 
so I think 
there's 
--
 
it's hard to draw those parallels between quarters anymore.
 
I will though mention the guidance that we do have the $800 million of lower 
depreciation from our extension of our server useful lives, which is part of 
the range that 
we gave you of $3 billion to $4.2 billion.
 
Dave Fildes
 
Thanks for joining us today on the call and for your questions. A replay will 
be available on our Investor Relations website at least through the end of 
the quarter. We appreciate your interest in Amaz
on and we look forward to 
talking with you again next quarter.

Thank you for standing by. Good day, everyone, and welcome to the 
Amazon.com Q3 2017 Financial Results Teleconference. At this time, all 
participants are in a listen
-
only mode. After the presentation, we will 
conduct a 
question
-
and
-
answer session. Today's call is being recorded.
 
For opening remarks, I'll be turning the call over to the Director of Investor 
Relations, Dave Fildes. Please go ahead.

Hello, and welcome to our Q3 2017 Financial 
Results Conference Call. Joining 
us today to answer your questions is Brian Olsavsky, our CFO.
 
As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press 
release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics 
and
 
commentary on the quarter. Please note unless otherwise stated, all 
comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period 
of 2016. Our comments in response to your questions reflect management's 
views as of today, October 26, 2017
 
only and will include forward
-
looking 
statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information 
about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in 
today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including o
ur most recent 
Annual Report on Form 10
-
K and subsequent filings.
 
During this call, we may discuss certain non
-
GAAP financial measures. In our 
press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the 
SEC, each of which is posted on our IR w
ebsite. You will find additional 
disclosures regarding these non
-
GAAP measures including reconciliations of 
these measures with comparable GAAP measures.
 
Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we've seen to date and 
what we believe, today, to be a
ppropriate assumptions. Our results are 
inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, 
including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic 
conditions and customer spending, world events, the rate of growth
 
of the 
Internet, online commerce and cloud services, and the various factors 
detailed in our filings with the SEC.
 
Our guidance also assumes, among other things, that we don't conclude any 
additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings, or 
legal 
settlements. It's not possible to accurately predict the demand for our goods 
and services and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our 
guidance.
 
With that, we will move to Q&A. Operator, please remind our listeners how 
to initi
ate a question.

Answer Session

At this time, we will open up the call for questions. Thank you. Our first 
question comes from the line of Justin Post with Merrill Lynch. Please 
proceed with your question.

Great. I guess I'll just start with, can you give us your thoughts on the 
Whole Foods integration, how you see that contributing to the bottom line 
over time? And then on a quick balance sheet note, we obviously saw the 
strong AWS results, b
ut unearned revenue doesn't seem to be growing at 
the rate it was in the past. Maybe comment a little bit on the unearned 
revenue growth on the balance sheet, why it might be slower than the past? 
Thank you.
 
Dave Fildes 
-
 
Amazon.com, Inc.
 
Yes. Thanks, Just
in. This is Dave. I'd also point you to beyond the balance 
sheet. There's some disclosure to (03:57) unearned revenue as part of the 
cash flow statement. So when you look at that for the three months ended, 
around 34%, 35% for (04:05) and, historically, wh
at we've seen with 
unearned revenue is a big and leading contributor (04:12) signing up, 
paying $99 upfront and having that (04:18). That continues to be the 
biggest absolute contributor to what you see there. The other area that's 
been growing over the pa
st few years is Amazon Web Services (04:30) 
instances where those customers can pay for services upfront in some cases 
and discounts over multi
-
year periods.
 
What we're seeing more recently, I think, is on the Prime piece. We 
launched month
-
to
-
month Prime 
last year and if you think about how that 
works, customers are paying $10.99 per month as they go, so there's less 
that's deferred. So that's, I think, one of a number of factors. So, there's 
obviously other mix factors going in there besides the pieces th
at I just 
mentioned, but we have seen that monthly Prime has been a good driver of 
getting more members into the program. So, that's part of what you're 
seeing.
 
Brian T. Olsavsky

And your question about Whole Foods, we're really excited 
to have them as 
part of the team now after the acquisition in late August. What you see in 
the financial results for this quarter is, it's shown actually in the new physical 
stores revenue component, $1.3 billion of revenue, $21 million of operating 
income
. And that's where you'll be seeing the Whole Foods revenue showing 
up. In addition, that is, the cost of revenue, physical stores revenue is going 
to be where we're going to book any sales where the customer physically 
selects an item in a store. So, it w
ill also include, or does include our 
Amazon Books.
 
But if you step back on Whole Foods, again, I think we've had busy months 
since we've joined forces, offering lower prices on a range of key grocery 
items in the stores, launching the Whole Foods private 
label products on 
Amazon, the technical (06:07) work to make Prime the Whole Foods 
customer rewards program, and we'll have that coming out in the future. 
We've added Amazon Lockers to select Whole Foods stores. So lots of 
activity, lots of energy and we'r
e really excited to show customers what's 
possible when we join forces here.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney with 
RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.
 
Mark Mahaney

RBC Capital Markets LLC
 
Great
. I guess I'll ask two as well. The first one is that was a bit of unusual 
upside to your guidance, even stripping out Whole Foods. What most 
surprised you in the quarter? You have been pretty consistent on how you 
reported versus your guide, so something 
unusual happened or somewhat 
unusual happened, what would you attribute that to?
 
Brian T. Olsavsky 
-
 
Amazon.com, Inc.
 
Sure. In Q3, yes, I would say we had a very strong Prime Day. As you know, 
we talked about that on the last call. But it really carried in
to the quarter. 
We had a record day for sign
-
ups for free trials for Prime in Prime Day 
globally, had a very strong Prime Day in particular internationally. So, it 
really got a lot more traction in this, the third year that we've had it. So I 
would point m
ostly to those factors. It was also a very strong quarter for 
AWS.
 
Revenue growth was the same as Q2, and now we're at an $18 billion run 
rate, whereas last quarter when I had this call, we were at $16 billion, so 
very pleased with the customer response in
 
the AWS business as well. And 
usage growth is actually growing a lot higher than revenue growth. So 
particularly pleased with the new customers that we've added and the 
additional workloads that we've picked up from existing customers.
 
Mark Mahaney 
-
 
RBC Capital Markets LLC
 
And then, briefly, on the international retail, that growth also by itself was 
intrinsically stronger than you've seen in a while. Any particular markets, 
geographic markets, you would call out there?
 
Brian T. Olsavsky 
-
 
Amazon.com,
 
Inc.
 
Yeah, I would 

 
yeah, it was pretty strong across the board. We had the 
impact of Souq obviously, this quarter internationally and the Diwali holiday 
in India was a few days earlier, which maybe pushed some sales into Q3 
versus Q4. But generally, it 
was the strength of Prime Day internationally, 
and it carried through the quarter, but generally, I would point to the 
increased selection.
 
A lot of the building blocks that we've been working on, all the Prime 
benefits, advancements in free shipping offer
s or faster shipping offers, the 
Prime benefits would drive engagement, of course, adding selection, adding 
Fulfilled by Amazon partners and the selection that they bring. So again, I 
wouldn't point to anything other than the Prime Day pickup, but it was 
s
tronger than probably I anticipated.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Nowak with 
Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.

Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. Just on Whole Foods again, I 
was wondering could you talk about one or two of the biggest surprises 
you've seen so far? And then maybe just the strategic opportunities you see 
of having a brick
-
and
-
mo
rtar presence as you look to continue to grow your 
overall business. And the second one, on the subscription revenue, you 
accelerated to 59%. Could you just talk about which countries or which 
regions are driving that? And maybe talk a little bit about the
 
growth or the 
cadence of what's happening in the U.S., your oldest market? Thanks.
 
Brian T. Olsavsky 
-
 
Amazon.com, Inc.
 
Sure. On Whole Foods, I would say it is early. August 28 was the close date 
and what I can tell you is I have been in meetings with Joh
n Mackey and his 
team, and they are very like
-
minded with us, customer
-
obsessed, ready to 
work together to continue their mission and expand on their offerings that 
we can offer customers.
 
The other things I mentioned, price reductions early on, selling th
eir 
products on Amazon.com and also installing Amazon Lockers. I think over 
time, you'll see more cooperation and working together between 
AmazonFresh, Prime Now, and Whole Foods as we can explore different 
ways to serve the customer. So, that's kind of th
e early report on Whole 
Foods. So far so good, and we're thrilled to finally be working together after 
the summer of closing the deal.
 
On subscription revenue, let me just remember your question there. We had 
essentially 59% growth, as you said, 600 basis 
points higher than Q2. In 
this line item, is certainly the fees associated with Amazon Prime and also 
it's where a lot of our subscription services for digital music, digital video, 
audiobooks, e
-
books, so there's some moving parts in there.
 
The growth in 
Prime has been fairly consistent over the last recent quarters 
in Prime memberships, and as I said, we had the largest new sign
-
ups on 
Prime Day for the Prime program. The monthly program is gaining traction 
and is an attractive option for a lot of people.
 
And again, on the other 
subscription services, music especially, it works just so well with our Echo 
device that we're seeing a lot of growth in that area as we increase the 
number of Echo devices and customers using the Echo devices.

Thanks for taking the question. In the comment in the release on seasonal 
workers, that looks roughly flat year

yea

understand a little bit more about the trajectory around the workers needed 
to fulfill seasonal holiday demand and what that might also mean for 
automation or efficiency benefits you're getting inside your fulfillment 
cente
rs? Thanks so much.
 
Dave Fildes

Amazon.com, Inc.
 
Yes, Eric, this is Dave. I think we put out a release, I think, earlier this 
quarter talking about 120,000 operations folks to bring into our fulfillment 
centers this year. So, we're continuing to hire and
 
hire across a number of 
locations. We talked earlier this year about expecting to see a greater than 
or 

 
roughly or greater than 30% square footage growth in operations. So, 
we're certainly hiring to support that. More of these facilities do have 
Amazon 
Robotics and certainly that helps with the efficiencies there, but it 
requires a tremendous effort from a number of our folks as well, and so we'll 
continue to hire there.

While we're on this subject of head count, head
 
count grew 77% year
-
over
-
year in the quarter. That includes the impact of the Whole Foods and Souq 
acquisitions. Without those, without that head count, the base Amazon grew 
47%, which is still up from 42% in Q2. So a lot of the additional pickup in 
Q3 wa
s tied to our ramp for the holidays. We continued to hire a lot of 
software engineers. We continued to hire a lot of sales reps and it's tied 
directly to our major investment areas of AWS, Prime Video and devices.

Thanks for taking the question. Brian, I was hoping you could help us 
understand how, at this point, you're prioritizing expansi
on into new product 
categories. In particular, there's a lot of talk now about potentially using 
Whole Foods stores for a physical pharmacy presence and also that you've 
perhaps gotten approvals across multiple states in that category. Can you 
just help us
 
understand the approach in general to new categories and 
pharmacy in particular? Thank you.
 
Brian T. Olsavsky 
-
 
Amazon.com, Inc.
 
Yeah, I can't confirm or deny any of the rumors related to pharmacy or 
anything else. I will say we do see a lot of 
opportunity with Whole Foods. As 
I said, there will be a lot of work together between Prime Now, 
AmazonFresh, Whole Foods, Whole Foods products on the Amazon site, 
Amazon Lockers at the Whole Foods stores. So, there will be a lot of 
integration, a lot of t
ouch points and a lot of working together as we go 
forward. And we think we'll be also developing new store formats and 
everything else just as we talked about in the past before Whole Foods. 
Amazon Books stores, Amazon Go, and the opportunity that that te
chnology 
presents. We have on campus bookstores.
 
So, we are experimenting with a lot of formats. I think that Whole Foods 
really gives us a vast headstart on that and a great base. And a great team 
to work with who has a lot of history and a lot of 

 
they 
probably have 10 
years to 20 years of learnings that we don't have and wouldn't have. So, 
we're really excited about that and I think working together, will bring our 
different strengths to the table and really be able to build on behalf of 
customers.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark May with Citi. 
Please proceed with your question.
 
Mark A. May

Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
 
Thank you. The other category 
which includes advertising accelerated 58% 
in the quarter. I think the common view there is that that's a fairly high 
margin business, certainly higher than corporate average. Is there any 
reason why that isn't the right assumption to make? Essentially wha
t impact 
is the growth in the ad business having on the company's overall 
profitability? And in terms of the increased losses in the international retail 
segment of the business, can you provide some color around how much of 
that's being driven by Amazon l
aunching into new markets, which I know 
you continue to do, versus investing more heavily in existing markets?
 
Brian T. Olsavsky 
-
 
Amazon.com, Inc.
 
Sure. Let me start with the revenue. So you're right, other revenue grew 
58% in the quarter. And that includ
es advertising services and other things 
such as our cobranded credit card agreements. Advertising revenue 
continues to grow very quickly and its year
-
over
-
year growth rate is actually 
faster than the other revenue line item that you see there. But I would
 
say, 
generally, we're very pleased with the advertising business. Our goal here is 
to be helpful to consumers and help them make better shopping and 
selection choices. We'll also provide 

 
and giving them targeted 
recommendations, so making it helpful for
 
customers rather than intrusive.
 
And then we believe that by creating that growth (17:19) and engaging 
advertising experience with the customers, it will also maximize success for 
our advertisers. So, it's an important part of the flywheel and so it's the
 
traffic and the customers, especially the Prime customers that come to the 
site, are really the ones that we can use to help them select items and use 
advertising to help make their decisions more informed when they're picking 
products.
 
On the internation
al, yeah, I can't split it, the effects, but I will tell you 
again, it is international expansion and primarily in India where we're 
continuing to add benefits. And we launched Prime there a year ago, if you 
remember, and we've had more Prime members join 
in India than in any 
other country in the first 12 months. We have free shipping on 10 million 
items there and we're continuing to add benefits; Prime Video, Amazon 
Family.
 
We had the first Prime Day there this year, Prime Music, Amazon Business is 
also ex
panding in India. So, a lot of positive momentum and investment 
going on in India, very pleased with that. We also recently announced Echo 
and Alexa are available in India. So that should be well received by the 
Indian consumer base.
 
But excluding India an
d Souq, the rest is the Prime benefits and the 
continued growth in the other countries that we have been in for a while, 
continue to roll out Prime Now and AmazonFresh. In video, if you remember 
in Q4 of last year, we launched Prime Video in over 200 count
ries globally, 
continue to build up not only the offerings, but also the engagement that we 
see from those Prime customers.
 
So becoming more engaged and we're also doing the basic blocking, tackling 
of adding selection, especially FBA selection, increasing
 
free shipping offers 
and also speed of shipping offers. So, there's a lot of different influences 
there. You saw the growth rate. We believe that it's resonating with 
customers. So, we will continue to invest and think that we have a good 
path forward.

Barclays Capital, Inc.
 
Hey, guys. Two questions. There's been some news flow recently about 
Brazil expansion. Can you j
ust talk about how Brazil compares to maybe 
some of the other international markets that you're investing in? What level 
of investment should we expect in Brazil maybe relative to like in Australia 
or in India?
 
And then a follow
-
up on the Whole Foods, so d
o you feel like the store 
footprint at 460 odd scores is adequate? Or any color on plans to expand 
either the Whole Foods store footprint or the Amazon Books stores or those 
other ones you mentioned? Thank you.
 
Dave Fildes 
-
 
Amazon.com, Inc.
 
Yeah, Ross. Th
anks for the question. This is Dave. On Brazil, just briefly, 
yeah we did recently expand and add an electronics category there in Brazil. 
It's a third
-
party marketplace offering. You may recall we've been in Brazil 
for a number of years now, initially lau
nched with really a Kindle and e
-
books offering without the sort of physical categories and, more recently, 
added physical books again, a third
-
party marketplace offering.
 
So, I think, we're excited about the electronics getting out there. There is a 
wide 
variety of products included in that category: smartphones, tablets, 
cameras, TVs, what have you. So, I think, we're really excited to get that 
technology out there for Brazilians. And I think beyond that, we really just 
focus on those categories and growi
ng selection there, but I can't speculate 
on what we might do in the future there.
 
Brian T. Olsavsky 
-
 
Amazon.com, Inc.
 
And on Whole Foods, yes, I believe the total is 465 stores or thereabouts. 
And we have 12 bookstores now. We are adding a few more in th
e near 
future in California, Washington DC, and Austin. So, yeah, you will see more 
expansion from us. We're not ready to announce what that will look like and 
we are working with the Whole Foods team on how many more stores we 
might have in that area. But
 
still early, so those plans will develop over time.

Heath Terry

Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
 
Great. Thanks, Brian. I 
understand you can't comment on rumors one way 
or the other but curious, as you think about categories like health care and, 
obviously, you guys are already in health care to some degree through 
Amazon Business, can you give us a bit of a status update on 
what you do 
have out there now? And particularly how the company and management 
thinks about entering more regulated businesses over time, how you would 
approach that versus a standard category that you might go into or maybe 
again knowing you can't commen
t on rumors, how you have approached 
that in the past or in other markets.
 
And then to the extent that we're thinking about AWS growth in the fourth 
quarter, you guys are lapping the price cuts from last year and, obviously, 
have about an 800
-
basis
-
point e
asier comp Q3 to Q4, taking those two 
things into consideration, how should we think about AWS growth through 
the end of the year?
 
Dave Fildes 
-
 
Amazon.com, Inc.
 
Yeah, Heath. This is Dave. I'll take that first question in relation to health 
care. I think w
here you're seeing us do some work in that, I think, is on the 
areas of Amazon Business, and that's really just from the standpoint of there 
are many different types of businesses that we can serve with that offering, 
and we're in our third year now, and s
o there's a lot of different sectors, 
whether they are hospitals, educational institutions, labs, government 
agencies, I mean, there's a lot of different shapes and sizes across industries 
that we can serve with that.
 
And so, I think what you're seeing us 
do is really focus on services that meet 
those businesses multi
-
user accounts, improving approval workflow tools 
and just more recently, we introduced Amazon Business for Business Prime 
Shipping, which we think will be a great way for businesses to use mul
tiuser 

 
business customers have multiuser accounts, and that's in the U.S. and 
Germany. So, I think it's part of that offering, and we will really have to see 
how that evolves. And the other side, too, is certainly health care is one of 
many sectors as pa
rt of Amazon Web Services that are important customers 
that we are focusing on and building tools for. So probably nothing specific 
to call out on that one, but that's a lot of what you're seeing from us today.
 
Brian T. Olsavsky 
-
 
Amazon.com, Inc.
 
Yeah, on
 
AWS, we don't provide segment level estimates, but we did 
consider in our guidance the impact of the price cuts last year. You're right, 
we had a number of price cuts timed about around December 1 of last year. 
That certainly had an impact on Q4 of last y
ear. But again, price cuts and 
not only price cuts but new products that have lower average cost and can 
cannibalize more expensive products is pretty much a part of our business 
all the time in AWS. So we're looking forward to a strong Q4 and re:Invent is
 
in December or the end of November, early December, so that is also an 
exciting time of year for the AWS business.

Please proceed with your question.
 
Scott William Devi

Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.
 
Hi. Thanks. I had two, please. First, Prime Now, Fresh, Prime Pantry, and 
Whole Foods, they're all distinct offerings, but it does seem like there's 
natural overlap with the potential to be further connected. And I was jus
t 
wondering if you could just speak to how we should think about those four 
as distinct product offerings in the future versus being more integrated and 
possibly even in some cases, eliminated to remove overlap from a customer 
experience standpoint.
 
And th
en secondly, given the recent management changes in video, Brian, I 
was just wondering if you could speak to any strategic shifts in video or 
changes in the pace of content portfolio build in coming years? Thank you.
 
Brian T. Olsavsky 
-
 
Amazon.com, Inc.
 
Su
re. Let me start with video. And I just want to be clear. We're going to 
continue to invest in video and increase that investment in 2018. And why 
are we going to do that? It's because the video business is having great 
results with our most important cust
omer base, which is our Prime 
customers. It continues to drive better conversion of free trials, higher 
membership renewal rates for existing subscribers and higher overall 
engagement. We're seeing the engagement go up year
-
after
-
year in video 
and also mus
ic and a lot of the other Prime benefits. We also know Prime 
members who watch video also spend more on Amazon.
 
And we have a lot of data where that's the advantage we have is that we see 
the viewing patterns, and we also see the sales patterns, so we can 
tie the 
two together and understand which video resonates with Prime members, 
which video doesn't, and make mid course corrections. So we always do 
that. We're always changing the emphasis and looking for those more 
impactful shows, more shows that resonat
e better with our customer base, 
and things they want to see. So that will always be an important part of our 
Prime offer, and we'll continue to use the data that we have to make better 
and better decisions about where to invest our dollars in Prime Video.
 
So we 
remain very bullish on the video business, and we're looking forward to a lot 
of interesting new projects at the back
-
end of this year and also lined up 
into next year.
 
On the, sorry, the second comment was, oh, the overlap. Yes. So Whole 
Foods, I t
hink I mentioned this earlier, but we definitely see commonality 
and overlap with the Whole Foods business as well as Amazon in total, but 
specifically Prime Now and also AmazonFresh. And we're going to work to 
see how we expand those offerings, and in som
e cases combine them. We're 
not sure how it'll play out.
 
But we're going cooperate across those different customer touch points and 
trying to make them better for customers. We know customers are going to 
buy, just like in the physical world, sometimes you
 
go to a convenience 
store, sometimes you go to a supermarket, sometimes you go to a 
superstore. Sometimes you need things within an hour, sometimes you can 
wait days for shipments. So there's no one paradigm for all customer 
engagement, and we're looking 
for the ones that resonate best with 
customers and we're going to continue to work on those.

Thanks. I'll actually ask two, if I can. Just any way you can comment on the

? Thank you.
 
Brian T. Olsavsky

Let me start on traffic. So we're not disclosing traffic figures. Whole Foods 
will be issuing a final 10
-
K early next month. So you'll see a better 
perspective on the entire quarter. The quarter that, or th
e four week period 
that you see running through the Amazon P&L this quarter is pretty hard to 
draw conclusions on other than revenue at this point. But Dave, do you have 
more on the...?
 
Dave Fildes 
-
 
Amazon.com, Inc.
 
Yeah, Jason, this is Dave. On the ad su
pported question, I think what you've 
seen to
-
date is really particularly as you're looking as a customer, as a Prime 
Video member and watching content, we view that as you've paid into that 
service and able to watch those shows ad free. There may be insta
nces 
where you're viewing a first episode and there's an ad leading into that if it's 
the first free episode, but generally we like to have that as customers have 
paid into that program and they'll be able to enjoy that without interruption.

Great. Thanks for the question. Just wanted to ask about delivery and just 
over the last several 
months, we've seen a lot of announcements and 
products around delivery options between Lockers, the testing of the Kohl's 
partnership, Whole Foods obviously, Amazon Key came out recently, just 
wanted to better understand this investment. Is this a result o
f, or the thesis 
that more options could drive obviously more sales on the flip side, do you 
think you're losing sales by not having those options? Thank you.
 
Brian T. Olsavsky 
-
 
Amazon.com, Inc.
 
Probably a little of both. We think that especially as we ge
t into more and 
more Amazon Logistics deliveries, we're going to experiment with different 
ways to deliver things that make it easier on consumers, things that cut 
down on potential theft on doorsteps, but really it's mostly about increasing 
convenience fo
r them.
 
Dave Fildes 
-
 
Amazon.com, Inc.
 
Yeah. I think that's right. In terms of overall investments there.
 
Brian T. Olsavsky 
-
 
Amazon.com, Inc.
 
And the other investments obviously are on the 
-
maybe on the bigger
-
ish 
things or like planes and transportation 
capacity in general. There our 
philosophy is, again, we are going to watch out for our customers, we're 
going to build capacity that gives them great service 12 months a year but 
particularly at holidays. By investing in those transportation options, we do
 
so at same cost or cost parity I would say at the very minimum.
 
But it also allows us to do interesting things like extend cut off times for 
customers. It enables Sunday delivery, enable better weekend delivery. So 
we're seeing a lot of benefits, just the
 
ability to stretch the order cut off from 
what once was 3 PM in the afternoon to midnight. Has huge benefits for both 
the customer and also for Amazon. It results in incremental sales and it also 
builds that trust that when you need something, Amazon is g
oing to be there 
for you. And I need to remind you that the Thursday Night Football Game 
will start in two hours and 20 minutes, so...

Thank you for standing by. Good day, everyone, and welcome to the 
Amazon.com Q2 2017 Financial Results Teleconference. At this time, all 
participants are in a listen
-
only mode. After the presentation, we will 
conduct a 
question
-
and
-
answer session. Today's call is being recorded.
 
For opening remarks, I will be turning the call over to the Director of 
Investor Relations, Darin Manney. Please go ahead.

Amazon.com, Inc.
 
Hello, and welcome to our Q2 2017 financ
ial results conference call. Joining 
us today to answer your questions is Brian Olsavsky, our CFO. As you listen 
to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in 
front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics
 
and 
commentary on the quarter. Please note, unless otherwise stated, all 
comparisons in this call will be against our results to the comparable period 
of 2016.
 
Our comments and responses to your questions reflect management's views 
as of today, July 27, 2
017 only, and include forward
-
looking statements. 
Actual results may differ materially.
 
Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our 
financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the 
SEC, including ou
r most recent annual report on Form 10
-
K and subsequent 
filings.
 
During this call, we may discuss certain non
-
GAAP financial measures. In our 
press release, slides accompanying this webcast, and our filings with the 
SEC, each of which is posted on our IR w
ebsite. You will find additional 
disclosures regarding these non
-
GAAP measures, including reconciliations of 
these measures with comparable GAAP measures.
 
Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we've seen to
-
date and 
what we believe today to be ap
propriate assumptions. Our results are 
inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, 
including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic 
conditions and customer spending, world events, the rate of growth 
of the 
Internet, online commerce and cloud services and the various factors 
detailed in our filings with the SEC.
 
Our guidance also assumes, among other things, that we don't conclude any 
additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings or leg
al 
settlements and excludes the impact of our proposed acquisition of Whole 
Foods Market. It is not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods 
and services, and therefore our actual results could differ materially from our 
guidance.
 
With that, we 
will move to Q&A. Operator, please remind our listeners how 
to initiate a question.

At this time, we will open up the call for questions. We ask each caller please

Great. Thank you. I was just wondering if you could give us a sense on the 
investments that are planned in Q3. Previously, yo
u've been willing to 
provide sort of some qualitative guidance around how you're rank ordering 
those or in terms of the ones that are the largest areas of investment in the 
quarter. I'm just wondering if you could update us on that given the 
guidance for Q
3 and what we saw in investment in Q2.
 
Brian T. Olsavsky

Amazon.com, Inc.
 
Sure. Let me see what I can tell you on that. First of all, I want to remind 
you that Q3 is typically a lower operating income quarter as we're preparing 
for the Q4 holiday peak. T
he other dynamic is that, similar to last year, a 
large percentage of our new fulfillment centers are coming online in the 
second half of the year, a lot of them in Q3. So, to give that some 
perspective, the Amazon
-
fulfilled network, or the combination of 
retail and 
FBA shipments coming out of our warehouses has been nearly 40%. It was 
that last year, and it's continued through this year. Last year we added 30% 
additional square footage to handle that additional shipping volume, and 
about 80% of that went i
nto service in the back end of last year. And that's 
what I mentioned about this time last year.
 
The similar dynamic this year, we are going to have about 80% of our 
increase in square footage for fulfillment and shipping coming online in the 
back end of t
he year, so that's a major increase. The other comment I would 
make is on the video content. Video content last year, I highlighted the fact 
that it was going to be a significant step up between second half of 2016 and 
the second half of 2015. We are still
 

 
we lapped that most of the first half 
this year and we'll also be increasing video spend on a sequential and year
-
over
-
year basis in Q3, and that's included in this guidance.
 
Other than that, can't give much more specifics except to say that the large 
i
nvestment areas remain the increasing fulfillment capacity to service the 
strong growth of the FBA business. I will also point out that the strong usage 
growth in AWS has led us to a step up in infrastructure in capital leases to 
build the capital leases i
n the trailing 12 months. They've increased 71% 
through the end of Q2 versus last year. That is servicing 

 
accelerating 
usage in our largest AWS services as well as geographic expansion. So that's 
additional factor sequentially in the quarter year
-
over
-
ye
ar.

Great. Thank you. A question on the grocery category and the 
announcements that
 
we have 

 
that we heard recently. Specifically, does 
that imply that the strategy has changed around fresh, which was 
presumably replacing the trip to the grocery store? Or should we think about 
adding different modes such as pick up points and bricks and
 
mortar as 
serving a distinct customer base or geared to reduce the cost bottleneck 
around home delivery? Any comments would be helpful. Thanks.
 
Brian T. Olsavsky

Amazon.com, Inc.
 
Sure, Colin. First, as far as Whole Foods is concerned, as Darin mentioned
, 
it's not included in this guidance since it hasn't closed yet, but we are 
excited about that acquisition and looking forward to working with the team 
at Whole Foods. We think they are very customer
-
centric, just like us. 
They've built a great business, f
ocus around quality and customer. So we're 
really glad to join up with them. On your larger question about what the 
place of Amazon Fresh, likely Prime Now and some of our other efforts, I 
would say we believe there'll be no one solution, so we're experime
nting 
with a number of the formats from physical pickup points in Amazon Go to 
online ordering and delivery to your door through Prime Now and Amazon 
Fresh.
 
And we'll see how customers respond. We like the response that we've seen 
so far. We think it's a v
aluable 

 
all those are valuable services, Amazon Go 
is not out of beta, but the other ones are. On top of that, we're looking 
forward to adding the Whole Foods team and their great reputation for 
quality customer service to this offering.

Yes. A couple of questions. It definitely seems relative to your guidance, you 
may have stepped up spendi
ng in the second quarter. Anything in particular 
to call out, India or anything like that? And then just thinking bigger picture, 
I'm wondering why physical locations might make sense for Amazon. Why is 
that a positive use of capital going forward? Thank y
ou.
 
Brian T. Olsavsky 
-
 
Amazon.com, Inc.
 
Sure. As far as Q2 is concerned, we were very encouraged by the revenue 
and unit growth acceleration, particularly in North America. We see that tied 
to the Prime growth and the adoption of Prime and success of that
 
program. 
Also point out that AWS stepped up its run rate from a $14 billion run rate 
last quarter to $16 billion. So we saw the largest quarter
-
over
-
quarter and 
year
-
over
-
year increase in revenue in that business as well. And gross 
margin expanded 130 bas
is points.
 
So as you point out, the year
-
over
-
year difference is primarily driven by 
investments, what we were within the guidance range and we continue to 
invest in, as I said, fulfillment capacity and logistics services, digital video, 
our Echo and Alexa
, Echo devices and Alexa platform India, the buildup at 
the AWS infrastructure, all the things I mentioned not to mention Prime Now 
and Amazon Fresh and Prime benefits.
 
We did see a big jump in head count in year
-
over
-
year. You'll see it's 42%, 
and in the 
past, I'd say most of that is driven by operations hiring. I've even 
said that headquarters or office hiring many times in the past was below the 
level of revenue growth. Right now, what we're seeing is an accelerated 
growth rate in software engineers and 
also sales teams to support primarily 
AWS and advertising. So, yes, the growth rate of those two job categories 
actually exceeded the company growth rate. So we are adding 

 
having 
success hiring a lot of people and pointing them at some very important 
pro
grams and customer
-
facing efforts.
 
On the place of physical, again, as I mentioned in the earlier question, we 
are experimenting with a number of formats. You've seen the physical 
bookstores and I would say that the benefit there is again, we have a 
curate
d selection of titles and it's also a great opportunity for people to 
touch and feel our devices and see them, especially the new Echo devices. I 
went into the store in Seattle last week and I saw about a third of the people 
were standing around the device
 
table learning how they work, how they 
interact with devices. So, I saw firsthand the customer experience, I think, 
that's what we're seeing as a benefit to the physical stores right now.

Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
 
Thank you. A question on the comments around the fulfillment investments. 
Could you characterize or maybe even quantify how much of the fulfillment 
infrastructure investment 
that you're making is kind of incremental, is 
geared towards handling growth and sort of the existing business and 
infrastructure versus expanding your capabilities in fulfillment, like adding 
more inbound or last mile and/or from entering new internationa
l markets 
where you need to invest ahead of growth versus just sort of keeping up and 
maintaining growth within sort of your existing footprint? And then AWS, you 
had some price adjustments in May, yet the Q2 growth was quite good. Can 
you just comment abo
ut the impact that those cuts may have had in Q2 and 
if you're modeling those also in your Q3 guidance, maybe the impact there? 
Thanks.
 
Brian T. Olsavsky 
-
 
Amazon.com, Inc.
 
Yes. Let me start with the second one. So, yes, we've had numerous price 
decreases,
 
and we continue to have that in the AWS business, both absolute 
decreases in service costs and also rolling out new services that may be 
cannibalizing more expensive other services that we provide. So, nothing 
really to note on Q2 or Q3 from that standpoi
nt. The fulfillment investments, 
I can't split it out for you between Amazon logistics support sort centers and 
fulfillment centers. What I can say, the biggest dynamic going on again is 
that Amazon fulfilled unit growth of nearly 40%, which was last year 
and 
carrying into this year.
 
It's a global number and we are very glad to have the success of the FBA 
program. We are matching that with just over 30% increase in square 
footage, and you're right, that does include some shipping sort centers and 
things tha
t are incremental and new functions for us, if you will. But that's 
about all I can say on that right now. I think we're very happy with the FBA 
program. It's impact on Prime and we think Prime and FBA are self
-
reinforcing. We know customers really like it
, the additional selection that 
FBA provides. So we like those combined, and we are working very hard to 
match that with capacity in an efficient manner.

Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to follow up on AWS, and just 
on the back of the price cut, obviously 1Q being the first full quarter, but it 
looks like 2Q, as Mark said, things did stabili
ze some. Can you just talk 
about whether you're seeing more of a volume pickup response here and 
companies kind of more actively moving volume into the cloud at these 
lower prices? And then just secondly, on Prime, the value of a Prime 
subscription for the
 
consumer seems to continue to increase as you add 
more features in there. Can you just talk about your view around the 
flexibility of the price of annual Prime subscription? Thanks.
 
Brian T. Olsavsky 
-
 
Amazon.com, Inc.
 
Sure. On the price of Prime, I have 
nothing to add at this time. We think 
that the 

 
we are increasing the value of the Prime program every day. So it 
becomes more and more valuable and again, as we've said, it's the best deal 
in retail. On AWS, yes, we are seeing great customer adoption. Ag
ain, as I 
said earlier, the run rate's gone up from $14 billion to $16 billion in Q2, and 
also we had the largest sequential and year
-
over
-
year dollar rise in 
revenues. Our usage in all of our large services are actually accelerating and 
they're growing at
 
a rate higher than our revenue growth. So, you're seeing 
great adoption. We are seeing AWS customers migrate more than 30 
databases over the last year
-
and
-
a
-
half.
 
We signed some very big customer wins, like Ancestry, High Tail, California 
Polytechnic Stat
e University and others, that we're very proud to have. So, 
yes, the momentum in the business is very strong. We continue to open new 
regions. We'll be opening five regions in the near future in France, China, 
Sweden, Hong Kong and a second government clou
d region in the East. So, 
yes, we like the momentum in that business. Stepping back, I would say 
that while pricing is important, again, we're generally being selected because 
of our functionality and pace of innovation, the innovation keeps 
accelerating. 
It did in the first half of this year, the pace of new services and 
features. We also know the customers value our partner and customer 
ecosystem and really the experience we've had, we've been at this longer 
than anybody else.

Mark Mahaney

RBC Capital Markets LLC
 
Hey. I want to stick with AWS, please. So the AWS revenue growth showed 
almost no change but the AWS operating margin was 
lower I guess than 
we've seen in, I don't know, six quarters or something like that. I find that a 
little surprising but then I also saw that the tech and content came in 
materially heavy, I think, versus our and I assume other expectations. So 
could you j
ust talk about that a little bit, the profitability, if there's anything 
that's changed in the profitability of AWS? Thanks.
 
Brian T. Olsavsky 
-
 
Amazon.com, Inc.
 
Sure. Those margins, as we say frequently, are going to fluctuate quarter
-
to
-
quarter and always going to be a net of investments, excuse me, price 
reductions and cost efficiencies that we drive. So I would say the biggest 
impact in the margin that you're s
eeing in Q2 is really around the 71% 
increase in assets acquired under capital leases. Most of that is for the AWS 
business. So we've really stepped up the infrastructure to match the large 
usage growth and also the geographic expansion. And that is showin
g up in 
tech and content. On the marketing, if you look under the marketing 
expenses, they are also up, and that is driven by the increases we're seeing 
in the sales team both in AWS and advertising. So I would point to those two 
as probably larger than no
rmal impacts on Q2 operating margin.

Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. The first one, as y
ou continue 
to add more Prime Now markets with one to two
-
hour shipping, can you just 
talk to some of the logistical challenges that you've already encountered and 
worked through? And talk to kind of if you really do see one to two
-
hour 
shipping become a l
arger piece of the business over the next year, what's 
the biggest challenge you have to make sure that you manage? And the 
second one on the subscription revenue, it looks like subscription revenue 
growth was strong again, over 50%. Could you just talk to
 
what drove that 
acceleration? Was it Prime? Or is there something else in there? Thanks.
 
Brian T. Olsavsky 
-
 
Amazon.com, Inc.
 
Sure. Let me start with your second question on the subscription revenue. It 
grew 53% year
-
over
-
year versus 52% in Q1. So, we con
tinue to see strong 
Prime membership growth. That is the main thing. There's also 

 
in that line 
item are also other monthly fees associated with some of our other 
subscription services like audiobooks, e
-
books, digital video and digital 
music. Again, I wo
uld say that we're very happy with the Prime membership 
growth and it has remained pretty consistent both in Q4 and then through 
Q1 and Q2 of this year.
 
On your second question on Prime Now, so Prime Now is now available in 50 
cities across eight countries
. We do learn. It's something to do in every city 
and have different 

 
slightly different shapes and sizes of those buildings 
and different density profiles. And so we are learning as we go, learn as we 
grow internationally as well. That is a service that 
customers love. That's not 
an inexpensive service, though, and we also have 

 
so we're constantly 
working on our cost of delivery and our route densities. And again, we like 
what we see and we'll continue to expand that and we'll be working very 
hard on ma
king that not only a valuable Prime offering, a Prime benefit, but 
also a lower
-
cost operation as well.

Hey. Good afternoon, Brian. I think I heard you earlier say that your head 
count for advertising salespeople is growing faster than the company as a 
whole, or company's head count growth rate as a whole. I would just like t
o 
use that maybe as a springboard to talk a little bit about what you think the 
right mix is for how you sell in terms of self
-
service versus salespeople.
 
And then a second one would just be a quick one. I know it's early, but be 
curious to see what you're
 
seeing with users of the Echo Show, with the 
screen on it, and if you're seeing any particularly different type of user 
behavior there versus the original devices with that one. Thank you.
 
Brian T. Olsavsky 
-
 
Amazon.com, Inc.
 
Sure. Yes. It's early on the 
Echo Show. As you know, we just started 
shipping those in late June, but we're very excited about the potential and 
the addition of the video screen and the messaging capability and video 
capability. So it's 

 
I've used mine, it's awesome. It's a big step 
up in my 
mind, but we'll get more customer feedback as we go along. On advertising, 
technically what I said is the sales force has grown higher than the rate of 
growth in the business itself, which was 42% regular head count and that 
sales force is primari
ly AWS and advertising. So, we built self
-
service tools 
and obviously we want to make those as efficient as possible for customers 
and advertisers, but we realize that we will need actual sales contact with 
the accounts as well. So it's a mix. I can't get 
into the split, really, but I 
would see both growing.

UBS Securities LLC
 
Thanks so much for taking the question. Maybe tw
o. One, with respect to 
international margins, is there anything there you can give us in terms of 
rank order or color, whether it be geographies or category expansion that we 
should be thinking about that are driving some of the cost curve in the 
internat
ional side of the business? That would be number one. Number two, 
stock
-
based comps stepped up a lot, both quarter
-
over
-
quarter and year
-
on
-
year. Wanted to know if there was anything either organic or inorganic that 
was driving that step
-
up in stock
-
based 
compensation. Thank so much.
 
Brian T. Olsavsky 
-
 
Amazon.com, Inc.
 
Sure. I'll start with the second one. Yes, as you noted in the press release or 
the 8
-
K, we had an absolute step
-
up from Q1 of $792 million to Q2 of $1.2 
billion. So it increased 51% year
-
ov
er
-
year in Q2 versus a head count 
increase of 42%. I'll also say that we generally see a step
-
up from Q1 to Q2 
because we do our employee RCU grants in Q2 of each year. So that's a 
normal trend. But the 51% year
-
over
-
year is also 

 
it's a combination of th
e 
hiring we've done but also an adjustment we made to our estimated 
forfeiture rate. We're seeing less forfeitures, which is a great sign for our 
employee retention, but you have to make adjustments to your reserves as 
you see that. So that was another inf
luence in Q2.
 
On operating margins internationally, I would step back and say a lot of the 
investments we're making in North America we're also making in 
international. Prime benefits including Prime Video and remember we 
launched Global Video in Q4 of las
t year to 200 countries, Prime Now, 
Amazon Fresh, the general rise of FBA and added selection, both retail and 
FBA to make Prime more attractive, and the fulfillment and logistics costs 
that go with that, and the additional constant effort to reduce prices
 
and 
accelerate shipping. So that all impacts both North America segment and 
international. The North America segment is a little further along in the 
Prime, excuse me, yes, the Prime membership growth curve. And so in some 
respects we are giving benefits 
earlier in the lifecycle to international Prime 
customers than we did in North America just because it launched later.
 
And there's also India, as I mentioned, we continue to invest in India. We're 
very hopeful with the progress we've made with sellers and 
customers alike 
in India and we see great momentum and success there, so we continue to 
invest and we have some of our best people in that business.

about that path optimization over a year or so? As you

Hi, Brian. This is Darin. Yes. We're getting more efficient every time we put 
new capacity into the network, whether that's through automation or just 
through the experience we've gained over the years. We still say it takes up 
to three years or three peak
s to get to kind of network efficiency for a new 
particular facility, and that's about the same although the whole network 
gets sufficient over time. So there's a big mix going on, and we like the new 
innovation that we're bringing to the capabilities, but
 
that ramp still stays 
about consistent as it was.

made a comment about physical stores and reaction to one other question 
that was really about showcasing new devices. Is it

thinking about that? Thank you.

there anything to call out around that?
 
Brian T. Olsavsky

Amazon.com, Inc.
 
No, nothing in that other line item. It's advertising and also other things like 
cobranded cre
dit card agreements. I would say that advertising revenue 
growth has been strong and fairly consistent over the past three quarters. 
So that number will move around, but there's other things in it that more 
the variance and the volatility is in the other l
ine items.
 
Your question on stores, we are 

 
again, I personally think the new devices, 
the ability to see new devices is a great asset, but I don't want to 
shortchange the rest of the bookstore and the ability to have curated 
selection and the creativity 
we've had in taking new look at the bookstores. 
So we are experimenting with different formats, and we look at different 
sizes and we look at revenue cost per square foot just like any other physical 
retailer. So, we haven't essentially nailed the model ye
t, and we continue to 
experiment to see what works and how it differs by city or more suburban 
locations.

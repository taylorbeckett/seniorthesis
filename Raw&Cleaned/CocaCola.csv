Muhtar Kent
 
Thank you, Jackson and good morning, everyone. Let me start by saying 
that we are pleased with our reported results today. 
In a year marked by 
further uncertainty in the global economy, once again, we delivered solid 
volume, solid revenue and solid profit growth. We grew our worldwide 
volume by 3% in the quarter and 4% for the full year. We generated, in 
comparable currency ne
utral, net revenue growth of 5% in the quarter and 
6% for the full year in the process delivering net revenues over $48 billion in 
2012, consistent with the outlook we provided last quarter, we delivered full 
year comparable currency neutral operating inco
me growth of 6%. This 
growth also translated into our company
-
generating record comparable 
operating income of more than $11 billion for 2012. Importantly, we met our 
long
-
term volume revenue and profit targets for the full year, an 
accomplishment we are p
roud of meeting or exceeding every year since we 
announced our 2020 Vision.
 
In fact, since the first quarter of 2010, and the start of our 2020 Vision, 
during one of the most difficult macroeconomic environments in recent 
history, we have firstly grown our
 
daily servings by more than $200 million 
serving more consumers daily on a global basis than at any other time in our 
history.
 
Secondly, increased our global volume and value share of both, our Spark or 
our core sparkling and nonalcoholic ready
-
to
-
drink b
everages to their 
highest levels since 2003, and thirdly we added over $30 billion to our 
company's market capitalization.
 
We are well on our way to doubling our systems' revenues by 2020 to $200 
billion, reflecting the ongoing commitment of our entire glo
bal system to 
keep investing together for a better tomorrow, and we are crystal
-
clear on 
why we do what we do, so it is our mission to refresh the world, inspire 
moments of optimism and happiness and to create sustainable value while 
making a lasting diffe
rence.
 
This year, we once again led industry growth and expanded our volume and 
value share gains globally in nonalcoholic, ready
-
to
-
drink beverages. We 
gained global share in the sparkling beverage category, where our portfolio 
was up 3% for the full year
. This is the third straight year our sparkling 
beverages had grown by at least 550 million incremental cases. This has 
added more than 13 billion new servings annually to our global business for 
the past three. This growth of our sparkling beverages has c
onsistently and 
reliably been led by brand Coca
-
Cola, which grew a very healthy 3% for the 
full year of 2012.
 
We also gained global share in still beverages with our portfolio growing a 
solid 10% for the full year. This year, this full year growth was led 
by 
POWERADE and DASANI, which were both up double digits and our Glaceau 
trademark brands, which were up mid
-
single digits. In fact, our still 
beverage portfolio growth was well
-
balanced with mid
-
single to double
-
digit 
growth across every single still beve
rage category in which we compete.
 
As we have shared for some time now, we recognize that consumers across 
the globe continue to feel the effects of a still uncertain global economy. 
2012 saw the extension of prolonged uncertainty in Europe, the ongoing 
tr
ansition of the economy in China [one] recovery in the United States and 
ongoing challenges for Japanese consumers.
 
We expect this volatility to extend through 2013. Having said, the 
nonalcoholic ready
-
to
-
drink beverage category on the whole continues to b
e 
vibrant and grow in line with the levels we forecasted when we first 
developed our 2020 Vision. Our experience also teaches us that it is critical 
to seize opportunities during these uncertain times in order to lead and to 
succeed in any macro environmen
t. To do so, we will together with our 
bottling partners keep investing in our business, so that we not only grow 
bigger, but also we grow better, better at collaborating, better at innovating 
and better at listening to our consumers and customers as well 
as bottling 
partners. And most importantly, better at executing with precision. So, while 
2013 will once again be a year of challenges, we are confident that we will 
continue to generate consistent quality growth in this, the fourth year, of our 
2020 Visio
n.
 
So now, let us review our performance results across our global markets in 
more detail beginning first with North America flagship market. Our business 
in North America delivered its 11th consecutive quarter of growth, up 1% for 
the quarter and 2% for t
he full year. As a result, our North America business 
achieved its best ever full
-
year volume sales results. In addition, we 
sustained 2% positive price mix in 2012, resulting in our North America 
beverage business generating 6% full
-
year comparable curren
cy neutral net 
revenue growth. Importantly, we achieved this growth while also realizing 
full
-
year volume and value share gains in nonalcoholic ready
-
to
-
drink 
beverages.
 
In fact, since we initiated our 2020 Vision back at the end of 2009, our U.S. 
business
 
has seen consumer dollar spent across measured channels increase 
from approximately $56 to $60 per person in 2012. This represents over 
$1.5 billion of value created by our brand portfolio in these measured 
channels alone. I am personally very pleased wit
h our ability to deliver 
quality results, as well as to consistently create real value across our entire 
North America business.
 
This year's growth in North America was led by our still beverage portfolio 
which was up 8% in both the quarter and also for th
e full year. This is the 
fifth consecutive year that our North America still beverage portfolio has 
either maintained or gained, both volume and value share.
 
Our POWERADE brand grew double digits in both the quarter and for the full 
year making this POWERA
DE's third consecutive year of double
-
digit growth. 
More importantly, POWERADE is the North America sports drink category in 
both absolute volume and value growth for full year 2012. This was further 
evidenced of how today's consumers are increasingly demo
nstrating a 
growing preference for this innovative sports drinks brand.
 
Our premium Smartwater brand achieved a fifth straight year of double
-
digit 
growth. Our juice and juice drinks portfolio also delivered a year of positive 
growth with our Simply tradem
ark up 7% on a full
-
year basis. As such our 
total juice and juice drinks portfolio gained volume and value share in both 
the quarter and full
-
year.
 
Finally, our tea portfolio in North America sustained its momentum, up 
double digits while gaining volume an
d value share in both the quarter and 
full year. This result was led by Gold Peak which was up 36% in 2012 cycling 
48%, making this Gold Peak's sixth consecutive year of double
-
digit growth. 
Our sparkling beverage business in North America delivered absolu
te value 
growth in 2012 with full year in volume down 1% offset by a positive 2% 
price mix. Importantly, our strategy to provide meaningful and purposeful 
choice to consumers continued to yield benefits.
 
Our core sparkling beverage immediate consumption tr
ansactions were up 
1% for the full year enabling us to capture sparkling beverage volume and 
value share in North America in both the quarter and for the full year. Coke 
Zero sustained its momentum, up high single digits for the full year. We also 
saw acce
lerated growth in Fanta, which was up mid
-
single digits for the full
-
year.
 
As we look ahead, we remain positive that North America is the long
-
term 
growth market for our sparkling beverage business. We will keep investing in 
the category and in our winning
 
sparkling portfolio and continue to promote 
active, healthy well
-
being in all the communities that we proudly serve.
 
Moving now to Latin America, our volume grew 5% in the quarter and for 
the full year. The incremental volume we generated in Latin America
 
this 
year was equivalent to adding a business the size of Canada to this region's 
volume base. Our total business in Latin America set a new record with 
volume sales exceeding 8 billion unit cases or the equivalent of 192 billion 
servings on a full
-
year b
asis for the first time in our company's history.
 
Our sparkling beverages in Latin America grew a healthy 3% in 2012 with 
brand Coca
-
Cola also up 3% both for the quarter and for the full year. Also 
our still beverages in Latin America delivered double
-
digi
t growth in both the 
quarter and for the full year. These well
-
balanced results translated into 
Latin America capturing volume and value share in nonalcoholic beverages 
for the eighth consecutive year.
 
We also saw balanced result across all four of our 
Latin American business 
units, each generating mid to high single
-
digit growth for the full year. Our 
two largest markets in Latin America, Mexico and Brazil, were both up a 
solid 5% this quarter, while also growing volume and value share in 
nonalcoholic r
eady
-
to
-
drink beverages. On a full
-
year basis Mexico was up 
4% supported by consistent brand Coca
-
Cola growth, up 8% in the quarter 
and the full year. Brazil grew 6% for the full year with sparkling beverages 
up mid
-
single digits in both, the quarter and t
he full year. And last 
December, also three of our bottling partners in Brazil, including two 
operated by our Bottling Investments Group, signed an agreement to 
combine their operations. When completed, this transaction is going to you 
create the second
-
la
rgest Coca
-
Cola bottling operations in Brazil. The 
proposed combination with former company with a greater ability to invest 
in the market and accelerate growth, reflecting our franchise systems' 
continued evolution in our system's commitment to long
-
term 
sustainable 
growth in Brazil.
 
Now let me turn to our Pacific Group, which grew 2% in the quarter and 5% 
for the full year. In Japan, our full year volume grew 2% in line with the 
outlook we provided in our previous earnings calls. This resulted in our 
busi
ness in Japan delivering a third consecutive year of record high sales 
volumes. Our business in Japan also gained full year share in nonalcoholic 
ready
-
to
-
drink beverages. This result was driven by volume growth across 
most channels, including drugstores, 
convenience retail outlet and 
supermarkets.
 
I am also proud to announce that Ayataka, our premium green tea brands as 
well as LOHAS, our innovative water brand achieved $1 billion brand status 
in late 2012. These are the fourth and fifth billion dollar bra
nds we have 
added to our portfolio since announcing our 2020 Vision. Also, with regard to 
Japan, last December the four Japanese bottlers from the Greater Kanto 
region announced an agreement to merge into one integrated and publicly 
listed company called C
oca
-
Cola East Japan.
 
While this agreement is still pending final approval by each of the four 
bottlers shareholders, once compete, Coca
-
Cola East Japan will become our 
fifth largest global bottling partners in terms of annual revenue. We support 
this bottl
er led consolidation in Japan, and see it as one example of net of 
the many ways our franchise system continues to evolve in full alignment 
with our 2020 Vision.
 
Moving now to China, during our last earnings call we shared our clear 
expectations that China
's ongoing economic transition will have a short
-
term 
impact on our industry and on our business. Since then we've seen 
disposable consumer spending remain quite challenged in China, especially 
in the export
-
driven coastal areas where higher proportion of 
our beverages 
are proceeding. As a result, our China volume was down 4% in the fourth 
quarter, also impacted by unseasonably poor weather, the cycling of double
-
digit growth from last year and the timing of the Chinese New Year.
 
On a full
-
year basis, our v
olume in China grew mid
-
single digits, cycling 
double
-
digit growth from last year. Our strong sparkling beverage portfolio 
in China continued to expand our nearly 2 to 1 share advantage over our 
time ridge international competitor. This portfolio is very w
ell
-
positioned in 
China with leading brands in every major sparkling flavor categories, 
including Sprite number one sparkling brand in China, Coca
-
Cola recently 
rated by Chinese consumers as their most favorite brand and Fanta, which 
registered double
-
digi
t growth in 2012 exceeding 100 million annual unit 
cases for the first half. And, we are committed to investing and innovating 
across our broader still beverage portfolio in China to strengthen our 
presence across all categories.
 
As we look ahead to 2013, 
we still expect the ongoing uncertainty in China 
to have a short
-
term impact on our industry and on our business, although 
we do expect to see improvements in consumer disposable income as the 
year progresses. As such from here on, we expect our business t
o deliver 
sequential improvement in 2013. As we had stated before, we have every 
confidence in the long
-
term resilience of our China business and we remain 
very excited about our long
-
term opportunities in distribution.
 
Across the rest of the Pacific Group
, we realized several new milestone 
performances in fast
-
growing markets. South Korea was up double digits in 
2012 with our business sales achieving over 200 million annual unit cases 
for the first half. Thailand, also delivered double
-
digit growth, up 22%
 
for 
the full year resulting in record value share and full year unit case volume 
results.
 
Philippines also achieved strong results, growing 5% for the full year while 
also capturing volume and value share in nonalcoholic ready
-
to
-
drink 
beverages. As many 
of you know, we recently sold 51% of our bottling 
business in the Philippines to Coca
-
Cola FEMSA. While every bottling 
transaction is unique, this transaction is yet another example of our long
-
standing and fundamental belief in the strength of our global 
franchise 
system. We look forward to this new partnership with Coca
-
Cola FEMSA as 
we jointly invest and further strengthen our business in the Philippines to 
create sustainable, long
-
term growth and value.
 
Our Eurasia and Africa business also extended its 
strong momentum, 
growing a very solid 10% in the quarter and up 11% for the full year 
including full year double
-
digit growth for brand Coca
-
Cola. During both the 
quarter and the full year, our business in Eurasia and Africa grew both 
volume and value shar
e in total nonalcoholic ready
-
to
-
drink beverages.
 
On a country level, Russia was one of the key drivers of this group's 
performance up 8% in 2012 led once again by outstanding growth of brand 
Coca
-
Cola, which grew 20% for the full year. The momentum behind
 
our 
Dobriy juice brand accelerated further with 13% growth for the full year. 
Viewed in total, we have outpaced the nonalcoholic ready
-
to drink
-
industry 
in Russia grew for three consecutive quarters. As a result, our business in 
Russia now has achieved an
 
all
-
time high market share.
 
Our business in India, which grew 16% on a full
-
year basis, continued its 
long stretch of strong growth realizing both volume and value share gains 
across both sparkling and still beverage. Importantly, India has now 
delivered 
six consecutive years of double
-
digit volume growth starting back 
in 2007.
 
Moving now to Europe. Our business was down 5% in the quarter and was 
down 1% for the full year reflecting the region's ongoing macroeconomic 
uncertainty. While we recognize the rea
l challenges of today's European 
environment, it is important place our results in the proper context and to 
recognize the resiliency of our industry and our business in Europe. Since 
the start of 2009, when austerity measures, unemployment and fiscal 
conc
erns began to weigh heavily European consumer confidence, Europe has 
seen a GDP decline.
 
In contrast during the same four year period, our business in Europe has 
outpaced the broader industry making our company one of a select few able 
to deliver positive 
growth between 2009 and 2012. We successfully grew our 
business in Germany up 1% in 2012, despite cycling 6% growth in 2011, 
while gaining full year share in nonalcoholic beverages. This makes it three 
consecutive years that Germany has deliver full year v
olume growth. As 
such we remain confident that our business in Germany is in a sound 
position and capable of delivering long
-
term sustainable growth.
 
Looking ahead, we expect Europe's economic uncertainty to extend well into 
2013. At the same time, we expe
ct that the European economy and 
consumer sentiment will gradually improve that our business is well
-
positioned to return to volume growth as that occurs. We are also confident 
that our leadership team and our system will keep investing to outperform 
the i
ndustry in 2013 as Europe continues along the road to recovery.
 
Before concluding my prepared remarks, I would like to highlight our 
company's sustained efforts and result to work to find meaningful solutions 
to the conflict issue of obesity. There is an i
mportant conversation going on 
about obesity and we want to be part of the solution. Together with partners 
in government, civil society, our own industry and other business, I am 
personally committed to leveraging all our resources to lead and make a 
diff
erence here. We are committed to use evidence
-
based science to guide 
the choices we offer. We are committed to investing in innovation of our 
sweeteners, products, packaging and equipment that fosters active, healthy 
living. We are committed to bringing re
al choice to consumers everywhere 
and educating them on how the choices we offer can play a role in a sensible 
balanced diet and active, healthy lifestyles. We are committed to 
transparency about the nutritional content of our products and we are 
committed
 
to responsible marketing of our products.
 
In closing, we are pleased that our business has done so well in recent years 
and that we remain well on track to achieve our 2020 Vision. Together, we 
as a system have delivered on our priorities and we are achie
ving real 
success. With passionate commitment and our collective focus, we are 
propelling ourselves forward during these challenging economic and social 
times.
 
As we look back to January 2010, we began our 2020 Vision, we had 
reasons to be proud of our col
lective achievement and yet remain 
constructively discontent. We completed new largest transaction in our 
history leading to the formation of Coca
-
Cola Refreshments in North 
America. We added five new $1 billion brand our portfolio. We maintained 
Coca
-
Cola
 
as the world's most valuable brand and distinction is earned from 
very Interbrand every year since 2000, and we launched multiple programs 
to support the global communities we serve such as our 5x20 initiative to 
empower 5 million women by 2020 and provid
e entrepreneurial training to 
help growth the local businesses.
 
All that said, we are keenly aware of how today's turbulent economic 
landscape is likely to extend through this year. As such, our 2013 strategic 
priorities remain absolutely clear. First will
 
continue to grow sustainably and 
provide meaningful solutions that enhance the health and well
-
being of the 
community we proudly serve.
 
Second, we will win with Coca
-
Cola while actively promoting the brand and 
the category. Third, we must absolutely keep 
winning and executing with 
excellence with point
-
of
-
sale. Fourth, we need to keep maximizing the value 
of our global beverage portfolio. And sixth, we will encourage and inspire our 
system and associates to deliver our mission and our vision.
 
So, there is 
still a great runway ahead of us both, for our sparkling 
beverages as well as across the entire range of our broader portfolio. After 
all, global consumer expenditures are expected to grow strongly between 
2013 and 2012, driven by further economic growth i
n developing emerging 
countries as well as expected middle class expansion in populous economies.
 
So, while we are proud of our strong record of delivering results through the 
first three years of our 2020 Vision, we know that we are really just getting 
st
arted. All of us at the Coca
-
Cola Company and the Coca
-
Cola System 
remain diligent about what we need to do in order to achieve our results and 
to effectively and efficiently manage our business for sustainable long
-
term 
success for all our stakeholders.
 
W
ith that let me now turn the call over to Gary.
 
Gary Fayard
 
Thanks, Muhtar, and good morning, everyone. We are pleased to have once 
again delivered quality performance results in 2012, making this seventh 
straight year that our volume and operating income 
results have been in line 
with or ahead of our long
-
term growth targets. Achieving such consistent 
performance during a time of ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty is a real 
testament to our global systems' ability to execute our strategic priorities 
and ali
gnment with our 2020 Vision.
 
Therefore, we remain confident that we will continue to deliver full year 
volume, revenue and operating income results in line with our long
-
term 
growth targets.
 
So let's review our results in more detail starting with our comp
arable 
earnings per share which came in at $0.45 this quarter, up 15% versus the 
prior year. Our full year comparable earnings per share came in at $2.01, up 
5% despite facing what we estimate was about a 4% currency headwind for 
the full year.
 
Our compara
ble currency neutral net revenues grew 5% in the quarter. The 
currency impact on this quarter's comparable net revenue results was a 1% 
headwind. Our full year comparable currency neutral net revenue growth 
was up 6% in line with our long
-
term growth targe
t. On a comparable basis, 
the impact of currency on our full
-
year net revenue results was a 3% 
headwind.
 
Our comparable currency neutral operating income was up double digits this 
quarter consistent with the outlook that we shared in our earnings call 
last 
quarter. As Muhtar shared a few moments ago, on a full
-
year basis our 
comparable currency neutral operating income came in at 6% as expected 
and in line with our long
-
term growth target.
 
During our last few earnings call we shared a more specific full
 
year 2012 
outlook across several financial items to help those of you who model our 
business. I am pleased to say the results were right in line with or slightly 
ahead of the outlook that we provided. So I want to take a moment to recap 
these results and 
where applicable provide more and further insight into our 
full year 2013 outlook.
 
With regard to volume growth, our full year 2012 concentrate sales growth 
was in line with our full year unit case volume growth as per our comments 
last quarter. Our consol
idated price mix was up 1% for the full year 2012 
consistent with our prior year full year outlook. For 2013, we expect to keep 
earning low single
-
digit consolidated price mix as called for on our long
-
term 
growth model as we continue executing our occasio
n
-
based brand, price, 
package and channel strategies with precision around the world.
 
Our comparable currency neutral SG&A expenses were up 5% on a full
-
year 
basis. This increase in SG&A reflects our ongoing commitment to keep 
investing for a better tomorr
ow as we grew our direct marketing expenses in 
2012, while simultaneously capturing incremental marketing efficiencies. We 
also added additional feet on the street, primarily in North America, to 
ensure support of our growing business in this important mar
ket. Our SG&A 
results for the quarter and full year also included a benefit from the reversal 
of certain expenses related to our long
-
term incentive plans as well as a one 
point unfavorable impact of structural items primarily in our Bottling 
Investments G
roup and in North America.
 
Our full year comparable gross margin was roughly in line with the estimate 
we provided during our previous earnings calls. Our operating expense 
leverage was a positive nine points this quarter as we benefited from having 
two ad
ditional selling days. The full year operating expense leverage came in 
at a positive one point. For 2013, we expect our positive operating expense 
leverage to be even to slightly positive as we sustain our strategic 
investments in brand building activitie
s around the world and efficiently 
manage our operating expenses.
 
As you as you model our 2013 operating results and our corresponding 
operating expense leverage, let me also remind everyone that our 2013 
calendar will have one less day when compared to 20
12, specifically our first 
quarter 2013 will have two less days when compared to the first quarter of 
2012, then the fourth quarter of 2013 will have one more day when 
compared to the fourth quarter of 2012.
 
Moving now to net interest which came in at a po
sitive $31 million in the 
fourth quarter. This was ahead of our initial expectations and raised our full
-
year net interest income to $74 million. For 2013 our best estimate is that 
net interest will come in as an expense ranging between $30 million and $50
 
million for the full year of 2013. We will update this outlook each quarter as 
we move through the year.
 
For 2012, underlying effective tax rate held steady at 24% and we expect 
the tax rate for 2013 to be approximately the same. Our cash flow from 
operat
ions increased 12% on the full year 2012 partially benefiting from 
favorable timing relating to certain working capital items. Looking ahead to 
2013, we expect our cash flow growth rate to be more in line with our 
earnings growth rate.
 
Now let me take a mo
ment to update on impact of several additional items 
that may help you model our business in 2013 starting with commodities. 
Incremental cost related to our big four commodities, which are sweeteners, 
metals, juices and PET came in at around $225 million f
or the full year 2012 
in line with what we had provided previously.
 
Looking ahead to 2013, and after considering our hedge positions, we 
anticipate a more moderate year of commodity inflation with incremental 
related to our big four commodities coming in a
t closer to $100 million. As 
for currencies, we saw headwinds of 4% on our fourth quarter comparable 
operating income and 5% for the full year 2012, our comparable operating 
income, consistent with our previously provided an outlook.
 
In preparing for 2013,
 
we are fully hedged on the euro, yen and sterling, 
and also have the near
-
term coverage in place across several other 
currencies. After considering these hedged positions, current spot rates and 
last week devaluation announcement in Venezuela, we now expe
ct 
currencies to be a 4% headwind on operating income for the first quarter of 
2013, and at even minus 1% headwind for the full year, but it would even 
quarter before Venezuela maybe slightly negative with Venezuela.
 
We'll also report a $100 million to $22
5 million devaluation loss in the first 
quarter related to the monetary asset held in Venezuela. Our normal 
practice, we'll update our currency forecast on a quarterly basis as we go 
through 2013.
 
Our full year share repurchases net of employee option exer
cises totaled 
$3.1 billion in 2012, just slightly above the $2.5 billion to $3 billion range we 
communicated at the outset of the year. In 2013, we expect our net share 
repurchases to range between $3 billion and $3.5 billion.
 
Now let me take a moment to h
ighlight a few other items that will also 
inform you about our business in 2013. First, as previously announced 
starting this year, we will have organized our company around three major 
operating businesses. Coca
-
Cola International, consisting of Europe, t
he 
Pacific and Eurasia and Africa operations. Coca
-
Cola Americas, consisting of 
our North America and Latin American operations, and our bottling 
investments group, which will continue to oversee our company
-
owned 
bottling operations outside of North Ameri
ca.
 
As this organizational change does not impact our reporting segments, we'll 
continue to disclose of performance results for all five geographic operating 
groups as well as for our Bottling Investment Group. That said, starting with 
the first quarter 20
13, we will reflect our India and Southwest Asian 
business results within our specific operating group instead of within our 
Eurasia and Africa operating groups.
 
Prior to our to our next earnings call, we will provide information 
reclassifying the last thr
ee years of our results for these two geographic 
operating groups to facilitate through historical comparison of our results to 
our future results.
 
Second, as previously mentioned by Muhtar, there have been several 
transactions announced these past few mon
ths, including bottler mergers in 
Japan and Brazil and the sale of 51% of our bottling business in the 
Philippines. To be clear, we do not expect these transactions to have a 
material impact on our 2013 earnings results. However, these actions will 
generat
e a structural headwind on our year
-
over
-
year net revenue and 
operating income growth rates. As such, we anticipate these transactions to 
have a 3% structural impact on our full year 2013 net revenue. Likewise our 
full year operating income results should 
be a 1% structural impact with this 
decline offset by a corresponding improvement in equity income. As I 
mentioned, we do not see these transactions having a material impact on 
2013 earnings per share.
 
As a final update and as part of our previously announ
ced global productivity 
and reinvestment program, we are reorganizing our Coca
-
Cola Refreshments 
business in the United States to align itself and operating functions around 
three geographies. Ws. We take this action as part of our consistent effort to 
imp
rove our processes and systems and to ensure greater operating 
effectiveness and productivity across our North American operations. This 
new alignment is in keeping with the ongoing evolution of our North 
American business model as we invest even further t
o enhance our 
capabilities and deliver against our 2020 Vision.
 
In closing and as Muhtar said earlier, we are delivering on our strategic 
priorities and achieving real success. As we move into 2013, our global 
bottling system is healthier than ever, and ou
r financial priorities remain 
clear. We will invest in our core business with plans to spend around $3 
billion in capital expenditures in 2013. We will strategically invest with our 
global bottling system to increase our share position across key growth 
ca
tegories. We will pay a healthy dividend and as previously announced we 
will repurchase shares between $3 billion and $3.5 billion in 2013.
 
Our system is committed to investing together for a better tomorrow and 
our proven ability to achieve consistent qua
lity results provides us with the 
confidence that we will continue to successfully execute our growth 
strategies with precision in line with our 2020 vision.
 
Before concluding our prepared remarks, I want to remind you that Ahmet, 
Steve and I look forward 
to seeing you when we present at the upcoming 
CAGNY conference in Boca Raton on Friday, February 22 and Irial and I also 
look forward to being with you when we present together at the CAGE 
conference in London on Tuesday, March 19.
 
Operator, we are now rea
dy for questions.
 
Question

and

Answer Session
 
Operator
 
(Operator Instructions) Our first question is from Bill Schmitz of Deutsche 
Bank.
 
Bill Schmitz

Deutsche Bank
 
Good morning. Muhtar, I know you have been doing a lot of globe hopping 
recently. So maybe
 
you can just talk about the global macro, maybe some 
granularity about regional growth rates. I know you were at Sochi and 
Davos, just can you give us some color on how you sense things are going 
to trend over the next year. I know you have kind of covere
d this but maybe 
some more granularity?
 
Muhtar Kent
 
Yes, Bill, I think I have recently been to Korea, to Australia, in the last 10 
days to also Southern Russia and Sochi but I think essentially in Europe 
there is a sentiment there that people are beginning to feel that it is not 
going to get any worse, that
 
there will be some expansion happening as we 
move forward and sort of just purely fiscal restraint and monetary restraint. 
So that feeling is beginning to emerge but I think it is going to be long 
recovery.
 
Certainly in China we are seeing the transition 
happened from a purely 
export led economy to one that is more balanced with consumer spending 
and a combination consumer spending as well as export led, a balanced 
economy I think there was challenges in that transition initially where there 
was a divergen
ce between GDP growth and pure disposable incomes for a 
while but I think, long
-

this transition in China.
 
I think in general Japan is going to also, the consumer sentiment will 
continue to be mobile an
d volatile there and it is subdued. For the rest of the 
world, whether it's Africa, the youngest billion, Latin America, Eurasia, our 
Middle East, we see and of course, Asia, Southeast Asia and other parts of 
Asia, Indian subcontinent, we see growth, we se
e very disciplined, monetary 
policy, balanced budgets, good banking system and the consumer is more 
positive, and so it's modeled, and it's mixed here into United States, we see 
some signs of improvement.
 
We need to wait and evaluate the impact of the payr
oll taxes as well as the 
higher gasoline prices. It's too early to say that it's a recovery that is at best 
look on, but we feel that it could get better. That's how we see the world, 
and based on that we continue to invest for opportunity, we continue to 
invest based on our long
-
term models and plans with our bottling partners 
to continue to generate both, volume, top line and income growth.
 
Bill Schmitz 
-
 
Deutsche Bank
 
Great. Thanks very much. Then a follow
-
up with the change in the structure 
of CCR North
 
America, I mean, does this change your philosophy on sort of 
how long you are going to own the asset and maybe how it's going to be 
operated going forward.
 
Muhtar Kent
 
Sorry. Are you talking about just the restructuring?
 
Bill Schmitz 
-
 
Deutsche Bank
 
Exact
ly, three different regions, I guess there were seven businesses and 
now there is three. Does that change your view on how long that asset stays 
with GCC?
 
Muhtar Kent
 
Yes. It's got nothing to do with that that at all. Think if it as last year we 
announced 
a new productivity reinvestment program that includes continued 
synergies from our North America CCR, Coca
-
Cola Refreshment operations 
to be able to enable us to continue to invest in our brands to grow in North 
America, 11 consecutive quarters of growth.
 
When we first talked about growth in North America back in '09, people 
thought that we were trying to go to the moon without lighter, and now its 
reality 11 quarters of consecutive growth and we intend to continue that. We 
see this as a growth market and t
herefore enabled us to continue to invest 
in our brands. This is just ordinary course of business. Think about it exactly 
like that
 
It's not a big deal, ordinary course of business and therefore it's got nothing 
to do with the United States' bottling struc
ture. It's just part of our ongoing 
business and I'll have Steve Cahillane is here with me on this call, as well as, 
Ahmet Bozer in area of finance, so I can ask Steve to also comment.
 
Steve Cahillane
 
Yes. You said it very well. This is very much an effect
iveness play. Two years 
ago, when we put these businesses together, we had a simple mantra. First 
was, we're going to make it work. Then we were going to make it better 
than then we were going to make it best. We've learned a lot over the 
course of last tw
o
-
and
-
a
-
half years. One of our most successful 
organizations is our food service organization, which is aligned around three 
geographic units. we're moving our national retail sales and our field sales 
organization also around the same two units which will
 
really build our total 
efficiency and effectiveness, our ability to work together, our ability to 
continue to invest in this market, invest against our brands, put more feet 
on the street, so we are very excited about new organization in Bangalore, 
to get
 
us from making it better to making it.
 
Operator
 
Your next question comes from Bill Pecoriello of Consumer Edge Research.
 
Bill Pecoriello 
-
 
Consumer Edge Research
 
Good morning, everybody. I just wanted to re
-
clarify one thing first Gary. 
Hitting the long
-
t
erm FX neutral operating profit target you expect to do that 
in 2013 as well as in the long run. And then in with closing euro operating 
expense leverage guided for '13 despite the savings, you're signaling step up 
spending, so just want to get an idea of 
where you are focusing that 
incremental spending on. Thanks.
 
Gary Fayard
 
Thanks, Bill. Yes. And, I was trying to be pretty clear, but let me be very 
clear. We expect to hit our long
-
term growth target targets both, in 2013 
and long
-
term. That applies to 20
13 as well, so we are comfortable with that 
and we would expect to be able to deliver that. The second thing is, we have 
always had demand to invest through a crisis. We've been in a global crisis 
for a number of years now, but we've got history and we've 
seen what 
happens when you invest through the crisis when you come at the other 
end, as Muhtar says, we see things slowly improving across the globe, but 
we expect to come out that the other end much stronger than we were even 
going in. And so, we are goin
g to continue to drive efficiencies, productivity 
and then reinvestment that back to grow the business and growing the 
brand. The brands are stronger than they have ever been but we think we 
can drive it even further. So we are going to continue to invest 
behind the 
brands.
 
Muhtar Kent
 
Just one point to add on that, Bill. I always say, as you go up the air gets 
thinner. Always remember, we are adding on top of significant increases 
from prior years all the time. Just on sparkling beverages alone, we have 
ad
ded over 0.5 billion cases each year. So we are cycling that every year 
and we are continuing to grow. I think that is really important and in three 
years, the worse that gets probably macroeconomic environment we have 
seen for a long time, we were able to
 
generate volume growth in line with 
our growth expectations, revenue growth in line with our growth 
expectations and income growth and generating record revenues of $48 
billion record income as well as record cash flow. So I think it needs to be 
taken int
o that context. Continue to crack the calculus for growth.
 
Operator
 
Your next question comes from Judy Hong of Goldman Sachs.
 
Judy Hong 
-
 
Goldman Sachs
 
So, Muhtar, I know you spoke a lot about the macro environment but maybe 
you can speak a little bit abou
t the competitive environment particularly 
around U.S. sparkling, China and parts of Western Europe where you have 
seen some step up in competitive pressure and how that's affected your 
volume performance and how you see that trending in 2013?
 
Muhtar 
Kent
 
I think in the United States where, as you have heard, we continued to gain 
both volume and value share. All over the world, our share is at an all
-
time 
high. Everywhere across the world in NARTD as well as in the different 
categories that were operat
ing in and competing in and we choose to 
compete in. Similarly in China in sparkling we have widened our gap to our 
nearest international competitor in sparkling. In Europe, I there has been a 
month or two where we have had some challenges but overall for 
the whole 
year, we have again gained share across the whole of broader Europe, in 
Western Europe as well as Eastern Europe and in Southeast Europe across 
the whole continent, in both volume and value share.
 
To be frank, we see competition is healthy and it
 
keeps us on our toes, it 
keeps us executing better and being better, becoming more efficient and 
more productive and all we strive every single day as the business system 
together with our assembly by bottlers around the world as we strive to get 
better a
t making decisions, quicker so that we can be more nimble and more 
innovative. As you know we have launched more than 800 types of different 
products over the last four or five years.
 
Many of them are new innovative products that are gaining great traction
 
as 
they are in the United States. Look at the performance of our still business. 
Look at the relative performance of our sparkling business. I mentioned that 
between 2009 and 2012, spend per person on our brands went up from $56 
to $60. So transactions ar
e up the United States.
 
Our brand, price, package and channel allocation architecture is working in 
the United States. So both in China transactions are ahead of our volume as 
well as in the United States immediate consumption business. So judge us 
not onl
y by pure volume, judge us by the quality of our volume and 
transaction growth. We sell and the end
-
consumers buy packages and 
products, a combination of packages and products, each one at a time. They 

 
understand and how we 
think about it.
 
Judy Hong 
-
 
Goldman Sachs
 
Okay, and then Gary just following up on currency guidance for the full year. 
So it seems like the first quarter guidance is actually a little bit worse than I 
thought. So can you just help u
s understand, is that based on our hedge 
position and with the Yen moving pretty sharply how much are you hedge 
spending in?
 
Gary Fayard
 
Judy, we are actually fully hedged on the Yen, Euro and Sterling. So coming 
back to the last Yen position that we have 
are actually on the money, they 

quarter, it was actually, I said 4%, it was pre
-
Venezuela, 4.5%. So the 
Venezuela devaluation obviously is a big one when devalued 50%. So that's 
number
 
one. But number two, the real impact is not what you would expect. 
It's not the yen, the impact are the rates that were cycling in the emerging 
markets particularly, Latin America. If you look at Brazil, look at Mexico, 
goes look at the rate at early last
 
year and then they started devaluing 
South Africa as well.
 
So, if you look at those you will see improving trend, so towards the latter 
part of 2013, based on where spot is today, we actually turned positive all 
with kind of even to minus 1 for the full y
ear, but it's frontend loaded 
negative and then it is improving throughout the year.
 
Judy Hong 
-
 
Goldman Sachs
 
And then on Venezuela, Gary, just the impact you are purely looking at 
translational impact or some sort of margin impact as you have the pricing
 
control in place?
 
Gary Fayard
 
We've got a wealth of monitor assets. That was 100 to 125, and so if you 
look in the Wall Street Journal article this morning, we just were on a list of 
other companies that have the same issue, so that's kind of a one
-
time 
i
tems, but I am just telling you has occurred, will occur. Then the translation 
impact of the revenues will be about 1% drag in the first quarter.
 
Operator
 
Your next question comes from John Faucher with JPMC.
 
John Faucher 
-
 
JPMC
 
Thank you. Just two questio
ns here. Gary, just sort of more of a 
housekeeping type of thing, as you look at the commentary on the net 
interest line, it seems as though that can create a situation and there is 
probably not much leverage if any below the operating lines. If you could 
just sort of confirm that.
 
And then secondly, as we look at the organic top line growth in terms of just 
simply the bottler case sales, volume less price mix decelerated. It looks like 
to me at least every quarter this year, so can you talk about how you s
ee 
that trending up as we go through the course of 2012. You got difficult 
comparisons in the first half of the year, and sort of how that's going to play 
into your comfort level of hitting that 6% to 8% currency neutral operating 
profit target. Thanks.
 
Ga
ry Fayard
 
Sure, John. Yes. Let me see if I can get the first half of your question. First, 
the low operating income growth, you are right, because we will see net 
interest flow from interest income to interest expense. There are a couple of 
things going on
 
in there. Primarily its rates and just rates are down, 
particularly in some of the emerging markets where we've got some cash, 
which was generating a lot of interest income. You saw that happening 
during the latter part of this year and all the reason tha
t interest income was 
actually a lot better than in the fourth quarter than I told you to expected to 
be was actually we put on some interest rate swap hedges a couple of years 
ago. There is a small ineffectiveness piece to that hedge and ineffective 
piece
 
has to go through the P&L. That was actually pretty large this quarter, 
positive and it gave us lot of interest income, so that's part of what you are 
seeing.
 
In equity income, you are going to get some leverage just going to be up 
because of structural i
tems that talked about from some of the transactions 
that have occurred. Then if we go to the second half of your question was 
tell me again?
 
John Faucher 
-
 
JPMC
 
Just looking at the deceleration in the organic top line growth and again how 
that maps out ov
er the course of the year and the comfort on, let's say, the 
6% there?
 
Gary Fayard
 
Well, I think there are a couple of different things. There, I think, we are 
going to see improving and slowly improving trends in many of the markets 
around the world. Euro
pe, I think, will improve. My expectation is that 
Europe will improve in 2013 from well, we had pretty good improvement 
from the fourth quarter of 2012. So I would say, you are going to actually 
see sequential improvement in Europe, you are going to see se
quential 
improvement in China for sure.
 
I think that U.S. is poised now also in a pretty good place. Number one, I 
think, volumes in 2012 dipped a little bit in the fourth quarter. Our view is 
that is not the start of a trend. We think that just it happene
d but it is not 
the start of a trend and we would expect volume actually to be okay in 2013 
and we think it will sequentially start coming back and be better and be okay 
in 2013.
 
Irial Finan
 
John, just to add on that. I think very little is always said 
about the 120 or 
so countries which have a per capita around 125 in our business where 
volume growth for just 2012 will again 7%. These countries represented 
about a little more than one third of our total global volumes. Countries that 
we never talk about
. Whether it is Sub
-
Sahara or whether it is in Asia or 
Middle East or Central Asia and so forth. But we grew in these countries 9% 
in 2010, 7% in 2011, 7% in 2012. We keep on growing. This is the beauty of 
our portfolio, in fact. So while you may have a qu


on our long
-
term growth model, both volume and also for revenues. Imagine 
what would have happened to our volume if Europe did grow this past 
quarter and 
China. So this is that the benefit of having this portfolio which is 
getting stronger and bigger as we continue to invest with our bottling 
partners in alignment.
 
John Faucher 
-
 
JPMC
 
Okay, and then finally one housekeeping question. Gary you mentioned the 


deconsolidation, right? So that 6% to 8%, minus one for the bottler minus 
one for the FX, is kind of how we s
hould look at it?
 
Gary Fayard
 
Yes, John. That is exactly right. So when I said, hit the target, we hit the 
target before structural but then you would have to adjust for structural. 
That's with pretax or net income being sign. This is just what is the 
geog
raphies within the P&L.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Your next question comes from Ali Dibadj with Bernstein.
 
Ali Dibadj 
-
 
Sanford Bernstein
 
Can you give us a little bit more of a sense of against the go forward 
evolution of the brands globally and in the U.S.? If 
you look at Germany, 
that strength this quarter and you wanted to do some system changes there, 

struggling a little bit and there were competitive system changes there, also 
the U.S. sparkl
ing bottling just got tough and you have got it back to a year 
ago. Gary has pointed volume trends are a trend or not, it just seems that 
given all that, you might actually for next few years with very large changes 
through the Coca
-
Cola system and the ind
ustry overall, so if you were to 
close your eyes and see with us, how would you see the structure of the 
system of the future looking versus what it is today?
 
Gary Fayard
 
Ali, I have always said that the fact that we are a total believer in the 
franchise s
ystem. It is a beautiful system when you get to work as we have 
aligned in four divisions, aligned with its goals and aligned in its ownership 

drive this bottling system with an align
ed vision which we have. As I said, 
we have got three years that we have accomplished that and seven years to 
go and we are confident that we can continue to accomplish.
 
As we move through the system, you have already heard us talk about what 
we see in the
 
business for the U.S. system where we have a role, again, for 
our bottling partners. We still have the same time table for that. I won't 
repeat that the time table was. We said about four to five years since the 
time that we close the transaction and you 
can figure we still believe that 
this doable.
 
As we move along different parts of the world, you see us creating stronger 
systems like Brazil, stronger systems like Kanto. That is a huge milestone in 
the 55 year history of our Japanese business getting the
 
four Kanto bottlers 
to unite and to take cost out of it and continue to invest to drive top line 
growth for our system.
 
You will see us doing well as we move forward. Again refranchising 
Philippines is another example, so don't think of this as seismic ch
anges in 
our bottling system. We will continue to fine
-
tune and evolve as needed as 
necessary to drive the goals that we have outlined.
 
Ali Dibadj 
-
 
Sanford Bernstein
 
It's helpful, I guess I am still struggling with what can we look forward to 
changes in t
erms of not being as reactionary, but maybe thinking going 
forward and maybe if you can help me? You mentioned the U.S. you 
mentioned a little while ago, so it's been about two years since you closed 
the CCE North America transaction.
 
Can you give us a sen
se of where you think you are ahead of plan and 
where you are behind plan? Certainly for many investors this quarter was 
probably (inaudible) because operating margin starts inflect positively, but is 
it sustainable without any more meaningful restructurin
g and bigger things? 
How do you think about the volume trends we have been seeing so far in 
sparkling when that changes anything how you think not reactionarily, but 
going forward about the structures here. A different example of.
 
Gary Fayard
 
Well, first, 
let me just say everywhere we are doing, none of it is reactionary 
to these four, whether it's Brazil, whether it's Philippines, whether it's Japan 
and we've got more to talk about too, we are not in a position to talk about 
right now. All of that is actua
lly prices and U.S. is all about prices. And I can 
tell you very clearly, once again that as I mentioned in Judy's question 
judges not only by the meters, judges also by the transaction, judges by 
how we are doing in terms of value of the business that we 
are creating and 
the consumer spend that's coming into our business into our brand and the 
health of our brands. This is ultimately a brand business. Our brands are 
healthier than they have ever been both, in sparkling as well as in still 
beverages.
 
So, I 
repeat, we see opportunities in the United States for us to keep 
growing and also for us to keep generating value in both sparkling and in 
still beverages, and that's how we see it and whatever it takes for us to be 
able to investment, proactive long
-
term 
investment is the key, whatever it 
takes for us to be able to continue our targeted thoughtful, purposeful 
investments you will see us continuing to do that, so that we our brands 
remain healthy, our system remains nimble and flexible as far as rest the 
ma
rket as far as production NSR distribution.

Your next question comes from Bryan Spillane of Bank of America.
 
Bryan Spillane 
-
 
Bank of America
 
Hi, good morning. A kind of question on just the productivity program, just 
really looking for an update.
 
First, I think if you test the two elements of it, 
both what was initially announced last year plus the extension of the CCR 
integration, your expectation was $550 million to $650 million annualized 
savings by the end of 2015, so is that still the same or
 
has there been any 
change to what you are expecting in terms of total savings?
 
Gary Fayard
 
Bryan, this is Gary. No changes at all. You are exactly right. What we 
announced the beginning of last year productivity and reinvestment was 
$550 million to $650 m
illion. The total company, including North America we 
are still on track in fact well on track on that program. It was a 2012 
through 2015 program and we are continuing to execute against that.
 
So, we are on track. We are taking the savings and from the su
pply chain 
optimization, the marketing effectiveness, operational excellence, data and 
that the system standardization was area of that of that whole program in 
addition to what we were doing in CCR, and we have taken that and we are 
reinvesting behind inn
ovation as well as marketing of or brands. And that's 
still working well.
 
What we talked about in North America just today is just a normal part in 
evolution of that program and we'll continue to do that around the world to 
drive effectiveness, because it 
really helps in several different ways
 
It's not only about saving money. It's about operating more effectively, so 
we can operate faster. Being more productive means we can make decisions 
quicker and those are things we are driving for. We want to be 
fast, flexible 
and very big.
 
Bryan Spillane 
-
 
Bank of America
 
How much did it continue to drive? How much savings did you drive in 2012?
 
Gary Fayard
 
Outside of North America, we probably had about $40 million to $50 million 
in savings in 2012. Then North A
merica continues to drive synergies and 
doing fairly well against their part of their targets as well.
 
Bryan Spillane 
-
 
Bank of America
 
It is fair to say you think certainly it will be a bigger, (inaudible) you pulled 
the savings to spend back than you had
 
in '12?
 
Gary Fayard
 
Yes, it will be.
 
Bryan Spillane 
-
 
Bank of America
 
Okay, and then just one last one. Just how much, in terms of charges are 
you expecting to take over the life of the plan relative to the savings?
 
Gary Fayard
 
Let me, Brain, answer it this way. As we continue to update you on where 
we are how big the plan is. So we will call it back to the 650 today but as 
you know, a few years ago, we had another program as well that we 
concluded and started this one. So we con
tinue to look for efficiencies and 
effectiveness. But everything we look at when we evaluated, we would 
expect that the one time cost ought to be in a ratio of no more of 1 to 1.5:1 

continuous benefit to the P&L going forward.
 
Muhtar Kent
 
Thank you, Gary, Ahmet, Steve, Irial and Jackson. In closing, we had a 
strong 2012 and we once again delivered quality full
-
year performance 
results. Our business continues to grow, even in the midst
 
of ongoing global 
economic challenges. Our system is aligned and it is on track to achieve our 
2020 Vision. Together, we are consistently investing in our brands on a 
global scale through world
-
class marketing and commercial strategies.
 
As we get closer t
o the midpoint of our 2020 Vision, our system remains 
resolutely focused on refreshing our achievements, creating value for our 
customers, maintaining strong partnerships with our bottling partners,

Muhtar Kent
 
Thank you, Jackson, and good morning everyone. First, let me begin by 
saying that we are very pleased with our third quarter performance. We 
successfully completed our acquisition of Coca
-
Cola Enterprises, North 
America business, and the sal
e of our Norway Sweden bottling operations to 
CCE, on plan and in line with our commitments and we close this transaction 
on the heels of executing a strong quarter.
 
We continue to build on our momentum, delivering solid volume revenue 
and profit growth th
is quarter with our results exceeding all of our long
-
term 
targets and generating sustainable value for our shareowners.
 
This quarter, once again underscores how we are advancing our 2020 vision 
from a position of strength as we enter a new era of growth f
or the Coca
-
Cola Company. Together in close alignment with our global bottling partners, 
we are executing with excellence around the world. Our strategies, our 
brands, our marketing, our innovation, our partnerships and our people are 
defining new growth o
pportunities today, and shaping our system vision for 
this decade.
 
Our brand equity is growing stronger around the world as evidenced by a 
measurable increase in consumer preference for our brands this quarter as 
well as more potent global growth for our f
lagship brand Coca
-
Cola on a 
year
-
to
-
date basis.
 
We are now intensely focused on driving a fast and seamless integration in 
our North America operations, and this evolution of our franchise system is 
an important milestone in realizing our 2020 vision, str
engthening our 
commitments to best serve our customers and our consumers and 
facilitating our ability to achieve sustainable and profitable growth in our 
flagship market.
 

operating 
income growth was 14% ahead of our long
-
term growth target. 
We grew our quarterly volume a solid 5% also ahead of our long
-
term 
growth target fueled by organic unit case volume growth across both North 
America and our international operations.
 
We increase 
net revenues a healthy 8% on a comparable currency neutral 
basis in the quarter bringing our year
-
to
-
date comparable currency neutral 
revenues to 5%. This is in line with our long
-
term growth target. And once 
again we generated significant cash from our op
erations with cash flow up 
15% year
-
to
-
date.
 
Now, I will share our performance results in more detail across our market 
starting with our flagship market. North America volume grew 2% this 
quarter, the second consecutive quarter of positive organic growth.
 
On a 
year
-
to
-
date basis, our North America business is now up 1%. These results 
are due to the continued successful execution of our well
-
defined brand pack 
and price strategy focus on driving profitable growth.
 
Our sparkling beverages in North America gr
ew volume and value share, 
both against the total category as well as versus our primary competitor. 
And to be clear, when we speak about share swing gains versus our primary 
competitor in North America, we refer to our performance across all 
channels, not
 
just measured channels, which represents less than 40% of 
our North America business.
 
Brand Coca
-
Cola health measures keep improving as we increased our 
favorite brand score versus our primary competitor amongst the most critical 
consumer segments. At the
 
same time, Coca
-
Cola Zero delivered double
-
digit volume growth for the 18
th
 
consecutive quarter. Band Sprite had the 
second consecutive quarter of positive growth, and is now positive on a 
year
-
to
-
date basis and Fanta had its strongest quarter of the year
 
growing 
4%.
 
We further extended the footprint of our innovative Coca
-
Cola Freestyle 
Fountain Dispenser, which is on track to be in 15 markets by the end of this 
year providing a greater choice of brands to our customers and our 
consumers. This all reaffir
ms our confidence that we are executing the right 
strategies with our bottling partners to drive growth across our entire North 
America sparkling beverage portfolio.
 
Turning to North America still beverages, these also continue to accelerate 
up a strong 8%
 
for the quarter and 5% year
-
to
-
date. We have now grown 
volume share for 11 of the past 13 quarters and value share for 12 of the 
last 13 quarters.
 
Our North America juice and juice drink business delivered positive growth 
for the quarter, led once again b
y double
-
digit growth from our Simply 
trademark. Our North America energy portfolio also accelerated this quarter 
up 15% including double
-
digit growth by NOS.
 
In the North America tea category, our Gold Peak brand delivered double
-
digit growth in both its 
bottle can and food service delivery forms. I also 
would like to highlight how our North America still beverage portfolio works 
in concert to generate value. First our Glaceau brands were up mid
-
single 
digit this quarter in North America continuing a yearl
ong trend of sequential 
improvement. Secondly, Powerade was up over 30% in the quarter 
outperforming the North America sports drink category while gaining share 
against our primary competitor for the eighth consecutive quarter.
 
This performance is not a ne
w turn of events or simply due to price 
discounting, but rather the results of implementing a clear, consistent and 
competitively sustainable strategy focused on innovation, consumer 
engagement as well as brand building.
 
In fact, since acquiring Glaceau in
 
mid
-
2007, our joint Glaceau and 
Powerade businesses have gained more than seven points of volume share 
swing against our primary competitors combined sports drink and functional 
hydration offerings. This is the power of valuable brands and strong system 
e
xecution working together in the marketplace.
 

business, we have an important opportunity to take our execution across our 
entire North America portfolio to the next level. As we have c
onsistently 
said, we have the right long
-
term strategy in place in our flagship market, 
and we are confident that we are well positioned for the next era of winning.
 
Now, let me turn to Eurasia and Africa, an operating group consisting of nine 
business uni
ts with 89 countries spanning from Africa through the Middle 
East and India up to Russia. This group grew 12% volume in the third 
quarter with strong performance across both sparkling and still beverages. 
Year
-
to
-
date growth now stands at 11%. All nine bus
iness units in Eurasia 
and Africa grew this quarter with countries representing more than half of 

 
This broad
-
base growth was led by Russia up 30% this quarter and 13% 
year
-
to
-
date. We outgrew our 
primary international competitor in Russia this 
quarter. Importantly, this high quality growth was led by the strong 
performance of our core sparkling brand, which drove almost half of this 

-
Cola, the si
ngle 
largest nonalcoholic RTD brand in Russia was up 34% this past quarter, 
gaining both volume and value share.
 
We are also making steady progress in the Russia juice market, the 
integration of our Multon juice business, which began this past quarter, is 
advancing as planned. And this quarter we also acquired Nidan a leading 
juice brand in Russia. This transaction will enable us to further expand our 
juice offerings in this important market.
 
We also grew double digits this quarter in Turkey, Southern Euras
ia 
complementing high single
-
digit growth in the Middle East. India meanwhile 
achieved its 17
th
 
consecutive quarter of growth despite facing record rainfall 

comparable 2009 period. Important
ly, India captured share in both sparkling 
and still beverages. And on a year
-
to
-
date basis we have grown Trademark 
Coca
-
Cola 18% in India while our Maaza juice brand is up 24% 
demonstrating the broad
-
base strength of our portfolio in this critical 
market.
 
Our commitment to India is unwavering. Last month, we announced plans to 
invest up to $120 million in a new plant in southern India and we are excited 
about the significant and sustainable opportunities this region has to offer 
over the long term.
 
Another
 
continent we are excited about and keep investing in heavily is 
Africa. Over the past 10 years, our system has invested more than $5 billion 
in the African continent and we plan to invest another $12 billion as a 
system in the next decade. As for this qua

saw double
-
digit growth in east and central Africa and mid
-
single
-
digit 
growth in north and West Africa.
 
South Africa delivered 6% unit case volume growth benefiting both from the 
momentum generated by our FIFA World Cup ac
tivation programs as well as 
our ongoing work to improve our relative market and small store activation 
capabilities in this key markets.
 
Moving to our Pacific group, overall volume growth was up 11% in the third 
quarter bringing our year
-
to
-
date volume gr
owth to 8%. These results were 
supported by a return to double
-
digit growth in China up 12% in the third 
quarter. China captured volume and value share gains in both sparkling and 
still beverages.
 
Our sparkling beverages grew high single digits in China le
d by the strong 
performance of both brand Coca
-
Cola and Sprite with Sprite remaining the 
number one sparkling brand in China for the 14
th
 
consecutive quarter. Our 
still beverages in China were up as strong double digits led by the continued 
momentum of our
 
Minute Maid Pulpy brand.
 
We are one of only a few true multi
-
category beverage players in Russia, 
twice as large and growing faster than our primary international competitor. 
And while we are pleased to report such good results this quarter, our focus 
in 
China is primarily on building our business with great brands across 
multiple categories to drive strong performance over time.
 
The measure of our success in this country will be how we grow our total 
business between now and 2020. We are confident we have
 
the right 
strategies in place to deliver sustainable double
-
digit growth in China over 
the long term.
 
We were also pleased to see Japan return to growth up a very strong 11% 
for the quarter and 3% year
-
to
-

was our h
ighest in Japan in over a decade, we recognize that along with the 
rest of the beverage industry our business benefited from record high 
temperatures this summer. That said, our brand portfolio gained further 
traction with the Japanese consumer.
 
For exampl
e, Coca
-
Cola Trademark was up 11% this quarter, a third 
consecutive quarter of positive growth driven by effective and exciting 
summer marketing program and successful FIFA World Cup activation. And 
our water business in Japan also drove profitable growth 

launch of I LOHAS Mikan, a new mandarin orange flavored water extending 
the presence of our industry leading and eco
-
friendly single served I LOHAS 
brand.
 
Despite the success we have so far had in Japan this year, it is important to 
poin
t out that economic headwinds remain challenging for the time being. As 
for the Philippines, we delivered a fourth consecutive quarter of double
-
digit 
growth with Coca
-
Cola Trademark growing 12% and still beverages up 20% 
supported by strong gains in tea, 
juices and juice drinks as well as water.
 
We also announce our commitment to increase our investments in this 
critical country by $1 billion over five years as we remain focused on 
investing ahead of demand. Moving now to Latin America where the quarter 
vo
lume grew a steady 4% gaining share in total nonalcoholic ready
-
to
-
drink 
beverages, despite adverse weather conditions in Mexico, Columbia and 
most of Central America. Brand Coca
-
Cola was also up 4% for the quarter.
 
Brazil delivered very strong results wit
h volume of 13% for the quarter and 
12% year
-
to
-
date. This also marked the third consecutive quarter that Brazil 
has gained volume and value share in total nonalcoholic beverages.
 
Mexico volume was even for the quarter cycling 9% growth from last year 
and 
impacted by heavy rain during the summer season. Mexico has now 
gained total nonalcoholic ready
-
to
-
drink beverage volume share for 14 of the 
last 15 quarters and value share for 15 consecutive quarters. We are 
confident that Mexico will return to normalize
d growth over the balance of 
the year. Lastly, our Latin, South Latin region which includes Argentina and 
Chile delivered solid mid
-
single
-
digit growth.
 
Moving to Europe, we still see customers and consumers pressured by the 
difficult economic conditions i
mpacting various countries in this geography. 
For the quarter, our volume was slightly positive rounding to even versus 
the prior year. Our performance in sparkling beverages in Europe was led by 
Trademark Coca
-
Cola which is up 1% for the quarter and on a 
year
-
to
-
date 
basis.
 
Our still beverages in Europe saw a positive growth across categories 
including double
-
digit growth in energy and tea as well as positive results in 
both sports drinks and juice and juice drinks. Importantly, our still 
beverages gained 
both volume and value share in Europe this past quarter.
 
We were pleased to realize low to mid
-
single
-
digit growth this quarter across 
most of our Western European markets including France, the Nordics and 
Great Britain. These encouraging results were offs
et by ongoing economic 
challenges in South and Eastern Europe.
 
In Spain, despite the ongoing economic crisis, our business once again 
improved its share trends capturing total nonalcoholic ready
-
to
-
drink 
beverage share this quarter. Our Nordics business gr
ew a solid 6% in the 

 
The move of these bottling operations is consistent with the principles we 
have always shared regarding our bottling investments group. That is to sell 
our selected c
ompany
-
owned bottling operations at fair value and at the 
right time to strategically and financially align bottling partners. As we have 
said many times before, we will only sell our bottling operation when it is a 
successful and sustainable business.
 
The
 
Norway and Sweden operations are just that. So, on behalf of our 
company, I would like to personally thank all of our Coca
-
Cola associates in 
Norway and Sweden for their great efforts. They are the foundation upon 
which a strong business was built and we 
look forward to partnering with 
them now that they have joined a new CCE organization.
 
As for Germany, our remaining European bottling operation, it sustained its 
momentum delivering its fifth consecutive quarter of positive volume 
growth.
 
You have heard m
e say time and time again that we always put our brands 
first in everything that we do, across each and every one of our operating 
groups. As a result, our sparkling beverages grew 3% in the quarter with 
international sparkling beverage volume up 4%.
 
As fo
r Coca
-
Cola Zero, it continues to be one of the fastest growing global 

uninterrupted string of success in the North America market. This 
momentum extends around the world with the brand of
 
6% in international 
markets on a year
-
to
-
date basis.
 
We are also successfully expanding our still beverage portfolio with total still 
beverage unit case volume increasing by 11% in the quarter led by double
-
digit growth in sports drinks and water as well 
as high single
-
digit growth in 
juices and juice drinks.
 
I mentioned before how Powerade has been the growth leader of the sports 
drink category in North America, but this brand success story is also a global 
one. Powerade has almost doubled its global shar
e since 2000, and this 
momentum extended into the third quarter supported by the flawless 
execution of Powerade global FIFA World Cup campaign across 34 markets.
 
In summary, the sound results across our operations and the balanced 
growth across our sparkli
ng and still beverages are a testament to our 
seasoned operating team and global franchise partners. Together, we are 
executing our 2020 vision in a disciplined, aligned and decisive manner. We 
are growing our business while holding a more than three to on
e volume and 
value share advantage internationally over our primary global competitor.
 
And while we grow our business, the strength of our flagship brand is only 
getting stronger. This past quarter alone, Coca
-
Cola was named South 

the Sunday Times. And Coca
-
Cola retained its number 
one ranking in inter
-
brands rankings of the best global brands for the 
11
th
 
consecutive year.
 
Despite these recognitions, we can assure you that we are not content, in 
fact we remain constructively discon
tent. We realize and appreciate that 
many near
-
term challenges remain with our consumers and customers 
around the world.
 
So as we build, further build our business momentum across the world, we 
are also committed to building a better tomorrow. When we are 
doing this is 
by delivering on our promise to be the global leader in sustainable water use 
and the industry leader in packaging energy and climate protection.
 
This past quarter, our PlantBottle package, a newly designed PET plastic 
bottle made partially f
rom plants, won a Greener Package Award reaffirming 
our position as a sustainable packaging leader and representing yet another 
step in our journey to create the bottle of the future.
 
Since making its debut in Denmark in December 2009, our PlantBottle 
pack
age has rolled out in a variety of sizes across our sparkling and still 
beverage portfolio. By the end of this year, we will have 2.5 billion 
PlantBottle packages in the market and we expect to double this number in 
2011.
 
The presence of these packages thi
s year alone is equivalent to eliminating 
almost 30,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide, CO2, and approximately 
70,000 barrels of oil. So, our commitment to lead in climate protection is 
one we have worked on diligently for years. We made a public commitment
 
in 2008 that we would place an additional 100,000 HFC
-
free coolers in the 
marketplace by the end of 2010.
 
I am pleased to report that together with our bottling partners, we have 
fulfilled this commitment five months ahead of schedule having placed our 
10
0,000 incremental HFC
-
free unit in the marketplace this past quarter 
bringing our total number of HFC
-
free coolers in the marketplace to 220,000 
units.
 
Another way we are building a better tomorrow is by partnering with our 
communities. A great example of 
this is our recent launch of Project Nurture 
in Kenya. This is a mango and passion fruit and juice sourcing partnership 
with the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. Through this creative initiative, we 
are helping develop local fruit sourcing farms to support
 
our expanding juice 
businesses around the world.
 
Equally important, we are improving the incomes of more than 50,000 fruit 
farmers in Kenya and Uganda. We are also building for a better tomorrow by 
putting up people first. In fact, I spend as much time de
veloping our 
management team and talent as I do leading our business. Our people are 
the absolute key competitive advantage and an enabler to achieving our 
2020 vision.
 
The real opportunity in developing our people is finding leaders with a global 
mindset 
and experience who can effectively lead a multinational, 
multicultural, multilingual team of associates and bottling partners. To do 
this, we have a consistent set of criteria we apply when it comes to talent 
management seeking leaders with a breadth of ex
perience and perspective 
who can think beyond their geography and also operate in different and 
dynamic environments.
 
And then, our reputation attracts and retains talent, but we cannot rely on 
this as our only strategy. Just as we continue to focus on bui
lding our 
brands, we are also investing in our brand as a 21
st
 
century employer, which 


2010 survey was bas
ed on data from nearly 130,000 college students all 
around the world.
 
The Coca
-
Cola Company moved up five spots since 2009 to number eight in 
the world according to the surveyed business students, number two amongst 
consumer goods companies and only the be
verage company ranked in the 
top 20.
 
Let me close by saying that we are confident in our systems ability to win 
together, align and focus on executing against our consistent growth 
strategies to achieve our 2020 vision.
 
Despite facing extended economic hea
dwind, we are on course to deliver on 
our commitment to grow volume, revenue, share and profits in 2010. The 
integration of our North America business is fully underway and well on 
track. We have created the right operational structure, which will accelera
te 
our ability to make agile, strategic decisions to build on our strong 
momentum in this marketplace.
 
As we look ahead, we see a world that is yearning not just for the beverages 
provided by The Coca
-
Cola Company, but also for the values and ideals that 
o
ur brands represent, values and ideals like community, like fun, happiness 
and the hope for a better tomorrow. This is what inspires the strong and 
unyielding belief in the growth of our company and our system as well as the 
long
-
term value it can create f
or our shareowners.
 

 
Gary Fayard
 
Thanks Muhtar. Good morning everyone. As Muhtar said, we once again 
delivered a quarter of consistent quality, volume and profit growth. Our 
volume revenue and profit res
ults all came in ahead of our long
-
term growth 
targets this quarter, reaffirming that our highly capable leadership team is 
executing the right strategic plans with our bottling partners to achieve our 
sustainable long
-
term goals.
 
These results demonstrate
 
that we are building on our 2010 momentum and 
advancing our 2020 vision. As outlined in our released, we reported 
comparable earnings per share of $0.92, up 12% versus the prior year. For 
the quarter, our business delivered strong comparable net revenue g
rowth of 
8% in the quarter, driven by a 7% increase in concentrate sales and a 1% 
positive price mix impact. Our comparable operating income was up a strong 
14%, bringing our year
-
to
-
date comparable growth to 15%, while currency 
had a minimal impact on ope

positive impact year
-
to
-
date. Further our comparable gross profit increased 
10% with year
-
to
-
date gross profit up 9%, again currency had a minimal 
impact on gross profit in the quarter but has had a 2% positive imp
act year
-
to
-
date.
 
As for our cash flow from operations, this increased 15% year
-
to
-
date to 
$7.2 billion, this growth was primarily driven by our improved performance 
including the effects of currency.
 
Now let me go through some detail around our quarterly 
results and year
-
to
-
date performance. Our sequential improvement in price mix was in line with 
our expectations with the ongoing impact of geographic mix more than 
offset by our positive global revenue growth, management strategies. This 
improvement brings
 
our year
-
to
-
date price mix results to even versus a prior 
year fully consistent with our expectations shared in previous earnings calls. 
As we communicated before, we expect our price mix to remain even for the 
full year.
 
Our comparable currency neutral c
osts of goods was up 3% for the quarter 
and is now up 1% year
-
to
-
date fully in lined with our communications in 
previous quarterly calls when we said that we expected our cost of goods to 
grow in a low single
-
digit range for the full year.
 
Comparable curre
ncy neutral SG&A expenses were up 8% in the quarter and 
up 3% year
-
to
-
date reflecting increased levels of marketing expand driven 
by the cycling of low marketing expenses during the same period last year, 
which we anticipated and also out lined for you in 
our last quarterly call.
 
As far our total market expand including both our direct and point
-
of
-
sale 
marketing, this continuous to be positive on a year
-
to
-
date basis as we 
remain committed to investing in our brands for long
-
term growth. For this 
quarter w
e captured 4% points of operating expense leverage, this was a 
little better than our expectation for the full year that I mentioned last 
quarter and was driven by greater top line profit growth continued strong 
focus on cost management and the benefits of
 
our productivity initiatives.
 
Importantly this underscores the unique strength of our global system a 
system able to simultaneously run highly effective and efficient operations 
while driving solid top line results. Going forward, we now expect our full 
y
ear 2010 operating expense leverage to command at the low to mid
-
single
-
digit range. Lastly the lowering of our year
-
to
-
date effective tax rate from 
23.2 to 23% benefited our earnings per share by little less than a penny.
 
Now let me take a minute to highl
ight a few additional factors we see in the 
fourth quarter of this year. First I want to remind you that has highlighted in 
our previous quarterly calls, our comparable result for 2010 reflect the 
impact of the deconsolidation of certain entities primarily
 
bottling operations 
due to new accounting guidance that became effective the beginning of this 
year as far past the requirements.
 

-
GAAP 
schedules to provide a comparable income statement f
or external modeling 
purposes and it posted to schedule in the investor section of our website that 
takes into account, this change in accounting guidance to this year and 
adjusting prior year results.
 
Secondly as per my earlier remarks, currency had a min
imal impact on our 
comparable results this quarter. As thought and as we communicated in our 
prior quarterly call, we believe that currency will have a slightly positive 
impact on operating income on a full year basis with this benefit weighted 
toward the 
first half of 2010.
 
We expect currency to have a minimal to low single
-
digit negative impact on 
operating income in the fourth quarter. Looking
-

expect to see a repeat of the currency volatility, we saw in early 2009 and 
earlier 
this year, we would expect some further volatility going forward as 
economics are merged from the global recession differently.
 
Please note that we routinely monitor our exposure to currency actively 
hedge odd currency such as the Euro and Yen and proactiv
ely balance our 

our long
-

activities. Importantly we will keep managing and investing in our business 
at the loca
l market level and in local currencies to drive long
-
term growth 
and increase the consumption of our brands.
 
On productivity we are well on track, and on plan to deliver $500 million in 
annual savings from our initiatives by the end 2011, lastly with regar
d to our 
share repurchase program, we were out of the market depending the close 
of our transaction with Coca
-
Cola enterprises. With this transaction of close 
we are in a profit of reentering the market and now expect to repurchase 
approximately $2 billion
 
of share by the end of 2010.
 
Well, on the subject to CCE, let me share a few items regarding the 
transactions. First the deal closed on October 2, 2010 which was the first 
day of our fourth quarter ,while this transaction was structured as primarily 
cash 
list under terms of the deal we agree to make a cash payment to CCE 
in the advance that the actual debt assumed upon acquisition was less than 
the previously agreed upon amount.
 
Therefore, in anticipation of closing the transaction, a cash consideration of
 
$1.3 billion was paid to CCE substantially related to the debt level assumed. 
This payment was made on October 1
st
, the last day of our third quarter. 
Concurrently and as expected we also received about $900 million in cash 
from CCE for the sale of our No
rway and Sweden bottling operations. Both of 

balance sheet.
 
As for the recurring result we report today, these were not impacted by the 
CCE transaction. When we report our fourth qua
rter and full
-
year results, 

business as well as the divesture of our Norway and Sweden bottling 
operations.
 
Secondly, when we announced our fourth quarter and full
-
year result, we
 
will continue to detail our results by our five existing geographic operating 
groups with the North American operating group fully incorporating our 
newly constituted Coca
-
Cola refreshments and Coca
-
Cola North America 
Organizations.
 
Finally with regard to
 
synergies, as we have announced previously and 
reiterated in our earnings release today, we continue to expect synergies of 
at least $350 million per year phased in over the next four years. We know 
that many of you are looking for additional modeling inf
ormation regarding 
our newly integrated North America business, please note that before the 
end of this year, we intend to share with you further details regarding our 
capital and debt structure plans, as well as the impact of other items 
regarding the mod
eling of our new North American operations.
 
In conclusion, we delivered strong volume growth and [Inaudible]
 
profit 
growth through the first three quarters of this year, both our operating 
income and earnings per share growth rates are ahead of our long
-
te
rm 
growth targets on an ongoing currency neutral basis. Our revenue growth 
has sequentially improved over the course of the year and is now fully in line 
with our long
-
term growth targets.
 

y to 
effectively manage and execute our strategies within a challenging market 
environment. Together with our global bottling partners, we are maintaining 
our disciplined investment strategies and executing the right actions to drive 
our business for both 
today and tomorrow. As such, we remain confident 
that we will keep enhancing the health of our brands and importantly drive 
long
-
term profitable growth and value for our shareowners.
 
Operator, we are now ready for questions.
 
Question
-
and
-
Answer Session
 
Ope
rator
 
And thank you sir. We will now begin the question
-
and
-
answer session. 
(Operator Instructions). And our first question comes from Bill Pecoriello 
with Consumer Edge Research.
 
Bill Pecoriello 

 
Consumer Edge Research
 
Good morning. Muhtar, you had a ver
y strong quarter in North America, 
relative to where the industry is growing. Can you talk about what the Coke 
system is doing in the non
-
measured channels to drive this outperformance 

 
Muhtar Kent
 
Good morning, B
ill. I think you are right in pointing out that we had a good 
quarter in North America; volume grew 2%, second consecutive quarter 
positive and I highlight organic growth, and year
-
to
-
date volume growth was 
1%. I think, if you sort of dig double click and 
dig down for the quarters, 
total sparkling was even Trademark and then for the year
-
to
-
date when you 
look at, like Trademark Coca Cola on a year
-
to
-
date basis is even versus 
minus three for the same three quarters the prior year.
 
So, one of the things that
 
is continuing to drive this is our success in our 
brand price pack channel architecture that we have talked about for a 
number of quarters that we are implementing. I think another one is our 
continued strength in our brands. We continue to invest in our 
brands and 

-
Cola remains the number one favorite brand and has 
widened that lead over its nearest competitor, ratio is now 1.6 to 1 versus 
1.4 in a year
-
to
-
date 2008 for example.
 
Favorite brand scores are again up. Coke Zero favorite b
rand scores 
continue to grow at a significant rate. So all of that is paying off and I think 

powerful brands, creating the value with our customer relationships and also 
a high pe
rformance system that is capable of working together to serve our 
customers and consumers.
 
And I am happy also to point out that in the third quarter as the industry 
returned to more rational pricing, CCNA, our North American Operation, 
Coca
-
Cola USA gaine
d valued share in total NARTD and volume and value 
share in the sparkling as well as still categories.
 
So, when you look back at say some of the media reports back in the middle 
of 2008, say June, July, 2008, one of the priorities I outlined at that time, 
if 
you look into the clippings and go back into recent history, I said it is to 
stabilize and return to a sustainable growth our North American Operations.
 
I think that, in no way are we declaring victory, we are in the process of 
stabilizing as you can se
e from the numbers. And we are cautiously 

had in the last couple of years in North America and the US consumer is still 
confused by the way that we are 

 
our investments are pay
ing off, our 
alignment with our bottling partners is paying off. And now I think we can 
accelerate that with this historic transaction.
 
So, I am particularly pleased that as we have gone into this transaction at 
the end of this quarter, this past quarter, 
that we go into that transaction 
from a point of strength, from a position of strength. And as I said the 
transaction will further enable us to accelerate our momentum, I believe.
 
Bill Pecoriello 

Consumer Edge Research
 
Then Gary, if I can just quickly fol
low up. I know you said you are going to 
update us at year end on some of the deal math, but originally you had said 
the deal would be accretive by 2012. Interest rates have move down since 
there, do you see it as likely to be accretive on 2011 earnings?
 
G
ary Fayard
 

update on the answer of that question actually when we get together later in 
the year. We are putting together all of the numbers now, and to really 
answer it, you have go
t to go through all of the synergies. You have got to 
go through all the purchase accounting adjustments and everything else. 

have come down which will be helpful. Let me delay the a
nswer to that 


 
Bill Pecoriello

Okay, thanks.

And next is Carlos Laboy from Credit 
Suisse.
 
Carlos Laboy 

 
Credit Suisse
 
Good morning everyone.
 
Muhtar Kent
 
Good morning.
 
Carlos Laboy 

 
Credit Suisse
 
Muhtar, could you provide us maybe some more granularity on the 

facilita
ting this type of volume growth, maybe talk a little bit about the 
profitability levels that you might be or improvements that you are seeing 
out of the Philippines? And on a related basis you are talking more or your 
management seems to be talking more ab
out transactions and tracking 
transactions better not just volume; can you speak to how you are using this 

transaction growth versus volume growth?
 
Muhtar Kent
 
First, on the Philipp
ines Carlos, I think as we have noticed, we posted a 
strong quarter of plus 19% growth in the third quarter, which was actually 
our fourth consecutive quarter of double
-
digit growth. The BIG team, 
Bottling Investment Group team, led by Ariel [ph] and his a
ssociates, I think 
have done a good job in stabilizing the business first in the Philippines and 

 
Coca Cola grew 12% in the quarter due to [Inaudible]
 
on multi
-
serve 
packages to protect Diet [ph] Coke with 
[Inaudible] and I think our still 
beverages grew 20%. We have also recently announced our commitment to 
the Philippines to increase our investments to the tune of about $1 billion 
over the next five years. And I think that again tells you that we believe i
n 
the future of the Philippines. We believe in the future of the Philippines 
consumer as well as the Philippines in total as a country. And I think we are 
excited what the future offers in the Philippines.
 
As far as transactions are concerned, at the end o




 

important for us to track the consumer behavior patterns of consumption in 
different
 
channels on a transaction basis. And I think that we are certainly 
seeing the benefit of tracking that metric in the United States, especially as 
we have offered more choices as part of our brand price pack channel 

 
working well. And you will continue 
to see a focus on that metric as we widen it across the world.
 
Gary Fayard
 
And Carlos this is Gary. And just to be definitional for everyone who is on 
the call, when as you talk about transactions, the way we define tra
nsactions 

If you bought a 14 or 16
-


pack pr

critically important and one of those metrics that we are actively reviewing 
every month.

And the next question comes from J
ohn Faucher from JPMorgan.
 
John Faucher 

 
JPMorgan
 
Good morning, thank you. Wanted to dial down on a couple of different 
markets where we saw some, a little more volatility in results than we are 

latility. So you 
guys had mentioned weather is a factor in Japan, Russia and Mexico. Can 
you just talk a little bit about sort of how you would have seen the 
normalized trends in those three markets and particularly for Japan and 
Russia, sort of how you se
e things normalizing over the next couple of 
quarters? Thanks.
 
Muhtar Kent
 

particularly in the past that these markets are linked to more, we should try 
to think of these are being more vola
tile markets though go into the crisis 

seeing an exact play of that happening.
 
And I think that Russia over the next sort of three
-
year period they will 
normalize to growth rates
 
of sort of double digits I think as we move 

three years. But I think a more gradual return to a high single digit and 
double
-
digit growth rate.
 
As far as Mexico is concerned, 
you ask the question. I think, during this 
quarter Mexico and certain regions of Northern South America, the northern 
part of South America, suffered from very unusual high rainfalls which were, 
in fact in some cases in Mexico particularly severe enough to
 
disrupt 
distribution over some prolong periods.
 
And of course also this past quarter, again to remind you that Mexico was 

that Mexico, we believe that Mexico will return to a m
ore normalized rate of 
growth that we have seen in the past periods over the last two, three years.
 
And I think Japan certainly benefited from the extraordinarily positive 
weather, lack of rainfall and also very high sustained temperatures during 
the key s
ummer months, July, August. I think that Japan, but again not all 
of the growth was related to that, some of the programs we are really 
getting traction, especially in the Kanto region, in Tomei [ph] as well as 
Coca
-
Cola bottlers Tokyo and also some of the
 
other outline like Coca
-
Cola 
central Japan.
 
And therefore I think Japan we should see Japan, despite the very 
challenging consumer landscape deflationary environment should return to 
more of an even to 1% to 2% growth rate normalize over the coming 
period.
 
John Faucher 

 
JPMorgan
 

couple of quarters?
 
Muhtar Kent
 
I think the next coming period meaning sort of the one to three
-
year period.
 
John Faucher 

 
JPMorgan
 
Okay.
 
Muhtar Ke
nt
 
And then China I think based on the cycling of plus 29%, 30% on the prior 
quarter in the quarter four certainly we will see some moderation there, but 
as I said our focus is to benefit from our multi
-
category positions in China, 
successful multi
-
categor
y positions in China and drive sustainable profitable 
double
-
digit growth over time leading into 2020.
 
John Faucher 

 
JPMorgan
 
Great, thank you.
 
Operator
 
And our next question comes from Judy Hong with Goldman Sachs.
 
Judy Hong 

 
Goldman Sachs
 
Thanks, good morning. Muhtar just going back to North America as we think 
about the volume trended 2% certainly is encouraging, but it seems like the 
price mix benefit has been pretty minimal here. So as you look out over the 
next six to 12 months and you 
continue to focus on this brand channels pack 
architecture, would you assume that you see an acceleration in terms of the 
price mix benefit?
 
And then over the longer term if you think about the North American 
business now that you have integrated the CCE N
orth American operation, 
what do you think is sort of the right revenue growth projection for that part 
of the business?
 
Muhtar Kent
 

-
forward statement on the United States 
business. All I can tell you, Judy, is that, I
 
think in this past quarter net 
revenues for the quarter increased 2% which reflected a 2% increase in our 
concentrate sales, and a positive price mix which sort of rounded to even, 
which was partially offset by deconsolidation of certain entities due to a
 
change in our accounting guidance and I will have Gary comment on this 
too.
 

believe, in the United States as sparkling and still 

 
both our sparkling and 
still portfolios grow, 
and as we get traction in terms of a more nimble and 
faster system in the United States as we transform our business and reap 
the benefits of successful integration.
 

we can l
ead in to this transaction with two consecutive quarters of growth. 

Trademark Coca
-
Cola year
-
to
-
date on an even basis compared to say minus 
three for the first three quarters of prior ye
ar, and Coke Zero still doing very 
well in double
-
digit growth.
 
And so I think and then our still beverage strategy is really working very 
well. The total still beverage is up 8% on a year
-
to
-
date basis up 5% and 

 
segment as well as sports drinks. 
As I mentioned, energy, tea, all working together, coming together to 
generate this balance growth in the United States.
 
And I think, again you can expect the price mix to gradually strengthen, but 

hat we continue to invest in our brands and in our 

dividend. The strength of our brands are paying dividends, and especially in 
this third quarter, this past third quarter were t
here was price rationalization 
in the industry that we can still generate 2% organic growth was particularly 
encouraging.
 
Judy Hong 

 
Goldman Sachs
 
Okay.
 
Muhtar Kent
 
Gary, you want to comment on some?
 
Gary Fayard
 
Yeah, Judy just a couple of things. First, 
there was a negative one point from 
structural change and that was the deconsolidation of Honest Tea this year 
versus it was consolidated last year just to make that adjustment. The 

if you 
look at our pack price architecture particularly on the smaller entry level 
$0.99 pack, while that has some negative pressure actually on gross profit 
and price mix is absolutely the right thing to do, really helping with 
recruitment, really helping
 
us drive transactions as Carlos was asking about 

marketing programs is driving those brand preference score.
 
So, this is one of those examples where North America went 
down over a 


from right now.
 
Judy Hong 

 
Goldman Sachs
 
And Gary, just a quick follow
-
up. You called out t
he favorable timing of G&A 
in North America, the benefits in the quarter from a profit perspective. Is 
there a way to quantify how much that helps the profitability in the quarter?
 
Gary Fayard
 
No, and really what we had is, we had some reversals of some co
mpensation 
plans last year. And it was both in North America and in the corporate 
segment. And in fact, reversed in the third quarter and then reinstated in 

 
Judy Hong

ay. Thanks.

UBS
 

trend i
s strengthened or weakened maybe month to month? And then 
second thing, shipments were about 100 basis points it looks likes ahead of 
[Inaudible] sales, is that something that you reverse in 4Q? Thanks.
 
Muhtar Kent
 

far as the general trends are 
concerned, if you had looked at the Q2 trend of minus 1 and the Q3 trend of 

think, again Europe has been a little bit; continue to be a Tale of Two Citie
s 
type of the West being performing better continuatively with higher per 
capita, as we mentioned markets like France and Benelux and Great Britain.
 
But also at the same time, East and Southeast Europe still very challenged 
from Iberian Peninsula to Greece
 
and Southeast Former Eastern Europe 
countries like Romania and Czech Republic, Hungary, Central Europe, all 
remained more subdued and consumer confidence being still very 
challenging in that environment.
 
Kaumil Gajrawala 

 
UBS
 
Got it, and on the shipments
?
 
Muhtar Kent
 
Gary, you want to comment on the shipments?
 
Gary Fayard
 
Yes, I would expect shipments to pretty much be in line in the fourth quarter 
with volumes like I think year
-
to
-
date; they are pretty much in line and 
should be in the fourth quarter as 
well.
 
Kaumil Gajrawala

Got it. Thank you.
 
Gary Fayard
 
Thanks.

And our next question comes from Christine Farkas from Bank of America.
 
Christine Farkas 

 
Bank of America
 
Thank you very much. Gary, just a couple of housekeeping items. I 
wanted 
to confirm currency, was that actually neutral on the top
-
line as well as 
profits in the quarter? And could you comment on CapEx targets? Certainly, 



overall CapEx targets in bigger picture.
 
Gary Fayard
 
Hi Christine, currency on revenue was pretty much minimal. And currency 
basically for the quarter was minimal as its very little impact. And we expect 
a little 

Relative to CapEx, most of those investments we talk 

 
when we talk about 

sales and the bottlers, and much of
 
that is actually bottler investment.
 

would expect CapEx for this year to be pretty much in line with what we had 
talked about earlier in the year. And CapEx for next year will go t
hrough as 
we pull all of our plans together for 2011, which you and I can see 
significant changes.
 
Christine Farkas 

 
Bank of America
 
Okay. Thanks for that. And just a quick follow
-
up on South Africa. Certainly 

 
seen a nice acceleration post 


 
Muhtar Kent
 
Christine, hi. I think we were very pleased with the effective execution of o
ur 
World Cup programs. And I think it has, again helped our brands on a 
sustainable basis in South Africa. The sparkling category showing recovery 
with improvements in the new 1.25 liter returnable glass bottle and also as I 
said the FIFA World Cup program
s, I think Fanta is performing well after we 
made some, again pack changes. Activities in general have yielded good 
results, and consumers still trading down to more affordable options. We see 
that, especially in juices and waters, and we still see some he
avy 
discounting going on.
 
But I would say overall the consumer psyche is beginning to recover from 
the hard economic conditions of 2009. As you would recall that last year 
GDP shrank by about 2 

 
between 2% to 2.5%. If I recall in 2010, GDP is 
estimated to
 
be at around plus 4%. And we are benefitting from that also.
 
Christine Farkas

Okay. Great. Thanks for that Muhtar.

And our next question comes from Mark Swartzberg with Stifel Nicolaus.
 
Mark Swartzberg 

 
Stifel Nicolaus
 
Yes, tha
nks good morning everyone. Gary, I had a modeling question and 
Muhtar something on North America. And I hear you Gary on unit volume 

I look back I see unit volume and gallonage i
n line in the first quarter, in line 
in the second quarter and then that up seven versus up five here in the third 

-
to
-
date in line. Any thoughts on 
that? Again, the go forward is the key here. But any thoughts on, 
my 

 
Gary Fayard
 

looked at was just the third quarter and year
-
to
-

points ahead in the quarter gallons versus case

same year
-
to
-
date, and I would expect fourth quarter to be right in line as 
well.
 

business was accelerating in the third quarter, the bottlers are obvio
usly just 
ordering more and more concentrate, because they had been behind in 
ordering up this first two quarters.
 


-
to
-
date and I would expect it t
o stay in line in the 
fourth quarter.
 
Mark Swartzberg 

 
Stifel Nicolaus
 
Fair enough. Okay, great. And then, Muhtar, couple of things on North 
America, I mean, as has been discussed here and we have seen trends 
have

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to The Coca
-
Cola Company's 
Third Quarter 2012 Earnings Results Conference Call. Today's call is being 
recorded. If you have any objection, you may disconnect at this time. 
[Operator 
Instructions]
 
I would like to remind everyone that the purpose of this conference is to talk 
with investors, and therefore, questions from the media will not be 
addressed. Media participants should contact Coca
-
Cola's Media Relations 
department if they hav
e questions.
 
I would now like to introduce Jackson Kelly, Vice President and Investor 
Relations Officer. Mr. Kelly, you may begin.
 
Jackson Kelly
 
Good morning, and thank you for being with us today. I'm joined by Muhtar 
Kent, our Chairman and Chief Executiv
e Officer; and Gary Fayard, our Chief 
Financial Officer. Following prepared remarks this morning, we will turn the 
call over for your questions.
 
Before we begin, I would like to remind you that this conference call may 
contain forward
-
looking statements, i
ncluding statements concerning long
-
term earnings objectives, and should be considered in conjunction with 
cautionary statements contained in our earnings release and in the 
company's most recent periodic SEC report.
 
In addition, I would also like to note 
that we have posted schedules on our 
company website at www.thecoca
-
colacompany.com under the Reports and 
Financial Information tab in the Investors section, which reconcile certain 
non
-
GAAP financial measures that may be referred to by our senior 
executiv
es in our discussions this morning, and from time to time in 
discussing our financial performance to our results as reported under 
Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. Please look on our website for this 
information.
 
Now let me turn the call over to M
uhtar.
 
Muhtar Kent
 
Thank you, Jackson, and good morning, everyone. Let me begin by saying 
that we're pleased with our third quarter and year
-
to
-
date performance. We 
continue to deliver consistent quality results, with our business growing 
worldwide volume 
by 4% in the quarter and 5% year
-
to
-
date. Importantly, 
we realized positive growth across all 5 of our geographic operating groups 
this quarter despite facing a still uncertain global economy. Together with 
our global system, we are operating from a positi
on of real strength.
 
This past quarter, we built on this advantage by once again leading industry 
growth and extending our volume and value share gains globally in 
nonalcoholic ready
-
to
-
drink beverages. We gained global share in the 
sparkling beverage cate
gory, where our portfolio is up 3% in both the 
quarter and on a year
-
to
-
date basis.
 
To put this in perspective, our global sparkling business has generated 
nearly 450 million incremental cases year
-
to
-
date or the equivalent of 
adding another Russia to our 
global business. And this growth has been 
consistently and reliably led by brand Coca
-
Cola, which has grown every 
quarter over the past 3.5 years and is up a healthy 3% year
-
to
-
date. We 
also gained global share in the still beverage category, where our por
tfolio 
grew a solid 10% in the quarter and 9% year
-
to
-
date. This quarter's still 
beverage results were well balanced, with high single
-
digit growth in juice 
and juice drinks and sports drinks, as well as double
-
digit growth in the 
water, energy and ready
-
t
o
-
drink tea categories. We are committed to 
striking a sound balance between the growth of our sparkling and still 
beverages. We see this balance as the key to growing our total business 
while sustainably enhancing our margins and profits, in line with our
 
2020 
Vision.
 
We're also committed to providing consumers more choice in brands, 
beverage types and calories or no calories, all of which contributes new 
growth to our business. The balance results that we have achieved across 
our portfolio demonstrate tha
t we are delivering on this commitment.
 
As we've shared during our prior earnings calls this year, we recognize that 
consumers across the globe are still feeling the effects of the prolonged 
uncertainty in Europe, the ongoing cooling of the economy in Chin
a and a 
mild recovery in the United States. We believe these global macroeconomic 
pressures will extend through 2012 and likely into 2013. Despite this, we are 
heartened by our ability to consistently deliver quality results, as well as by 
our global syste
ms commitment to invest in the business for the long
-
term 
growth.
 
We're also encouraged by how we have successfully and systematically 
adapted our business model these past few years to readily address the 
changing demands of the global marketplace. First,
 
we better positioned our 
company to capture North America's long
-
term growth opportunity by 
acquiring CCE's North America business. Our North America business has 
delivered volume growth every quarter since we executed this important 
transaction. Second, 
we broadened the relevance of our Bottling 
Investments Group, evolving it further from its initial role of fixing 
challenging markets to a more significant role of spiriting our growth in 
select strategic markets, such as India and China.
 
Constant renewal 
is in our DNA. Now with solid fundamentals and real 
momentum in our business, we are ready to take the next step towards our 
2020 Vision. As announced last quarter, effective January 1, 2013, we're 
organizing our company around 3 major operating businesses
: Coca
-
Cola 
International, consisting of our Europe, Pacific and Eurasia & Africa 
operations; Coca
-
Cola Americas, consisting of our North America and Latin 
America operations; and Bottling Investments Group, which will continue to 
oversee our company
-
owned
 
bottling operations outside of North America. 
By consolidating leadership of our global operations under 2 large and 
similar
-
sized geographic regions, as well as in our Bottling Investments 
Group, we will streamline reporting lines and intensify our focus
 
on key 
markets. This newly evolved structure will also enable us to better leverage 
synergies and more flexibly adjust our business strategies within those 
geographies in the future. All of this will further strengthen our efforts to 
achieve long
-
term sus
tainable growth as we advance our momentum 
towards our 2020 Vision.
 
Now let's review our performance across our global markets in more detail, 
beginning with our flagship market, North America. This past quarter, our 
business in North America delivered its
 
10th consecutive quarter of growth, 
up 2% for the quarter and year
-
to
-
date. We also captured volume and value 
share in nonalcoholic ready
-
to
-
drink beverages while sustaining a positive 
3% price mix for our total North America beverage business. Our growth
 
in 
North America was once again driven by our still beverage portfolio, which 
was up 7% this quarter. This is the 10th consecutive quarter that our North 
America still beverage portfolio has either maintained or gained both volume 
and value share. In spor
ts drinks, POWERADE grew volume 9% this quarter 
while also leading the North America sports drink category in absolute unit 
case volume growth for the fourth consecutive quarter.
 
Our juice and juice drinks portfolio in North America outpaced the category, 
up 6% for the quarter while gaining both volume and value share. Our 
positive result in this category was broad
-
based, driven by strong growth in 
our juice drinks business, volume and value share growth across our Minute 
Maid Light portfolio, and further v
alue share gains in the 100% chilled 
orange juice segment.
 
Our glacéau brands were up mid
-
single digits in North America once again 
this quarter, gaining both volume and value share, and led by the 18th 
straight quarter of double
-
digit growth for our premi
um smartwater brand. 
The rest of our North America water business grew 4% in the quarter, led by 
DASANI, which maintained its premium price position, and saw further gains 
across key brand equity measures, driven by consumer awareness of our 
innovative Pla
ntBottle packaging.
 
And our key portfolio in North America sustained its momentum, up double 
digits while gaining both volume and value share. This result was led by Gold 
Peak, which has now grown strong double digits for 22 consecutive quarters. 
Our spark
ling beverages in North America were even in the third quarter, a 
sequential improvement over our second quarter results and ahead of the 
broader sparkling beverage industry. Importantly, our sparkling beverage 
portfolio earned a positive 3% price mix in b
oth the quarter and year
-
to
-
date in what continues to be a rational pricing environment. Coca
-
Cola Zero 
growth accelerated, up 9% this quarter. We also sustained our momentum 
behind Fanta, which was up mid
-
single digits for the third consecutive 
quarter.
 
W
e are encouraged by our consistent progress in North America, and we 
remain positive about the long
-
term outlook for this very important market.
 
We're also leading the effort across communities in the United States to 
tackle obesity. Last week, we joined f
ellow members of the beverage 
industry to announce the first
-
of
-
its
-
kind partnership with the cities of 
Chicago and San Antonio, encouraging the citizens of these cities to be more 
health aware and physically active. We introduced a city
-
to
-
city wellness 
c
hallenge, as well as our new Calories Count Vending Program that will 
provide consumers with the choices and information they need to choose 
beverages that are right for themselves and for their families. When it comes 
to non
-
communicable diseases such as 
obesity, we know that there are no 
simple answers. But we also know that a lack of physical activity is a 
primary contributor to obesity. We also know that there is a lack of 
understanding of how many calories people consume in a day. As such, our 
company 
is committed to partnering with customers and cities to promote 
active, healthy, balanced lifestyles, as well as making calorie information 
more transparent.
 
Now let me turn to our Pacific Group, which grew 3% in the third quarter 
and 6% year
-
to
-
date. Our 
business in Japan was up 2% this quarter, 
bringing our year
-
to
-
date volume growth in Japan to 3%. Japan has now 
delivered volume growth in 8 of the last 9 quarters. Our business in Japan 
continues to gain share in nonalcoholic ready
-
to
-
drink beverages this
 
quarter 
and also grew both volume and value share in still beverages. This positive 
result was driven by the sustained momentum of our Georgia coffee brand 
and water and sports drink category offerings, which led to consistent 
volume growth across channel
s, including drugstores, convenience retail 
outlet, as well as supermarkets. Looking ahead and consistent with what we 
said during our last earnings call, we expect our fourth quarter volume 
results in Japan to moderate somewhat below our year
-
to
-
date tren
d as we 
cycle strong growth from prior year. Having said that, our business in Japan 
is on track to deliver full year low
-
single
-
digit growth.
 
Moving now to China. Our business delivered 2% volume growth this 
quarter, cycling last year's double
-
digit growt
h. On a year
-
to
-
date basis, our 
volume in China has grown 6%, cycling strong 15% growth from last year. 
And once again, this quarter, we captured both volume and value share in 
sparkling beverages. Importantly and in alignment with our strategic 
priorities
 
in China, we are growing transactions ahead of volume, with total 
transactions up 10% year
-
to
-
date. One package that is helping us deliver 
against that strategy is our 300 ml, milliliter, package. On a year
-
to
-
date 
basis, this new package has generated ov
er 0.5 billion incremental 
transactions in China. We will keep driving our 300 ml package to provide 
consumers with a great offering at the right price point while also building 
our brands and the sparkling category in a healthy way over the long term.
 
As 
we look ahead to the next 6 months, it is reasonable to expect that 
China's ongoing economic slowdown may have a short
-
term effect on our 
industry and on our business. In our view, the Chinese economy is 
undergoing a natural and necessary economic transiti
on as the government 
places greater emphasis on controlling long
-
term inflation over injecting 
short
-
term economic stimulus. While the Chinese economy undergoes this 
period of transition, we have every confidence in the long
-
term resilience of 
our business
 
for 3 key reasons. First, our brands in China are strong. In our 
latest survey of consumers aged 12 to 49 years old, Coca
-
Cola was rated as 
both the most favorite sparkling and nonalcoholic ready
-
to
-
drink brand. In 
this same survey, Minute Maid was rated 
as the most favorite juice drinks 
brand.
 
Second, we hold the leadership position in the sparkling category. This is the 
ninth consecutive quarter in which our sparkling beverages in China either 
maintained or gained both volume and value share. And third, 
our system in 
China is strategically focused, well aligned and committed to invest for 
sustainable long
-
term growth. As such, we remain encouraged and excited 
about our opportunities in this region and continue to believe that China will 
serve as the long
-
term growth driver for our business.
 
I also want to share our perspective on a few other markets in the Pacific 
that are exhibiting strong growth, starting with Thailand, which again 
delivered double
-
digit growth, up a sound 19% this quarter. Thailand grow
th 
was led by brand Coca
-
Cola, which was up 26% in the quarter and 34% 
year
-
to
-
date. I also want to highlight our result in South Korea, another 
market which has grown double digits in both the quarter and on a year
-
to
-
date basis. As additional context, ou
r business in South Korea has nearly 
doubled since 2007. This is a testament to our system's ability to implement 
a robust set of occasion
-
based price and packaging offerings to consumers 
and drive growth across this region. We're excited about the growth 
opportunities in both Thailand and South Korea, and we'll keep investing for 
the future in these vibrant markets.
 
Moving now to Latin America, our volume grew 5% for both the quarter, as 
well as year
-
to
-
date. As in previous quarters, this growth was led 
by brand 
Coca
-
Cola, up 3% in both the quarter and year
-
to
-
date. In Latin America, 
we once again captured both volume and value share in nonalcoholic ready
-
to
-
drink beverages. Our 2 largest markets in Latin America, Mexico and 
Brazil, were both up a solid 6
% this past quarter while also growing volume 
and value share in sparkling, still and also the entire nonalcoholic ready
-
to
-
drink category. Importantly, our growth in both these markets was well 
balanced across all categories. Mexico grew sparkling beverag
es 3%, and 
still beverages were up double digits for the quarter. Similarly, Brazil 
delivered 4% sparkling beverage growth and double
-
digit still beverage 
growth for the quarter. Brazil was up 5% on a year
-
to
-
date basis. In light of 
these strong results, w
e now expect our 2012 growth in Brazil to be in the 
mid
-
single digits.
 
Let me also share our perspective on a few other markets in Latin America 
that we see as great opportunities for long
-
term growth; specifically, 
Colombia, Ecuador and Peru. Together, th
ese markets are 1/3 the size of our 
current Brazilian business. Our system is very focused on implementing the 
same winning strategies in these markets that have driven such positive 
results in Brazil this past decade. We will keep investing in Colombia, 
i
nvesting in Ecuador and Peru and across the entire Latin America region, as 
we execute our 2020 Vision. As such, it is easy to see why we are excited 
about the long
-
term growth opportunity represented by these 3 dynamic 
Latin American markets.
 
Our Eurasia 
& Africa business extended its strong momentum, growing a 
solid 11% in both the quarter and year
-
to
-
date, including 11% year
-
to
-
date 
growth for brand Coca
-
Cola. During the quarter, our business in Eurasia & 
Africa grew both volume and value share in total 
nonalcoholic ready
-
to
-
drink 
beverages. On a country level, India once again led this group's 
performance, delivering balanced and consistent quality growth. Our 
business in India was up 15% for the quarter, with double
-
digit growth and 
volume and value sha
re gains realized across both sparkling and still 
beverages. Sparkling beverage growth in India was led by brand Coca
-
Cola, 
up over 30% for the second consecutive quarter, as we sustained our focus 
on immediate consumption offerings. And still beverages in
 
India were led 
by our juice drink brands, with Maaza up over 20% again in the quarter. 
Russia was up 7% in both the quarter and year
-
to
-
date, with the strong 
result driven by the further acceleration of brand Coca
-
Cola, which grew 
18% in the quarter and 2
0% year
-
to
-
date. Like last quarter, we observed 
similarly strong results across our broader sparkling portfolio in Russia, with 
Fanta up 15% and Sprite up 7%. And our Dobriy juice brand built on its 
recent success, delivering 16% growth in the quarter and 
raising this brand's 
year
-
to
-
date performance up to 12%.
 
Our strong performance across the Eurasia & Africa Group was supported by 
our partnership with Aujan. We're excited about the further growth 
opportunities represented by our partnership with Aujan, w
hich holds the #1 
position in the still beverage business across the entire Middle East. And our 
collaborations in Eurasia & Africa extend beyond business relationships, as 
exemplified by our partnership with The Global Fund to bring critical 
medicines to 
rural Africa. At last month's Clinton Global Initiative, we 
announced our plans to expand the reach of project Last Mile, which was 
established in 2010 to help Tanzania's government
-
run medicine distribution 
network build a more efficient supply chain by l
everaging our expansive 
distribution system and core business expertise. Nearly 20 million Africans 
have benefited from this partnership since 2010. The newest phase of this 
partnership will increase the availability of medicines to 75% of Tanzania 
and exp
and the project's reach to Ghana and Mozambique. The success of 
this project demonstrates our belief in the power of civil society, government 
and the private sector, or what we call the Golden Triangle, working closely 
together to solve real global issues
 
and problems.
 
Moving now to Europe. We saw our business return to growth, up a solid 1% 
for the quarter. These results were achieved despite the continuation of 
unseasonably poor weather in the first half of the quarter, as well as the 
impact of ongoing m
acroeconomic uncertainty. Even with these external 
headwinds, all 4 of our European business units saw positive growth this 
quarter, demonstrating our ability to execute with excellence across this 
entire region.
 
Germany once again led the region, up 3% fo
r the quarter and 2% year
-
to
-
date. This marks Germany's seventh consecutive quarter of positive growth. 
And while our business in Germany is winning today, we are connecting with 
consumers to ensure continued success for tomorrow. An example of this 
was ou
r award
-
winning Coca
-
Cola summer campaign in Germany, which was 
named the best 2012 out
-
of
-
home campaign by Germany's leading 
marketing industry weekly. Understanding that music is a passion point for 
teenagers, our campaign in Germany leveraged our global
 
partnership with 
Spotify, a leading music streaming platform, to offer teenagers access to 
millions of songs and exclusive Coca
-
Cola content. This campaign generated 
more than 1.5 billion contacts and reached more than 90% of all teenagers 
in Germany as t
hey created their own Coca
-
Cola playlists and shared them 
with their friends via Facebook.
 
We are successfully applying the same consumer engagement principles 
across regions, as exemplified by our highly successful global activation of 
the 2012 London Sum
mer Olympic Games. Our internal indicators show that 
the marketing programs we executed across almost 100 markets drove 
global improvements in recruitment, frequency and brand equity with our 
consumers. Our television commercials were acknowledged by Ace M
etrix as 
consistently being among the highest
-
rated ads during the Olympics. Our 
efforts across the digital and mobile space were also recognized. We 
received a Digital Gold Award by Unmetric, a brand tracker, who analyzed 
the social media performance of e
very major sponsor. And we were honored 
with the Global Marketer of the Year award by the Mobile Marketing 
Association while also taking home a Best in Show nod at their awards 
ceremony for our Olympic Games Move to the Beat campaign.
 
Our social media prog
rams' success goes well beyond our Olympics 
activation. Over just the last 9 months, Coca
-
Cola's Facebook page has 
grown by over 40%. This past quarter, Coca
-
Cola became the first brand to 
achieve over 50 million likes. And as of today, this number has inc
reased 
further, surpassing 52 million. This rise parallels the growth of our social 
engagements footprint across all major social networks that generate 
conversation and content with our consumers. The recent study by PQ Media 
found that Coca
-
Cola was the 
#1 brand in social media impressions by 
nearly a 2:1 margin over the next most
-
mentioned brand.
 
Another area of emphasis for our system is to support sustainable 
communities by replenishing 100% of the water used in our finished 
beverages by 2020. To advan
ce this goal, we recently announced the global 
clean water partnership with DEKA Research & Development to bring clean 
water to communities where potable water access is limited. This 
partnership will leverage innovative technology to deliver clean drinkin
g 
water to schools, health clinics and community centers in rural regions of 
Africa, Asia and Latin America. When fully scaled, this partnership is 
expected to add more than 0.5 billion liters of clean drinking water per year 
to the global water supply.
 
Wh
ile water is the lifeblood of our business, we're committed to doing our 
part to replenish the water we use and give back to communities we proudly 
serve. By partnering with DEKA, we hope to empower local entrepreneurs 
with a specific focus on women by del
ivering, as well as maintaining, a clean 
water solution for communities and improving the daily lives of thousands of 
people around the world.
 
Finally, we were humbled and honored earlier this month when brand Coca
-
Cola topped the list of Interbrand's Best
 
Global Brands rankings. Interbrand 
has rated Coca
-
Cola as the #1 brand on its list every year since 2000. This 
is a testament to our ongoing commitment to invest in our brands, innovate 
our marketing and engage with our consumers in a sustainable manner t
hat 
builds long
-
term value.
 
Certainly, the world has been very volatile from a macroeconomic 
perspective over the last 4 years. As a global company and also on behalf of 
all our associates, I'm pleased to say that we continue to crack the calculus 
for grow
th in this challenging and volatile environment. We've done this by 
consistently increasing our investments in our system and our brands to 
ensure that our global portfolio is more relevant and healthier today than it's 
ever been during our history. We rem
ain resolutely focused on ensuring that 
we leverage our unique heritage and fuse it with what is expected by our 
consumers today in order to earn and sustain our place in their daily lives 
today and tomorrow.
 
I want to thank all of our consumers who invite
 
us into their lives 1.8 billion 
times each and every day. And I want to thank all of our shareholders for 
your interest and investment in our company. It's a great responsibility. You 
can rest assured that our entire leadership team is working diligently 
to 
protect and grow the value of your investment in our company, both today 
and for tomorrow.
 
So with that, let me now turn the call over to Gary.
 
Gary P. Fayard
 
Thanks, Muhtar, and good morning, everyone. We delivered another quarter 
of solid performance 
results, reflecting our global system's ability to 
consistently execute our strategic plans while managing through a still 
unpredictable macroeconomic environment. As you'll recall, I provided a 
commentary about the third quarter during our last earnings c
all because we 
knew there were several unique timing and cycling factors to consider when 
modeling the third quarter. Taking these factors into account, I'm pleased to 
say that our third quarter results were consistent with the commentary we 
provided in ou
r last earnings call. And as such, we remain confident in our 
ability to deliver full year volume, revenue and operating income results in 
line with our long
-
term growth targets.
 
So let me start our review with our third quarter results with our comparable
 
earnings per share, which came in at $0.51 this quarter and at $1.56 on a 
year
-
to
-
date basis, up 2% year
-
to
-
date despite facing considerable currency 
headwinds throughout the year. Our comparable currency
-
neutral operating 
income was up 1% this quarter, i
n line with our expectations. And on a 
comparable basis, the impact of currency on this quarter's operating income 
results was a 7% headwind.
 
On a year
-
to
-
date basis, our comparable currency
-
neutral operating income 
is up 4%, also in line with our expectat
ions. As per my previous comment, 
we expect to deliver full year operating income results in line with our long
-
term growth targets, and we understand that this implies we will achieve 
double
-
digit comparable currency
-
neutral operating income growth in the
 
fourth quarter.
 
Comparable currency
-
neutral net revenues grew 6% in the quarter. The 
currency impact on this quarter's comparable net revenue results was a 5% 
headwind. On a year
-
to
-
date basis, comparable currency
-
neutral net 
revenue growth is also at 6%.
 
As we discuss profit and revenue growth 
rates, let me take a moment to remind everyone that the profits and 
revenues generated by some of our more recent strategic partnerships, 
including Aujan and Innocent, among others, are accounted for under the 
equit
y method of accounting. So while unit cases related to these businesses 
are fully reflected in our volume growth, their associated concentrate sales 
or concentrate gallons
-
associated profits and revenues are not currently 
contributing to our operating inco
me and revenue growth rates. Instead, 
these profits are consolidated into our equity income results. While this did 
not materially impact our third quarter results, I think it's important because 
there is an impact on growth rates.
 
Returning now to a revie
w of our third quarter results, our concentrate sales 
came in slightly ahead of unit case volume by approximately 0.5%. As a 
reminder, growth rates for concentrate sales and unit cases can vary from 
quarter
-
to
-
quarter. Having said that, concentrate sales a
re in line with unit 
cases year
-
to
-
date, and we expect our full year concentrate sales growth to 
be in line with unit case volume growth.
 
As for our consolidated price mix, this came in slightly positive in the 
quarter, rounding to even, consistent with ou
tlook we provided in our last 
quarter call. On a year
-
to
-
date basis, our consolidated price mix is up 2%. 
We continue to expect our full year 2012 consolidated price mix results to 
come in between 1% and 2%, in line with our long
-
term target range.
 
Our thi
rd quarter comparable gross margins were in line with our second 
quarter comparable gross margins. This was a slight improvement over the 
estimate we provided during our last earnings call, as we successfully offset 
some of the currency and mix shift headw
inds faced by our business. For the 
full year, we still expect our comparable gross margins to come in below our 
second and third quarter comparable gross margins.
 
On comparable currency
-
neutral SG&A expenses, they were up 8% in the 
quarter and 6% year
-
to
-
date. These results include a mid
-
single
-
digit 
increase in our third quarter direct marketing expenses, as we continue to 
invest in the health and strength of our brands. Our third quarter SG&A also 
reflects an increase due to the timing of certain operati
ng expenses, as well 
as the cost of adding incremental feet on the street, primarily in North 
America, in support of our growing business. And one point of both our 
quarter and year
-
to
-
date SG&A rate is related to the impact of structural 
items, primarily 
in our Bottling Investments Group and North American 
business. As we look to the rest of the year, we expect our full year SG&A to 
come in close to our current year
-
to
-
date rate. Our operating expense 
leverage was minus 4 points this quarter, right in line
 
with the minus 3
-
 
to a 
minus 5
-
point range that we estimated during our last earnings call.
 
As we've stated in our last call, we expect this trend to reverse in the fourth 
quarter, as we benefit from having 2 additional selling days. This should 
enable us
 
to achieve slightly positive operating expense leverage on a full 
year basis. Our net interest came in at a positive $16 million in the third 
quarter, which is ahead of our initial expectations. This raised our year
-
to
-
date net interest income to $43 mill
ion. Looking ahead, we still expect our 
net interest to come in as an expense in the fourth quarter, primarily due to 
expected lower rates in some of our international locations, as well as 
ongoing currency headwinds. As a result, we're updating our full y
ear net 
interest income outlook to a $30 million to $40 million range.
 
Our underlying effective tax rate held steady at 24%, and we expect to carry 
this 24% tax rate into next year. And our cash flow from operations 
increased a very healthy and very strong
 
15% year
-
to
-
date. Our year
-
to
-
date share repurchases, net of employee stock option exercises, totaled $2.3 
billion, placing us well on track to achieve the $2.5 billion to $3 billion range 
for full year 2012 that we communicated at the outset of this year
.
 
With regard to commodities, in our last call, we reduced the estimated full 
year incremental impact of our Big 4 commodity cost on our results to $300 
million. Based on our latest forecast and hedge positions, we now expect our 
full year incremental cost
 
of commodities will come in at approximately $225 
million.
 
As for currencies, we previously provided an outlook that we would have an 
8% to 9% headwind on an operating income in the third quarter. Today, I 
can confirm that currency came in slightly better
 
than our initial outlook, 
resulting in a 7% headwind on third quarter comparable operating income. 
Based on our hedge positions, current spot rates and the cycling of our prior 
year rates, we continue to expect currencies to be a mid
-
single
-
digit 
headwind
 
on our operating income in both the fourth quarter and on a full 
year basis.
 
In closing, and as Muhtar said earlier, we are strategically and successfully 
advancing our global momentum while navigating through a challenging 
global economy. Our system is f
ocused on maximizing economic profit and 
long
-
term cash flow, which allows us to continue to reinvest in the business 
and anticipate changes in the marketplace and competitive dynamics. While 
we have made several important and strategic investments this ye
ar, our 
financial priorities remain the same. We'll reinvest in the core business. We 
still expect to spend around $3 billion in capital expenditures in 2012. We 
will strategically invest in acquisitions and partnerships, the strength in our 
bottling syste
m, and to increase our position in key nonalcoholic ready
-
to
-
drink growth categories.
 
We will continue to pay dividends. In 2012, we increased our quarterly 
dividend 8.5%, and we have returned $4.3 billion in dividends to 
shareholders in 2011. And 
further, we expect our Board of Directors to 
approve another quarterly dividend this week, which by the way will be paid 
in December of this year, as it has been every year since 1934.
 
And we'll continue to repurchase shares with excess cash. In our curren
t 
program, which we started in 2006, we've already repurchased 533 million 
shares at an average price of $31.17. Since our share repurchase program 
started in 1984, we have repurchased 2.9 billion shares at an average price 
of $12.55.
 
As a result of our st
rong cash flow and that of our bottlers, I remain very 
confident that we can continue to invest and deliver our long
-
term growth 
targets on a sustainable basis to achieve our 2020 Vision and deliver value 
to our shareowners. Operator, we're now ready for q
uestions.

Answer Session
 
Operator
 
Our first question today comes from Bill Pecoriello from Consumer Edge 
Research.
 
William Pecoriello 
-
 
Consumer Edge Research, LLC
 
Gary, you talked about the double
-
digit operating profit growth expected for 
Q4
 
versus the 4% year
-
to
-
date, I think it's something like 14% you need to 
hit the 6% lower end of the long
-
term range for the full year. I know you 
have the 2 extra days in the fourth quarter. You mentioned commodities 
were easing. Anything else about the t
iming of expenses in the fourth 
quarter versus year
-
to
-
date, as well as what you're lapping in the fourth 
quarter that'll explain the strength? I know last year's fourth quarter was 
strange, you had some of the timing differences related to the CCE 
transac
tion. So I don't know if that's also coming into play in the lap there.
 
Muhtar Kent
 
Bill, this is Muhtar. Let me just address a few of the things in your question, 
and then Gary will add some more commentary. First, I want to just ensure 
and stress that ou
r business momentum continues in the midst of ongoing 
global economic challenges. Our system is very well aligned and on track to 
achieve our 2020 Vision. And the appetite for investment by our bottling 
partners is strong as it has ever been. And consumers
' love for our brands is 
stronger than ever. And as such, we do remain confident in our ability to 
meet our long
-
term targets, while also delivering sustainable, profitable 
growth and value for our shareowners. With respect 
--
 
and so 
--
 
at the 
outset. With
 
respect to your question on the fourth quarter, let me 
--
 
as 
Gary said, we 
--
 
based on what we know today, we feel very confident that 
we can dock our ship for 2012, in line with our long
-
term growth targets for 
both top line and bottom in terms of operat
ing profit. And so as Gary 
mentioned, that will imply having a double
-
digit growth in our operating 
income for the fourth quarter. We feel confident that, that can be achieved 
based on what we know and based on current trends. And that is a host of 
reasons
; cycling of marketing expenses, as you saw total marketing for the 
company was up quite significantly in the fourth quarter. We had spend 
related to 
--
 
a onetime spend related to the Olympics, to the UEFA Cup, 
spending on our brands in a healthy way. And 
I think it is important to note 
that you can find many companies today around the world, around 
--
 
in the 
United States, around the world that can generate their profit line from no 
growth in top line. That is not sustainable. We feel very confident that w
e're 
doing the right thing for our business, right thing for our brand and we will 
dock our ship in 2012, yet again, in line with our long
-
term growth target, 
despite having 
--
 
facing significant commodity headwinds in both 2011 and 
cycling also on top of 
that, headwinds in 2012, investing in our brands, 
growing our top line and also earning our price/mix. So I'd like to just 
emphasize that, and pass it over to Gary.
 
Gary P. Fayard
 
Okay. Bill, a couple of things. As you mentioned, the 2 extra days helped 
si
gnificantly, most particularly in the finished products business, so both in 
North America and in BIG. And we saw the opposite impact of the 1 less day 
in the first quarter. So the 2 extra days helped significantly. There are quite 
a bit of cycling things.
 
And you see a lot of that cycling in the third quarter, 
which made the third quarter so complex, and that's why we try to give a lot 
of extra guidance at the end of the second quarter because of the third. But 
a lot of that is what we've been saying all y
ear, particularly about the North 
America business, how we would expect to see sequential improvement in 
the North America business. If you remember, just it went from minus 9 to 
even, now to plus 3, and you'll continue to see improvement in North 
America.
 
The easing of commodities is 
--
 
obviously is helping some, 
although a lot of that commodity now has come through, the easing has 
come through into the standard costs, but that's helping. And currency will 
help as well, in that the headwinds of currency fr
om the minus 7 in the third 
quarter to lower in the fourth quarter, not just on the translation of the 
results but the transactional impact, particularly inside of BIG where that 
currency owned 
--
 
the cost of their commodities or in their cost of goods, we
 
do not pull out our currency
-
neutral calculation. So the impact of currency 
does hurt BIG results, and so that will improve as well in the fourth quarter. 
So I think everything we're seeing 
--
 
the brands are healthy. We've taken 
pricing across the world, 
we've seen much better elasticities than what we've 
ever had historically, which give 
--
 
has given us a lot of optimism as well.

Our next question comes from Judy Hong from Goldman Sachs.
 
Judy E. Hong 
-
 
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division
 
Just in terms of North America, so it's nice to see the profitability of slight 
positively in the quarter. If you could just maybe talk about as you look 
2013, your ability to sort of sustain kind of a positive pricing mix. And also 
just color as it relate
s to some of the commentary on channel mix that 
you've alluded to in the last quarter where you continue to see that pressure 
in terms of shift towards take home versus immediate consumption and how 
that's kind of playing out so far.
 
Muhtar Kent
 
Sure. Judy
, let me address some of those. I'm very pleased with the 
performance of our United 
--
 
U.S. business. I think in terms of 
--
 
we've 
increased total beverage volume and value share in this past quarter once 
again, driven by the 2% overall volume growth, led 
by 7% growth in still 
beverages, while 
--
 
and also maintaining sparkling volume on a year
-
to
-
date 
basis. And this is, again, 10th quarter in a row of volume growth in our 
North America business. And I think we continue to build our occasion
-
based 
price, pa
ck, channel strategy that provides increased consumer choice, along 
with preferred packages, preferred price points, which is very important in 
this economic environment. We see also some more positive trends in the 
channel mix compared to last quarter. I 
think the overall convenience retail 
channel in the third quarter was stronger. Industry grew almost 
--
 
certainly 
above 4%, almost 5%. And we have not only taken significant pricing, 3% 
price/mix, up again in the quarter and maintained it for the full year
, but 
also we are focused very much on transactions getting pricing, maintaining 
share and growing transactions in the United States. That's the model. 
That's working. And specifically, we've got a great package in the 12.5 
ounce, which is retailing for un
der $1 in that channel, for example. And then 
also, we continue to expand in our food service channel with our innovative 
Freestyle. We will pass, for the first time this year the 10,000 mark in terms 
of dispensers deployed in this coming quarter, in the q
uarter that we're in, 
the fourth quarter. The average incidence lift there is more than 6%, the 
volume lift is significant, as well as revenue lift for the customer. So that's 
another very important point of reference in our business in the United 
States. 
And again our growth is led by strong performance with Coke Zero, 
up almost double digits in this past quarter, coming back very strongly, 
strong performance across multiple categories, such as POWERADE 
continuing, Gold Peak growing strong double digits, F
uze growing, 
smartwater, glacéau, Minute Maid, all growing in a very significant manner. 
So we feel confident that our North America strategies are working. We are 
focused on execution. We can always improve and strive for more, we 
always do. And we're opt
imistic about our outlook, despite the challenging 
competitive and macroeconomic backdrop. But important channels, we see 
better light coming through in some of the really important critical channels 
in the third quarter. I hope that's helpful.
 
Gary P. Fay
ard
 
Judy, it's Gary. On your 
--
 
the rest of your question, in 2013, we're going 
through business plans now. And on the year
-
end call, we'll give you an 
outlook on what we see, both for North America and rest of world, as well as 
--
 
because that will obviou
sly encompass things like commodities, 
currencies, et cetera. So we'll go through that at the end of the year. And 
--
 
but we can't do it today.
 
Muhtar Kent
 
And again, just to close the question, we feel confident about sequential 
improvement in this year a
nd the fourth quarter in the U.S. business in 
terms of results. And again, we feel that the strategies that we've deployed 
are working in the United States. We have invested. Our total marketing, 
again, in the United States in the quarter, and this past qu
arter is up. And 
also I would say to you that we feel that specifically also that the packaging 
strategies are working really well for us.

Our next question comes from Bryan Spillane from Bank of America.
 
Bryan D. Spillane 
-
 
BofA Merrill Lynch, Re
search Division
 
Just have a question regarding productivity in the productivity and 
reinvestment program. I guess one is just, Gary, if you could give us some 
idea of how much productivity is contributing to this year and kind of where 
you stand in terms o
f the 2015 target. And then, Muhtar, I think in your 
comments you talked about the new reporting lines and how that would help 
enable leveraging synergies. And so I just wanted to see if you could tie that 
comment back to the productivity and reinvestment 
program. Does it 
--
 
do 
the new reporting 
--
 
does the new reporting structure accelerate it? Does it 
increase, enhance it in some way? Just trying to get a sense of kind of where 
we stand on productivity.
 
Gary P. Fayard
 
Yes. Bryan, thanks. This is Gary. On 
the program just to remind everyone, 
what we announced earlier this year is a new productivity and reinvestment 
program from 2012 through 2015. And $550 million to $650 million 
composed of quite a few different focus areas. And we would take all of the 
pro
ductivity that we realize, and then take that and reinvest it back behind 
-
-
 
into the brands. We have started. We're well on the way. In fact, I can tell 
you that I have a sightline today to where we can achieve the entire target, 
so it's not an issue at a
ll on achieving. Relative to the current year, I would 
say it's probably in the $40 million to $50 million range that's already been 
achieved and reflected in the results or will be in this year. So it's already 
flowing through. And we're doing, I think, r
eally well. Just to remind 
everyone, the focus areas were around supply chain optimization, around 
marketing and innovation effectiveness, around operational excellence, 
which leads to OpEx leverage and around standardizing data and IT 
systems, where place
s where you can really get a lot of leverage, and then 
take that and reinvest it behind the brands. Muhtar?
 
Muhtar Kent
 
Yes. And again, Bryan, in terms of the structure, I think we have a new 
leadership structure that is going to be leaner, more effective, more flexible 
structure; and that is going to drive a further, I believe, enhancement in our 
productivity initiatives. 
Gary and Ahmet Bozer and Irial and Steve and 
myself will be 
--
 
in terms of looking at these productivity initiatives, feel 
confident. And as Gary can see the 
--
 
have sight in the numbers and in the 
productivity being achieved, I think that we will certainl
y be looking at what 
we can do to enhance it even further. As you know, we came in, in the last 
productivity cycle for the past 3 years significantly over our targets, and we 
feel that we have again room to improve always. And also, as Gary said, 
important
ly, while we deliver our results, this allows us to continue to invest 
successfully and making our brands even stronger. That is the key, and 
that's what you should always be looking for and that's what we always look 
for.

Our next question comes 
from Bill Schmitz with Deutsche Bank.
 
William Schmitz 
-
 
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division
 
Can you just sort of circle the square for me here? So you had great organic 
growth in both Latin America and Eurasia with terrific price and mix. But 
those are the
 
2 regions where you had the biggest margin compression. So 
is that really just sort of year
-
over
-
year comparisons and maybe some of the 
FX transaction here? Because you would have thought that with that kind of 
growth, perhaps the margins would have been 
a little bit better.
 
Muhtar Kent
 
Just very quickly on that. I'll tell you, first, we had very significant marketing 
spend in our international operations and total company for the third 
quarter. Our total marketing was up double digits for our internationa
l 
operations. And I think that again, that is partly cycling from prior year, 
particularly in certain geographic areas. But also it was to do with the 
onetime spend related to the Olympics, related to brand building around the 
UEFA Cup, particularly for Eu
rope, but also for Eurasia, as well as for Latin 
America. So I think you need to take it into that context, from the 
perspective of marketing spend, cycling and prior year comparisons. And I'll 
see if Gary wants to add anything to that.
 
Gary P. Fayard
 
Yes,
 
one thing I would add, and I don't know if this is directly responsive to 
your question, but when I made a few comments in the prepared remarks 
about volume and how we have different business models like the Innocent, 
Aujan, et cetera. So you've got some 
volume in Eurasia this quarter, for 
example. So if you look at the table in the release, if I remember correctly, it 
would show that Eurasia and Africa's volume, volumes up 11% and 
comparable currency
-
neutral operating income is up 11% as well. So you're 
n
ot seeing a lot of leverage in that. If you 
--
 
but remember, there is no 
income in there related to Aujan. It's sitting down in equity income, but the 
volume is in that 11%. So if you adjust for that, Eurasia, Africa actually has 
some really nice operating
 
leverage within their P&L. And so on operating 
margins, they're actually sitting in a really nice place for the quarter and 
year
-
to
-
date. So and then on Latin America, I don't think anything really 
unusual at all. I think they just continue to hum along a
s they have for the 
last number of years. And there's nothing other than we continue to invest 
in Latin America because it's such a great, great, strong market.
 
Muhtar Kent
 
One other thing about Latin America, just want to add context is in the 
--
 
a 
couple
 
of years ago, we had this discussion. And many were questioning 
Latin America's ability to continue grow. And I always said, ""Latin America is 
just beginning its journey in still beverages."" The key is to have balanced 
growth. Still beverages, though, gro
wing, of course, from a very small base 
at a higher rate of growth than sparkling beverages. But I think there's 
--
 
Latin America is a great model for how we can continue to grow at even high 
per capita as for sparkling beverages entering into new categori
es. And I 
think that is adding tremendous value to our business and also tremendous 
strength to our bottom line as we continue to progress in Latin America. 
We're cycling a very strong quarter from Latin America last year and we still 
achieved 5% and gener
ating very healthy returns.
 
Gary P. Fayard
 
Yes. The only 

I'd add one other thing as well. We're probably starting to 
give you too much detail. But within the quarter in Latin America 
--
 
in Brazil 
actually, they started making 
--
 
we started making our init
ial investments 
around the 2014 World Cup. That's in marketing. And while in absolute 
dollars it's not that big, it will continue. But in fact, it does have an impact of 
1 point or 2 points on the leverage that you're seeing in Latin America. So I 
guess, a
ll in, what we're saying is we are continuing to invest in the brands. 
We're investing well ahead of the curve. We're getting ready for 2014 World 
Cup. It's flowing through in the third quarter. And you'll see it flow
-
through 
next quarter as well because w
e're going to make sure that we do these 
things right.

Our next question comes from John Faucher with JPMorgan.
 
John A. Faucher 
-
 
JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division
 
In taking a look at the price/mix number, obviously didn't come in as 
strongl
y as we've anticipated in Europe and the Pacific. Can you talk a little 
bit about what's driving those price/mix numbers and sort of how you see 
that playing out over the next couple of quarters?
 
Gary P. Fayard
 
Yes. Thanks, John. Let's go to Europe first. 
And there, I think, price/mix was 
negative 4, and there are a couple of things going on there. But I'd say it's 
primarily actually the economic condition of Europe. And we've been seeing 
this flow through for some time now. So I think it's kind of the new 
normal 
until we start seeing some more favorable results. But what you're seeing is 
go to Madrid and what you 
--
 
and look at the cafes, and there aren't a lot of 
people sitting around drinking cokes or coffee or whatever. It is a shift in 
consumer spending
 
in Europe from immediate consumption much more to 
future consumption. So while we grew our volume across the region or 
across each of the business units, there is a shift, and it's all about the 
macroeconomic environment that we're dealing with. So we fee
l very 
confident because people continue to love the brands. They continue to buy 
the brands. They are just buying them in more of a take home because 
they're not going out. So it's the macros that are impacting that. And 
additionally, if you look at the g
rowth rates, there's negative geographic 
price/mix in Europe as well, just look at the growth rates. Europe and 
Central and Southern Europe grew faster than Spain and Northwest Europe. 
So that's some of it as well. And we're cycling through the tax increas
e in 
France. So it's all of those kinds of things together. Don't expect to see it get 
worse. I think we're kind of at the bottom now and should be okay. Relative 
to price/mix in the Pacific, I think your initial reaction would probably be, 
""Oh my God, it'
s minus 6."" And your initial reaction is probably that it's all 
China. Well, it's not actually. A lot of it is actually because if you look at 
cases and gallons while, as I said in the prepared remarks, that gallons are 
slightly about 0.5 point ahead of ca
ses in the quarter, in Japan, where Japan 
volume was up 2, gallons were actually down 2. And it's normal and it'll be 
fine at the end of the year. But that's 4
-
point swing in Japan, which as a 
very high profit per gallon market causes significant price/mix
, negative 
price/mix, and that's a large part of what we're seeing in the Pacific. It's not 
a big deal. I think Japan was, I think, pretty much in line year
-
to
-
date and 
will be full year.
 
John A. Faucher

JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division
 
Got it, th
at's great. And then if I can just ask a follow
-
up on the 
--
 
particularly on the Spain piece of this, which is are you guys running on a 
straight incidence pricing model then in Spain? Because that negative 
channel mix would probably 
--
 
I'm trying to figur
e out how that's impacting 
you so quickly unless you're providing either a, you're on a straight 
incidence, in which case the channel mix would hit you immediately? Or are 
you providing a little extra funding into the bottlers in terms of trying to help 
th
em get through this?
 
Muhtar Kent
 
John, the primary reason, I'd say probably 70% 
--
 
this is Muhtar, 70% of the 
mix in Europe is geographic, related to the fact that lower price regions like 
Germany and Eastern Europe and Central Europe were growing faster t
han 
some of the other regions in Europe that have a higher pricing like France, 
like England, and that has really 
--
 
and like Spain. Spain has one of the 
highest prices in Europe. And so that has had the biggest contributing factor. 
One of the reasons for 
that was very unseasonable weather in Northern 
Europe during half of the quarter. It's never been wetter than 
--
 
in history 
than this 

 
than the beginning of the quarter for 2.5 
--
 
2 months, 1.5 
months, half of the quarter in Northern Europe. So that is co
ming back, and 
we feel that, that is one of the primary reasons. As we have more balanced 
growth in Europe, which we expect will happen, and as Gary said, we feel 
that it's not going to get any worse than it is and it may even 
--
 
and even in 
these conditio
ns, we can generate growth and crack the calculus for growth, 
then we feel that, that will certainly be coming back quite significantly. Spain 
remains today, on a net revenue per unit case basis, the highest in Europe. 
So I just want to make sure that thos
e 
--
 
that commentary gets through.

Our next question comes from Caroline Levy from CLSA.

Obviously, my concern is defin
itely around China. And just I'm just 
wondering how margins in the Pacific would not be impacted by what's 
happening in China. Can you just dig a little deeper? Was there 
--
 
did you 
have increased promotional activity in China during the quarter? Or should
 
we expect that in the next period? Just as we know the competitive 
environment there has got more 
--
 
both more price competitive and there's 
more distribution for Pepsi brands there.
 
Muhtar Kent
 
Well firstly, I mean I think, Caroline, on China, we are confident in our ability 
to continue growing in China, in this important market despite the changing, 
as you mentioned, competitive landscape and softness 
--
 
comparative 
softness in the macro conditi
ons. And our transactions are up a healthy 7% 
in the past quarter. We have said it before in previous quarters that we're 
focused on transactions and that's the health of the business in China. And 
certainly, we're driving transactions in a very favorable 
way. Year
-
to
-
date, 
volume is a solid 6% and our brands are very strong. We have a clear 
leadership position in the sparkling category, and I have total confidence in 
both our bottling partners, COFCO and Swire beverages and Bottling 
Investment Group were t
o continue to deliver. You have noted from previous 
calls that on a total comparative basis, relative basis, China's contribution to 
profit is less than its contribution to volume in the Pacific Group for a 
number of reasons. One is because we've got much 
more developed 
countries that have much bigger margins for like, of course, Japan, but like 
also Australasia. And therefore, it is 
--
 
the impact 
--
 
even if we were to 
promote in China and not that, again, we feel it's a rational environment. 
But even if we
 
were to promote, it would not have significant impact on the 
results of the Pacific Group, simply because of the size and scale of the profit 
pools that are generated out of markets like Japan and out of markets like 
Australasia. And again, given the size
 
of our Japan profit pool in the Pacific 
Group, what Gary mentioned is the primary cause of that, which is an 
increase in volume, 2%, but a commensurate decrease at the same percent 
point in actually concentrate shipments.

Our final question today
 
comes from Mark Swartzberg with Stifel, Nicolaus.

Muhtar, I was hoping we could talk a little bit more about North America c
-
stores, and I had 2 questions there. Firstly, on the 
sparkling part of your 
portfolio, can you give us a little more detail on what's going on with some 
of the smaller pack sizes? I think they were having some difficulty in the 
second quarter. What's happening there? And also within sparkling in c
-
stores com
peting products, with Mountain Dew spending a lot more, what's 
your strategy versus that particular brand with your portfolio? So that's on 
the sparkling side. And then can you just give us an update on the energy 
segment sequentially in c
-
stores?
 
Muhtar K
ent
 
Yes, I think in terms of 
--
 
firstly, the good news is that there is more 
positives to talk about the c
-
store channel in the quarter than in the first half 
of the year, we feel. And certainly, it is also important to note that we 
aggressively led the in
dustry on competition and pricing in the channel. And 
also that the industry grew at around just under 
--
 
shy of 5% roughly in the 
channel. And we led the pricing. And we have, again, very healthy growth in 
transactions. And we held share in the channel an
d of course in total market. 
And in terms of packaging, our variety of packages starting with the entry 
pack of 12.5 ounce is really working well for us at the entry price of under 
$1. And then that puts us 
--
 
our 16 ounce significantly ahead of competitio
n 
and pricing at $1.19 and so on and so forth. So I would say we are very 
confident and very pleased with the progress that we have in that channel as 
we have in the Foodservice channel where we see increased traffic coming 
through, particularly in the lat
ter part of the quarter. And then in energy, 
you asked, we had double
-
digit volume growth. Our brands were up and 
gained volume and value share in the energy channel, in 
--
 
which is 
primarily the c
-
store, the convenient store channel. But also I'd say that
 
our 
variety of packages, including the mini cans, 8.5 ounce mini cans and all the 
way through the 1.25 liter combined with the 2
-
liter, et cetera, are working 
really well for us in the future consumption channel as well.

So it sounds like Mountain Dew 
--
 
of all the things competitively happening 
in c
-
stores, Mountain Dew is not, on the margin, a big impact on your 
business, at least for now?
 
Muhtar Kent
 
I wouldn't want to comment on competit
ion. I just would say that I think it's 
healthy for everyone.
 
So thank you Gary and Jackson. And in closing, we had a strong third 
quarter, have again delivered quality year
-
to
-
date performance results. Our 
business continues to grow even in the midst of g
lobal economic challenges. 
Our system is clearly aligned, on track to achieve our 2020 Vision. The 
appetite for investment by our bottling partners is as strong as it's ever 
been. And together we, as a system, continue to invest in our brands on a 
global s
cale through world
-
class marketing and also through world
-
class 
commercial strategies. And as a result, consumers' love for our brands is 
stronger than ever. As always, we thank you for your interest and your 
investment in our company and for joining us th
is morning.

Relations Officer. Mr. Kelly, you may begin.
 
Jackson Kelly
 
Good morning, and thank you for being with us today. I'm joined by Muhtar 
Kent, our Chairman and Chief Executiv
e Officer; and Gary Fayard, our Chief

luding statements concerning long
-

at we have posted schedules on our

Now I'll turn the call over to Muht
ar.
 
Muhtar Kent
 
Thank you, Jackson, and good morning, everyone. Let me begin by saying 
that I'm pleased with our second quarter and year
-
to
-
date results. We're 
delivering consistent top line performance in line with our 2020 Vision and 
long
-
term growth tar
gets despite an increasingly unpredictable global 
economy. Our business realized solid top line results this past quarter, 
growing worldwide volume by 4% in the quarter and 5% year
-
to
-
date. Our 
second quarter comparable currency neutral net revenue was up 
7% in the 
quarter, driven by solid price mix of 3%. Year
-
to
-
date, comparable currency 
neutral net revenue was also up 7% and our comparable currency neutral 
operating income also grew 7% in the quarter, raising our year
-
to
-
date 
operating income growth to 6
%.
 
We once again led industry growth, extending our volume and value share 
gains globally in nonalcoholic ready
-
to
-
drink beverages. We gained global 
share in the sparkling beverage category, where our portfolio is now up 3% 
year
-
to
-
date. This was driven by
 
the global growth of brand Coca
-
Cola, 
which is also up a healthy 3% year
-
to
-
date. We gained global share in the 
still beverages category, where our portfolio grew a solid 9% in both the 
quarter as well as year
-
to
-
date.
 
Importantly, we delivered these resu
lts while further enhancing the well
-
being of the communities and customers we proudly serve and the 
consumers whose lives we touch each and every day. During today's call as 
we discuss our performance, I'll also share a few of the meaningful ways we 
are s
erving our communities across our geographic operations, as these 
efforts are an integral part of realizing and sustaining our 2020 Vision.
 
We recognize that consumers across the globe continue to feel the effects 
and impacts of prolonged uncertainty in Eu
rope, the further cooling of the 
economy in China and a protracted recovery here in the United States. 
Despite this, our consistent quality performance results, as well as our 
systems commitment to invest in the business for long
-
term growth, give us 
confi
dence that we have the right strategies and the right plans in place to 
deliver full year 2012 results that meet our long
-
term growth targets, for in 
times like these, there is no better industry to be in than the nonalcoholic 
ready
-
to
-
drink beverage indus
try. We're proud to be part of a strong and 
growing industry that passionately serves millions of outlets and refreshes 
billions of consumers every single day.
 
Now let us review our performance results across our global markets in more 
detail, beginning wi
th our flagship market, North America, where this past 
quarter, our business delivered its ninth consecutive quarter of growth, up 
1% for both the quarter as well as year
-
to
-
date. Importantly, we achieved 
this growth in North America while sustaining a pos
itive 3% price mix for our 
total beverage business. And in the process, we once again captured value 
share in nonalcoholic ready
-
to
-
drink beverages this quarter, consistent with 
our focus on driving profitable growth in North America. This growth was led 
b
y our still beverage portfolio, which was up 8% this quarter, gaining both 
volume and value share across nearly all of the categories in which we 
compete.
 
In sports drinks, POWERADE once again grew double
-
digits this quarter, 
while also capturing volume an
d value share. This marks the third 
consecutive quarter in which POWERADE has led the North America sports 
drink category in absolute unit case volume growth.
 
Our glacéau brands, up 5% this quarter, also captured share, driven by the 
further momentum of vi
taminwater zero, up high single
-
digits, as well as by 
another quarter of double
-
digit growth for smartwater. In addition, 
smartwater began using PlantBottle packaging this past May, as we further 
leverage this proprietary, innovative and sustainable packag
ing that we 
launched nationally with our DASANI water brand last year. Speaking of 
DASANI, this brand provided yet another quarter of double
-
digit growth in 
North America, delivering both volume and value share gains.
 
The acceleration of our tea portfolio 
in North America also continued this 
quarter, up double
-
digits while gaining both volume and value share. This 
result was led by Gold Peak, which has now grown double
-
digits for 21 
consecutive quarters.
 
Finally, our juice and juice drink portfolio in North
 
America was up 3%, led 
by high single
-
digit growth for our Simply brands, as well as mid
-
single
-
digit 
growth for our Minute Maid brands. These results solidify our share 
leadership in the high
-
value, 100% chilled orange juice segment.
 
Our sparkling bevera
ges in North America was down 2% in our second 
quarter, in line with the broader sparkling beverage industry's results during 
the same April to June time frame. Importantly, our sparkling beverage 
portfolio earned a positive 5% price mix this quarter in a 
rational pricing 
environment. We also sustained our momentum behind both Coke Zero and 
Fanta, with both these brands up mid
-
single
-
digits this quarter. We're 
particularly pleased to see this continued solid growth for Coke Zero in North 
America, considerin
g that this brand's baseline was built off of 5 consecutive 
years of double
-
digit growth.
 
This winning track record reflects our commitment to sustainable innovation 
that delivers year
-
over
-
year growth. And Coca
-
Cola's brand equity scores 
keep improving, w
ith Coca
-
Cola's favorite brand score among the total U.S. 
population up when compared to a year ago. This favorite brand score for 
Coca
-
Cola is now nearly 2x greater than the score of its primary competitor. 
Finally, our Coca
-
Cola Freestyle fountain dispen
ser, which recently won the 
Gold Innovation Award from the National Automatic Merchandising 
Association, is now available in more than 4,400 outlets across North 
America.
 
One of the many ways we've consistently served our communities in North 
America is th
rough our investments in initiatives that promote physical 
activity and well
-
being. A good example is how we are encouraging physical 
activity through our Sprite Spark Parks Project. Launched in 2011, this 
project has supported the construction and refurbi
shment of more than 150 
neighborhood parks, athletic fields and basketball courts. We're also 
partnering with the National Foundation for Governors' Fitness Councils and 
the American College of Sports Medicine to build gyms in schools across the 
country. L
ast month, we announced that we will dedicate $5 million to 
provide 100 communities with new fitness centers for schools. While our 
commitment to our communities both in North America, as well as across 
the globe, goes well beyond just physical activity pr
ograms, we will always 
encourage our consumers to be healthy and active and provide them with 
opportunities to do so. This is at the heart of our brand values.
 
In summary, we have every reason to remain optimistic about the long
-
term 
outlook for this marke
t, which has the best demographics of the developed 
world and remains an unparalleled center of innovation and entrepreneurial 
activity.
 
Now let me turn to our Pacific Group, which grew 8% in both the quarter 
and year
-
to
-
date, including 6% year
-
to
-
date gro
wth for brand Coca
-
Cola. 
Additionally, our Pacific Group captured both volume and value share in 
nonalcoholic beverages this quarter.
 
During our last earnings call, we shared our expectations that our volume 
growth in China might moderate to some extent as
 
our business would not 
be immune to China's cooling economy. In fact, China's GDP growth rate is 
at a 3
-
year low, yet still above 7%. As anticipated, the broader beverage 
industry in China has felt the impact of this economic slowdown. Despite 
this, our b
usiness in China delivered 7% growth in the second quarter, while 
cycling a strong 21% growth from last year. Year
-
to
-
date growth in China 
was a solid 8%, cycling 17% from last year.
 
The rightsized packaging efforts we put in place in China last year keep 
generating consistent, strong incremental transactions, in line with our 
expectations. As such, both sparkling beverage and total beverage 
transactions were up double
-
digits for both the quarter as well as year
-
to
-
date in China. And importantly, we once ag
ain captured both volume and 
value share in the sparkling category 
--
 
beverage category in China this past 
quarter.
 
We're very excited about our opportunities in this region. Our clear focus on 
building our business for sustainable growth provides us with 
confidence that 
China will continue to serve as a double
-
digit growth market over the long 
term.
 
Our business in Japan delivered yet another quarter of strong growth, with 
volume up 4%, bringing our year
-
to
-
date growth in this important critical 
market to 
up to 4% as well on a year
-
to
-
date basis. Importantly, these 
results in Japan were broad
-
based, with growth seen across all channels, 
including convenience stores as well as vending. And our Japan business 
gained both volume and value share in the nonalcoh
olic ready
-
to
-
drink 
beverage category this quarter. So looking ahead, we expect our third 
quarter volume results in Japan to moderate below our 4% year
-
to
-
date 
trend as we enter what is forecasted to be a cooler summer season when 
compared to last summer's
 
historically record hot temperatures. Having said 
that, we remain confident that our system in Japan is well aligned and in a 
strong position to deliver full year low single
-
digit growth in 2012.
 
I also want to update our results in Thailand. Our business
 
in this market 
sustained its solid momentum, growing over 20% for both the quarter and 
year
-
to
-
date. In the process, we gained volume and value share in Thailand 
across nonalcoholic ready
-
to
-
drink beverages, as well as in both sparkling 
and still beverage
 
categories. We are excited about the future growth 
opportunities in Thailand, and we'll keep investing for the future in this 
vibrant market.
 
As for the Philippines, we just celebrated the 100th anniversary of our entry 
into this market. 
Importantly, we again captured volume and value share in 
nonalcoholic beverages in the Philippines and have grown our volume mid
-
single
-
digits for both the quarter as well as year
-
to
-
date.
 
We launched our 5 BY 20 program in the Philippines almost exactly 1
 
year 
ago. As background, this program is our global initiative to enable the 
economic empowerment of 5 million women entrepreneurs by 2012 
--
 
2020. 
In the Philippines, we are working with local partners to implement a pilot 
business skills training progra
m, and we are now in the process of scaling up 
this program nationwide to economically empower 100,000 women store 
owners and operators by 2020. We believe there is no better investment we 
can make to spur economic growth and foster sustainable development
.
 
Moving now to Latin America. Our volume grew 3% for the quarter and is up 
4% year
-
to
-
date. This growth was once again led by brand Coca
-
Cola, up 
3% year
-
to
-
date. In the process, we once again captured both volume and 
value share in nonalcoholic ready
-
to
-
drink beverages in Latin America, as 
well as share gains in both sparkling and still beverages.
 
In Mexico, our volume growth in the quarter was up 1% as we cycled a very 
strong 10% growth from previous year. This brings our year
-
to
-
date volume 
growth in Me
xico to 2%, while cycling 12% from last year. Importantly, we 
once again outperformed the beverage industry in Mexico, capturing 
nonalcoholic ready
-
to
-
drink beverage volume and value share, as well as in 
sparkling and still beverages.
 
In Brazil, our busine
ss continued to deliver solid results, with volume growth 
up 6% in the quarter and 5% year
-
to
-
date. And our business in Brazil is also 
driving industry growth, gaining both volume and value share in nonalcoholic 
beverages, as well as again in sparkling and
 
still beverages. Looking ahead, 
we expect our 2012 growth results in Brazil to hold steady at low to single

Our Eu
rasia & Africa business extended its momentum, growing a strong 
12% in the quarter and 11% year

growth for brand Coca
-
Cola. This group's overall performance was once 
again led by India, which grew a strong 20% for 
both the quarter and year
-
to

date, delivering balanced and consistent growth across all beverage 
categories. Sparkling beverage growth in India was led by brand Coca
-
Cola, 
up 35% in the quarter and 32% year
-
to
-
date. In still beverages in India, our 
Maaza j
uice brand was up over 30% in both quarter and year

importantly, our business in India captured volume and value share in 
nonalcoholic ready

beverages.
 
I was recently in India, where we a
nnounced our systems plan to increase 
investments in India by $3 billion, bringing total system investments to $5 
billion between now and 2020. These investments will drive innovation and 
enable our efforts to deliver a portfolio that enhances the consumer
 
experience and builds brand loyalty to deliver long
-
term sustainable growth.
 
Russia was up 9% this quarter, raising our year

to

date growth to 7%. The 
steady acceleration of our business in Russia was once again led by the 
strong momentum of brand Coca
-
Co
la, which grew 23% in the quarter and 
is now up 22% year
-
to
-
date. Similarly, strong results were also observed 
across our broader sparkling portfolio as Fanta and Sprite both registered 
double
-
digit growth this past quarter in Russia. And our Dobriy juice 
brand 
delivered 12% growth in the quarter, bringing this brand's year
-
to
-
date 
results to double digits. As a result, our overall business in Russia keeps 
outperforming the rest of the industry, gaining nonalcoholic ready
-
to
-
drink 
beverage volume and value 
share.
 
We also saw robust growth across the rest of Eurasia & Africa region this 
quarter, including double
-
digit growth in South Africa and the Middle East, as 
well as North Africa region.
 
Lastly, we finalized our acquisition of approximately half the equi
ty of Aujan 
Industries this past quarter. As a reminder, Aujan holds the #1 position in 
the still beverage business across the entire Middle East. Between our solid 
performance, the strength of our bottling partners and our new partnership 
with Aujan, it i
s easy to see why we are so excited about the future of our 
business in this dynamic part of the world.
 
Moving now to Europe, where our volume was down 4% for the quarter, 
cycling strong 5% growth from last year. As a result, our business in Europe 
is now 
down 2% on a year
-
to
-
date basis, cycling 3% growth from prior year. 
This past quarter, Europe was challenged by both historically unseasonable 
inclement weather as well as ongoing macro uncertainties. Despite this, our 
business in Europe held share in nona
lcoholic ready
-
to
-
drink beverages, as 
well as sparkling beverages, while capturing both volume and value share in 
still beverages. Germany remains the bright spot in this region, up 1% for 
the quarter and 2% on a year
-
to
-
date basis. This marks Germany's si
xth 
consecutive quarter of positive growth. Importantly, we once again captured 
volume and value share in ready

drink beverages. This serves as a solid 
evidence that we have the right brands, the right strategies and the right 
capabilities in place to d
eliver long

term sustainable growth in this critically 
important market.
 
We recently concluded our highly successful activation of the UEFA Euro 
2012 football tournament. In recent consumer surveys, Coca
-
Cola was 
overwhelmingly recognized as the tournament
's primary brand sponsor, with 
this brand awareness translating into volume and value share gains in the 
tournament's host nations.
 
We're also very excited about the special opportunity to grow the value of 
our brands even further through our investment in
 
the 2012 London 
Summer Olympics. From a brand standpoint, we shared our last quarter 
--
 
we shared last quarter how our Olympics Move to the Beat program has 
been launched globally and activated in over 100 markets. Additionally to 
brand Coca
-
Cola, we're l
everaging this unique platform to activate and fully 
integrate a global Olympic POWERADE program in more than 35 markets 
across 
--
 
all across the world. This will be POWERADE's first global activation 
program since its launch 20 years ago at the 1992 Barce
lona Olympic 
Games.
 
And in keeping with our LIVE POSITIVELY culture, we've placed our 
commitment to sustainable communities at the heart of our Olympic 
activation efforts. This year, we're offering the widest range of drinks and 
sizes ever to be made avail
able at the Olympic Games, and we have pledged 
that all bottles collected at the Olympic Games venues will be recycled and 
back on shelves within a short 6 weeks. We have also updated the labels for 
our Coca
-
Cola packages to present consumers with a clear 
recycling call to 
action. And we've also created more than 120 permanent Coca
-
Cola Recycle 
Zones all across Great Britain.
 
Before closing, let me say how pleased we are with this past quarter when 
Coca
-
Cola was recognized as the #1 brand by CoreBrand, base
d on a survey 
tracking the corporate brands of 1,000 companies across 54 industries. This 
is the 11th straight year we have received this honor, is especially gratifying 
since CoreBrand's rankings are based on a poll of 10,000 business 
professionals with r
ankings based on brand familiarity, reputation, 
perception of management, as well as investment potential.
 
While all of us at The Coca
-
Cola Company are proud of our performance 
year
-
to
-
date, we believe that our best days are still ahead. Our 2020 Vision 
pr
ovides our system with a clear road map for growth. Our consistent quality 
volume, value and profit results demonstrate that our global bottling system 
is very well
-
aligned and poised for execution. As we look ahead for the 
balance of this year, we underst
and that consumers still face an 
unpredictable environment. Having said that, we remain confident that we 
have the well
-
loved brands, vision and road map with our global bottling 
partners to effectively navigate today's environment.
 
We will continue to pas
sionately refresh a thirsty world. We will do so by 
offering a growing choice of quality beverages that refresh and hydrate our 
consumers while bringing them simple moments of happiness. We will do so 
by sustaining our commitments to communities and to the
 
many well
-
being 
initiatives we support. And we will do so by ensuring that we always place 
our highest priority on creating sustainable value for our consumers, for our 
customers and for our shareholders.
 
With that, let me now turn the call over to Gary.
 
Gary P. Fayard
 
Thanks, Muhtar, and good morning, everyone. We delivered solid results this 
quarter, demonstrating once again that despite an unpredictable 
environment, our global system is well positioned to execute our strategic 
plans in alignment with ou
r 2020 Vision.
 
Let me start with our comparable earnings per share, which came in at 
$1.22 this quarter, up 4% versus the prior year. This raises our year
-
to
-
date 
comparable earnings per share growth to 4% as well. Our comparable 
currency neutral operating
 
income was up 7% this quarter, increasing our 
year
-
to
-
date comparable currency neutral operating income to 6%. On a 
comparable basis, the impact of currency on this quarter's operating income 
results was a 5% headwind. Comparable currency neutral net reve
nues grew 
7% this quarter, including a 3% increase in concentrate sales and a 3% 
positive price mix. The currency impact from this quarter's comparable net 
revenue results was a 4% headwind. On a year
-
to
-
date basis, our 
comparable currency neutral net reve
nue growth held steady at 7%.
 
We also maintained our consolidated price mix at a positive 3% this quarter. 
In fact, we realized positive price mix across every one of our geographic 
operating groups this quarter. Looking ahead, we will cycle higher price m
ix 
comparisons during the back half of 2012, which will lead to lower 
consolidated price mix results in the third and fourth quarters. Having said 
that, we continue to expect our full year 2012 consolidated price mix results 
to come in between 1% and 2%, i
n line with our long
-
term target range.
 
Our gross margins softened a little further this past quarter, particularly in 
late May and June. This sequential trend is being driven by both ongoing 
currency headwinds, as well as by changing 
--
 
changes in channel
 
and 
package mix across markets, as today's economic conditions are leading 
consumers to temporarily shift their channel and package preferences. As 
we look ahead, we anticipate that these currency and mix shift headwinds 
will continue through 2012. As suc
h, we now expect our full year 2012 
comparable gross margin to come in below our second quarter gross margin, 
with this headwind primarily observed in the third quarter of 2012. Despite 
this, we remain confident in our ability to deliver full year comparab
le 
currency neutral operating income growth in line with our long
-
term growth 
targets.
 
Our comparable currency neutral SG&A expenses were up 5% in both the 
quarter and year
-
to
-
date. These results include an overall increase in year
-
to
-
date direct marketing
 
expenses, as we sustain our commitment to invest 
in the health and the strength of our brands. Our operating expense 
leverage once again came in positive this quarter, bringing our year
-
to
-
date 
operating expense leverage up to 1 point, in line with our pr
eviously stated 
outlook. We now expect our third quarter operating expense leverage to 
range between a negative 3 and negative 5 points. However, this pressure 
on operating expense leverage is expected to reverse in the fourth quarter, 
especially as we ben
efit from having 2 additional selling days in the fourth 
quarter, and enabling us to achieve slightly positive operating expense 
leverage on a full year basis.
 
Our net interest came in even in the second quarter, exactly in line with the 
outlook we provide
d in our last earnings call. This held our year
-
to
-
date net 
interest income at $27 million. We now expect our net interest to come in as 
a slight expense in the back half of the year, primarily due to expected lower 
rates in some of our international locat
ions, as well as ongoing currency 
headwinds. As a result, we are now updating our full year net interest 
income outlook to $10 million to $20 million, with the net interest expense 
we sense 
--
 
that we see in the second half of 2012 evenly spread between 
th
e third and fourth quarter.
 
Our underlying effective tax rate now stands at 24%, which is an 
improvement over the 24.8% rate we communicated during our last 
earnings call. And we expect to be able to carry this 24% tax rate through 
the remainder of this ye
ar and into next year. And our cash flow from 
operations increased a very strong 15% year
-
to
-
date.
 
Our year
-
to
-
date net share repurchases total $1.6 billion. This places us well 
on track to achieve the $2.5
-
billion to $3
-
billion range for full year 2012 th
at 
we communicated at the outset of this year. With regard to commodities, in 
our last call, we said we expected the full year 2012 incremental impact of 
our big 4 commodity cost on our results to range between $350 million and 
$450 million. We also said t
hat if current trends held, we could see this 
outlook slowly improve. Today, I can confirm, based on our latest forecast, 
we now expect our full year incremental cost on commodities to come in 
closer to $300 million.
 
As for currencies, we previously provid
ed an outlook that they would have a 
mid
-
single
-
digit negative impact on our full year operating income. Today, 
we are still seeing the dollar strengthen against other currencies, including 
many of those that we do not traditionally hedge, that is not effe
ct 
--
 
because it's not effective to do so due to the high cost associated with these 
hedges. As such and based on our hedge positions, current spot rates and 
the cycling of our prior year rates, we expect currencies to have an 8% to 
9% negative impact on o
perating income in the third quarter. In addition, 
we now expect the full year impact of currencies on our operating income to 
be a headwind at the high end of the previously communicated mid
-
single
-
digit range.
 
And there's one housekeeping item to 
keep in mind as you update your 
models. Our shareowners recently approved a 2
-
for
-
1 stock split, which will 
double the number of outstanding shares in August.
 
In closing, as we reach this halfway point of 2012, we find ourselves 
navigating through a challe
nging global economy. The recovery in the United 
States remains moderate and consumer sentiment is still challenged. 
Consumers in Europe are feeling the effects of that region's prolonged 
macroeconomic uncertainty. And the economy in China, while still gro
wing, 
continues to demonstrate signs of cooling.
 
But it's important to put today's challenges and our business results in the 
proper perspective, for while consumers may be feeling some pressure in 
these markets, we continue to execute with excellence. We 
are earning price 
and gaining value share in North America while sequentially improving 
profitability. We're holding our share in Europe while investing in our brands 
for long
-
term growth. And we're delivering double
-
digit transactions growth 
in China as w
e solidify our leadership across multiple categories in this 
growing market.
 
The bottom line is that we are successfully managing our business for the 
long
-
term while delivering consistent and solid top line and bottom line 
results. Our system is healthy a
nd is financially strong as ever, generating 
solid cash flow and investing to support our world
-
class portfolio of brands. 
We are also investing across the globe to support the long
-
term health and 
well
-
being of our communities, customers and consumers. An
d importantly, 
we continue to reward our shareowners, prudently managing our 
investments to deliver quality results while also paying a healthy dividend.
 
So as we look ahead to the rest of 2012 and a protracted and unpredictable 
economic recovery, we are e
ncouraged by our consistent results, as well as 
by our faith in our 2020 Vision, and remain confident in our ability to deliver 
full year volume, revenue and operating income results in line with our long
-
term growth targets. Operator, we're now ready for 
the questions, please.

Consumer Edge Research.
 
William Pecoriello

Consumer Edge Research, LLC
 
Muhtar, considering the tough global macroecon
omic backdrop, your Q2 
results were certainly impressive. But you've been talking about on the call 
today, some of the incremental global macro headwinds we're seeing 
decelerating further in certain markets, so what's giving you the confidence 
that The Coc
a
-
Cola Company can continue this strong performance during 
the second half of the year? And what specific actions is the company taking 
to offset the incremental headwinds? You mentioned some of the packaging 
shifting. And maybe is there any reallocation o
f market spending, et cetera?
 
Muhtar Kent
 
I think I'd just say 
--
 
start by saying that, firstly, we're very fortunate that 
our business has been doing well in recent years. I think operating in this 
environment has become the norm for us. It's not a passin
g feature now, 
operating in this very volatile and unpredictable environment. And I think 
that we're meeting the long
-
term growth targets set out for our 2020 Vision, 
even in difficult economic circumstances. And I think part of our success has 
been becaus
e there's been a healthy appetite for investment across our 
global bottling system in this environment, and stronger than it's been for a 
long time. Our 2020 Vision is a system vision. It's focused on long
-
term 
growth collectively with our partners 
--
 
bott
ling partners. And when you look 
back at 2010, 2011, the nonalcoholic ready
-
to
-
drink industry grew by about 
$65 billion in total retail dollar value. And we're pleased to say that our 
system represented nearly 40% of that total industry growth, well above 
our 
fair share, underscoring that vision and that collective effort and that 
investment is working. That said, we're naturally keenly aware of how 
turbulent the economic landscape is today and will continue to be this year. 
And we've said many times before
 
during the past few years that we may hit 
a bump in the road, given the continued volatility in the macro environment, 
but that we're focused on meeting our long
-
term growth targets on realizing 
--
 
and realizing our 2020 Vision. And so far, I think you ca
n say that, 
quarter
-
after
-
quarter, we've proven that. All of us at Coca
-
Cola, the entire 
system, remain constructively discontent. We know that we can always do 
better. And I think you've got to realize we've got a wonderful portfolio of 
geographic regions
. And so some of them may 
--
 
not all of them will not 
ever do well all the time. But just like this past quarter, where we had very 
unseasonable weather in Europe, we had tremendous, again, negative 
consumer sentiment brewing in Europe, we still have deliv
ered our results 
and we will continue to do so. And then also, quarter
-
after
-
quarter, we're 
gaining share and, quarter
-
after
-
quarter, our business, our top brands have 
been improving. Brand health metrics, I keep on saying that's an important 
metric to loo
k at. And when you look at the past sort of quarters, back to 
2011 versus today, we've again delivered very strong increments of 
improvement in our Coke, Fanta, Sprite brand scores, as well as weekly
-
plus 
drinkers. And as you go around the world, I think c
ertainly there is a 
sentiment that this is going to be a prolonged crisis, that the high levels of 
unemployment are here to stay, both in Europe as well as in the United 
States, and also that there's a little somewhat cooling off of economies in 
Asia, part
icularly China. But in this environment, I don't believe there's a 
better business and there is a better system to continue to crack the calculus 
for growth. When you look at BRICS, Brazil, Russia, India and China and the 
Sub
-
Saharan Africa, referred to as
 
the BRICS nations, we grew in Q2 a 
combined plus 8%. And so it's worth noting that those markets represent 
nearly 400 million cases of incremental growth last year. And so we continue 
to generate significant growth in those emerging markets and we continu
e 
to create growth in developed markets, like Japan, what you saw in this past 
quarter, as well as the United States, ninth consecutive quarter of growth in 
the United States. And when we first talked about that, again, in the midst 
of economic turmoil bac
k 2.5 years ago, very few people thought that we 
could achieve that. So that's why I have confidence, Bill, that we believe 
that we can continue to meet our long
-
term growth targets despite a very 
volatile, unpredictable and prolonged economic recovery.

Our next question comes from John Faucher with JPMC.
 
John A. Faucher

JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division
 
Gary, I want to talk a little bit about the operating leverage guidance going 
forward, particularly for the third quarter. You talked a li
ttle bit about the 
gross margin impact. In order to get to that type of negative deleveraging, 
we'd probably have to see a little higher level of SG&A spending. So can you 
talk a little bit about that? And then also, can you talk about some of the 
improvem
ent that you've started to show in North America in terms of 
operating profit growth there? With North America sort of 
--
 
I guess, the 
question is, are you expecting North America to also get better from here? 
Because if it does, that also makes the operat
ing leverage in Q3 seem a little 
bit more surprising.
 
Gary P. Fayard
 
A very good question. And let me 
--
 
I'm going to have to take it in pieces 
and parts, if I could, and see if we can put that all that together and come 
up with an answer on it. But let's 
start at gross margin first, because I think 
that's the most important place to start. Even on gross margin, I think 
you've got to split it into a couple of pieces, split the company, look at BIG 
and international operations and then North America. And on 
BIG and 
international, a lot of the gross margin pressure there is really FX currency 
headwinds. And it's coming through in cost of sales, and there's an impact 
on revenue. And so that is causing some margin pressure. And the highest 
impact of exchange rat
es 
--
 
highest headwind impact of exchange rates on 
us this year will be in the third quarter. And then it starts moderating again 
on what we're cycling. So that's the first thing. The second thing, while we're 
on international, on margins particularly is o
ur expectation, as we just said, 
is that in Japan, we think growth is going to moderate slightly from the very 
strong 4% that we've seen year
-
to
-
date in Japan. They're going to still have 
a very good year. But I think that will moderate and that will put 
-
-
 
that will 
be some margin compression on the total company. Then if you go to North 
America, I think, I'd say we've been very pleased. We've seen sequential 
improvement in North America from 
--
 
first quarter operating income was 
down 9, 10
-
ish. This quart
er, it's even. And I think we'll continue to see 
sequential improvement, albeit kind of slow improvement, and I'll go into 
why, in North America. So in North America, I think what we're seeing and 
what we saw happen actually in the United States is in abou
t mid
-
May, we 
started seeing consumer shifts and the consumer started changing behavior, 
we think temporarily. But I think it's just you pick up the newspaper, you 
turn on the television and you see economic 
--
 
huge economic issues all over 
the world, whet
her it's no job creation in the U.S. to all of the issues in 
Europe, China slowing somewhat. And what we then saw was the consumer 
change go more toward future consumption, packages and channels versus 
immediate consumption. And one of the things that's a 
little surprising 
--
 
and I think we'll have to see how this goes and I think it's, for sure, a 
temporary shift. But as the price of gasoline came down kind of in that May
-
June time period, normally what you would see, particularly in convenience 
retail, is
 
your immediate consumption should go up, and it did not. So that, I 
think, is probably going to continue somewhat through the third quarter. 
Again, some margin pressure. So that's what's leading us to that gross 
margin and that's the primary part of it. W
e've got 
--
 
and then we were 
cycling some things last year relative to SG&A. So I think there will be some 
increase in SG&A, particularly in the third quarter, and that kind of cycles 
out in the fourth. So you put all that together, that's kind of where we
 
get to 
on the negative 3 to 5 points of leverage in third quarter, coming back in the 
fourth quarter to positive 
--
 
slightly positive and kind of the gross margin as 
well. That was a long answer, but I think it's complicated because there are 
a lot of dif
ferent parts to it.
 
Muhtar Kent
 
And also, John, just one other point on what Gary mentioned in terms of the 
immediate consumption business. I think if you take our sort of top 22 
countries in the world, in Q1, we had probably more than 15 of them realize 
v
ery positive IC growth. In Q2, we had about 11 countries out of our sort of 
top 22 markets that had IC growth. And the primary reason for that was the 
very, very, very poor summer 
--
 
the start to the very poor summer in 
Europe. And so I think that is also 
an important factor that has to be kept in 
mind. It was a very unseasonable situation in Europe and hopefully, it will 
reverse itself in the coming months.
 
John A. Faucher 
-
 
JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division
 
Okay. And then, Gary, so is it safe to say
 
that the leverage piece is 
transactional? So you're looking at transactional on the leverage piece and 
then the translational piece is separate. Is that kind of how we look at, at 
least internationally? Is that what you're telling us from an FX standpoint
?
 
Gary P. Fayard
 
Say it in a different way to make sure I understand your question.
 
John A. Faucher 
-
 
JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division
 
Well, I guess, in terms of there's transactional FX impacts as opposed to 
translational FX impacts, so is it the r
aw material increase in dollars in the 
local currencies that's driving the negative leverage from a BIG standpoint? 
Is that...
 
Gary P. Fayard
 
Yes, yes. So you've got translational impact on revenue, but then you've got 
transactional impact on cost of goods
 
as well.
 
Operator
 
Our next question comes from Bryan Spillane with Bank of America.
 
Bryan D. Spillane 
-
 
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division
 
Just wanted to follow up on John's question on operating leverage, just a 
couple of points of 
clarification. First, on the commodity cost increase 
expectation for the year of $300 million, how much has actually happened so 
far year
-
to
-
date?
 
Gary P. Fayard
 
This is Gary. I would say probably about half of it. I think it's going to be 
pretty well sequ
ential through the year. And a lot of it we've already locked 
in and hedged. So it's pretty well, probably about half, maybe slightly less 
than half.
 
Bryan D. Spillane 
-
 
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division
 
Okay. And then in terms of the effect on gross m
argins of your outlook for 
price mix having less of a contribution in the first half of the year versus the 
second half, I just want to make sure it was clear that what you're 
--
 
this is 
just simply a phasing of the way your pricing 
--
 
your planned pricing
 
rolled 
through the year. It's not an expectation or a change in plan in terms of 
being more promotional or promoting back at all for the second half. I was 
just trying to...
 
Gary P. Fayard
 
Yes. No, Bryan, it's exactly what you said. That's exactly right. 
It's what our 
normal pricing had been, what we're cycling just as we phase through the 
year. We are 
--
 
have not engaged in anything relative to change into more 
promotional or anything. It's normal pricing and normal cycling. In fact, if 
anything, I would 
tell you that the pricing environment has stayed 
--
 
particularly in the U.S., has stayed very rational. And some of our 
competitors internationally are doing a lot of promotional pricing. But that's 
kind of normal. What you're seeing is exactly what we pla
n to do the whole 
year, have not deviated at all.
 
Bryan D. Spillane 
-
 
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division
 
Okay. And then the last piece would just be in terms of understanding the 
different pieces on geographic mix. Europe is a high
-
margin market for you
. 
And it sounds like, given the performance and just the outlook in terms of 
the macro, that you're expecting less of a contribution from Europe than you 
normally would expect. And now we're talking about profit contribution. So, 
a, is that the right way t
o think about it? And, b, or second, is there also 
anything that you're doing specifically in Europe to support profits while 
you've still got 
--
 
or to boost profitability while you've got kind of a soft 
patch from a demand perspective?
 
Gary P. Fayard
 
Yes.
 
You're right on Europe. It is a high
-
margin, high
-
profitability business 
for us. And we're continuing to hold share. We are seeing some weakness 
there, obviously down 4% in the quarter. I think it's important to recognize 
that weather is probably as much 
to do with what we saw in the second 
quarter as the economic macros, probably 50
-
50 on all of Europe and 
probably even more so for Northwest Europe. Britain had the wettest 
summer so far that it's had in over the last 100 years. So the weather's been 
unbel
ievably bad. If it turns 
--
 
and I don't want to use weather as an excuse. 
If it turns, things will be better. We're not anticipating that, but hopefully 
that will be somewhat better. And we are cycling a pretty good summer from 
last year 
--
 
a very good sum
mer from last year as well.
 
Muhtar Kent
 
I think, Bryan, in Europe, we've got very, very strong programs in place. 
We've just finished one of the most successful euro activations. We have just 
embarking upon the Olympics programs, which globally are going t
o be 
activated in over 100 markets. We've never had that happen before. We've 
reached 
--
 
the greenest ever Olympics was 
--
 
we believe that our business is 
very strong in Europe. And as Gary said, I think there has been an anomaly 
in the weather. But having
 
said that, if you look at the past 
--
 
in the last 2 
years, Europe has really performed better than expectations, given how bad 
the consumer sentiment was deteriorating in Europe. And this should not be 
taken as a kind of a fall off the cliff. But certainl
y, Europe is continuing 
--
 
going to continue to be challenging as an environment. But our business 
gets essentially stronger in Europe because our brands are stronger. We're 
investing with our bottlers, both CCE, our Iberian bottlers, as well as Coca
-
Cola 
Hellenic. So I do believe that probably there was some factors, one
-
off 
factors that created the current result, as opposed to it being taken as a 
given for the rest. But I do also believe that I think you need to understand 
that we're in for a very protra
cted recovery in Europe.
 
Gary P. Fayard
 
Bryan, I'd add one thing. If you go back to our conference call in the first 
quarter, if you go back to the transcript, you asked a question on that call. 
And the last 
--
 
I think one of the last things I said to you 
in answering your 
question was, ""Remember, we are managing this business as a marathon 
and not a sprint."" And that's exactly what you're hearing us say today. We're 
in a marathon. We're in this to win. We are gaining and furthering the 
distance between our
selves and our competitors every quarter. We're going 
to continue to do that. And we feel very good that we've got the right plans 
in place to do it.

Our next question comes from Bonnie Herzog from Wells Fargo.

I had a question on China. You talked about the volume in China slowing due 
to the economic slowdown. So I was hoping you could provide a little more 
color on some of the symptoms of a soft landing you're seeing in your 
business 
by some of your key categories, and then possibly by area or 
region. And then I also would be curious to hear how your business in China 
performed in the quarter compared to what your expectations were early on 
this quarter.
 
Muhtar Kent
 
I think during our 
last earnings call, again, I think we shared our expectation 
that our volume growth in China might moderate to some extent as, a, the 
business is not going to be totally immune to the cooling, particularly along 
the coastal areas of China. And I think as a
nticipated, the broader beverage 
industry in China has also felt the impact of that slowdown in the first half of 
2012. But also 
--
 
and so it was not 
--
 
in terms of expectations, it's probably 
where we expected the business to land in terms of how we saw t
he 
marketplace developing. I think, year
-
to
-
date growth in China being a solid 
8%, cycling plus 17% from prior year, I believe we're content. But certainly, 
we'll always try to achieve double
-
digit growth. But importantly, I think the 
rightsizing packaging
 
efforts that we put into place in China last year 
continued to generate consistent incremental transactions, in line with our 
expectations. In fact, a little bit ahead of our expectations. And as such, 
total beverage transactions 
--
 
and you've heard us ta
lk about transactions 
being really a really very good metric for the health of the business 
--
 
were 
up double
-
digits for both the quarter, up about 12%, and also on a year
-
to
-
date basis, up about 14%. So just want to stress that, a really important 
point. 
And again, we captured both volume and value share significantly in 
the sparkling beverage category in China in this past quarter. And our 
brands, particularly in the sparkling category, have been doing very well. 
And transactions, as I say, which is a gre
at health of the business, have 
been progressing well. In terms of regions, I think the northern regions and 
the regions 
--
 
more inland regions are doing a little better than the coastal 
regions in China. And I think we'll continue to see that throughout t
he year 
as some consumers have moved back into the central and inland regions of 
China, given some of the slowing down of the export businesses along the 
coast.

And then just a quick follow
-
on.
 
Are you seeing any signs of slowdown in 
any other parts of Asia? Is this spreading in any way?
 
Muhtar Kent
 
We are not. I would say Vietnam, Southeast Asia, Philippines is actually 
doing better. We talked about Philippines having a kind of coming off the c
liff 
a little bit after the elections, and after tremendous amounts of sort of 
monetary easing preelections. I think it's coming back to a good sort of 
balance now. And then in terms of Indonesia, I think obviously, Australia, 
some of Australia's exports t
o China are slowing down. But actually, we've 
had a pretty good quarter in Australia. And I don't 
--
 
we don't really see 
--
 
it's actually a pretty strong, balanced growth across the region. I would 
phrase it that way, Bonnie.

Our next 
question comes from Ali Dibadj with Bernstein.
 
Ali Dibadj

Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division
 
So maybe going back to the comment earlier about marathon versus sprint, 
sort of applying that again to North America and thinking about it from
 
a 
long
-
term perspective. And obviously this quarter, you had pricing up 5%, 
volume down 2%. In share, it sounds like, in sparkling, roughly flat. Is that 
kind of a comfortable algorithm, a comfortable elasticity that you'd be 
looking for going forward, lo
nger
-
term, sort of maybe moderating from price 
but kind of in that range of elasticity? Or does some of the macro challenges 
you're seeing now and maybe the persistence of those challenges make you 
think a little bit differently about that? And I guess, if
 
you could answer that 
in the [indiscernible] of your margins, the margin answer you gave about 
North America going forward, that would be helpful.
 
Muhtar Kent
 
Yes, Ali. First, let me just take sort of what we would term as sort of a 
normal outlook. I said
 
it before. I think, look, in terms of moderate growth in 
volume in North America and we have 
--
 
and also certain amount of positive 
price mix, given the strength of our brands, I think, and also our new 
occasion channel
-
based packaging architecture that w
e've actually recreated 
with smaller packages with the mini cans, with the 14 ounces and with the 
advent also of a much wider Freestyle distribution of the Freestyle 
dispensing units, I think probably is the right way to think about. Given that 
it's going 
to be a protracted recovery, that's the way we would think about 
it. Moderate volume, 1% to 2%, and then also some positive price mix on 
top of that. And that's how we would see the business progressing. In terms 
of share, I think it's important to reflect
 
on the fact that over the last 3 
--
 
2, 
3 years, we've been gaining market share consistently quarter
-
after
-
quarter 
in the United States. If you look at consecutively, in terms of value share, 
since the beginning of 2010, every quarter, we've gained share 
if you look at 
the numbers in value share every quarter, adding on top of the quarter 
prior. So we've been coming through historically a very strong share gain 
environment. And I think certainly, we see the pricing environment to be 
logical and one that is
 
rational, and that's very important. And I think we 
just have to ensure that we keep the right balance of both marketing and 
pricing and also improvements in customer service with Coca
-
Cola 
Refreshments that are taking 
--
 
that are improving every quarter.
 
As we 
move into the year, I think you should also see us continuing that kind of 
trend in the United States going forward. And, Gary, if you want to talk 
about the margins?
 
Gary P. Fayard
 
A little bit on the margin. A couple of things. So North America, t
otal volume 
was plus 1 on 3 points of price mix 
--
 
positive price mix. Sparkling was 
minus 2 on 5 points of positive price mix. And I think, Ali, your question is, 
is that kind of the elasticities and kind of the relationship we would expect to 
see going f
orward? And I'd tell you a couple of things. One, in a very rational 
pricing environment, so I think you have to underline that, and it is, the 
historical elasticity models would have said that you would have seen a lot 
greater volume decline, greater than
 
2%, if you took 5% of pricing. So I 
think that's a very good thing, obviously. Going forward, in a more 
normalized market, where you're not seeing the huge commodity spikes that 
we've seen over the last 2 years, I think a much healthier environment, we 
wo
uld want to see sparkling growing kind of the low 1 or 2 percentage 
points, kind of 
--
 
and more moderate pricing on top of that to still get a 3% 
or 4% or something revenue growth, but do it in a more balanced fashion 
with 
--
 
between volume and price, but.
..
 
Muhtar Kent
 
And just one thing to add to that, Ali, also. I think it's important to 
remember that 2011 was probably a special year, where we've had to face 
tremendous increases and changes in commodity costs like we hadn't faced 
before. I mean, that's, 
in the United States, to the tune of about $550 
million. And although it hasn't continued, thank goodness, at the same rate, 
we also are facing some commodity increases, of course, this year, too, not 
anywhere close to what it was. So have to remember what
 
kind of pricing we 
had to take to ensure that our business could continue to invest for 
sustainable future growth in the United States coming off of 2011.
 
Ali Dibadj

Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division
 
Okay. So that's great. And I hope t
he better
-
than
-
expected elasticity kind of 
boldens a little bit more pricing, which is good. But 
--
 
so just if I could 
squeeze in a housekeeping perhaps question. It may or may not be a 
housekeeping, I guess. But on the balance sheet 
--
 
and, Gary, this may
 
be 
for you. There's always a lot of moving parts, and we kind of try to keep 
track of it. But this quarter was another one of kind of large shifts from cash 
to short
-
term investments, large increase in marketable securities. What 
exactly are you doing? An
d what's the impact to the P&L, if any?
 
Gary P. Fayard
 
Yes. Most of it does not have much impact to the P&L at all. What you're 
seeing us do is, as we continue to build cash, most of that cash or a large 
part of that cash is offshore. We are moving into se
parately managed 
accounts, and so reducing exposure to banks, particularly, so that we are 
diversifying risk. And then we're also investing some of that 
--
 
rather than in 
a savings account, if you will, we're putting some of it into government 
bonds and so
me 
--
 
and AAA
-
rated other investments, all short
-
term. But it's 
basically just ensuring that we are diversifying against any concentrations of 
risk.

Our next question comes from Alice Longley of Buckingham Research Group.
 
Alice Beebe Longley

The
 
Buckingham Research Group Incorporated
 
My question is about volume in the second half. You've already indicated 
that price mix should be slowing. Can you give us some indication of what 
volume should look like, and particularly Brazil, the U.S. and China,
 
versus 
what we've seen in the second quarter?
 
Muhtar Kent
 
Yes. I mean, I think you'll appreciate that we can't give forecasts. But I think 
you've heard us say that we feel confident, despite the volatility that we 
would be looking at, reiterating our long
-
term targets of 3% to 4% volume 
growth and, again, that we manage a great portfolio of 206 markets. And we 
believe that based on our 
--
 
both marketing programs, as well as our 
strength of our brands, the strength of our system, that we would be able to 
re
iterate our long
-
term growth target in terms of volume of 3% to 4% for 
not just the remaining part of the year, but going into the future.
 
Alice Beebe Longley 
-
 
The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated
 
Well, we've had some macro slowdown occur during the
 
course of the 
second quarter in China and Brazil. And we've seen a little slowdown in your 
numbers. And then just is that going to continue? Or are we going to sort of 
stay at these second quarter levels?
 
Muhtar Kent
 
I can't comment on that. But look, you
've seen us in the past 
--
 
if you take 
the last 3 or 4 years, where we've been operating in this economic 
environment, you've seen us have quarters of 3% or even less or 5% or 6%. 
And so when less than 3 or 4 things go bad, then you'll see us higher 
volume
s. When some more things all combine in a certain time frame, you 
may see less. But over a period of time 
--
 
longer period of time, we feel that 
the 3% to 4% is a good number to look at in terms of 
--
 
which is our long
-
term growth targets. We've never chan
ged them and we think 
--
 
and 
generating 
--
 
for a business our size, generating a 7% revenue growth, 
comp currency neutral revenue growth across the world, that's, in my book, 
continuing to crack the calculus for growth.
 
Alice Beebe Longley 
-
 
The Buckingham
 
Research Group Incorporated
 
And then could I ask a different question, which follows up with some that 
have been asked before? And this is the operating profit performance in 
North America. I think you've indicated that it will continue to get better 
sequ
entially in North America. And yet you've highlighted a sort of 
unfavorable mix in terms of channel and I think product as well and price 
mix here. So why do we have sequential improvement in operating profits 
here in North America coming?
 
Muhtar Kent
 
Gary
, do you want to...
 
Gary P. Fayard
 
Yes, yes. I'll take that one. I think what 
--
 
you've been seeing us deliver 
sequential improvements. I don't know that the third quarter versus the 
second quarter in North America 
--
 
probably, it won't be the same 
kind of 
sequential improvement you saw from minus 9 to 0. But I think you'll see 
some improvement in the third quarter, although there are some macro and 
consumer issues in the United States just because of the condition of this 
economy and all. And then y
ou will see 
--
 
I would expect to see a fairly 
significant improvement then in the fourth quarter, particularly as you has 
that [ph] 
--
 
as an operating business, a finished products business has 
significant leverage that will come through in the fourth quar
ter, particularly 
with the extra days and the 2 extra days in the fourth quarter.
 
Alice Beebe Longley 
-
 
The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated
 
The fourth quarter is clear. I'm just trying to figure out why we get 
improvement in the third quarter 
versus the second.
 
Gary P. Fayard
 
Just because we continue to work on the business. But I'm not saying it's 
going to be significant improvement. It's just there should be 
--
 
our 
expectation is there should be a little improvement in the third quarter.
 
Muht
ar Kent
 
Look, we have said that in the United States, we started 
--
 
when we started 
the business that we pointed out that there's going to be sequential 
improvement. It's also partly on how the commodities are priced into our 
business, and also how marketi
ng spend operates 
--
 
the marketing spend 
curve operates in our business and a number of other things. So we do 
expect to see, as we have seen in the second quarter, which we pointed out 
in the first quarter, we will continue to see sequential improvement a
s a 
result of some of those other things that I've also mentioned, as well as the 
strength of our marketing programs going into the third quarter, particularly 
related to the Olympics, as well as many other local programs. In the United 
States, we've never
 
had more customer partners pick up and align with us 
on the Olympic activation as in these Olympic Games.
 
Gary P. Fayard
 
One other thing I'll point out, and it's kind of tactical, but in timing, in the 
last year, most of or about half of the Fourth of Jul
y holiday was in the 
second quarter. The impact was in the second quarter, and then a little bit in 
the third quarter. The way the calendar fell this year, basically all or most of 
the Fourth of July holiday in North America will be in the third quarter, w
hich 
helps the third quarter.
 
Operator
 
And our final question today comes from Judy Hong with Goldman Sachs.
 
Judy E. Hong 
-
 
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division
 
Gary, just a follow
-
up to some of the earlier questions. If I take the puts and 
takes in
 
terms of some of the changes to your guidance, so you've got 
better commodities, you've got better tax rate, and then you've got a bit 
worse interest income, and then worse FX. So net
-
net, my math sort of 
comes to kind of a wash in terms of some of those 
puts and takes. Do you 
sort of get the same calculation, just in terms of some of the puts and takes, 
to those aspects of the changes that you've talked about?
 
Gary P. Fayard
 
Yes. If you look at tax, so you've got 
--
 
kind of depending on where you 
were. Bu
t if you take 0.8 points on tax, that will give you $0.03 or $0.04 a 
share. You've got probably down $0.01 or so relative to interest. So 
commodities, let's call it $50 million probably positive. That's another $0.01 
or so. So those are starting to wash. B
ut then FX is going to be worse, and 
particularly worse in the third quarter, significantly worse in the third 
quarter. And then we have previously said kind of mid
-
single
-
digits 
headwind. I think my words were exactly the high end of our previously 
commun
icated mid
-
single
-
digits. So kind of depending on where you were. 
But the risk aversion that investors around the world have gone to has really 
driven the dollar, particularly against the emerging market currencies 
because the others, even on the euro, wer
e hedged for the year. But it's 
primarily those emerging market currencies have really been driven hard 
--
 
hit hard just because of risk aversion.
 
Judy E. Hong 
-
 
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division
 
Yes. I guess, I was just trying to understand how 
the gross margin impact in 
BIG and international from a transactional perspective, that is captured in 
your FX guidance.
 
Gary P. Fayard
 
No, no. We do not include the impact of currency on cost of goods in the FX 
guidance. So that's on top of it.
 
Judy E. Ho
ng 
-
 
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division
 
Okay. That's on top, okay. And then just finally, switch quickly on the U.S. 
So the channel and the pack shift that you're seeing, why do you think it's 
only a temporary shift? And sort of 
--
 
and a little bi
t more of a color, just 
because if you look at the data, I mean, take
-
home channel has been 
declining at a faster pace. You've had immediate consumption channel that's 
been growing. Is that not enough to really offset what's going on within kind 
of the imm
ediate consumption side, the mix shift that you're seeing? And 
then if that's the case, I'm just surprised that the categories, like energy 
drink, continues to really accelerate even into June. So what are some of 
dynamics that you're seeing as it relates 
to some of the channel and product 
shift that you've talked about? And I guess, why is that more of a temporary 
situation in your view?
 
Muhtar Kent
 
I think, first 
--
 
this is Muhtar. I think, first, you've got to take into account 
the pricing environment. 5
%, I mean, that is a pricing environment that you 
won't see coming through all the time. And therefore, I think you need to 
put it into that perspective, and therefore, look at it in that regard. And also 
as you know, over time, the pricing impact gets eve
ned out and the 
consumers get back to a normalized sort of sequence. And so I think you will 
be seeing some of that happen in the United States. That's one reason. The 
second reason is the strength of our programs. The third reason is what 
Gary mentioned i
n terms of holiday season falling into the quarter as 
opposed to not in the quarter, et cetera, et cetera. So there's a lot of 
number of reasons why we're talking about it being not a permanent feature 
but a feature that will wash out through time. That's 
why. And so I hope that 
explains some of that.
 
Thank you, Gary and Jackson. And in closing, I think I'd like to once again 
reiterate that we had a strong quarter and delivered quality midyear 
performance results. Along with our partners, bottling partners,
 
customer 
partners, we're successfully navigating through an unpredictable external 
economic environment with a well

sustainable growth. Our 2020 Vision is working. Our system remains 
resolutely focused on capturing th
e great opportunities we see ahead in all 
of the markets. And as we partner with our global consumers, customers, 
communities, we fundamentally believe we are building something lasting 
and something good while creating long

term sustainable value for our 
shareholders. As always, we thank you for your interest and your investment

Now I'll turn the call over to
 
Muhtar.
 
Muhtar Kent
 
Thank you, Jackson, and good morning, everyone. Let me begin by saying 
that I'm pleased with our first quarter results. I've never been more excited 
about the prospects for our brands, as well as our system, or more proud of 
our people
 
who are driving our consistent and quality performance results. 
We continue to deliver volume, value and profit growth as we enter the third 
year of our 2020 Vision, and we once again saw positive volume growth 
across every one of our 5 geographic operati
ng groups. We also continue to 
gain volume and value share globally in the nonalcoholic ready
-
to
-
drink 
beverages and in every sparkling and still beverage category in which we 
compete. We are winning with our global sparkling beverage portfolio, which 
was 
up a solid 4% this past quarter, led by the global growth of brand Coca
-
Cola, which was up also a healthy 4%. And we are continuing to win with 
our global still beverage portfolio, which grew a strong 9% this quarter. As 
we stand a little less than a quart
er of the way into our journey towards our 
2020 Vision, today's results demonstrate yet again how we are passionately 
and effectively refreshing a thirsty world with a capable, resilient and 
advantaged global bottling system.
 
Before reviewing our quarterly
 
operating results, let's take a few moments 
to address today's mixed global economic environment. With respect to 
Europe, we are observing ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty as 2012 
unfolds. Austerity measures implemented across the region are weighing on 
consumer confidence, which recently reached its lowest level since the first 
quarter of 2009. Despite the challenges in Europe, we are executing on all 
fronts to drive performance and share gains. So while we expect the 
macroeconomic conditions will remain
 
difficult in Europe throughout 2012, 
we remain cautiously encouraged by our performance in this market.
 
Turning to the United States. Despite its struggle with a sustained period of 
relative high unemployment, we're pleased to see some early signs of a 
sl
owly improving macroeconomic environment. We remain firmly committed 
to building strong brands and creating value in the United States to capture 
more than our fair share of the industry's profitable growth.
 
Finally, let me touch on recent macroeconomic de
velopments across a 
couple of key BRIC markets. In China, we've all seen economists lower their 
2012 GDP growth rate forecast. While we agree that there has been some 
moderate slowdown in China, we also believe that this is a national 
progression and that 
it is a positive for the long
-
term sustainable growth of 
the country. As we move through 2012, we anticipate that our business in 
China may not be immune to this cooling economy, and therefore, we may 
also see our volume results in China moderate to some e
xtent. Having said 
that, we are confident that China will continue to serve as a double
-
digit 
growth market for our business over the long term. As for Brazil, which 
underwent a cooling
-
down period of its own in 2011, there are now signs of 
improving consu
mer sentiment. We expect this trend to hold as we move 
through the balance of 2012 with our business in Brazil continuing to gain 
market share.
 
In summary, we always find ourselves operating in a fast
-
evolving global 
environment, one with some economies sl
owing, other economies stabilizing 
while sustaining high unemployment and still others improving and well on 
their way to recovery. In all cases, we remain intently focused on realizing 
our 2020 Vision, and we will keep investing through these challenging 
times 
to drive long
-
term advantaged and sustainable growth. So if we have 
learned anything these past few years, it is that during times of ongoing 
uncertainty, consumers are even thirstier for brands that inspire real 
moments of optimism and happiness.
 
Tu
rning now to our total company performance results. Our volume grew 
5% in the quarter, ahead of our long
-
term target and fueled by organic 
volume growth in all 5 geographic operating groups. As for our financial 
results, we grew comparable currency
-
neutral
 
net revenue by 7%, and we 
grew comparable currency
-
neutral operating income by 8% once you adjust 
for the cycling of lower commodity cost in the prior period. As such, we 
remain confident in our ability to deliver full year 2012 operating income 
results i
n line with our long
-
term targets.
 
Now let's review our performance results across our global markets in more 
detail, beginning with North America, our flagship market. Our North 
America business was up 2%, delivering an eighth consecutive quarter of 
growt
h. Importantly, our North America system once again led the industry, 
capturing volume and value share in nonalcoholic ready
-
to
-
drink beverages. 
Our sparkling beverages in North America were up 1% in the quarter, with 
brand Coca
-
Cola also positive in the q
uarter while further improving its 
brand health scores. The momentum behind both Coke Zero as well as Fanta 
continues, with these brands up 9% and 4%, respectively, this quarter, and 
we also earned higher pricing in North America, which enabled us to 
gener
ate a positive 3% price mix for both bottled and canned sparkling 
beverages, as well as our total North America beverage business. Our still 
beverages in North America were up 6% in the quarter, gaining both volume 
and value share while delivering industry
-
leading results across many 
categories. In sports drinks, POWERADE grew double digits yet again this 
quarter while once again capturing volume and value share. Our glacéau 
trademark grew 9%, also capturing volume and value share, led by another 
quarter of
 
double
-
digit growth for both smartwater and vitaminwater zero. 
And our key performance again accelerated this quarter, up double digits, 
led by Gold Peak, which grew double digits for the 20th conservative 
--
 
consecutive quarter. And in water, DASANI also
 
expanded double digits this 
quarter with the national rollout of our innovative PlantBottle that is 
positively impacting purchase intent and brand equity. As we've said many 
times before, we believe North America is a growth market for our business. 
Despi
te a challenging competitive and macroeconomic backdrop, our results 
both validate this belief and provide us with every reason to remain 
optimistic about the long
-
term outlook for America.
 
Now let me turn to our Pacific Group, which grew 8% in the quarter
, 
including 6% growth for brand Coca
-
Cola. In China, the overall beverage 
industry was not immune from the impact of the economic slowdown we 
mentioned earlier, as well as the unseasonably cold weather that occurred 
during this quarter's Chinese New Year c
elebration. Despite this, our 
business in China delivered a solid 9% growth this quarter while cycling a 
strong first quarter last year. And importantly, our rightsizing efforts are 
generating strong incremental transactions in line with our expectations. 
Sparkling beverage transactions were up double digits this past quarter, 
driven by the expansion of our 300 ml package. This helped us capture both 
volume and value share in the sparkling beverage category this quarter.
 
Just a few weeks ago, I was pleased 
and honored to inaugurate our 42nd 
bottling plant in China in Yingkou. This new plant is now our largest 
production facility in China, with an expected annual production capacity of 
more than 5 billion servings of sparkling and still beverages. This new LE
ED
-
certified plant is part of our system's 3
-
year $4 billion China investment plan 
and reaffirms our strong commitment to China.
 
Japan's first quarter results were up 3%, building on the great work done by 
our system to restore and strengthen our business 
during a very challenging 
2011. Our Japan business gained both volume and value share in the 
nonalcoholic beverages this quarter. And this growth in Japan was broad
-
based, with numerous sparkling and still beverages delivering positive 
results, including b
rand Coca
-
Cola up 2%, Fanta up 6%, I LOHAS water up 
4% and Georgia coffee up 3%. Additionally, our Japan business grew across 
all channels, including convenience stores and vending. Also during the 
quarter, our Japan business unit was recognized with our c
ompany's highest 
honor, the 2011 Woodruff Cup based on the business unit's achievement of 
key performance metrics as set forth in our 2020 Vision. As such, we remain 
confident that our system in Japan is well aligned and in strong 
--
 
in a strong 
position t
o deliver full year, low single
-
digit growth in 2012.
 
I also want to call out 2 other markets within this diverse and dynamic 
geographic region of the world. First, our business in the Philippines is 
growing again, up mid single digits this past quarter, r
eflecting how the hard 
work put in by our Bottling Investment Group keeps yielding strong results. 
While we believe there is still much opportunity left to be captured in the 
Philippines, we also believe that our business there is on the right track and 
th
at we are successfully building the capabilities needed to deliver consistent 
and sustainable growth. Second, our business in Thailand grew over 20% in 
the first quarter, and brand Coca
-
Cola was up over 30% as we build 
momentum in this market while investi
ng for the future. We have plans in 
place to expand our beverage production capabilities in this fast
-
growing 
market, consistent with our system's culture of targeted investment that 
underpins our 2020 Vision.
 
Moving now to Latin America, our volume grew 5
% for the quarter, including 
4% growth for brand Coca
-
Cola. In the process, we gained additional share 
in nonalcoholic ready
-
to
-
drink beverages, as well as in both sparkling and 
still beverages in Latin America this quarter. Latin America's solid first 
qua
rter results were driven by our consistent growth in Mexico, improved 
results in Brazil, and high single
-
digit growth in both our Latin Center and 
South Latin regions. In Mexico, we delivered 3% growth, cycling 14% from 
last year. We captured additional no
nalcoholic ready
-
to
-
drink beverage 
volume and value share in Mexico, and this is a further testament to our 
team's ability to execute clear occasion
-
based channel strategies across all 
beverage categories in our highest per capita market.
 
As for Brazil, we
 
reiterated many times last year that as this country's 
economy improved, so would our results. This quarter's 4% volume growth 
in Brazil validates this belief, and importantly, our continued volume and 
value share gains in Brazil are a testament to our su
stained long
-
term 
growth strategies which never wavered during last year's economic 
slowdown. Looking ahead, we expect our 2012 growth results in Brazil to 
remain steady at low to single 

 
mid
-
single digits as the Brazilian economy 
recovers. And our commit
ment to the future of Brazil has never been 
stronger, as shown by our system's recent announcement to accelerate our 
investments in Brazil to nearly $8 billion through 2016.
 
Our Eurasia and Africa business grew a strong 9% in the quarter, including 
solid 9
% growth for brand Coca
-
Cola. Our overall group results were led by 
robust growth across the entire region, including growth in India, Russia, 
South Africa, the Middle East and North Africa. Overall performance was 
once again led by India, which grew 20% i
n the quarter, delivering balanced 
growth across all categories. I was particularly encouraged by brand Coca
-
Cola's 27% growth in India this past quarter, and our still beverages in India 
were up over 20% in the quarter, led by Maaza up over 30%. Russia wa
s up 
3% this quarter, cycling last year's strong 27% growth. Our business in 
Russia continues to be led by the strong momentum of brand Coca
-
Cola, 
which once again delivered double
-
digit growth. Additionally, our Dobriy 
juice brand delivered 9% growth and 
as a result, our overall business in 
Russia keeps outperforming the rest of the industry, gaining nonalcoholic 
ready
-
to
-
drink beverage volume and value share. Finally, we saw positive 
volume across growth in every other business unit in our Eurasia and Afr
ica 
group, including double
-
digit growth in South Africa, as well as in the Middle 
East and North Africa region. We are excited about the future opportunities 
for our business in this dynamic growing part of the world.
 
Moving now to Europe. Volume was up 1
%, gaining share in nonalcoholic 
ready
-
to
-
drink beverages. Notably, this is Europe's seventh consecutive 
quarter of positive growth. And this growth was led by Germany, which was 
up 3% for the quarter, capturing, once again, share in the nonalcoholic 
ready
-
to
-
drink beverages, as well as in both sparkling and still beverage 
categories. Brand Coca
-
Cola was up 4% this quarter in Germany, benefiting 
from both our effective marketing campaigns and our consumer recruitment 
initiatives. In total, this marks German
y's fifth consecutive quarter of 
positive growth. This consistency validates how our ongoing bottling 
restructuring efforts have enhanced our ability to create value during difficult 
economic times. Another region where our business is showing signs of 
mod
erate improvement despite challenging economic conditions is Central 
and Southern Europe. Most markets in this region posted positive growth, 
including Italy which was up 4% for the quarter. Another very important 
geography where we achieved positive resul
ts is Spain, up 6% for the 
quarter. We are closely monitoring our business in both of these markets in 
light of recently announced austerity measures. Importantly, we believe we 
have the right brands, the right strategies and the right capabilities in plac
e 
to continue delivering long
-
term sustainable growth in Europe.
 
As we look ahead to this summer, both in Europe as well as across the 
world, we are very excited about the unique opportunity to grow the value of 
our brands even further through our investme
nts in the 2012 London 
Summer Olympic Games. For context, during the 2008 Beijing Summer 
Olympics, we activated 36 markets across the globe. For this year's Summer 
Olympics, we plan to activate almost 100 markets, leveraging content, 
experiences and conver
sations generated through our global program. This 
fully integrated 2012 global Olympic marketing program will be all about 
recruiting teams by tapping into emotional passion points like sports and 
music. An early success of this program is the over 160,00
0 YouTube views 
of Mark Ronson's behind
-
the
-
scenes footage as he developed our new 
Olympics theme song. These views were generated without any active 
promotions on our part and, once again, are a clear example of how we are 
successfully engaging consumers 
with innovative, compelling and shareable 
social media content.
 
As we work to engage with our consumers, we're also committed to building 
a better tomorrow. Last month, we released our 2012 Global Water 
Stewardship and Replenishment Report, detailing our o
ngoing work to 
reduce, recycle and replenish the water we use around the world. To date, 
our company has launched 386 Community Water Partnership projects in 94 
countries. These projects have improved water access for 1.6 million people, 
including more tha
n 0.25 million women and children in Africa. In 2011 
alone, our Community Water Partnership projects replenished 35% of the 
water used in our finished product beverages. These projects also benefited 
the communities we serve by providing sustainable agricu
lture training and 
resources to more than 12,000 farmers and by supporting the reforestation 
of over 30,000 hectares.
 
As we build a better tomorrow, our efforts and performance are being 
recognized. This past quarter, we were humbly honored to receive seve
ral 
acknowledgments. Firstly, Fortune Magazine's survey of the Most Admired 
Companies listed us at #4 in their 2012 rankings, up from #6 in 2011 and 
up 20 spots from where we ranked just 5 years ago. In these same 
rankings, Fortune Magazine's survey once a
gain rated us as the #1 most 
admired beverage company in the world. Secondly, Forbes also announced 
just 2 weeks ago that our company had risen to #7 on their publication's list 
of America's Most Reputable Companies based on a consumer survey by 
Reputation
 
Institute. This ranking is up from #25 in 2011. We also saw our 
standing improved within the Harris Interactive reputation study, an annual 
survey that measures the corporate reputations of the 60 most visible 
companies in the U.S. In their latest survey,
 
our company climbed to #3, up 
from 15th the previous year.
 
While all of us at The Coca
-
Cola Company are proud of these achievements, 
we understand that they only represent a snapshot of where we are today 
rather than where we aspire to be tomorrow. As I h
ave stated many times 
before, the complexity and the challenge of today's mixed global economy 
also brings real opportunities and exciting growth prospects. What was true 
on Day 1 of our 2020 Vision is still true today. Our system has only just 
begun to ac
hieve its potential. We have a clear roadmap for growth, a 
productivity and reinvestment program that is driving efficiencies and a 
global bottling system that is well aligned and poised for execution. This 
strong alignment has not only enabled us to effec
tively navigate the 
volatility of these past several years, it has also put us in a position of real 
strength. That is why we are confident that our Coca
-
Cola system will 
continue to passionately refresh a thirsty world and create value for all of 
our cons
umers, customers and shareholders.
 
And with that, I'd now like to turn the call over to Gary.
 
Gary P. Fayard
 
Thanks, Muhtar. Good morning, everyone. We delivered strong results this 
quarter, underscoring once again that our global system is well positioned to 
execute our strategic plans and alignment with our 2020 Vision. We reported 
comparable earnings per share
 
of $0.89 this quarter, up 3% versus the prior 
year. And as Muhtar shared earlier, our earnings growth was driven by 
broad
-
based volume growth across all of our 5 operating groups. In fact, we 
had volume growth across nearly all of our business units withi
n our global 
operations this quarter.
 
Comparable currency
-
neutral operating income was up 5% this quarter. On 
a comparable basis, the impact of currency on this quarter's operating 
income results was a 2% headwind, in line with outlook we provided during 
o
ur last earnings call in February. In addition, and also as for the outlook we 
provided through this quarter, we cycled lower commodity cost in the first 
quarter of 2011. Adjusting for the 3% impact relating to the cycling of these 
lower commodity cost, ou
r comparable currency
-
neutral operating income 
was up 8% in the first quarter of 2012. When you also consider that this 
quarter had one less selling day than the first quarter of 2011, we are very 
pleased with this operating income result.
 
Comparable curre
ncy
-
neutral net revenue grew 7% this quarter, including a 
3% increase in concentrate sales and 3% positive price mix. The currency 
impact on this quarter's comparable net revenue result was a 1% headwind. 
This quarter's 3% consolidated price mix is particu
larly encouraging, 
especially when considering today's challenging macroeconomic conditions. 
Looking ahead, we still expect our full year 2012 consolidated price mix 
results to come in between 1% and 2% in line with our long
-
term target 
range.
 
This quarter
's comparable gross margin was in line with our full year 2011 
gross margin, consistent with the outlook we provided earlier this quarter. 
As a reminder, we expect our full year 2012 consolidated comparable gross 
margin to remain in line with full year 201
1.
 
Our comparable currency
-
neutral SG&A expenses were up 4% in the quarter 
as we sustained our commitment to invest in the health and the strength of 
our brands. As for operating expense leverage, it came in positive this 
quarter. For 2012, we still expect
 
to capture low single
-
digit operating 
expense leverage as we further invest in strategic brand building initiatives 
around the world and effectively manage our operating expenses.
 
Our net interest income came in at $27 million this quarter ahead of our 
in
itial forecast, primarily due to a benefit related to our interest rate swaps. 
As such and based on our current best estimates of interest rates in our 
international operations, we now expect our full year 2012 net interest 
income to come in at the higher 
end of the $20 million to $40 million range 
we provided in our last earnings call. In addition, we expect our net interest 
to come in close to even in the second quarter. We'll continue to update you 
on net interest outlook on a quarterly basis.
 
Our underl
ying effective tax rate currently stands at 24.8% within the 24% 
to 25% range we communicated during our last earnings call.
 
As for our cash flow from operations, this increased 13% year
-
to
-
date. 
Please note that this cash flow result is net of the approxi
mately $130 
million in incremental contributions made to our pension plans this quarter 
when compared to the contributions we made to our pension plans in the 
first quarter of last year.
 
With regard to our share repurchase program, our net share repurchase
s 
during the quarter totaled nearly $850 million, including accruals for stock 
options and treasury shares that did not settle prior to the close of the 
quarter. This places us well on track to achieve the $2.5 billion to $3 billion 
range for full year 201
2 as we communicated during our last earnings call.
 
Now let me take a moment to remind you of our full year outlook on 
currencies and commodities which we provided in our last earnings call. With 
regard to commodities, in our last call, we said that we exp
ected the full 
year 2012 incremental impact of the Big 4 commodity cost on our results to 
range between $350 million and $450 million. And just a reminder, the Big 4 
commodities are aluminum, sweetener, juice and PET. While our commodity 
cost outlook remai
ns unchanged, if current trends hold, we may see this 
outlook slowly improve in the coming months. And we'll update you on any 
changes to our outlook during our next earnings call.
 
As for currencies, based on our hedge positions, current spot rates and the
 
cycling of our prior year rates, we continue to expect currencies to have a 
mid single
-
digit negative impact on operating income for the full year. 
Furthermore, we expect to see this impact come in at the high end of this 
mid single
-
digit range in the sec
ond quarter.
 
Let me highlight one additional item for those that model our business. In 
light of the recent change to our global tea joint venture with Nestlé, and as 
a reminder, earlier this year, we announced our agreement with Nestlé to 
refocus the geog
raphic scope of this joint venture primarily to Europe and 
Canada while phasing out the joint venture in most other territories by the 
end of 2012. Accordingly, we have eliminated the joint venture volume from 
our reported results for both 2011 and 2012 in
 
those territories where the 
joint venture is being phased out. Please note that this change did not 
impact the company's reported volume results this quarter on a consolidated 
level or for any individual operating group.
 
Finally, with regard to our new pr
oductivity and reinvestment program, we 
reconfirm our expectations to capture total incremental annualized savings 
of $550 million to $650 million, phased over a 4
-
year period, starting in 
2012 through the end of 2015. As noted in our last call, these fund
s will 
serve to enhance our ongoing system
-
wide brand building initiatives as we 
reinvest in our business to drive long
-
term profitable growth. We're still in 
the initial stages of defining the total onetime cost associated with the 
capture of these increm
ental annualized savings, and we'll provide an update 
on these costs during our next earnings call.
 
In summary, as we begin the third year of our 2020 Vision, we are greatly 
encouraged by our business achieving yet another solid quarter of quality 
volume, 
value and profit results. Our system remains healthy and financially 
strong. We're generating cash, investing in our world
-
class brands and 
executing our consistent growth strategies from a position of real strength. 
And importantly, we continue to pay a h
ealthy dividend. Our seasoned 
leadership team and highly capable global bottling partners are taking the 
right actions and executing the right strategies to successfully realize our 
2020 Vision. So while we're still navigating through an ongoing mixed glob
al 
economic recovery, we remain confident in our ability to deliver full year 
results in line with our long
-
term growth targets.
 
Operator, we're now ready for questions.

Answer Session

[Operator Instructions] And sir, our first questi
on comes from Bill 
--
 
from 
Bryan Spillane, Bank of America.
 
Bryan D. Spillane

BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division
 
I just had just a question. You had a very strong first quarter, and I think 
what was really encouraging was how broad
-
based your volume g
rowth was 
and especially seeing markets like Japan, North America, Germany, 
Philippines, all sort of growing simultaneously. Think about the balance of 
the year. Muhtar, could you talk a little bit about how you view that 
performance carrying out through t
he balance of the year, maybe some of 
the factors that you've got in place or some of the activity you have in place 
to continue to drive that through the balance of the year? And then 
secondarily, maybe Gary, if you could just talk about if it's a 
--
 
give
n your 
potentially better view on cost balance of the year and the potential for 
some volume performance continuing to be well 
--
 
doing well this year, just 
better drop through profitability, I guess as we move through the year, if we 
can just talk a littl
e bit about that as well.
 
Muhtar Kent
 
Bryan, good morning, thanks. This is Muhtar. I think what I'd like to just get 
--
 
the message I'd like to get across is that we leave behind the first quarter 
of 2012 with confidence and with momentum in our business. 
And I think it 
is broad
-
based growth, as you mentioned. In fact, the top 10 countries in 
our business generated about 65% 
--
 
a little over 65% of the total 
incremental growth cases 
--
 
organic unit case growth in the quarter. And 
that is more broad
-
based th
an in the past. And that's a good sign. And I 
think we've always said that there's tremendous 
--
 
I see 
--
 
everywhere I go, 
I see tremendous opportunity for our brands. Our system is strong. Our 
system 
--
 
this is the result of investments that our system co
ntinues to 
make every quarter and also generating revenue, and we're able to crack 
this calculus for growth. And everywhere we go in this difficult 
macroeconomic environment, it's important to note that The Coca
-
Cola 
system is one of the most important net
 
contributors to the economy. 
Globally, we're one of the top 10 private employers, nongovernmental 
employers, and we create 
--
 
based on our vision, we will create an additional 
120,000 new jobs in the next 10 years. And more and more, governments 
are recog
nizing that unemployment is the #1, #2 and #3 priority. And I 
think with that, with our system, we're earning our right every day in every 
market. And that's important. As I 
--
 
obviously, the macroeconomic 
conditions around the world is challenged. The rec
overy is slow. 
Unemployment remains high and is 
--
 
I believe will remain high as we go 
through this year. But the premise, Bryan, on which we've built our 2020 
Vision holds true today. What we said is no matter how you slice and dice it, 
there will be abou
t 1 billion new people coming into the middle class. We'll 
have about 800 million new urbanized consumers in the decade. This decade 
that we're talking about, 2010 to 2020. Now the quarter we just left behind, 
about 22 million new urbanized consumers and a
bout 22 million to 25 million 
new middle class have been created in the world, and we were there to 
serve their needs and refresh them. So yes, challenged environment; yes, 
slow recovery; yes, some slowing down in emerging markets. But when we 
talk about s
lowing down, you go down from a 9% to an 8.5% or an 8.2%, I 
think there is still tremendous amount of growth and middle class creation 
around the world, whether you take Africa, Latin America, Asia, and we're 
there. And in the western markets, we've always
 
said our balanced 
--
 
our 
vision calls for balanced growth, balanced in geographies, balanced in 
portfolio. And once again, we were able to validate that, that is something 
that we are able to execute with our 
--
 
passionately with our bottling 
partners. So
 
I'll now pass it over to Gary to answer the second part of your 
question.
 
Gary P. Fayard
 
Bryan, I guess I'd say a couple of things. As we look, it is still a challenged 
economic environment across the world. We have seen 
--
 
if you think back, 
actually fir
st quarter of 2010, things looked like, economically, they were 
getting better and then they didn't. First quarter of 2011 looked like things 
were getting better and then they didn't. And then we've seen the significant 
volatility around commodities and cu
rrencies across the world over the last 
several years as well. So I think 
--
 
I guess where we are is trying to be 
somewhat conservative and try to say we're 3 quarters 
--
 
or 3 months into 
the year, 1 quarter into the year, the kind of the smallest quarter 
in fact, 
and I think we need to continue to go through the year. Are things looking 
better? Yes, it looks like interest is a little 
--
 
interest income is going to be a 
little bit better. It looks like if things hold, commodities will probably be 
better. So
 
things are actually looking pretty good, but I think at this point, 
our view was, we kind of hold with where we are. We kind of get through 
another quarter to kind of see how the year is going. Is the economic 
recovery that we're starting to slowly see in
 
the U.S. going to continue or 
not? So that's kind of where we are. We're kind of being 
--
 
trying to be 
conservative and recognize that we are in this as a marathon and not as a 
sprint. This is about long
-
term value creation.
 
Muhtar Kent
 
Just one point I'd
 
add to 
--
 
that to, Bryan, is that 4 years ago, we made 
some bets in terms of our strategy, our 2020 Vision, and I think those are 
now positioning us to win. And I'd say that in this volatile world 
environment, I think we see 
--
 
we are definitely a great h
edge and a 
balanced hedge in what's happening in the world.
 
Bryan D. Spillane

BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division
 
And just 
--
 
Gary, just as a follow
-
up, if it's 
--
 
if there's upside 
--
 
or Gary and 
Muhtar, if there's upside, more inclined to 
invest some of that back 
particularly given the momentum you have in some of these markets, is that 
--
 
is there more room to invest if there's more funds generated?
 
Muhtar Kent
 
Well, I'm happy to say that we are investing. If you look at our marketing 
spen
d and if you look at how we're controlling all OpEx in the right way and 
then spending on our brands and you'll see that some of those numbers in 
the first quarter, too, coming to life and that's basically how we've always 
managed this business, investing 
in our brands, investing for the long term, 
ensuring that we 
--
 
our brands remain healthy and get healthier all the time, 
which they are. And that generates, again, a great system alignment, a 
great investment picture from our 
--
 
the total cash that we gen
erated with 
our bottling partners. And I said it before, the results that you see this 
quarter, this past quarter, are not coming from the investments we made in 
this quarter. They're coming from the investments that we made 4, 5, 6, 7 
quarters ago, and th
e same is going to be true from 4 quarters or 5 quarters 
from now based on investments we're making today.

Our next question comes from Caroline Levy, CLSA.
 
Caroline S. Levy

Credit Agricole Securities (

) Inc., Research

Muhtar, the last time we met, you said that you were headed off to Asia and 
you did share quite a bit of your enthusiasm with us already, but can you 
talk a little more in depth about the prospects for Japan, China, an
d what 
the other real big drivers of growth will be going forward, and how owning 
your bottlers in some key markets within China and Japan is impacting the 
business?
 
Muhtar Kent
 
Caroline, yes, I just spent a good bit of time in Asia a couple of weeks ago. 
And I think you've seen the Pacific Group's volume growth up 8%, which 
was broad
-
based in the quarter with the numbers that we've shared with 
you for places like 
--
 
not just China and Japan up 9% and 3%, respectively, 
but also for Thailand and the Philippi
nes and so forth. And I think 
importantly, again, very encouraged that brand Coca
-
Cola is up 6% in that 
massive geography, and reported net revenue for the quarter up 12%. And I 
think 
--
 
and good price mix across. So it's important really to be able to 
ens
ure that when you have 
--
 
when we talk about sustainable growth, we 
mean growth not just in volume, not just in a certain category, but broad
-
based growth and also growth in the revenue line that can be matched or 
better than the volume line, and I think w
e've seen that. And yes, no 
question, everyone you talk to, whether it's the shop owner in any particular 
part of China or whether it's the government, or whether it's some national 
government, there is a little cooling down. Is that 
--
 
I think that's heal
thy. 
And I think that's healthy for the real estate market in China. That's healthy 
for the banking industry in China. That's healthy for the long
-
term 
sustainable growth of the economy in China, which I have no doubt is going 
to continue. So we see China 
as a fantastic opportunity. As I said, we've just 
opened our largest
-
to
-
date facility in China, 42nd, and the largest of them 
all, and LEED
-
certified on top of it. And that's again one sign of our 
commitment, many more such factories to come in our $4 bill
ion announced 
investment program for China. And so I see China as certainly playing an 
important role for our 2020 Vision. And particularly pleased about Japan, 
where I met with all our bottling partners in Tokyo and presented their 
Woodruff Cup awards to 
each one of our bottling partners. And again, 
category by category, we see very good improvement in our business in 
Japan. So the terrible tragedy of 2011 allowed us to galvanize our system 
and strengthen our system and continue to grow our system. And 
imp
ortantly, every channel, important channel, like convenience, like 
vending, is now expected to grow in Japan. And that's a very important thing 
for our business 
--
 
and categories, whether it's coffee with Georgia or 
sparkling or tea. Again, we're generatin
g growth. So prospects, I think 
overall, we've always said the picture of success in Japan is low single
-
digit 
growth. And I believe that we're poised well to achieve that target for Japan. 
And then I went to Thailand, where we're having, as I said, very g
ood 
growth prospects and share gains, tremendous share gains in that important 
market, with a very healthy consumption habit for sparkling beverages. And 
I see 
--
 
whether it's other markets like Vietnam or Indonesia or West Asia, I 
see great prospects for 
our growth. And I'll soon be also heading towards 
West Asia in a couple of months. And again, you heard the results that we've 
been able to post this past quarter in India, continue to have very healthy 
brand metrics for Coca
-
Cola, as well as our still bra
nds there in that 
incredibly prospective geography. So I think Asia, overall, little cooling, 
healthy and great long
-
term prospects for both our business, as well as I 
think leading the world out of some of the current global macro issues.

Our nex
t question comes from Judy Hong from Goldman Sachs.
 
Judy E. Hong 
-
 
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division
 
Muhtar 
--
 
sort of couple of questions, Muhtar or Gary, on North America. 
One, just in terms of the underlying industry performance and your 
perfo
rmance in North America, obviously, the macro has been getting a little 
bit better but just in Q1, do you think that there was any benefit from a 
weather perspective, if you've seen a big shift from take
-
home into 
immediate consumption? And then talking ab
out your performance in the 
context of the competitive backdrop, where, obviously, Pepsi has talked 
about spending more money, so what sort of impact are you seeing from a 
competitive perspective in North America? And then Gary, just on the 
profitability s
ide in North America, if you can just walk us through the puts 
and takes in Q1 as it relates to cycling of the commodities and kind of for 
the balance of the year, how should we think about the phasing of 
commodities and the margins in North America as we 
go forward?
 
Muhtar Kent
 
Judy, let me just take the first part of the question. I think we continue to 
see validation, a little more validation, on what I indicated also in the 
previous call. There are some signs, healthier signs, from the U.S. consumer 
rig
ht now than it was 12 months ago at this time in terms of more travel, 
more mobility, more bookings. And mobility is an important factor for our 
business for consumer goods. And also, I think eating out, a little healthier 
numbers in terms of that, that we
 
were seeing compared to, say, 12 to 16 
months ago. Having said that 
--
 
and I do believe that, that trend is likely to 
continue, providing we can sort of keep 
--
 
have some prices on the 
--
 
at the 
pump for gasoline where 
--
 
about where they stay now. So I p
remise that 
with that caveat. I think for 
--
 
we have always said that United States is a 
growth business. Despite the current macroeconomic challenges, we've been 
posting growth quarter after quarter. I'm very pleased that this past quarter 
also that spark
ling beverages was positive, brand Coca
-
Cola was positive. 
And we've started putting together the framework for our growth in North 
America way before the acquisition of the CCE business in North America. I 
want to reiterate that once again. The brand, pri
ce, pack, channel 
architecture, the 
--
 
beginning 
--
 
getting our brands to a healthier position 
than they were previously, getting the right package to be sold at the right 
outlet and the right channel at the right price, all of that architecture we 
started
 
working on 3 to 4 years ago. And I think we are seeing some results 
out of all of that work. And as I've said, we believe that the positive 
sentiment that we see compared to a year ago of the U.S. consumer, slightly 
positive sentiment would probably conti
nue is what I would estimate, 
providing other conditions hold, particularly the price of gasoline. Gary?
 
Gary P. Fayard
 
Yes. Judy, I'd say just a couple of things. And the first, I just want to 
congratulate our colleagues in North America because I think i
f you 
--
 
as you 
think about it and think about this quarter, it was sparkling plus 1, brand 
Coca
-
Cola positive growth in the quarter. And those are things that not that 
long ago, I think everyone listening in this call would have said it's 
impossible to do
. And it's really working. Everything that Muhtar is talking 
about is actually working. And our brand score is getting better because of 
the things we have been doing over the last few years. But then, if you look 
at, ""All right, great, Gary, got that, but
 
let's talk about the financial results 
and you're showing that on a comparable basis, operating income is down 
9% quarter on quarter. So how do you talk about that?"" Well, on that one, 
that is the issue that I alerted, I think, all of you to earlier this 
quarter. The 
way the commodities hit last year, that $800 million of commodity pressure 
that we had last year, it all was in quarters 2, 3 and 4, basically, none of it 
in the numbers in Q1 in North America. So when you adjust for that for just 
commodities,
 
that minus 9 actually gets to only slightly negative. And then 
you have to recognize that there was one less day. You adjust for that and 
actually, North America suddenly flips into it was actually positive. You take 
that then you look at remainder of yea
r, and you recognize that we've 
gotten the pricing so that the commodities aren't going to be that as big an 
issue going forward, remainder of year. And all the other things we've been 
doing, we would expect to see North America in very good positive terri
tory, 
remainder of year. Things are going, knock on wood, exactly the way we 
planned for them, too, at this point.
 
Muhtar Kent
 
Just one last quick add onto that, Judy. Importantly to note, the strategic 
focus in North America remains consistent on continui
ng to build strong 
brands, creating value with our customers and building our systems, 
continuing to build our system capability. And so the strategic focus remains 
in place. Secondly, in this past quarter, I'd note also that IC growth was 
ahead of total v
olume growth in North America. That also helped generate a 
good price mix for our total business. And also, of course, I just want to 
make sure I mention the share gains that are continuing across the board in 
North America for us.
 
Judy E. Hong

Goldman S
achs Group Inc., Research Division
 
Great. Gary, just on 
--
 
so if I think about that 3%, the cycling of the lower 
commodity impact on your operating profit, that's about $75 million. And 
when you think about you're saying North America would have been sligh
tly 
down x that cycling. So the impact on North America from that would have 
been about $50 million and the rest would be in BG 
--
 
BIG?
 
Gary P. Fayard
 
Yes, the rest would have been in BIG.
 
Judy E. Hong 
-
 
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division
 
Okay, an
d the phasing of the $400 million of commodities this year is much 
more evenly spread out. I guess we'll see depending on the commodity cost 
as we go forward, but it's much more evenly spread out. So we should start 
to see really the much more benign impac
t starting in Q2.
 
Gary P. Fayard
 
Very well put. That's exactly right, exactly right. And then as I kind of 
mentioned when 
--
 
to Bryan's question earlier, if then commodities hold with 
where they are today, that actually $350 million to $450 million, so cal
l it 
$400 million, actually could be coming down to the lower end and becoming 
more favorable versus what we've been talking about.

Our next question comes from Bonnie Herzog from Wells Fargo.
 
Bonnie Herzog

Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, 
Research Division
 
I wanted to go back to a question on China. I was actually hoping you could 
talk about the competitive landscape given Pepsi's new strategic alliance 
with Tingyi and how that may impact your business and strategy. I guess 
thinking about i
t, the alliance of the 2 strong competitors, wouldn't this 
accelerate the pace that you execute your game plan? And also, could you 
give us some color on how you will allocate the $4 billion investment among 
your different initiatives there? For instance, 
will you spend more on 
infrastructure than brand building in the next few years?
 
Muhtar Kent
 
Okay, Bonnie. I think we have a strategy for China. That strategy is not 
changing with what's happening across the industry. I want to reiterate that. 
That strateg
y is valid and still in place. And obviously, it will evolve as we 
introduce a wider variety of packages to promote affordability, it has the 
consumer experience with our brands, all with a focus to drive incremental 
increased transactions and profitable g
rowth. And to continue building brand 
equity with consumers, I think this is critical for us and that will 
--
 
you will 
see us continue to do that. I believe that we're confident in our ability to 
deliver double
-
digit growth over the long term, and I think 
continuing 
introduction of a wider variety of packages to promote affordability and I 
think immediate consumption growth. So we will continue driving all of those 
priorities. As far as the investments are concerned, $4 billion, that I would 
say probably it
's 
--
 
you could allocate about 50% into infrastructure and 
50% into the brand building area. That's probably a good split. And if you 
looked at the past 3 years, that's probably where it ended up.

Our next question comes from John Faucher with JPM
organ.
 
John A. Faucher 
-
 
JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division
 
Gary, just wanted to follow up on Judy's question a little bit, which was 
--
 
and I apologize if I missed this. If we strip out the commodity stuff, what 
have you, the revenue growth was still
 
great but the operating profit, I 
think, was still down. So is that a profit mix issue? Is that simply an 
investment issue? And then Muhtar, I just was wondering if you could clarify 
something because in your comments, you guys hadn't stated explicitly th
at 
you would gain share in sparkling, but you just mentioned that you had 
share gains across the board. So is that a safe assumption then that you 
guys did in fact have share gains in North America in sparkling?
 
Gary P. Fayard
 
Yes, John. Let me start 
--
 
we
ll, in fact, I'll go ahead and answer that last 
part first. We did have share gains pretty much across the board, across the 
world and the U.S. So we did have share gains in sparkling. On the 
commodity issue relative to North America, and if I don't exactl
y answer the 
question, just come back and tell me, but basically, if you strip out the 
commodity impact, North America's OI for the quarter instead of being down 
9 would have been down 1. It's exactly what it would have been. And if then 
--
 
if you add in a
n extra day, it would have been positive. So what you're 
seeing is that 1 day, actually 1 less day, is having a huge impact on the P&L 
because you've got basically all of the costs going through for the full 
quarter with a day less sales is basically what'
s happening, which is why 
when you go to Q2 and 3, actually, it becomes much more normalized and 
the commodities are not an issue at all. In fact, it kind of reverses a little bit 
because you had more of that hitting in Q2 and 3 last year, with none of it 
hitting in Q1 last year. So it's kind of a cycling thing, but that's why when 
you adjust for all that, our view is and what we had planned and what we 
saw all along is that North America actually started to improve significantly 
after Q1 into the remainder
 
of the year. And that's kind of what 
--
 
that's 
exactly what we're seeing today.

So if we map out the cadence over the course of the year, it seems like what 
we probably should see and you factor in your FX guidance, is it 
--
 
should 
we be looking at the numbers sort of a l
ittle more back
-
end loaded, a little 
more Q4 weighted with a little bit tougher Q2 when you put all this stuff 
together? Is that kind of the right cadence then?
 
Gary P. Fayard
 
Yes, John, it is. It is. Now the CFO is going to come out in me, okay, because 
w
hen my own guys 
--
 
and I get a rolling estimate here. And when I see that, 
I say, ""Oh, you've given me a hockey stick,"" and so we're 
--
 
you try to 
manage against that as you're managing the business appropriately. But the 
cadence of the business this year 
actually is exactly as you just said it. 
That's exactly right. It is more back
-
end loaded because of how the 
commodities hit and went through the P&L last year and the 1 day less in 
the first quarter, 2 extra days in the fourth quarter. Some of the reason 
--
 
I 
have to hedge a little bit on this, is because there was 1 less day, you had a 
little bit of an Easter shift to help probably the first quarter slightly, but you 
really can't measure it. So I'd say basically, what you're saying is exactly 
right.

And just to add on the North America front, John, I think it's important to 
note that we 
--
 
North America, I want to reiterate, had a great quarter in 
terms of both volume, revenue, overall NARTD share gains. And also, we 
see, importantly, a rationa
l pricing environment in North America. A 3% 
price mix gain is very important, and I think those things should really give 
indication of health of the business as we move into the second and third 
quarters, important second and third quarters of the year. 
And therefore, I 
am pleased with the results in North America. And again, I think Gary 
explained the anomaly of comparability there in terms of the operating 
income number.
 
Operator
 
And our final question comes from Bill Schmitz with Deutsche Bank.

Can you just talk about the global competitive environment relative to what 
you thought it was going to be heading into the year? I know you discussed 
North America a little bit. Can you broaden that globally?
 
And I have a 
follow
-
up.
 
Muhtar Kent
 
Yes, well, it's hand
-
to
-
hand combat out there every single day and 
everywhere 
--
 
but everywhere I go, everywhere our operators go, 
everywhere our leadership goes, we see opportunity. We see opportunity for 
our brands th
at are stronger. We earn our price every day. We're generating 
revenue growth. We're net contributors to the economies, and our brands 
are healthy. And our IC business is growing ahead of our total business, and 
that's a good thing for the world. Our IC bu
siness globally grew 6% in the 
world compared to 5% global volume growth. And by the way, this volume 
growth that we just had in the first quarter is one of the highest organic 
volume growths we've had in the last, say, 8 to 10 quarters that I look back, 
b
ecause this is all
-
pure organic growth and it is strong and there is 
momentum. And I think, as I've said, the competitive environment, I think, 
out in the world is obviously, consumers are reticent to go out, to spend 
money. The environment is not healthy,
 
particularly in Europe in terms of 
consumer sentiment, but our business is able to continue to invest and also 
ensure that we generate value for our customers in Europe, in this case 
large customers, large format, small format. And one of the really impor
tant 
metrics that we always follow is immediate consumption, which is a healthier 
mix. It's growing ahead of our total business. And once again, that is a 
testament to the strength of our system because you can always 
--
 
it's much 
easier to go and gain dis
tribution in the future consumption channel, but in 
order to ensure that you supply and work in partner with every single small 
format store takes a very strong and a very different kind of system, which 
is the one we have.

Great, and maybe just a little more granular, I mean, relative to what you 
expected headed into the year, because it seems like maybe in Europe, the 
promotional and pricing environments may be a little bit worse and then
 
we 
obviously saw Pepsi show their cards, and perhaps the competitive 
environment in North America is a little better. Is that fair?
 
Muhtar Kent
 
I think the environment in Europe is not any better for sure. But look at 
some of the numbers that I shared wit
h you earlier, up 6% in Spain, up 4% 
in Italy, up 
--
 
Germany continues to grow, Southeast Europe beginning to 
show signs. I've said before, Europe is a tale of 2, 3 cities at least. You've 
got Eastern Europe beginning to come out, led by Russia. You've got
 
Southern Europe beginning to stabilize, and Central and Northern Europe is 
still 
--
 
and led by Germany is 
--
 
I think the sentiment is slightly improving. 
So overall, the Southern Europe still remains an importantly challenged 
area, but our business system
 
is very strong in Southern Europe, and we're 
benefiting from that. In the U.S., as I said, consumer sentiment in terms of 
mobility, in terms of travel bookings, in terms of travel with 
--
 
on the 
highways, in terms of eating out, is better than it was 12 t
o 16 months ago.
 
Gary P. Fayard
 
This is Gary. I want to come back, John Faucher, on your question. I want to 
correct one thing. In North America's share, I went back and looked at the 
numbers as we were looking at this. We gained value and volume share in 
total nonalcoholic beverages. We gained significant volume and value share 
in still. In sparkling, it was a slight loss of share. And the reason I said that 
we actually gained share is internally, as I was thinking about it, I was 
actually taking some pipe
line, filling out. That's not the way you should look 
at it. So there was a slight loss of share.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Coca
-
Cola Company's 
Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2010 Earnings Results Conference Call. 
[Operator Instructions] I would now like to introduce Jason (sic) [Jackson] 
Kelly, Vice 
President and Director of Investor Relations. Mr. Kelly, you may 
begin.
 
Jackson Kelly
 
Good morning, and thank you for being with us today. I'm joined by Muhtar 
Kent, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Gary Fayard, our Chief 
Financial Officer. Fo
llowing prepared remarks this morning, we will turn the 
call over for your questions.
 
Before we begin, I would like to remind you that this conference call may 
contain forward
-
looking statements, including statements concerning long
-
term earnings objective
, and should be considered in conjunction with 
cautionary statements contained in our earnings release and in the 
company's most recent periodic SEC report. In addition, I would also like to 
note that we have posted schedules on our company website at 
www.
thecocacolacompany.com, under the Reports and Financial Information 
tab in the Investors section, which reconcile certain non
-
GAAP financial 
measures that may be referred to by our senior executives in our discussion 
this morning and from time to time in o
ur discussing our financial 
performance to our results as reported under Generally Accepted Accounting 
Principles. Please look on our website for this information.
 
Now with that, I'll turn the call over to Muhtar.
 
Muhtar Kent
 
Thank you, Jackson, and good m
orning, everyone. I'm pleased to report that 
once again, the Coca
-
Cola Company delivered strong results this quarter and 
ended 2010 having realized another year of solid growth and success.
 
In 2010, we met or exceeded all of our long
-
term growth targets. A
nd we 
achieved these results against a backdrop of an unbalanced global economic 
recovery and while completing our acquisition of CCE's North America 
business.
 
At the same time, we once more gained volume and value share in Global 
non
-
alcoholic beverages. 
We also gained global volume in both the sparkling 
and still ready
-
to
-
drink beverage categories. Together, with our global 
bottling partners, we are decisively executing our 2020 Vision and are 
advancing our momentum.
 
Our brands are stronger and healthier,
 
fueled dynamically by our marketing 
and innovation. Brand Coca
-
Cola, the very oxygen of our business, grew 4% 
for both the quarter and the full year, the highest full year growth our 
wonderful flagship brand has achieved in over a decade. Our investments 
are rising as we keenly focused on expanding our profitable operations in a 
sustainable way across more than 200 markets where we do business today.
 
Our business in North America is growing again. We delivered positive 
organic volume growth for the full ye
ar in North America. This complements 
the rapid and successful work we're doing to integrate our North America 
business, all designed to bring greater growth, profitability and value to our 
flagship market. And today, our system is more aligned than it has
 
been in a 
decade. In 2010, the first year of our 2020 Vision, we executed and 
performed as one closely coordinated global system. No question, the 
journey to our 2020 Vision is underway.
 
Turning now to our performance results. I'm happy to report that our
 
volume growth grew a strong 6% in the quarter. Excluding the benefit of our 
new cross
-
licensed brands, primarily Dr. Pepper brands in North America, 
our quarterly volume growth was a strong 5%. This was fueled by organic 
volume growth in every one of our 
five geographic operating groups.
 
As for the full year, we also grew our global volume 5%, again ahead of our 
long
-
term growth target and delivered over $1 billion unit cases of 
incremental organic volume growth. That is more than the equivalent of 
adding 
another Japan to our business.
 
We increased fourth quarter net revenues 45% on a comparable currency 
neutral basis. For the full year, we grew comparable currency neutral net 
revenues 14% in line with our long
-
term growth target, even after excluding 
the b
enefit of structural changes, principally due to the CCE transaction and 
the benefit of new cross
-
licensed brand.
 
This quarter, we reported comparable earnings per share of $0.72, up 9% 
versus the prior year and at the high end of our long
-
term growth targ
et. On 
a full year basis, we delivered comparable earnings per share growth of 
14%, well ahead of our long
-
term growth target.
 
And our fourth quarter comparable currency neutral operating income 
growth was 10%. This brings our full year comparable currency
 
neutral 
operating income to 11%, also above our long
-
term growth target. In fact, 
this is the fifth consecutive year we have either met or exceeded our long
-
term profit growth target.
 
These strong fourth quarter and full year 2010 performance results furt
her 
strengthened the foundation of our business and provide us with great 
momentum as we embark on 2011, the second year of our journey to 2020.
 
Now let's review our performance results across our global markets in more 
detail beginning with North America,
 
our flagship market. North America 
volume was up 8% this quarter, with organic volume growth of 3%, 
excluding the benefit of our new cross
-
licensed brands. This was North 
America's third consecutive quarter of positive organic growth. On a full year 
basis
, our North America volume was up 2% and organic volume was up 
1%, excluding again the benefit of our new cross
-
licensed brands.
 
The same time, this past quarter, we completed the acquisition of CCE's 
North America business on plan and on schedule. Today, 
we're very pleased 
to report that our new operating structure and our leadership teams are well 
in place, and that our integration efforts are proceeding exactly as planned.
 
Sparkling beverages in North America, excluding the benefit of our new 
cross
-
licen
sed brands, were up 1% in the quarter and even for the full year. 
Including the benefit of our cross
-
licensed brands, North America sparkling 
beverages were up 8% for the quarter and 1% for the full year. Importantly, 
North America grew sparkling volume an
d value share for the quarter and 
full year versus the total category, as well as versus our primary competitor. 
Trademark Coca
-
Cola in North America was up 1% in the quarter, led by 
Coke Zero, which delivered double
-
digit volume growth for the 19th 
consec
utive quarter. Sprite had a third consecutive quarter of positive 
growth up 4% for the quarter and 2% for the full year. Fanta also delivered 
positive growth for the quarter and the full year.
 
We also extended the footprint of our innovative Coca
-
Cola Free
style 
fountain dispensers. This game
-
changing innovation is now available in more 
than 400 locations across 20 U.S. markets, providing a greater choice of 
brands to our customers and our consumers. Plans for further expansion in 
2011 are well on track with
 
availability expected to reach more than 80 U.S. 
markets by the end of 2011. All of these developments reaffirm the fact that 
our system is executing the right strategies to sustainably drive growth 
across our entire North America sparkling beverage portf
olio.
 
Turning to North America still beverages. I'm pleased to report a strong 7% 
increase for the quarter and 5% growth for the full year. We have now 
grown volume share for our still beverages for 12 of the past 14 quarters 
and value share for 13 of the 
last 14 quarters. Our North America Juices and 
Juice Drink business delivered positive full year growth of 2%. This was 
fueled by our Simply brand up double
-
digits for the full year.
 
In the North America Tea category, we saw 11% growth in the quarter and 
1
2% for the full year, led by Gold Peak, which more than doubled its volume 
in 2010. Our glacéau brands grew 19% in the quarter, and our vitaminwater 
trademark growth up double digits was led by the further expansion of 
vitaminwater zero. In addition, smart
water delivered another quarter of 
strong double
-
digit growth.
 
POWERade was up a solid 20% in the quarter, outperforming the North 
America's sports drinks category and gaining share versus our primary 
competitor for the ninth consecutive quarter. For the f
ull year, POWERade 
delivered strong 19% growth, including over 60% full year growth for 
POWERade Zero, our innovative zero calories sports drink.
 
These strong results in North America are a testament to our long
-
held belief 
that through strong marketing an
d focused execution, we can accelerate our 
leadership position within North America and drive profitable and sustainable 
growth in our flagship market.
 
Now let me turn to Eurasia and Africa. This operating group saw broad
-
based growth, up 14% in the fourth
 
quarter and 12% for the full year. Once 
again, all nine business units in this operating group delivered positive 
volume growth. Importantly, brand Coca
-
Cola was up 12% for the quarter 
and up 10% for the full year, benefiting from our strategic investment
s 
across the entire region. This strong performance in Eurasia and Africa was 
led by Russia, up 31% this quarter and finishing the full year up 16%. We 
once again outperformed the market in Russia this quarter, led by the 
continued strong performance of ou
r core sparkling brands. Brand Coca
-
Cola 
in Russia was up 37%, for the quarter and up 26% for the full year. This 
performance represents the largest ever single
-
year incremental volume 
growth for brand Coca
-
Cola in Russia. It is no surprise therefore that 
Coca
-
Cola was recently awarded the Best Soft Drink of the Year at Russia's Brand 
of the Year Award ceremony. As such, we believe we are ideally positioned 
to outperform our primary international competitor in Russia.
 
India, meanwhile, returned to double
-
di
git growth, up 12% in the fourth 
quarter and 17% on a full year basis. This market has now achieved double
-
digit growth in nine of the last quarters. And India captured share growth 
across our sparkling and still portfolio in both the quarter and on a full
 
year 
basis. This shows, demonstrates that India is delivering high
-
quality growth 
consistently across our entire portfolio rather than relying on select growth 
from any single category.
 
Sparkling beverage growth in India was led by trademark Coca
-
Cola and 
trademark Sprite, both up double digits in the quarter and for the full year. 
In fact, our brands now represents four of the top five sparkling brands in 
India. And our still beverage gr
owth in India benefited from the further 
expansion of our Maaza juice brand, up double digits in the quarter and for 
the full year.
 
We also grew double digits in both the quarter and the full year in Turkey, 
Southern Eurasia and the Middle East. As for per
formance in Africa, South 
Africa delivered 8% unit case volume growth for the quarter and 5% for the 
full year, building on our momentum coming out of last summer's FIFA 
World Cup activation program, as well as our ongoing in
-
market 
investments. We also sa
w double
-
digit growth in East and Central Africa and 
high single
-
digit growth in North and West Africa, providing a very strong 
and consistent finish to our full year performance throughout the African 
continent.
 
Moving to our Pacific Group, overall volume
 
growth was up 1% in the fourth 
quarter, cycling 11% from the previous year, bringing our full year volume 
growth to 6%. These results were driven by a second consecutive quarter of 
positive growth for Japan, which was up 2% for the quarter and 3% for the 
full year. This growth in Japan was widespread across our beverage 
portfolio. Leading the way was Coca
-
Cola trademark, up 5% in Japan this 
quarter, a fourth consecutive quarter of positive growth. On a full year basis, 
Coca
-
Cola trademark was also up 5%, m
aking this the fourth consecutive 
year Coca
-
Cola trademark has grown 3% or more in Japan. We are 
encouraged by the recent momentum in this highly profitable developed 
market. But having said that, we remain cautious about the current and 
ongoing economic c
hallenges in Japan.
 
Turning to China. Our full year volume grew 6%, with fourth quarter volume 
down 3%. You will recall this quarter that we are cycling 29% volume 
growth from the prior year. As we indicated in our first quarter 2010 
earnings call, it is n
ot uncommon to see quarter
-
to
-
quarter volume swings in 
China. This is especially true between the fourth quarter and the first quarter 
of every year, given that fluctuating end of year trading activity, driven by 
the very timing of Chinese New Year. That s
aid, our Sparkling Beverages 
and Juice and Juice Drinks captured volume and value share in China in the 
fourth quarter.
 
For the full year, 2010, we grew our business in China by over $100 million 
incremental unit cases, our seventh consecutive year of achi
eving this level 
of incremental unit case growth. And cumulatively over the last two years, 
we've expanded our volume in China by 24%, significantly widening the gap 
with our primary international competitor. Over the same two
-
year time 
period, our compoun
ded annual growth rate in China was 11%, in line with 
our long term double
-
digit growth objectives for China.
 
This last quarter of 2010 marked a significant milestone for our business in 
China as Minute Maid Pulpy, a brand born and launched in China achiev
ed $1 
billion brand status in only five years. Minute Maid Pulpy is now our 
company's 14th billion
-
dollar brand. The rapid scalability of the Pulpy brand 
across 18 other markets is actually a testament to our systems' ability to 
rapidly adopt and scale bra
nd innovation from any part of the world.
 
Looking ahead to 2011, we are adapting our in
-
market strategies to make 
sure that we keep building on our strong foundation and remain well 
positioned to win in China between now and 2020. As more remote areas of 
C
hina experience accelerated economic growth, we are investing heavily to 
expand the scale of our distribution. In the fourth quarter of 2010 alone, we 
opened three new plants to further enhance our ability to serve China's 
growing consumer and customer bas
e.
 
As the retail trade in the coastal regions further evolves from traditional local 
outlets to newer and larger channels, we're also investing heavily to grow in 
the hyper and supermarket channels. And as the Chinese consumer 
demands increasingly varied a
nd sophisticated offerings, we are innovating 
and introducing a wider variety of packaged choices that will drive increased 
transactions and build brand equity.
 
Our team in China is executing all of these strategic actions to build greater 
brands across ca
tegories to drive strong and sustainable growth in this 
important market. As we've said before, the real measure of our success in 
China will be how we continue to seize growth opportunities in that region 
between now and 2020. While we may see some quarte
r
-
to
-
quarter 
fluctuations, we're confident that we have the right strategy, the right 
execution plans and the right capabilities in place today, and are better 
positioned than our competitors to deliver long
-
term sustainable double
-
digit 
growth in China.
 
O
ur positive full year results in Japan and China were further complemented 
by our performance across the region. For example, the Philippines, 
Thailand, Korea and Vietnam each grew double digits for the full year. These 
four specific countries combined gre
w well over $100 million incremental 
unit cases in 2010. This demonstrates the strength and value of our Pacific 
Group's broad geographic portfolio.
 
In addition, Brazil, Russia, India and China, commonly referred to as the 
BRIC nations, grew 10% as a whole
 
for the full year. It is worth noting that 
these four BRIC countries represented over $400 million cases of 
incremental growth in 2010 or almost 40% of our company's total 
incremental volume growth for the year.
 
Moving now to Latin America. Volume grew a 
steady 5% for both the quarter 
and the full year. We also gained volume and value share in the total non
-
alcoholic ready
-
to
-
drink beverages, as well as sparkling and still beverages. 
This broad
-
based growth was led by brand Coca
-
Cola, up 4% for the quarter
 
and 5% for the full year.
 
Brazil delivered strong results, with volume up 7% for the quarter and 11% 
for the year. This also marked the fourth consecutive quarter that Brazil has 
gained volume and value share in total non
-
alcoholic ready
-
to
-
drink 
beverage
s.
 
Mexico volume was up 8% for the quarter and 3% for the full year as 
weather conditions normalized from the previous quarter. Mexico has now 
gained non
-
alcoholic ready
-
to
-
drink beverage volume share from 15 of the 
last 16 quarters and value share for 16 
consecutive quarters. Our South 
Latin business, which includes Argentina and Chile, delivered mid
-
single digit 
growth for both the quarter and the full year, rounding out another solid and 
consistent year for our Latin America operating group.
 
Moving to Eu
rope, we saw positive growth in the quarter despite ongoing 
economic challenges. Volume was up 2% for the quarter and even for the 
full year. Our performance in sparkling beverages in Europe was led by 
trademark Coca
-
Cola up 2% for the quarter and 1% for t
he full year. Our 
still beverages in Europe were up 5% for the quarter, with tea up 9% and 
energy drinks up double digits.
 
France was up mid
-
single digits for both the quarter and the full year, 
making this the fifth consecutive year of positive growth in 
this key 
developed market. Additionally, trademark Coca
-
Cola was up 5% for the full 
year. Great Britain delivered low single
-
digit growth for both the quarter and 
the full year, supported by growth across both our sparkling and still 
beverage portfolios.
 
A
nd while economic challenges remain across many parts of Europe, we're 
starting to see initial signs of recovery. In fact, several Central European 
countries including the Czech Republic and Slovakia, saw double
-
digit growth 
in the quarter, and others such
 
as Romania, Switzerland, Austria, grew mid
-
 
to high
-
single digits in the quarter. And Germany closed the year up 1% its 
first full year of positive volume growth since 2007. Importantly, we gained 
volume and value share in Germany to both the quarter and 
the full year.
 
Now let's turn to an overview of our brands and their performance. As we've 
said before, we always place our brands first in all that we do across each 
and every one of the 206 countries around the globe. As a result for the 
total company, o
ur sparkling beverages grew 3% in the quarter, excluding 
the benefit of new cross
-
licensed brands, with international sparkling 
beverage volume up 4%.
 
Coca
-
Cola Zero continues to be one of our fastest growing global sparkling 
beverages. Earlier, I referenc
ed Coke Zero's uninterrupted string of success 
in North America. In fact, this momentum extends around the world with 
Coca
-
Cola Zero up 9% for the quarter and up 7% for the full year across our 
international markets. And in 2010, Fanta grew 4% for the quar
ter and 3% 
for the full year and became our company's third brand to surpass $2 billion 
annual unit case sales, along with Coca
-
Cola and Sprite.
 
We're also successfully expanding our global still beverage portfolio. Total 
worldwide still beverage unit case
 
volume increased 9% in the quarter and 
10% for the full year, led by the further expansion of our global Juice and 
Juice Drinks and Sports Drinks businesses. In 2010, we grew our overall 
Juice and Juice Drink business by double digits in the quarter and 9
% for the 
full year. These results build on a very successful decade for our global Juice 
and Juice Drink business, which delivered a compounded annual growth rate 
of greater than 9% over the past decade.
 
Our global Sports Drink business registered a very 
strong result in 2010, up 
14% for the full year. These results, driven by our global FIFA World Cup 
programs, were balanced across key geographies, including North America, 
Japan, Spain and Mexico.
 
We also saw ongoing success with the global expansion of v
itaminwater with 
international sales nearly doubling in 2010. vitaminwater is now present in 
20 international markets, with plans to launch into four new markets in the 
first quarter of 2011. This great momentum in our brand portfolio is further 
supported 
by a balanced customer
-
growth plans and our disciplined 
execution culture. For example, our full year results with our top 10 global 
retail customers saw high single
-
digit volume and revenue growth.
 
Our sales of immediate
-
consumption beverages grew 4% for 
the full year, 
driven by our focused in
-
store activation efforts and cold drink equipment 
expansion. In fact, as a global system, we placed over 1 million new pieces 
of cold drink equipment in 2010 with more than 1/3 of these placed in 
China, India and Bra
zil.
 
We're also focused on expanding our right execution daily for Red program. 
Red is our world class commercial process designed to improve execution at 
the output level. Our internal pilot studies show that bottlers implementing 
Red saw an average volum
e growth of more than 10% over the life of the 
pilot period. Today, operations representing nearly a quarter of our global 
volume utilize Red. And going forward, this program will be an area of 
increasing emphasis and growth for our system.
 
Our results acr
oss operations and with our customers around the world point 
to a well
-
aligned and focused global Coca
-
Cola system, vigorously and 
passionately executing a common set of strategies and delivering on our 
2020 Vision.
 
One of the ways we established such a st
rong foundation in 2010 was 
through the innovative and world
-
class methods: We engage and connect 
with our consumers each and every single day. Last December for example, 
we accomplished our most ambitious social media project ever named 
Expedition 206. Ov
er 365 days, three Coca
-
Cola Happiness Ambassadors, 
traveled more than 275,000 miles and visited 186 countries on a mission to 
seek out and document sources of happiness around the world. Our 
Happiness Ambassadors brought their adventure to life for fans a
nd 
followers in real time across social networking sites, bringing millions of 
people together in a way that only a brand with Coca
-
Cola's global reach 
could hope to accomplish. One of the sites in which the story came to life 
was our Coca
-
Cola Facebook fa
n page, where we currently have over 22 
million fans, making us the most popular consumer brand page on Facebook.
 
And to put this in perspective, 22 million Coca
-
Cola fans is roughly 
equivalent to the average viewership of American Idol, one of television'
s 
most popular programs. And our Facebook fan page is growing each and 
every week, with over 75% of our current fan base under the age of 25. This 
is another great example of how we are successfully engaging and building 
brand love with a whole new generat
ion of consumers.
 
As we further build our business momentum across the world, we're also 
committed to building a better tomorrow. Last month, we announced that 
we are expanding our collaboration with International Federation of Red 
Cross and Red Crescent S
ocieties, the world's largest humanitarian agency. 
Together, with our global bottling partners, we worked with the Red Cross 
and Red Crescent Societies in more than 50 countries. This partnership has 
helped provide disaster relief immediately after earthqu
akes in Haiti, Italy, 
China and Pakistan, droughts in Kenya, and more recently, flooding in 
Australia. We're proud to partner with this great organization to extend its 
worldwide reach. I'd like to invite all of you to visit our website to learn more 
about
 
these and many other initiatives and programs we have in place to 
advance our sustainability goals and efforts.
 
2011 marks the 125th anniversary of Coca
-
Cola, a refreshing and affordable 
luxury available to consumers everywhere for just cents at a time. However, 
Coca
-
Cola's 125 journey is actually testament to our youth, not our age. 
There's something special about 
our enterprise that is in a state of constant 
renewal and dynamic growth. As we begin the second year of our 2020 
Vision, we do so from a position of real strength and real momentum.
 
We see opportunities ahead as exciting as those our predecessors must hav
e 
seen 125 years ago, and we intend to capitalize on these opportunities by: 
first, investing further in our marketing, sales and infrastructure capabilities; 
secondly, by advancing our sustainability efforts to drive our business and 
extend our social lic
ense to operate everywhere; third, by embedding 
ourselves even further into our customers' growth strategies; and last but 
not least, by continuing to innovate across every aspect of our global 
enterprise.
 
Whether you've been a part of our journey for most
 
of our 125
-
year history 
or a more recent investor, we sincerely thank you for your trust and 
confidence in our business. And as we look ahead to 2020 and beyond, we 
remain relevantly focused on advancing our global momentum to deliver 
long
-
term sustainabl
e growth and value for you and all of our share owners.
 
So with that, let me just turn the call over to Gary. Thank you.
 
Gary Fayard
 
Thanks, Muhtar. Good morning, everyone. To recap Muhtar's earlier 
remarks, we once again delivered consistent quality volum
e, revenue and 
profit growth both in the fourth quarter and for the full year.
 
Our volume and profit results were in line with or exceeded our long
-
term 
growth targets for the fifth consecutive year, reaffirming that our global 
leadership teams across our 
system are executing the right strategic plans 
to achieve our 2020 Vision. Today, we will discuss our comparable currency 
neutral results for the fourth quarter and the full year. This is consistent with 
how we've historically communicated our results, as 
in our opinion, this 
provides a more complete picture of our underlying business performance.
 
That said, before going into the details of our financial highlights, we 
acknowledge that this quarter's comparable currency neutral results include 
significant s
tructural changes principally related to our recent CCE 
transaction. For this reason, we're also providing the net impact of these 
structural changes to help you better understand our results and our 
performance in relation to our long
-
term growth targets.
 
To be clear, when we refer to the impact of structural items, these include: 
the acquisition of CCE's North American operations, new cross
-
licensed 
brands, principally Dr. Pepper, the sale of our Norway and Sweden bottlers, 
the elimination of CCE equity i
ncome and some other smaller structural 
items.
 
So let's start with our earnings results. As outlined in our release this 
morning, we reported comparable earnings per share for the quarter of 
$0.72, up 9% versus the prior year. As we shared during our Decem
ber 
2010 modeling call, excluding the impact of one
-
time items, we anticipated 
that our recent transaction with CCE would be slightly dilutive to our 
comparable fourth quarter 2010 results. Today, we confirm that our 
transaction with CCE was in fact dilute
d by $0.02 per share to our 
comparable fourth quarter 2010 results.
 
For the quarter, our comparable currency neutral net revenues were up 
45%, driven by strong 6% increase in concentrate sales, 2% positive price 
mix and a 37% benefit from structural items.
 
Our full year comparable 
currency neutral net revenues increased 14%. This growth was composed of 
a 5% increase in concentrate sales in line with unit case sales, 1% positive 
price mix and an 8% benefit from structural items. This 1% full year price 
mix r
esult came in just slightly ahead of our full year outlook, sustaining a 
year
-
long trend of sequential improvement. This reflects the recent strength 
of our developed markets, which helped offset the impact of expected and 
ongoing geographic mix, given gro
wth in our emerging and developing 
markets.
 
As for 2011, it would be reasonable to expect positive price mix results 
consistent with that as implied by our long
-
term growth targets.
 
We delivered consistent gross profit growth with our comparable currency 
n
eutral gross profit increasing 36% for the quarter and 14% for the full year, 
including a structural benefit of 28% in the quarter and 7% in the full year. 
It's important to note that all five of our geographic operating groups have 
positive comparable cur
rency neutral gross margin growth for the full year. 
As for our comparable currency neutral operating income, this grew 10% for 
the quarter and 11% for the full year. This benefit from structural items was 
3% in the quarter and 1% in the full year.
 
Currenc
y had a 1% positive impact on operating income in the quarter and 
3% positive impact in the full year, which results in comparable operating 
income growth of 11% for the quarter and 14% for the full year.
 
Comparable currency neutral cost of goods sold incr
eased 60% in the 
quarter, primarily driven by 52% increase related to structural changes. 
Comparable currency neutral cost of goods sold increased 15% for the full 
year, reflecting a 12% increase related to structural changes, bringing our 
full year cost o
f goods result in line with outlook we provided in our last 
earnings call.
 
Our comparable currency neutral SG&A expenses increased 52% for the 
quarter, including a 45% impact related to structural items. These results 
were in line with our expectations and
 
primarily driven by continued 
investment in our bottling operations, the timing of marketing expenses 
versus the prior year and higher payouts tied to performance in conjunction 
with our long
-
term incentive compensation programs.
 
For the full year, compar
able currency neutral SG&A were up 16%, including 
a 12% impact related to structural items. With regards to operating expense 
leverage, please remember that we're referring to the point difference 
between our gross profit growth and our operating income gr
owth of a 
comparable currency neutral basis, excluding the impact of structural items.
 
For the full year, comparable currency neutral operating expense leverage 
was in line with our expectations down three points, which includes an 
adverse six
-
point impact
 
due to the impact of the structural items. Our 
healthy operating results across each and every one of our operating groups 
helped drive our cash flow from operations, up 16% to $9.5 billion.
 
For the full year 2010, we repurchased $3.1 billion in company s
tock, which 
is more than the $2 billion we indicated in our last earnings call. Given the 
performance of our stock in 2010, we experienced greater activity in our 
stock option programs at yearend; therefore, we ramped up our repurchases 
in response to that
 
stock option activity. While many of you rightly 
decreased our year end share count in your models due to our previously 
announced share repurchase plans, this greater stock option program 
activity resulted in our share count, actually remaining almost co
nstant at 
year end. This higher year end share count versus your modeled 
expectations equates to an earnings per share impact of between $0.01 and 
$0.02.
 
As for 2011, we expect to repurchase between $2 billion and $2.5 billion in 
stock over the course of t
he full year, and we'll update you on our progress 
during future quarterly earnings calls.
 
Now let me take a minute to follow
-
up on some of the items we called out 
during our December 2010 Modeling Conference Call. First, we referenced 
that in the fourth q
uarter of 2010, we would benefit from an estimated $5 
billion, one
-
time, noncash gain related to the revaluing of our CCE shares at 
the closing date fair value. We can now confirm today that this benefit did 
indeed result in a one
-
time gain of approximatel
y $5 billion. I'll remind you 
that this one
-
time gain does not impact comparable earnings results.
 
In our December 2010 call, we also mentioned that we would incur a 
transaction
-
related gross profit in inventory and fair value adjustment to our 
cost of goo
ds in the fourth quarter based on our inventory levels at year 
end. And I can confirm that this adjustment impacted our fourth quarter 
results by $235 million.
 
Now let me provide some further updates on a few factors we see impacting 
our 2011 results. Firs
t, we expect to see some different phasing of revenue 
and gross profit capture in upcoming quarters. As we explained in our 
December call, prior to the transaction with CCE, revenue and profit related 
to the sale of our products was recognized when our con
centrate shipped to 
CCE, which we reported as concentrate sales, or in the case of our finished 
goods product at the time, we shipped the finished goods to CCE. Now that 
we own the manufacturing and distribution assets to produce and sell these 
products, t
he revenue tied to their sale and therefore, their associated 
concentrate profit, is not recognized until they're sold as physical cases. For 
example, last year, most of our pre
-
Easter holiday concentrate sales to CCE 
were captured in our first quarter 201
0 results. This year, most of our Easter 
holiday
-
related finished goods sales will likely follow in the second quarter 
2011 results. And last year, most of our pre
-
July 4 holiday concentrate sales 
to CCE were captured in our second quarter 2010 results. Th
is year, much of 
our July 4 holiday related finished goods sales will likely fall in the third 
quarter of 2011 results.
 
With regard to commodities, our recent acquisition of CCE's North American 
business has resulted in an adjustment to our company's overa
ll cost 
structure, especially in North America. Today, approximately 35% of our 
total company's cost of goods is made up of both the raw material and 
conversion cost associated with the following four inputs: sweeteners, 
metals, juices and PET. As you woul
d expect, the bulk of these cost reside 
within our North American and Bottling Investment Group businesses. We 
anticipate the underlying commodities related to these inputs will continue 
facing pressure and volatility in today's marketplace. As a result, w
e expect 
the full year 2011 impact of increased commodity cost on our total company 
results to range between $300 billion and $400 billion.
 
As per our comments during our December call, prior to the close of our 
transaction with CCE, we were precluded from
 
hedging the exposures 
associated with these commodities. We are now actively hedging many of 
these commodity exposures, much like we traditionally have done with 
global currencies where we have a history of prudently managing exposure. 
In addition, it's i
mportant to note that many of our derivatives related to 
these commodity exposures do not qualify for hedge accounting under U.S. 
GAAP requirements, and therefore, we are required to recognize the 
unrealized change in fair value of the derivatives in our r
esults. As such, our 
reported results now reflect any associated unrealized gains or losses related 
to these hedging activities.
 
In the fourth quarter of 2010, the unrealized gain related to our hedging 
activities for CCR commodity exposures that did not q
ualify for hedge 
accounting was $29 million. We have excluded this gain from our 
comparable fourth quarter 2010 earnings, even though including it would've 
improved our fourth quarter comparable earnings as we felt this was the 
right thing to do in order t
o provide you with a better understanding of our 
operating results.
 
We've called out this $29 million gain in our GAAP and non
-
GAAP schedules 
and we'll reflect these gains in future comparable earnings in the same 
period that we realize a corresponding cha
nge in value of the underlying 
exposure.
 
A related question some of you have asked with regards to the recent rise in 
commodity prices is the corresponding impact this may have on our 2011 
pricing strategies. I can assure you that our long term pricing str
ategy 
remains unchanged. Simply said, our goal is to always provide consumers 
with the right product at the right time, in the right package and at the right 
price. In this way, we will keep driving sustainable volume and value growth 
in every market and c
ategory in which we compete.
 
Now let me provide an initial outlook on currencies, including the impact 
from our hedged positions and the cycling of our prior year rates. We expect 
currencies to have an even to slightly positive impact on operating 
income 
for the full year and in the first quarter of 2011. We will maintain our 
disciplined approach to SG&A expenses in 2011. Further, we reaffirm our 
commitment to capture between $140 million and $150 million of cost 
synergies related to our CCE transac
tion this year.
 
Further, we remain well on plan and on track to deliver $500 million in 
annual savings from our productivity initiatives by the end of this year. And 
while we continue to cycle the benefits of these ongoing productivity 
initiatives, we expe
ct to capture positive operating expense leverage in 
2011, consistent with what is implied by our long
-
term growth targets.
 
From a capital expenditure standpoint, and as I discussed during our 
December call, our annual capital expenditure needs will increa
se in 2011 as 
we incorporate CCE's former North American operations. As I also mentioned 
during our December 2010 call, we plan to make additional investments to 
further enhance our operational effectiveness, the net results of these North 
American specifi
c expenditures will be an increase of approximately $1 
billion to our 2011 capital expenditure program.
 
In addition, we plan to make further strategic investments in 2011, primarily 
related to expanding our production and sales capabilities within our Bott
ling 
Investments Group. As a result, we expect our 2011 capital expenditures to 
range between $3 billion and $3.2 billion.
 
Finally with regard to our tax rate, please note that the variances between 
our reported and underlying tax rates for both the fourth
 
quarter and the full 
year was due to the impact of various items affecting comparability. The 
most significant of which was the $5 billion one
-
time, noncash gain related 
to the CCE transaction that I discussed earlier. Looking ahead to 2011, our 
current b
est estimate is that the full year underlying effective tax rate will 
range between $23.5% and 24.5 %.
 
Before I close my prepared remarks this morning, some of you have asked 
us to provide additional commentary regarding our long
-
term growth 
targets. First
 
of all, we have always viewed these targets as multiyear or 
long
-
term targets. We run our business with an aim toward achieving the 
highest returns for our share owners over time. This philosophy has served 
us well in the past, and we believe is the right
 
way to run a sustainable, 
productive and dynamic business. This however, does not mean that we do 
not closely monitor our quarterly results. As we manage our business 
quarter
-
to
-
quarter, our focus is much more on understanding and identifying 
short
-
term m
acroeconomic trends that may call for us to adjust our short
-
term tactics as we execute our long
-
term strategies. And while we often 
compare our annual performance results alongside our long
-
term growth 
targets, our most important consideration is ensuring
 
that every year, we 
make the right long
-
term decisions to attain our goals, to achieve our 2020 
Vision and beyond.
 
In closing, our strong 2010 performance results and our consistent belief in 
the solid fundamentals of this great business provide us with t
he confidence 
to reaffirm our company's long
-
term comparable currency neutral growth 
rate, which are and have been 3% to 4% volume growth, 5% to 6% revenue 
growth, 6% to 8% operating income growth and a high
-
single digits 
earnings per share growth.
 
Operato
r, we're now ready for questions.
 
Question
-
and

Answer Session
 
Operator
 
[Operator Instructions] Our first question today is from Bill Pecoriello with 
Consumer Edge Research.
 
William Pecoriello 
-
 
Consumer Edge Research, LLC
 
Gary, I know you just had mentione
d the long
-
term target. You delivered 
really strong 7% organic sales growth here against a tough compare, and 
that was despite China being down 3% and profit was ahead of the long
-
term targets. So looking out to 2011, should we expect this kind of growth 
t
o be sustained? Will you be disappointed if it wasn't? You mentioned some 
commodity pressure in investments in the past to 2020, but still looking at 
the type of growth you're delivering here, what gives you the confidence in 
sustaining it? And would you b
e disappointed if it wasn't held at this rate in 
2011?
 
Muhtar Kent
 
Bill, let me just provide some context over that question first. This is Muhtar. 
I think what you need to sort of look at is what is driving that growth? And I 
think what's driving that gro
wth is really, in still a somewhat mixed economy 
around the world, challenging economy around the world, is the alignment 
that we're executing with our bottlers, the alignment that we have to 
strengthen alignment, the investments that we've been making in 
our 
brands in our infrastructure over the past, not just the year but multiple 
years, the strength of the brands, the strength of the geographic portfolio, 
all of that is coming to the four, I think, in terms of what you're seeing. Now 
again, in terms of t
he world economy, Gary mentioned commodities. There's 
currency, also in terms of the challenge, inflation coming out of 
commodities, political issues, uncertainties in some parts of the world as 
we've seen recently, the incredible amount of cash just sitti
ng on the 
sidelines, about $2 trillion just in the United States, generally still some lack 
of confidence. But at the same time, as I mentioned, in 2009, we saw a 
tremendously difficult environment in some parts like Russia, Eastern 
Europe. We see some sig
ns of improvement in certain parts of the world, 
better than they've been in the past and many emerging markets continue 
to grow. And consumer confidence is good in many of the emerging 
markets. So I think as we execute our long
-
term strategy, as we build 
on 
our momentum, our strategy is working, and that's what you're seeing 
coming out with a 5% organic growth in our business for the full year. And 
again, north of $1 billion unit cases added to our business, which we feel 
good about in terms of what has be
en achieved in 2010. But we remain 
resolutely focused on our execution and continue to drive results with our 
bottling partners.

Our next question is from Carlos LaBoy with Credit Suisse.
 
Carlos LaBoy

Crédit Suisse AG
 
Muhtar, you're showing trem
endous improvement here in your Bottler 
Investment Group territories. Can you comment on whether there is a new 
urgency coming into 2011? Or how high a priority there is to make you 
refranchise some of these territories as you look out over the next couple
 
of 
years?
 
Muhtar Kent
 
As we've always said, Carlos, our intention is to ensure that we have a very 
strong, well
-
aligned franchise system operating on all cylinders across the 
world. We have tremendous belief in that, and as we see the great execution 
comi
ng out of our Bottling Investment Group in all the markets that they are 
in, we will evaluate accordingly and even, I mentioned, even Germany 
coming out with growth for the first time in a number of years is a testament 
to that execution capability. And wh
en the time is right, we will certainly find 
the right home and the right financial conditions for those markets that are 
operated currently, successfully by our Bottling Investment Group.

Our next question is from John Faucher with JPMorgan.
 
John
 
Faucher

JP Morgan Chase & Co
 
I want to ask a question about the North American pricing. And you talked 
about, in your commentary, talking about doing the right thing for the long 
term with pricing. So let's focus a little bit more on the short term here
. If I 
look at the pricing on the quarter, if you assume non
-
carb positive mix in 
North America, that would imply 
--
 
and plus concentrate pricing to the non
-
COBO bottlers, that would imply that bottle/can pricing was likely down a 
little bit in the quarter
. So can you talk about your outlook for bottle/can 
pricing? How that's changed since you've taken over the CCE North 
American operations? And then Gary, just a little more color on the CapEx 
piece, your run rate on CapEx for 2011 will actually be sort of 
greater than 
your incoming trend plus all of CCE's CapEx. So can you highlight how much 
of that increase would you say is sort of CCE
-
related, and how much of that 
is sort of these additional opportunities that you mentioned?
 
Gary Fayard
 
Let me start with 
pricing. And in fact, if you get underneath it, in fact in 
North America, we did have positive pricing. We will have positive pricing in 
North America in 2011 as well. What we're trying to say is that basically, our 
pricing will be rational but it will als
o be pricing that's rational, not only in 
terms of competitors in the competitive marketplace, but also rational 
pricing in terms of the consumer. And there, we would much rather 
--
 
in 
rational, I mean, take 
--
 
let's say not react totally to, I hope, short
 
term 
volatility in commodities, but take more consistent rational pricing over a 
period of time over a number of years, which we believe is the right thing for 
our customers, it's the right thing for our consumers and in fact, will return 
much greater val
ue to us and actually to the beverage industry over a longer 
period of time. So we're being very rational about it, we will take that price, 
and we are increasing pricing in 2011 in North America. So I can confirm 
that directly. Relative to CapEx, the incr
ease from 
--
 
in fact the CapEx, if you 
look at it, was about $2.2 billion in 2010. And we're talking about going to 
$3 billion to $3.2 billion in 2011. CCE North America, Legacy CCE North 
America was around $600 million, $650 million. There's a large piece
 
of that 
increase then from, let's say, from $2.8 billion to $3 billion to $3.2 billion. A 
large part of that, more than half of it actually is incremental CapEx that is 
related to the integration efforts of CCE North American sales. It is 
--
 
a lot of 
it's
 
IT of having rationalizing the various systems to get us all within North 
America on the same system. Those types of things 
--
 
so in fact, what I 
would expect you will see is over the next couple of years, those 
investments actually will peak over about t
wo years or they'll start going 
back down. Then we do have some real opportunities to increase both 
production and sales execution in a lot of our work. BIG markets, which are 
growing rapidly as Muhtar talked about in his section. So we're continuing to 
in
crease there, as I say, both in production capacity as well as sales 
execution capability, cold drink equipment, et cetera in those markets to 
continue to invest in the long term. And then back to the question asked 
earlier by Carlos, over some period of t
ime a lot of those bottlers will 
actually be refranchised. And you'd see CapEx go down again relative to 
that.

You had said that pricing was positive in the quarter in North America, so 
that's implying that the mix 
was negative?
 
Gary Fayard
 
No actually what we're seeing is that actually price mix in North America, I 
think, was actually flat in the quarter. So you got some mix and everything 
going on within that, but talking about 2011, we are taking positive pricing.

So it probably was down in the quarter, but should be up in 2011?
 
Gary Fayard
 
Yes.

A little bit more on pricing. A
s it relates to being rational, would you say 
you're taking pricing up enough to offset commodities based on your view of 
the consumer? Or is there some that you feel you need to absorb this year?
 
Gary Fayard
 
Number one 
--
 
thanks, Kaumil, if this was a pre
tty good year, I hate to ask 
you what a really good year would be. With that, I don't want to actually get 
into specifics of exactly what the pricing is because the pricing is not just 
straightforward. I can't just give you a percentage because what you've
 
got 
is you've got different pricing by category of beverages. You also have 
different pricing by channel. You also have different packaging, particularly 
by package where you got different elasticities on different packages. And 
we're taking different amo
unts of pricing on each one of those, what we 
believe is the right thing to do for the market for customers, for consumers 
and for the company. So overall, we are pricing at a level that we think is 
the right thing to do long term, but we are not pricing a
t a level to say, 
""Okay, I have to make up for all of this commodity pressure because 
commodities go up, commodities go down."" And I don't want you to then 
ask me the same question, ""Are you taking your pricing down because 
commodity prices went down?"" Tha
t's not what you do if, in fact, you're 
trying to continue to build a stronger and stronger brands over the long 
term, which is what we're into and not a quarter
-
by
-
quarter, ""Oh my God, 
what did commodities do this quarter?""
 
Muhtar Kent
 
Kaumil, just one ot
her point about pricing, but also about mix, which is 
important. We've seen signs, not fully out of the woods, but certainly signs 
of improvement in our Immediate Consumption business across the world. 
That business, of course, is higher revenue per unit c
ase and also higher 
margin. And I think that you will see, I believe that as we move through 
2011, that we will continue to see those signs, and therefore, mix will help 
us also in the way our business moves through 2011.
 
Gary Fayard
 
Kaumil, I'd add one ot
her item as well. I think everything, pretty much 
we've been talking about on this subject is relative to North America. When 
you get outside of North America, you actually start getting into a different 
set of answers. Because in those, in many other mark
ets, you've got very 
different market dynamics. You've got very different inflation rates, et 
cetera. And so you get into different answers and really is, you have to kind 
of go country

country specifically.

Our next question is from Mark Swart
zberg with Stifel, Nicolaus.
 
Mark Swartzberg

Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.
 
Building on that notion of a good year, I was wondering if you could step 
back for us, Muhtar, maybe, Gary, you too, and talk a little bit about the 
incentive structures you see to
day inside of Coca
-
Cola and the incentive 
structures out there at your bottlers and things you have some influence 
over to try to build on the success you've had over these last couple of 
years, kind of promote that notion of constructive discontent? What 
tweaks 
do you think are being made, might be made, to incentive structures within 
Coke and then in your relationship with bottlers that will allow you to deliver 
on the opportunity you see for yourself over the next few years?
 
Muhtar Kent
 
First, just let m
e take the second piece first, the bottlers. I think what I'm 
very, I'm consciously pleased with the alignment we have with our bottlers. 
Obviously, there's always room for improvement, but we're really acting as a 
holistic, very coordinated system. And I 
think it's a really win
-
win approach. 
And we've always said, we cannot over the long term succeed unless our 
bottlers succeed in the marketplace. And I think that is the philosophy that 
permeates through the Coca
-
Cola organization across every single count
ry 
where we operate, whether it's a single bottler, multiple bottlers, whether 
it's a mixture of BIG and franchise bottlers or pure franchise bottlers. So I 
think that is certainly something that we will guard and build on very, very 
carefully. In terms of
 
incentive structures, simply said, Mark, I think what 
you're seeing is we are aligning more and more our incentive structures to 
our 2020 Vision. It's not about budgets, it's not about the numbers, it's all 
about achieving and surpassing our 2020 Vision. 
And that's what we're 
building, reconfiguring evolving our incentive structures to match the 2020 
Vision requirements. And that's what you'll see us engaged in a very 
material way.
 
Mark Swartzberg

Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.
 
And can you share with us, M
uhtar, as we think about North America 
specifically in 2020 and of course now, owning the bottler or most of your 
bottling ops [ph] here, how we might see some of those structures change 
over the near to intermediate term here in North America?
 
Muhtar Kent
 
All I can tell you is that on North America, Mark, I'm very pleased with our 
execution and also our integration both simultaneously. And so we have a 
new company with new people, new organization, a great passion to succeed 
in the marketplace. And as we c
ontinue to execute and continue to grow 
sustainably our business in North America, which we've always believed in 
and said, I've always said that, this should be viewed as a growth market. 

 
better 
demographics as we move into the next decade. We will continue to work 
very diligently to make sure that the structure meets the needs for us to 
achieve our 2020 Vision, and we're working on that too. But I can't give you 
any further details.

If I could, this commodity topic, obviously a big topic, and some of this Q&A 
helpful. But if I could press a little bit more, when we think about that $300 
million to $400 million number, it sounds like that is a
 
net number, so to 
speak. It's net of the pricing you anticipate to take around the world and it's 
net of any offsetting mixed benefits. Is that a fair understanding of what 
you're portraying in that $300 million to $400 million number?
 
Gary Fayard
 
Mark, t
his is Gary. No actually, what I was giving you was actually the gross 
number. So the impact 
--
 
what we see today is that the gross impact to the 
company from commodities will be in that $300 million to $400 million 
range, again primarily North America and
 
our Bottling Investments Group. 
That will be offset to the extent we have positive pricing, et cetera.
 
Mark Swartzberg

Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.
 
Lastly, as we 
--
 
I don't know, Muhtar, if we 
--
 
how difficult it is to generalize, 
but this rising commod
ity pictures is obviously not just a cost issue, it's a 
purchasing power issue. Can you perhaps just wax a bit here generally about 
markets where you're seeing it proving more challenging from a purchasing 
power standpoint and markets where you think it's 
a lot more manageable, 
vis
-
à
-
vis your ambitions for growth?
 
Muhtar Kent
 
We have not seen any 
--
 
it's too early to say what the results are and how 
all of this is going to evolve. And we have to see, obviously a lot of harvest 
coming up in the next few mont
hs, it will have a bearing. There's a lot of 
--
 
what you see around the world, there's a short
-
term and there's a long
-
term. Over the long
-
term, no question, demand going up in the world, 
middle class will continue to put pressure on commodity long term. S
hort 
term, there's different things happening that create what we see today, and 
they will be short term, and they can change. They can go either way. And 
short term, what are we seeing? Elimination of subsidies, vagaries of the 
weather, speculation, all o
f those coming together that's driving up some, 
creating some of the current situation. Now we haven't yet seen any of the 
major, any of the big social consequences that we saw two, three years ago 
because it's too early and also it's a different environme
nt than it was back 
then. So I think our business is really built for these kind of times. As I said 
moments of pleasure a sense at a time, and I think that, that's the key. 
We're not selling big
-
ticket items and over 50% of what we sell is impulse. 
And as
 
long as we execute well, we will continue to drive our results.

And our final question today is from Judy Hong with Goldman Sachs.
 
Judy Hong

Muhtar, just on China, obviously, you had a pretty tough comp here, but the 
fu
ll year gross was also below what we've been seeing in that market 
historically. I'm just wondering if you can just talk about maybe whether 
you're seeing increased competitive pressure. Obviously Tingyi has been 
pretty aggressive in their growth strategie
s. You got Pepsi stepping up 
investments. Is the competitor pressure building in that market more than 
you anticipated? And some of the adaptation that you talked about to your 
in
-
market strategies, is that sort of a function of just a competitive 
landscap
e getting tougher?
 
Muhtar Kent
 
First, Judy, China is a long
-
term growth story. And we feel very good about 
our growth prospects in this market. If you look at last two years, 
compounded with generated double digits, we're also a multi
-
category 
player, bein
g number one in two categories, sparkling and juice, and number 
three in water. And that we're twice the size of our 
--
 
more than twice the 
size of our primary international competitor. We've got the best distribution, 
best infrastructure in China. We open
ed just three very large modern plants 
in the last quarter of last year, and we believe that growth in China is not 
only to be measured in quarters. We were cycling 29%, which was a huge 
number from prior year. But it's about delivering consistent, sustain
able 
double
-
digit growth over the long term, and I think we see great prospects 
in China. And if you look again over the last sort of two, three years, yes, 
the competitive environment is increasing in China. But I think we're well 
prepared with our brands
, with our portfolio, with our infrastructure, with 
our partners to ensure that we can continue to win in China in that great 
market.

Gary, just on the buyback plans for 2011, just given how much cash you 
have on your b
alance sheet and how much cash you're generating, it just 
feels like $2 billion to $2.5 billion is very conservative. So I'm just wondering 
what is kind of holding the board back from committing to a higher buyback 
here?
 
Gary Fayard
 
Well first, the board h
asn't met yet. The board meets next week. Number 
two, I think it's always prudent to start out the year in a kind of a 
conservative fashion. And as we go through the year and get into it, that's 
where we'll update you each quarter as we go through it. I th
ink we just 
kind of see how we came out and how we're doing through the year, and 
we'll just update you as we go through.

Now, I'd like to turn the call over to James.

Thanks Tim and good morning everyone. In the third quarter, we saw 
ongoing improvement and progress. While our business continued to be 
affected by lockdowns in some ma
rkets, especially in places with strong 
exposure to the away
-
from
-
home channels we are encouraged by the 
response and execution of our system.
 
Together with our bottlers, we continue to focus on winning as the world 
reopens. We've moved quickly to address 
the near
-
term realities and we are 
working to deliver on the priorities we outlined in our second quarter call.
 
I'm also inspired each and every day by what I see from our associates their 
resilience, their drive, and their pride in this great system. They
're working 
purposefully to serve our consumers and customers and to do it safely. They 
are making a difference in the communities around the world, and for this 
and much more, I offer my sincerest thanks and appreciation.
 
Today, I'll provide an update on 
the quarter including where we're seeing the 
most improvements in our business and where recovery is moving at slow 
pace. Also I'll share some thoughts on the remainder of the year and as we 
look forward to 2021. Then I'll share progress we're already maki
ng to 
emerge stronger. And finally, I'll hand over to John to discuss the quarter in 
more detail including how we continue to execute in this challenging 
environment.
 
In the third quarter, we continued to rebound from the pressures we 
experienced at the pe
ak of the lockdown as the world generally moves into 
the recovery phase. That said, the trajectory of our business trends continue 
to be closely linked to the size of our away
-
from
-
home business in any given 
country and the level of the lockdowns in the ma
rket.
 
From the 25% volume decline that we saw in April, the mid
-
single
-
digit 
declines through the summer, and the low single
-
digit decline since 
September, our volume trends have continued to improve. Much of the 
sequential improvement has been driven by t
he away
-
from
-
home channels, 
which represent roughly half of our business globally.
 
Our away
-
from
-
home volume was down in the mid
-
teens in the quarter, a 
significant improvement from the April lows which approached 50% declines. 
This was driven by the agili
ty of our sales teams throughout the system and 
the efforts to create value for our customers during the gradual reopening 
phase. We are seeing the away
-
from
-
home recovery starting to stabilize 
given the ongoing restrictions in many regions.
 
Our at
-
home ch
annels also saw an acceleration throughout the quarter. 
Specifically, grocery and e
-
commerce channels continue to experience solid 
demand benefiting both from shifts in consumer behavior and our system's 
actions to capture those opportunities.
 
The system i
s working jointly to manage the supply and distribution shifts 
make key decisions around portfolio priorities and leverage digital data to 
identify new outlets to further growth.
 
We continue to see progress, but the environment remains dynamic and it is 
no
t a straight
-
line recovery around the world different markets are seeing 
varying degrees of impact.
 
In EMEA, at
-
home channels continued to perform well and sparkling soft 
drinks and juices remained resilient. Volume improved in away
-
from
-
home 
channels thro
ughout the quarter as activities resumed with limitations.
 
In Latin America, volume improved as government restrictions eased. 
Specifically, Brazil continues to be an outperformer. But economic pressures 
remain and our recovery in Mexico has been slower th
an expected.
 
Moving to North America, strong performance in at
-
home channels was 
offset by continued softness in our foodservice business. While some away
-
from
-
home channels have been slower to recover, we benefited from traffic 
improvements in channels li
ke convenience retail and quick service 
restaurants.
 
Importantly, digital partnerships with restaurants and aggregators to 
optimize menus have resulted in a four
-
point increase in attachment rates 
and digital commerce retail sales have more than doubled ye
ar
-
to
-
date 
outpacing the category.
 
In Asia
-
Pacific, China is well on its way to emerge stronger driven by solid 
performance in sparkling's soft drinks. Recovery efforts in India and Japan 
continue and we have seen meaningful improvement in the face of ongo
ing 
restrictions.
 
Global Ventures remains pressured, but has seen a significant improvement 
from Q2 with organic revenues improving by over 30 points. Our Costa retail 
stores, one of the most affected parts of our company at the peak of the 
global lockdown
s, are now almost entirely open.
 
While traffic is unlikely to fully recover in the near
-
term, our First One on Us 
campaign has shown promising signs driving over one million new 
consumers to the Costa app. We continue our journey to be a global multi
-
platf
orm coffee company under the Costa brand.
 
Across our channels and regions, our brand portfolio is working hard to 
return to pre
-
COVID levels of growth and we have made progress in the 
quarter. For example trademark Coke delivered volume growth in Q3. We 
al
so saw growth in local champions like Simply and fairlife in the U.S. and 
Thums Up in India.
 
With the NARTD category continuing to be affected by a shift to at
-
home 
channels, our underlying strength in value share this quarter was more than 
offset by 
the negative mix in away
-
from
-
home where we tend to have 
stronger share positions.
 
Clicking down, we are seeing positive share momentum in EMEA and Latin 
America including gains in sparkling soft drinks. In fact, trademark Coca
-
Cola saw share gains in 80% 
of our top markets globally this quarter. Share 
gains are a key metric of our determination to emerge stronger, and we are 
intent on recapturing lost ground and more through the recovery phase.
 
In summary, we are encouraged by the improvement in our busine
ss. 
However, it's important to remember the world is in a fragile state. We've 
seen reopening trends begin to moderate, and the away
-
from
-
home 
recovery showed signs of stalling in September with the increase of 
restrictions in several markets.
 
There is pot
ential for increased regional lockdowns as we enter colder 
seasons in the Northern Hemisphere. We don't expect to return to the peak 
levels of global lockdown, but we are prepared for setbacks due to the local 
spikes in cases and targeted restrictions and 
closures.
 
The pandemic has been a catalyst for change for our company, but the initial 
work behind our strategic transformation was in motion for some time 
before the crisis hit. We've been challenging legacy ways of doing business 
and the pandemic helped 
us realize we could be bolder in our efforts.
 
Last quarter, we highlighted five priorities to accelerate our transformation. 
We set out to optimize our portfolio and instill more discipline in our 
innovation approach, coupled with more effective marketing,
 
stepped
-
up 
revenue growth management and execution, and enhanced system 
collaboration.
 
We also said we'll evolve our organization and invest in capabilities to ensure 
we can bring the strategy to life. We're moving swiftly to deliver against 
those priorit
ies with our goal to reach pre
-
COVID growth levels ahead of the 
economic recovery.
 
Firstly, we set out to position our portfolio for success, focusing on scaled 
growth through targeted resource allocation and optimization. Over the past 
few months, a cross
-
functional team has worked to identify the right brands 
for a growth portfolio that will drive quality leadership and help us achieve 
our Beverages for Life ambitions.
 
We have finalized the master brands in this growth portfolio, which consists 
of about 2
00 global regional and local brands that will allow us to remain 
truly consumer
-
centric, focusing on those brands that can be scaled to drive 
profits for the long
-
term. For the brands who are not selected, we have 
begun the work with our bottlers to quickl
y sunset or thoughtfully transition 
them to one of the growth brands over the next year.
 
Secondly, our marketing transformation is also underway. We have 
undertaken a global initiative to improve marketing efficiency and 
effectiveness, jointly led by our m
arketing, procurement and finance teams.
 
This is a top priority and the initial work to date has validated the 
opportunity to sustainably reduce our spend via proven procurement 
methodologies and other efficiency levers, while maintaining and improving 
mar
keting effectiveness.
 
Importantly, this is not a top
-
down
-
driven exercise to reduce expenses. 
There is no savings target. Rather by improving our processes, eliminating 
duplication and optimizing spend on things like third
-
party agencies, we will 
increase 
our effectiveness and be able to fuel reinvestment in our brands.
 
When it comes to innovation, we're focusing on bigger, more scalable bets. 
And to be clear, this strategy does not mean less innovation overall. Already 
this mindset is showing results. Year
-
to
-
date, revenue contribution from 
innovation is higher than last year and the amount of revenue per innovation 
has doubled.
 
Innovation will come in different forms. We can leverage a trademark to 
expand the category like we're doing with Coke Energy. We 
can also create a 
brand like AHA to participate in a growing category or subcategory.
 
And we can also expand our addressable market by entering a new category 
like we've done so with Topo Chico Hard Seltzer, which debuted last month 
in select cities across
 
Latin America with more markets coming soon 
including the U.S. Ultimately, we're combining discipline with agility to win 
drinkers share and profits.
 
We continue to experiment on a local level and our new approach allows us 
to move faster to find and scal
e our best initiatives. We have a robust 
pipeline in the works for next year and expect innovation to continue to 
contribute meaningfully to our growth going forward.
 
And as we adapt our organization, we continue to apply our enhanced 
revenue growth manage
ment capabilities, provide beverage options at the 
right price and for the occasion consumers are looking for and to bring new 
drinkers to our brands. We are also strengthening our bottling partnerships 
across the system to enhance execution across channel
s.
 
In order to ensure the structure of our company facilitates the success of our 
accelerated strategy, we're becoming a more networked organization that 
will combine the power of scale with deep knowledge to win locally.
 
We expect this new networked model
 
to be established and functioning at 
the beginning of the next year and Platform Services will be fully integrated, 
standardized and scaled over the course of next year.
 
We're streamlining from 17 business units to nine operating units, which will 
acceler
ate decision
-
making while maintaining local market execution. We've 
announced five global category leads to steer the new marketing model and 
ensure relentless consumer focus on brands that can be scaled to even 
stronger positions.
 
We're also creating a ne
w Platform Services organization, which will be a 
critical enabler in supporting a networked web
-
working. It will be a collection 
of 10 areas of expertise, known as hubs that will partner with the operating 
units, categories and the center to develop capab
ilities and services needed 
to support their strategies as well as enable collaboration and execution.
 
Our people are confident and engaged in this transformation and an 
enterprise mindset is taking hold. Our new leadership teams have been 
formed, and ther
e are clear job descriptions to ensure accountability across 
functions. The changes to our structure will result in reallocation and a 
reduction in the number of associates.
 
This is underway through a combination of voluntary separation programs as 
well as
 
some level of involuntary reductions. Although these changes are 
never easy, I am certain they will allow us to emerge stronger.
 
In addition, to executing on the five priorities, environmental, social and 
governance initiatives, always remain at the foref
ront of our minds and 
actions. Our ESG goals are embedded in how we operate as a business and 
we will continue to make progress across our key sustainability initiatives 
including our World Without Waste goals.
 
For example, across markets representing 30% 
of our global volume we now 
have introduced 100% recycled plastic packaging options in at least one 
brand and this has grown even during the pandemic. And last month, The 
Netherlands and Norway became the second and third markets after Sweden 
to announce t
hey will manufacture the entire local portfolio in 100% recycled 
PET.
 
In the U.S., we continue to join other stakeholders in supporting policies to 
drive improved packaging collection and demand for recycled material such 
as California's new mandatory recy
cled
-
content legislation. In recognition of 
the importance of this topic to our company, and I know to many of you as 
well, I hope you will join us for our virtual ESG Investor Day on November 
13th.
 
To sum up, we are continuing to navigate through the unce
rtainties of the 
global pandemic. We are heading to a phase where the world is adapting to 
a new way of living with COVID. The progress we've made on accelerating 
our strategic transformation will give us the focus and flexibility to manage 
our business an
d execute with excellence today and to set ourselves up for 
better results in the long run.
 
With that, I'll pass it over to you John.
 
John Murphy
 
Thank you, James, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'd like to comment 
on our third quarter 
performance and give perspective on the financial 
implications of our structural changes and new operating model. I'll also 
provide some additional context on our outlook.
 
In the third quarter, I am pleased to report that our focus and flexibility 
enabled 
us to drive sequential improvement from the second quarter. Our 
organic revenue performance was down 6% driven by price/mix down 3% 
and concentrate sales down 4%. This quarter's performance compares to a 
26% organic revenue decline in the second quarter.
 
W
hile most of that improvement came in the form of better volume trends, 
we also saw improved price/mix particularly when you look at this on a two
-
year average. Comparable gross margin contracted by about 140 basis 
points. This was primarily driven by cont
inued albeit less pressure from our 
channel mix between away
-
from
-
home and at
-
home in addition to currency 
headwinds.
 
Comparable operating margin expanded by approximately 230 basis points 
due to ongoing cost management offsetting the pressure from the top
 
line. 
While our marketing spend remained below last year's levels, we did 
increase it sequentially and in a targeted way as we saw recovery in the 
business.
 
We continue to monitor the effectiveness of spend with the goal of investing 
ahead of recovery. Be
low operating income we saw a strong sequential 
improvement in many of our equity stakes as our bottlers have quickly 
moved to adapt to the changes. Therefore, third quarter comparable EPS of 
$0.55 declined 2% year
-
over
-
year. This was better than our inter
nal 
expectations, given stronger
-
than
-
anticipated volume trends in September 
and the improved equity income.
 
While the pandemic has weighed on our cash from operations year
-
to
-
date, 
we saw significant sequential improvement in the third quarter and remain 
intensely focused on the free cash flow opportunities ahead. These include 
further progress in our working capital initiatives and being better stewards 
of our capital spend.
 
While much has changed this year with the onset of the pandemic, our focus 
on con
verting top line growth to maximize returns has not. The changes we 
are making will lead us to more efficient and productive spending. These 
include our organizational restructuring, streamlined portfolio, disciplined 
innovation and optimized marketing app
roach.
 
As James mentioned we're streamlining our master brands by approximately 
50%, which significantly reduces complexity with an impact of less than 1% 
to top line and profits. We expect this impact to be more than offset over 
time by the benefits of gr
eater focus on our growth brands. The combination 
of voluntary separation programs and involuntary reductions are estimated 
to result in expenses ranging from approximately $350 million to $550 
million. While we are not defining a targeted level of cost sa
vings historically 
in these scenarios we have seen a similar level of savings as compared to 
the cost of the programs.
 
These actions will help us achieve a structure that is designed for growth, 
which in turn will fuel reinvestment to drive top line and ma
rgins for the 
long
-
term. Said another way the strategic priorities we've accelerated are 
designed to drive results that get us back to our long
-
term growth algorithm 
as fast as possible.
 
In our last call, we talked about adapting to the various phases of t
he 
pandemic focusing on what we can manage and control and not getting 
ahead of ourselves with regard to when things might return to normal. We 
see no reason to change this approach for the remainder of the year. 
Different countries around the world are go
ing through different phases. 
Some still dealing with the first wave, others dealing with or expecting a 
second wave and their respective governments taking a variety of approach.
 
All of which means continued uncertainty regarding the pandemic and the 
macr
oeconomic picture. So within this context we will continue to hold off on 
providing more detailed guidance today.
 
Having said that there are important factors to consider for the fourth 
quarter. We will be benefiting from two extra days in the quarter. To 
the 
degree that away
-
from
-
home channels are impacted by targeted 
restrictions, we would expect price/mix pressure to continue due to channel 
and package mix. This mix shift in our business will also continue to have 
implications for gross margins. We will 
continue to be prudent in our 
marketing expenditures, but stepping up investment in a targeted way 
ahead of recovery with a more efficient and effective approach.
 
As we noted in our release, we expect a currency headwind of approximately 
3% to the top line
 
and approximately 9% to comparable operating income in 
the fourth quarter based on current spot rates and our hedge positions.
 
Looking at today's rates and hedge positions at this stage the currency 
impact would be minimal as we head into next year. Comin
g out of an 
unusual year like 2020 will surely have implications for 2021. It is fair to 
assume that 2021 will have several considerations including the cycling of 
2020 impacts, the step
-
up in discretionary spending as well as the strategic 
acceleration in
itiatives we've outlined. While it's too early to provide specific 
commentary, our actions give us increased confidence to recover faster than 
the broader economic recovery. We will provide more insight as part of our 
fourth quarter call.
 
As we think about
 
the long
-
term, we will continue our journey to improve 
cash flow where we had made much progress last year, as well as focus on 
asset optimization with a goal to becoming asset
-
right over time.
 
Our balance sheet remains strong and we continue to have conf
idence in the 
health of our system as we emerge from the peak of lockdowns across the 
globe. System health is crucial to our success. We also remain committed to 
our dividend policy and balance sheet goals. We recognize the dividend is 
important to our inv
estor base and continue to believe our long
-
term model 
can deliver the cash necessary to reinvest to grow the business while also 
supporting the dividend. We will continue to work to return to a dividend 
payout ratio as a percentage of free cash flow that 
approaches 75% over 
time.
 
The acceleration of our strategy and the progress James outlined today will 
help drive long
-
term top and bottom line growth, not only for us but for the 
entire Coke system. The challenges that we faced during this pandemic are 
by 
no means, in the rearview mirror.
 
Nevertheless, we are seeing promising signs, that the actions we're taking 
have put us on track to equip the organization and the data system to win. 
We are confident that we will return to the high
-
end of our long
-
term gr
owth 
model. And do so having made an impact, with our stakeholders and having 
gained consumers' share and improved system economics.
 
With that operator, we are ready to take questions.
 
Question
-
and
-
Answer Session
 
Operator
 
[Operator Instructions] Our first 
question comes from the line of Bryan 
Spillane with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
 
Bryan Spillane
 
Thank you, Operator, and good morning everyone.
 
James Quincey
 
Good morning.
 
Bryan Spillane
 
So John, maybe you want to pick up a little bit on some of 
the commentary 
related to the outlook and into 2021. And I understand it's early. But I think 
a lot of investors are trying to figure out or 
--
 
the game, how quickly you 
can get back to the high watermark so kind of 2019 levels and kind of what 
that path l
ooks like in 2021.
 
So maybe if you could help us a little bit with, some of the puts and takes I 
guess for next year. There's going to be some cost savings. There's some 
discretionary spend that might have to come back, so maybe if you could 
just kind of h
elp us a little bit with, what those building blocks will look like 
for next year.
 
John Murphy
 
Sure. Bryan thanks for the question. It's still early and there's as we talked 
on the call a fair degree of uncertainty remaining. And we'll have certainly a 
lot
 
more to visibility I think when we get to the fourth quarter call. In the 
meantime, as we just discussed 2021 will be an unusual year. We're cycling 
a number of unusual impacts from this year.
 
We will see a step
-
up in our discretionary spending, as we go 
into the fourth 
quarter and into the first half of next year. And we're also going to I believe 
see the benefit from the strategic initiatives that we have outlined in the July 
and on this morning's call. Our new organizational structure will be, well in 
p
lace at that stage.
 
So I would anchor our spending in 2021 going into 2022 off our 2019 base, 
and take into account the actions that we have discussed to both drive the 
top line and to drive greater efficiency, across the organization. And we'll be 
in a po
sition to talk more in detail, on the Q4 call.
 
Operator
 
Our next question comes from the line of Lauren Lieberman from Barclays. 
Please go ahead. Your line is now open.
 
Lauren Lieberman
 
Great, thanks. Good morning. And I wanted to talk maybe a little bit l
onger 
term, because you have announced and have been discussing on today's call 
just a tremendous amount of change that, you're introducing not just to 
your organization immediately, but also to the broader system, all at a time 
when everyone needs to be n
imble and quick in adapting to what's right in 
front of them and the near
-
term reality.
 
So, I guess one, could you just talk a little bit about what you're hearing 
across the system, in terms of comfort, or excitement, or fear about the 
changes, the abilit
y to absorb? And then also, how may you describe kind of 
your long
-
term view? Pre
-
COVID you were already optimistic. Post
-
COVID 
we're looking at a world maybe with a smaller footprint and smaller traffic 
around away
-
from
-
home. So how would you describe kin
d of your long
-
term 
view today versus maybe what it was 12 months ago? Thanks.
 
James Quincey
 
Sure. Look, the headline is, we're more confident today, in the long
-
term 
growth potential of the company and the bottling system than we were pre
-
COVID. And the r
eason I say that is, look as we came into the crisis, we'd 
obviously done a lot of things reinvested in Coke re
-
franchised. And we had 
launched the total beverage strategy with Beverages for Life. And we were 
starting to get traction.
 
We were starting to s
ee the business both the company and the bottlers get 
up towards the higher end of our long
-
term growth model and come off 
several years, of good revenue growth and starting to see the earnings take 
off in dollar terms for the company, in EPS and for the b
ottlers as well.
 
And building off that strategy of Beverages for Life, the actions we're taking 
this year really being very focused on what are the brands that can take us 
into the future. As John said, we're going to we're letting go half more 
--
 
slightly
 
more than half of the brand, so we can focus on those with the 
greatest potential.
 
They account for a relatively small amount of revenue and profit, but they 
take up a disproportionate to that amount of time, process and shelf space. 
So the focus on, the 
portfolio the updating and change to the marketing 
model, as John mentioned, not just the efficiency but the effectiveness of 
the model, with the new organization, with the new networked organization 
and with the Platform Services.
 
These actions are helpin
g us not just adapt and prosper within the COVID 
crisis and clearly Q3 was better than Q2. But it's giving us confidence that, 
we are not only going to emerge from this crisis ahead of the economy 
overall in a stronger position, but we will be even better 
setup to drive the 
Beverages for Life strategy going forward.
 
And I think you can see that play through from the company, into the 
bottlers. Yes, every country is not equal. But a simple sign is that our third 
quarter was better, because our equity income 
was better, which is a direct 
result of the bottler is doing better in the third quarter.
 
So I think the way the system grasped the nettle in March and April and 
rapidly shared the learnings, and shared the adaptation strategies has paid 
dividends for the 
company and the bottlers during the crisis. And I think we 
are well set up and are all collectively being proactive in setting ourselves up 
to be stronger, when this ends whether that's because the bottlers are going 
to intersect with the upgraded marketin
g, with deeper execution against 
revenue growth management, and local execution.
 
Everyone is very focused on the efficiency of the supply chain and the 
rationalization of the product portfolio will pay dividends through the bottling 
supply chain. The idea 
of moving resources from the kind of 
--
 
the back 
office on to the feet on the street will pay dividends in the bottling system.
 
So I think you see a system in sync philosophically. And driving the changes 
needed to both win in the crisis and emerge stronge
r. And I believe we're in 
a better position the company and the bottlers today to be stronger in the 
long term than we were precrisis.
 
Operator
 
Our next question comes from the line of Nik Modi with RBC Capital Markets. 
Please go ahead. Your line is now op
en.
 
Nik Modi
 
Yes, good morning everyone. So James I was wondering if you could just 
help us understand just kind of two things. Some of the work we've done 
with just local players are making some inroads in terms of market share 
and this is mainly in the e
merging markets. So I want to understand the 
tension between your kind of SKU footprint or your brand footprint and the 
need to be local so you can compete with some of these local competitors.
 
And then just 
--
 
I guess I wanted more clarity on what's the t
imeline? Like 
how do you think about the failing fast phenomenon that you've been 
discussing for the past several quarters, how much time are you going to 
give new initiatives before you decide you're going to ax them? Because 
sometimes you have to stick w
ith an idea to kind of build it, but I just 
wanted to get your perspective around that.
 
James Quincey
 
Sure. I mean market share 
--
 
firstly our headline approach on market share 
is to win in the channels that are open. I mean it's 
--
 
we've talked about it 
o
n the last quarter it's clear. And so we have a stronger position in away
-
from
-
home channels and a higher share in away
-
from
-
home channels than 
we have in at
-
home channels and therefore mechanically as those have 
closed down and locked down we kind of mech
anically lose share.
 
So what we have focused on is to say to the system we must focus on 
winning share in the channels that are open. Because then as the world 
recovers 
--
 
and I'm a strong believer that as the world recovers with the fact 
that we are 
social animals means we will mix and mingle. Some of these 
channels will evolve and not 
--
 
they won't all come back in the same way, 
but away
-
from
-
home will come back and humans will go out and socialize 
and do lots of things. Because they want the experie
nces they're not going 
to stay stuck at home. So it will come back.
 
So we're focused on winning share in the channels that are open and so we 
have been winning share in the 
--
 
for the at
-
home channels. And that is true 
across the board. That's true across 
many, many, many of the countries. It's 
very rare to win in every country all the time, but we have been winning 
broadly across the world in the at
-
home channel.
 
And so 
--
 
and I think you've seen commentary about how bigger brands and 
people have been retu
rning to the brands they know and love from other 
categories and other sectors too. So I think that that's very much what's 
going on.
 
And as we look forward to kind of the focus on going forward the reduction 
of the portfolio by about half is actually goin
g to allow us to bring more 
stronger innovation to the table. This is not about less innovation and less 
ability to tap into local insights it's actually about leveraging the most 
successful vehicles to do that. So already this year, we have seen the 
reven
ue per innovation double versus what we had last year.
 
So it is about combining the platforms and the global and regional brands 
and the platforms to connect to local insights and that is part of the art of 
bringing it to life. And of course in terms of ho
w long do you wait before you 
pull some of these innovations we have some pretty clear metrics.
 
Of course the first thing is to decide what's the innovation for, what's its 
objective? It could be 
--
 
we talked on the call are we trying to get into a new 
cat
egory, are we trying to get 
--
 
are we trying to do a flavor extension on 
the existing brand, is it a packaging innovation, what sort of innovations are 
we talking about. But each one has its mission and has its goals and we are 
very focused on tracking how
 
it's doing and we'll sunset it as and when hope 
is no longer there or rational hope is no longer there.

Our next question comes from the line of Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank. 
Please go ahead. Your line is now open.
 
Steve Powers
 
Hey thanks, goo
d morning. Maybe you could pick up on some of what you 
were speaking to Lauren about and drill down a level. I'm wondering if you 
could talk about the organization's reaction internally to the announcements 
made over the last few months just around restruc
turing and the pivot more 
formally to a networked model and Platform Services etcetera.
 
I'm curious if you've been able to do any formal feedback or capture any 
formal feedback from employees in that regard? And if so, if you found the 
reactions to vary at
 
all by region or function or make you more or less 
encouraged. Any feedback from the organization at large would be great to 
hear that? Thanks.

Sure. Look firstly the two big things to say about that. Firstly of course, we 
have not reached t
he end of the process. We have gone 
--
 
made a decision 
very early on to make this redesign more in the open. I mean often 
restructurings are done in the room by a few people and then announced to 
everyone. That's not what we have done. We have decided that
 
we are 
going to enroll enlist and engage with a much much broader piece of the 
organization to make sure the design is what we want. And so therefore you 
have a more public 
--
 
a longer public timeline which is what we're in.
 
We have gone through a large p
art of the voluntary separation plan, but we 
have not completely finished the design and we are still working on that. But 
all of that leads to the obvious conclusion that a lot of the feedback is 
around uncertainty and when will I know what happens to me 
which is 
completely and totally understandable and we are working as fast as we can 
to provide as much certainty as possible. So that is still ongoing.
 
And as John commented we expect the large majority of all of that to have 
been completed for the clarity
 
by the end of the year. Some parts of the 
world not given local consultation requirements. But the 
--
 
when you stand 
back from the restructuring process, when you take the feedback from the 
employees and we've done surveys and both formal and informal, in
 
the end 
you're going to end up with two types of feedback.
 
You're either going to get a type of feedback which is, I don't understand 
what we're trying to do or I don't understand how we're going to do it yet. 
And the very encouraging thing about where we
've got to so far is, there's a 
great deal of clarity in the employee base around the strategic reasons to do 
what we're doing and how it will help improve and drive the business.
 
And there's a 
--
 
certainly from the people that have been announced leaders 
at the top piece of their network they have 
--
 
they also have that very clear 
and are very energized about bringing it to life. So the majority of the 
questions the vast majority of the questions are on how is it going to come 
to life and of course what do
es this mean to me which is an encouraging 
sign.
 
It's a natural reaction, but it's also an encouraging sign that this is on track 
to deliver the sorts of benefits and support the ability of the company and 
the system to drive the top line. And the feedback
 
from the bottlers is also 
positive on how this will help them and we will collectively as a system be 
stronger.

Our next question comes from the line of Dara Mohsenian from Morgan 
Stanley. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.
 
Dara Mohsenian
 
Hi
, good morning. So James I was hoping to review the restructuring 
program in a bit more detail. First, maybe just can you give us a sense and 
help us better understand how the program came about. How much of the 
reorganization plans that were announced wer
e in process pre
-
COVID or are 
already in the back of your mind and would play out over time versus how 
much impact COVID may have had on changing your plans?
 
And then conceptually just to help us give us some perspective for how 
significant you think chang
es under this program will be operationally in your 
organization maybe a sense relative to past restructurings and sort of your 
enthusiasm for the ultimate fundamental as well as execution payback from 
the program. Thanks.
 
James Quincey
 
Sure. The thinking 
behind where we're going predates COVID. In fact, we 
had a senior leadership meeting with the top 200 in February before the 
crisis became completely apparent where we started to talk about what 
would it take to bring a much more networked organization to 
life and 
started to talk about some of the dimensions. So the idea of the 
reorganization, the purpose of being a networked organization predates 
COVID.
 
And it's a logical consequence from starting to bring the Beverages for Life 
strategy to life no pun int
ended. So it is very much a continuation of where 
we're going. It's an agenda item that was clear. It was coming. Obviously in 
February, we were at the relative beginning stages. What the time of COVID 
particularly Q2 what that did to influence the program
 
was really a couple of 
things. One, it was clear that when we took the actions to refocus the 
system on safety and continuity of supply in Q2, the clarity of moving 
quickly on refocusing on fewer SKUs and the boldness of those decisions are 
paid off very 
quickly. And the insight was not just that, but the ability of the 
organization to act with speed was very encouraging. That led us to conclude 
that we should accelerate even in the course of the pandemic the move to 
the networked organization and really d
rive that forward and push that on. 
And so that's what we've done.
 
As I just said on the last call, we're largely through it. Of course, the other 
thing that came out of pandemic was a decision to try and make it as 
enrolling and engaging with the organiza
tion as possible even at the risk of 
having a longer period of uncertainty because the design is more in the 
public. And I think that has proven to be very powerful in helping us 
optimize the design of what we want. And so that increases our confidence 
lev
el that it will be another key component to helping us emerge stronger 
from the crisis and get up to the top range of the long
-
term growth model.

Our next question comes from the line of Carlos Laboy with HSBC. Please go 
ahead. Your line is now 
open.
 
Carlos Laboy
 
Yes. Good morning, everyone. James you have several new presidents 
including new heads for the U.S., Latin America and Europe. How might their 
respective divisions change under their new leadership? What might be 
some of the top opportun
ities that you wish for each of these individuals to 
focus on?
 
James Quincey
 
Yes. They're not all new to the parts of the world they're in. Obviously, 
Nikolaos who is leading Europe was leading EMEA before which obviously 
included Europe. So very much in t
he case of Europe, which was doing very 
well. Nikolaos represents a great deal of strategic continuity. And obviously 
self
-
evidently in the case of Europe we have the challenges of not just the 
expansion of the portfolio and success in the categories, but 
also the 
recovery of the away
-
from
-
home channel. So 
--
 
but there's a great deal of 
leadership continuity in Europe.
 
In the case of Latin America, Henrique who's now leading Latin America was 
leading the Brazilian business and Brazil is the star performer s
o far this 
year. And that is not just a consequence of the actions they've been taking 
in the short
-
term. The Brazilian system us with the bottlers have been very 
focused on responding to what several years ago was a very deep recession 
or depression in th
e Brazilian economy doubling down on the brand portfolio, 
doubling down on affordability through big investments with the bottlers in 
returnable packaging looking at execution and coolers. And that is paying 
dividends this year and helping drive Brazil to 
be the best
-
performing 
business unit so far in terms of absolute growth. And so Henrique deeply 
knows Latin America and the strategic challenges that we have there and 
will be fully capable to lead there.
 
And then Alfredo is coming in to the U.S., where we
 
have been on a good 
track in terms of driving the portfolio and gaining share in the U.S. business. 
And certainly, we're hoping to continue the best of everything that was 
happening in the U.S. before, but also infuse it with some of the thinking 
from Lat
in America whether that be around revenue growth management 
particularly in the economic times we're in, some of the sharpness on the 
portfolio and on the margins and working with the bottlers as well on the 
supply chain.

Our next question comes f

Please go ahead. Your line is now open.
 
Kevin Grundy
 
Great. Thanks. Good morning, everyone. John, a quick housekeeping 
question. And then James, a question on seltzers. So the housekeeping 
question is you indica
ted marketing spend was below last year's levels, but 
sort of picking up sequentially. Can you frame the magnitude for us either 
year
-
over
-
year or as a percent of sales?
 
James, the broader question is on the Topo Chico launch in hard seltzers 
specifically 
in the U.S. Just maybe spend a little bit of time how the 
agreement with Molson Coors came about and why you determined they're 
the right partner? How the Coca
-
Cola Company is defining success in the 
category? Is there a specific market share ambition? And
 
then more broadly 
how do you plan to differentiate in an increasingly crowded category what is 
Topo Chico's proverbial right to win? So thanks to offer all that.
 
John Murphy
 
First, the housekeeper here. 30% decline year
-
over
-
year. But Q3 and Q2, 
showed 
--
 
I don't have the number exactly in front of me but showed about 
65% on 30% from Q3 over Q2. So we continue to look at that sequential 
improvement Kevin quarter
-
to
-
quarter. And I'd expect Q4 based on what 
we're seeing around the world to 

 
for us to contin
ue to have targeted 
investments in those markets where it makes sense to do so.
 
And as I said earlier, as you look at 2021, I would encourage you to think 
about 2019 as an anchor. And then from there factor in the work that we 
have underway on the marketin
g area, particularly marketing innovation to 
drive greater efficiency. We know there's a lot of opportunity when you wire 
the organization together. And the way we're doing it, it unlocks a lot of 
opportunity for us to do the same with less or to do more w
ith the same. 
And that is 

 
that will be the part of the strategy conversation going into 
2021, as to which of the approaches we take on a market
-
by
-
market basis.
 
James Quincey
 
Yes Topo Chico. We're very excited about opportunities in Topo Chico. 
Obviously
, it's a fantastic sparkling mineral water brand and has done very 
well. The U.S. situation is very unique and specific. Clearly our starting 
position for innovations is to work with our bottling system. The best result 
is much more likely in terms of scal
e and profit to be the nexus between 
brands that the company owns and drives and go through the bottling 
system, and that's how we're approaching the Topo Chico Hard Seltzer 
outside the U.S.
 
In the U.S., it's very specifically driven by the nature of the r
egulation of the 
beer market or the alcohol market in the U.S. And many of you I'm sure are 
familiar with the 3
-
tier system for the U.S. marketplace, which is unique to 
the U.S. So we're launching in Latin America with our bottlers. But as it 
relates to th
e U.S., we have to find a path within in the 3
-
tier system. And 
so that's why we've looked for an external partner or more specifically a 
partner already in the alcohol industry.
 
It also relates to the fact that having someone who is an existing brewer is 
a 
much easier supply chain path into the category. And it also happens to be 
the case that the network of distributors the Molson Coors has also connects 
with some of the parallel businesses of people who are connected to the 
Coke system. So the U.S. struc
ture is very specific to the U.S. regulatory 
requirements and to the partners who we think can help us drive what's 
needed for Topo Chico.
 
How do we find success? This is going to be an explorer brand from us. I 
mean we are for sure clear that what we don'
t know about the alcohol and 
Hard Seltzer category is more than what we do know. And we need to 
continue to work our way to understand these opportunities as much as we 
did with Lemon
-
Do in Japan, starting small, learning and then expanding as 
we got succe
ss. And so we will take a very similar approach in the U.S. with 
Topo Chico Hard Seltzer as to working exactly what connects with 
consumers and what connects with retailers.
 
And in terms of differentiation, clearly there's going to be differentiation 
throu
gh the flavors, through the product itself, through the packaging. But 
also I think it builds on a tremendous strength. I mean Topo Chico is still 
growing fantastically across the U.S. and is the leading sparkling water 
brand in places like Texas. So I thi
nk that the brand itself is an established 
iconic interesting brand for the consumers that are interested in Hard 
Seltzer. So I think it's everything there indicates that it should be a great 
opportunity, we just need to bring it to life.

Our next question comes from the line of Andrea Teixeira from JPMorgan. 
Please go ahead. Your line is now open.
 
Andrea Teixeira
 
Thank you. And so my question is 
more on what you can control on the 
reinvestment commentary in the fourth quarter and the first quarter of next 
year. John, should we be thinking that would continue to be fully financed by 
the restructuring savings? In other words, should we expect your o
perating 
margins to continue to move in the right direction in 2021, given the cost 
savings and the mix improving? Thank you.
 
John Murphy
 
So I think we need to 

 
you need to think about 2020 as being a very 
unusual year in which we have obviously been 
able to manage very tightly 
our cost base through the pandemic and particularly through the worst 
phases of it, which in turn has allowed us to deliver operating margin 
improvements that are out of the normal pattern you would expect.
 
I would encourage you
 
to think about our long
-
term growth model has been 
the 

 
again the anchor. Embedded in our long
-
term growth model is a belief 
that we can over time continue to expand margins. And the actions that we 
are taking, which will have an impact in 2021 going int
o 2022 also, those 
actions are I believe will allow us to deliver on that algorithm as we go 
forward. So again, 2021 versus 2020, we're going to be cycling an unusual 
set of circumstances. And I think that needs to be appropriately factored in 
to the model
s that you will be deploying.
 
Operator
 
Our next question comes from the line of Bill Chappell with Truist Securities. 
Please go ahead. Your line is now open.
 
Bill Chappell
 
Thanks. Good morning. Can you just give me 

 
give us a little more color on 
the mast
er brand reduction. And when I say that I understand that it's only 
1% of kind of total revenue but maybe where that's dispersed in terms of is 
there one geography that's going to see more cuts? Is there a bigger hit, as 
we're kind of looking at our models
 
from certain areas?
 
And then also just trying to understand these 

 
I know they don't generate a 
lot of revenue but they certainly are occupying some shelf space. So how 
quickly can you replace that shelf space? Or is there any risk that that shelf 
space 
is taken by competitors who see some free space? Or just help me 
understand kind of the color on how it really affects the revenue model over 
the next maybe six to 12 months.
 
James Quincey
 
Yeah. So the brands themselves are distributed across the categorie
s 
probably slightly more in the hydration space than any of the other 
--
 
of 
sparkling coffee and tea or juice dairy and plant. But the brands are 
distributed across all the different categories. They tend to be much more 
local in terms of brands.
 
And so tw
o things are going to happen. One, there's going to be some 
brands we're going to retire. But there are some brands where the better 
answer is to transition it into one of the regional brands. So it might be we 
have a strong regional juice brand and then t
here's a local brand in one 
market and we're going to transition it into the regional brand because it's 
going to be much more efficient and effective to leverage the marketing and 
the innovation but from that regional brand rather than repeating everythin
g 
into the local brand.
 
So the 
--
 
we're talking mainly about the very tail and a much more local 
brand tail but brands that are spread across multiple categories. Clearly our 
objective is to convert the shelf space from these brands into ones that we 
own. 
Some of that has already effectively happened because of COVID. In 
the Q2 in particular in order to preserve the effectiveness of the supply 
chain, we already stopped making a set of SKUs including some of the 
brands and captured that shelf space for our m
ain brands.
 
Other places where it's a transition from a local brand to a regional or a 
global brand clearly we'll be managing that with the customers so we would 
not expect to lose shelf space.
 
I think in simple terms of the revenue model, the benefits 
--
 
I would think 
about it is the benefits we're going to get from freeing up that shelf space 
and freeing up the process and innovation time of those brands should be 
made up by 
--
 
at least made up by existing global or regional brands. And I 
would not 
--
 
I c
ertainly am not starting to think that this is a headwind to 
results in the next six to 12 months I would just assume that we're going to 
make it all up with the portfolio we have.

Our next question comes from the line of Kaumil Gajrawala from Cre
dit 
Suisse. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.
 
Kaumil Gajrawala
 
Thank you. Good morning, everyone. A couple of questions on some of your 
commentary. When you are talking about being at the high end of your 
algorithm, because of the structural changes 
that you've made, or more 
because as we go into 2021 obviously there's a very unique comparison for 
this year?
 
And also I believe the commentary for share repurchase is new. If that's the 
case can you maybe just provide a little more context on what you're
 
seeing 
in terms of cash flow and balance sheet that makes you feel comfortable to 
be talking about a potential share repurchase at this juncture? Thank you.
 
John Murphy
 
So let me take that. On the last point there's actually no change in our views 
on shar
e repurchase. I think it's very consistent with what we've talked 
about on previous calls, our priorities as we look ahead are to reinvest in the 
business and to continue to support the dividend. We continue to have an 
opportunistic view on the M&A front, 
although don't expect a whole lot on 
that on the horizon there. And share repos have really 
--
 
was our number 
fourth on the on the priority list and we expect them to stay there for the 
foreseeable future. So that's on that point.
 
Regarding the higher end 
of the algorithm, yeah, I think 2021 is 
--
 
we're 
going to be cycling a set of unusual factors. My view on the algorithm I think 
James will share this too is that we're talking about getting back to the 
higher end of the algorithm. As you think about the 
--
 
over the next 
--
 
over 
the mid
-
term. So the higher end when I think about the algorithm I'm 
looking at a 2022 versus 2019. 2021 versus 2020 is going to produce a not 
usual set I think of results. But that's to be expected given what's happened 
particularly
 
in Q2 and in Q3.

Our next question comes from the line of Rob Ottenstein with Evercore. 
Please go ahead. Your line is now open.
 
Rob Ottenstein
 
Great. Thank you. Just a point of clarification on the brand reduction what 
kind of impact will that ha
ve if any on working capital? And does that help 
you get where you want to go? And then my main question is on trademark 
Coke, which looked very, very strong. Can you give us more color on that, 
what you're doing to grow share despite the fact that you bro
ught 
advertising down and where you see the brand equity today compared to 
last year? Thank you.
 
John Murphy
 
Let me take the working capital question. Minimal impact overall. There's a 
real opportunity here to clean up our internal supply chain end
-
to
-
end.
 
So 
when you think about the amount of small purchases that are required to 
support these brands that are 
--
 
that represent the long end of the tail it's a 
pretty sizable number, but relative to our overall working capital it's not that 
material. But it ce
rtainly gives us a little bit of a tailwind as we go into 2021.
 
James Quincey
 
Yeah on Coke, I mean, look firstly, while we have been judicious in our use 
of marketing spend in Q2 particularly but also in Q3 we have continued to 
market including 
marketing strongly behind the Coke brand. So we have 
continued to market. Clearly that's also been linked by great work with the 
bottlers on some revenue growth management, particularly affordability 
plays in some parts of the world, adjusting the portfoli
o, the packaging 
portfolio given the skew to at
-
home channels in many other parts of the 
world, good local execution.
 
So there is continued focus and investment behind Coke. And I think that's 
clearly paying dividends as we've gone from Q2 to Q3. So as you
 
pointed out 
in Q3 Coke is growing. Coke is gaining share. And that is also being powered 
by an ongoing focus on Coke Zero Sugar where that grew high single digits 
in the third quarter in terms of volume.
 
So we are clearly continuing to invest behind Coke 
among many of the other 
brands. And we see the brand responding and doing well and believe as we 
increase investment into the fourth quarter and into 2021, that Coke will 
continue to be a motor of growth.

Bonnie Herzog
 
Hi. Thank you. Good morning, everyone. I just had a quick question on 
North America. Your price/mix in the quarter was especially strong relative 
to expectations. So cou
ld you drill down a little bit more on the key drivers 
of the strength, especially, since it looks like you took some pricing? And 
then, really, how should we think about this going forward in the context of 
mix and, especially, if we see some of the press
ures in the on
-
premise 
channel getting better? Thanks.
 
James Quincey
 
Yes, sure. Yes. Obviously, it was pleasing in the third quarter to see the 
price/mix from North America. Firstly, that was 
--
 
got a big component being 
driven by our focus on some of the 
premium offerings, whether that be 
Simply or fairlife which 
--
 
and some of the finished goods businesses we 
own.
 
So, obviously, there's a sort of 
--
 
there's good news, because we're driving 
premium categories or subcategories, but also recognize that some 
of that is 
finished goods products that we are selling. And that offset some of the 
pressures we feel in fountain channels and in other away
-
from
-
home 
channels. So it's good news. I'm not sure that we'll always do 4%, but it's 
being driven in part by this 
mix effect of the different finished goods versus 
non
-
finished goods and fountain business.

Our next question comes from the line of Sean King from UBS. Please go

Sean King
 
Good morning. You said that FX would have a 
minimal impact on your 
preliminary 2021 outlook. I guess how much variability could still exist? And 
are you hedged on the G10 currencies into 2021 at this point? And then, on 
top of that any color you can provide on your inflation outlook, given 
aluminum 
and freight rising recently.
 
John Murphy
 
Yes. So with regard to 2021, we are substantially hedged on the G10 
currencies. And as we've discussed in prior calls, the bigger variable and 
point of volatility is what happens to the large emerging currencies, 
pa
rticularly in Latin America and in Africa. So to the extent that they stay 
pretty solid and will be in 
--
 
as I said, we would see minimal impact.
 
And then, with regard to the commodity situation, this year has been a 
favorable year for us on the commodity 
front. And we would expect 2021 
based on the latest estimates we have on the various components to be 
pretty even with 2020. And to your point on aluminum, in particular, there'll 
be maybe just a slight favorability based on what we see at the moment. We 
d
o see on PET, there will be some

I think some slight increases, but we

Hey, good morning, everyone, and thanks for squeezing me in the lineup. So 
I got a question about the U.S. fountain business. While the particularity of 
the U.S. business is that, you own the fountain business and in the current 
circ
umstances and with the broader strategy, the reflection you have on 
your organization, I wanted to understand if you envisage refranchising the 
fountain business there and managing the same way you do, I mean, 
outside of the U.S. And what was the rationale
 
to keep it in
-
house? And how 
are you adjusting that piece of the business to be more agile and support 
the overall goal you have set for the company post
-
COVID? Thank you.
 
James Quincey
 
Yes. It was a little difficult to hear you there Laurent, but I think
 
you're 
asking a question about the U.S. fountain business and how it's doing. I 
mean, clearly, it's a big part of the operation. It's about 30% of the volume 
in the U.S. and it's a very important package format or channel intersection.
 
Clearly, it's been 
heavily affected by the COVID crisis. And within that QSRs 
have clearly been at the better end, whereas things related to transport and 
amusement have been 
--
 
continue to be at the more impacted end. But we 
very much manage the business not just to do the 
best for each and every 
one of the customers that use the fountain equipment, but as one of the 
packaging formats that brings our brands to life. So the brand strategies are 
holistic and look across the different packaging formats and different channel 
for
mats and we continue to think that that business will be a prosperous 
business with a good road to recovery.

Thank you, Tim, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will touch briefly on 
a few key highlights in the quarter before handing off to James to provide a 
more detailed review of our operational performance. During the 
quarter, we 
continued our progress towards transforming our company to a higher 
margin and return business focused on our core value creation model of 
building strong brands, enhancing customer value, and leading our franchise 
system. Our continued focus o
n our five strategic initiatives enabled us to 
deliver another quarter of global value share gains, while delivering 3% 
organic revenue growth in a worsening macroeconomic environment.
 
Importantly, our segmented revenue growth strategies drove three points
 
of 
price/mix in the quarter. Further, our strong focus on productivity was 
instrumental in expanding operating profit margins and delivering our profit 
target. While we are pleased we accelerated our price/mix from 1% last 
quarter to 3% this quarter, our 
volume and top
-
line results still fell short of 
our expectations. This was largely due to a weakening demand in certain 
large emerging and developing markets, which also impacted our company
-
owned bottling operations' revenue growth. Within our Bottling In
vestments 
segment, positive pricing at our North American bottler was offset by 
challenges in our China bottling operations, resulting in even organic 
revenues for our company
-
owned bottling operations globally.
 
However, our core franchise operations conti
nued to perform well, growing 
organic revenues a full point ahead of our consolidated organic revenues and 
in line with our long
-
term targets. Despite weaker conditions in several 
emerging and developing markets, we continued to see a positive return on 
ou
r marketing investments, with solid performance in key markets such as 
United States, Japan, and Mexico, which James will touch on in more detail.
 
While the macroeconomic headwinds we are facing in these emerging and 
developing markets are cyclical in natu
re and not secular downturns, we're 
not expecting a material improvement in the remainder of the year, given 
the continuing volatility in the global economy. This outlook, coupled with 
where we are year
-
to
-
date, will make achieving our previous 4% to 5% 
or
ganic revenue growth rate very challenging. Therefore, we are lowering 
our outlook for full
-
year consolidated organic revenue growth. James and 
Kathy will discuss this in greater detail later on the call.
 
With that being said, we remain fully committed and
 
confident in achieving 
our underlying profit target, despite this challenging environment. We're also 
confident that our core organic revenue growth will continue to outperform 
our consolidated organic revenue growth by a full point.
 
Finally, we remain on
 
track with our refranchising efforts, and we are 
confident we will complete those efforts by the end of 2017. Over the past 
few months, we successfully completed the Coca
-
Cola European Partners 
and Coca
-
Cola Beverages Africa transactions, announced the tr
ansfer of 
certain territories in the United States to Arca Continental, UNITED venture 
and reached a new understanding with Coca
-
Cola FEMSA regarding joint 
value creation in Mexico and certain territorial expansion opportunities for 
company
-
owned bottling 
operations, which was announced just this 
morning. As we work through the comprehensive refranchising and near
-
term macro challenges, we will emerge a much stronger company with 
higher margins and returns and better positioned to deliver on our long
-
term 
g
rowth targets.
 
I will now hand the call over to James, who will provide you with a more 
detailed look at our operating performance.
 
James Quincey

President & Chief Operating Officer
 
Thank you, Muhtar. Good morning, everyone. As Muhtar said, our 
consolida
ted volume and revenue results came in below our expectations. So 
let me first talk about where, why, and what we're doing about that. Our 
volume deceleration from the first quarter was concentrated in a few number 
of markets facing specific macroeconomic 
challenges; firstly, China, but also 
Argentina and Venezuela. The slowdown in our consolidated organic revenue 
versus our core organic revenue, which grew 4%, the consolidated slowdown 
was due to our Bottling Investments segment slowdown. It's the mechanic
al 
effect of owning both bottling operations as well as concentrate operations in 
certain challenged markets. BIG slowdown was principally driven by the 
challenges the industry, the broad industry, is facing in China.
 
So let's start with China. And what ar
e we doing about it? There are three 
factors impacting our performance in China. First, no question, the overall 
consumer environment is weakening due to the economy's economic 
transition. Secondly, as this is occurring, wholesalers are adjusting to lower 
expected sales growth and bringing down inventory levels, which has a 
whiplash effect on our bottler sales. Third, there are some category mix 
shifts occurring as different consumer segments respond to these new 
circumstances. For example, juice and juice 
drinks category is the weakest 
performing, whereas premium water is stronger and positive. So there's an 
opportunity here to both innovate with more premium products positioned 
for the higher income new mainstream consumer segment, as well as 
opportunities
 
to address strong affordability needs across the rural and blue
-
collar areas.
 
So I guess importantly, perhaps most importantly, what are we doing about 
it? Firstly, we've got a number of new premiumizing offers across multiple 
categories we compete in bei
ng launched. We're also focusing on better 
execution, particularly in the second tier and rural areas where they serve 
more of the mass consumer segment and upping the game in terms of 
affordable offerings. We are also rebasing the way we approach trade 
in
centives to drive better performance with wholesaler and from our own 
distributors.
 
Now, despite these actions to improve our business, we still expect our 
China operation to be under pressure for the remainder of the year. This is a 
key factor driving the
 
organic revenue outlook, particularly the difference 
between consolidated and core, but I think it is worth finally making a note 
that we are keeping a long
-
term perspective with regard to China. We 
always knew that for a country as large as China, transi
tioning to a 
consumer
-
led economy was going to have its challenges. Those may have 
turned out to be more than we expected in the short
-
term; however, we 
absolutely believe in the long
-
term opportunity of this market of 1.4 billion 
consumers with relatively
 
low beverage per capitas compared to the global 
average.
 
Okay. So that's China. Let's move for a second to our core business. The 
core business, understood as the concentrate and the franchising business, 
this is where we grew organic revenues 4% for the 
first half of the year as 
segmented revenue growth strategies continue to drive positive results. Yes, 
some markets are tough, but others are doing very well.
 
Let me start, perhaps, with the more challenging markets. I've already 
touched on China, so let m
e move to a couple of the other ones I mentioned 
earlier. Argentina, we believe that the Argentinian government is taking the 
right steps to secure its economic recovery, but this is resulting in a 
contraction in the near
-
term that accelerated in the secon
d quarter, 
therefore impacting our business. In Venezuela, severe shortages in certain 
raw materials resulted in us temporarily suspending production at the 
bottling partners' plants during the quarter, clearly impacting the results.
 
Additionally, Brazil, 
the challenges there are well
-
understood and we think 
will continue for the remainder of the year; however, we are focusing on key 
affordability packages and activating a strong Olympic marketing campaign 
in the coming weeks and months. We have lived throu
gh downturns before 
in emerging and developing markets and understand how to manage the 
business in these circumstances. It requires a disciplined approach to pricing 
relative to inflation and, of course, where necessary, aggressively moving to 
address con
sumer dynamics through adjusting the portfolio, both in terms of 
affordability and product innovation.
 
But as I said earlier, not every market is under pressure. In markets with 
relatively stable economies, we are executing our strategies and seeing 
strong
 
results. For example, in North America, we grew organic revenues 
4% in the quarter, reflecting continued pricing initiatives for our sparkling 
business as well as the ongoing strength of our stills portfolio. In Mexico and 
Japan, we're delivering strong p
erformance across our portfolio, driven 
heavily by innovation. And turning to some of the emerging markets, in 
Southeast Asia, we are growing volume double digits year
-
to
-
date behind 
strong integrated marketing and commercial initiatives across the core 
br
ands and key entry level packaging.
 
Taken together, these results give us confidence that in stable markets 
where we increase our investments in marketing innovation, combined with 
improving marketplace execution, we can continue to deliver strong 
performa
nce. Ultimately, we operate in over 200 countries, and there will 
always be some markets with macro challenges. Our ability to grow doesn't 
require macro perfection.
 
In fact, even with this current broader macro adjustment phase in a good 
number of 
emerging markets, our segmented revenue growth strategies are 
enabling us to capture solid pricing of 3% year
-
to
-
date for our core 
operations on top of 1% volume growth. And we're using the productivity to 
prudently fund marketing where there is momentum a
nd where we see a 
solid payback, but we're also holding on and making sure that we can use it 
to deliver strong underlying margin expansion. These actions have enabled 
us to grow underlying profit before tax in line with our expectations for the 
first half
 
of the year, and despite more challenging conditions than we 
initially expected.
 
So let me conclude by saying we are confident in our growth strategies. We 
continue to push in markets where we see success and proactively address 
those markets that are mor
e challenged, of course, while always keeping an 
eye on the long
-
term.
 
So with that, let me hand over to Kathy to take you through the numbers.
 
Kathy N. Waller

Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
 
Thank you, James, and good morning, everyon
e. I'd like to touch quickly on 
our financial performance in the quarter before providing our full
-
year 
outlook. Starting at the top line, our organic revenue growth was impacted 
about a point by our segment mix, as our Bottling Investments segment 
grew sl
ower than our core business. At gross profit, our comparable margin 
declined 20 basis points due to currency and structural headwinds. Excluding 
the effect of these items, our underlying gross margin expanded over 100 
basis points, driven by solid pricing,
 
a slightly favorable cost environment, 
productivity and segment mix. Our comparable operating margin improved 
about 15 (14:31) basis points. Similar to gross margin, currency and 
structural headwinds impacted our operating margin. Excluding the effect of 
these items, our underlying operating margin increased about 180 basis 
points in the quarter, due to gross margin expansion, as well as the timing 
of productivity savings and certain expenses.
 
Now, turning to outlook, as Muhtar mentioned, we are revising o
ur full
-
year 
top line target. For the full year, we now expect 3% organic revenue growth. 
With that said, we are confident our strategies will deliver stronger organic 
growth for our core business. And we are maintaining our full
-
year 
underlying profit tar
get as we continue to manage our business. Therefore, 
we expect to deliver comparable currency neutral ex
-
structural income 
before tax growth of 6% to 8%, in line with our long
-
term target.
 
During the first half of the year, we generated strong underlying 
operating 
leverage. Consistent with our previously
-
provided guidance, we expect this 
to moderate as we begin to cycle more difficult comparisons in the back half 
of this year. Coca
-
Cola European Partners closed about a month earlier than 
we estimated in ou
r previous structural guidance. And we continue to move 
faster with our refranchising efforts in North America. Therefore, we are 
updating our full
-
year structural outlook. We now expect a six to seven point 
structural headwind on net revenue and a four po
int headwind on income 
before tax. Our currency outlook remains the same as our previous 
guidance, a two to three point headwind on net revenue and an eight to nine 
point headwind on income before tax. So taking all of this into consideration, 
we expect fu
ll
-
year comparable EPS to decline 4% to 7%.
 
And there are a few phasing items to consider when constructing your 
models. Our fourth quarter has two additional days, as compared to last 
year, which will result in stronger top line growth in the fourth quart
er than 
in the third quarter. In addition, the two additional days in the fourth 
quarter, coupled with what we are cycling in SG&A in the third quarter of 
last year, means operating leverage will skew strongly into the fourth 
quarter.
 
Therefore, we expect 
virtually all of our growth in comparable currency 
neutral ex
-
structural income before tax to come in the fourth quarter. We 
expect structural items to be a nine point headwind on net revenue and a 
three point headwind on income before tax in the third qua
rter. Finally, we 
expect currency to be a two point headwind on net revenue and a two to 
three point headwind on income before tax in the third quarter.
 
In closing, our strategies are working in key markets. We are on track to 
deliver over $600 million in 
productivity this year, and we continue to 
accelerate our refranchising efforts. While our expectations for top line 
growth have softened, we remain confident in our ability to deliver our profit 
target this year.

Thank you. Our first question comes from Steve Powers of UBS. Your line is 
open.
 
Stephen R. Powers

Great. Hi. Good morning. Maybe we could start with a question for James on 
China mainly, because it
 
sounds like that market was the biggest driver of 
the gap between your reported 3% organic growth and the 4% core number 
that you that cited, and I'm guessing it cost you roughly a point of unit case 
volume in the quarter as well. So first, is that right?
 
But more importantly, is 
there a way to parse how much of the adverse impact is tied to the macro 
slowing, which I think is more likely to persist, versus supply chain 
corrections and wholesaler inventory de
-
stockings, which might hopefully be 
more transi
tory?
 
I guess I'm really trying to assess just how much of a headwind China was in 
Q2 and then how severe you expect the ongoing headwind to be, 
acknowledging the improvement initiatives that you called out? And then 
finally, do the issues facing BIG in Ch
ina impede, at all, your ability to 
refranchise that market on time and on favorable terms? Thanks.
 
James Quincey

President & Chief Operating Officer
 
Okay. Morning, Steve. So, okay, let me try and get to China, and let me 
start from the top and work down
wards, if I may. I mean, firstly, it's clear 
that, when you look at The Coke Company, almost half our revenue comes 
from bottling versus the other half comes from concentrate and franchise, 
but given, as you all know, that a bottling business comes with fo
ur to five 
times more revenue per drink sold and the accompanying cost, any effect on 
the revenue of the bottler is going to have a magnified impact on revenue 
and much less on profits, which is part of this dynamic.
 
So in China, it's our largest internati
onal bottling operation. We own bottlers 
that are roughly 20% of the global business, but the biggest one outside the 
U.S. is China. So that's where it's coming from. And it's the mechanical 
impact of being hit in China, where we own about a third of the s
ystem, 
that's creating that whole difference between the 3% and the 4%. And what 
we've assumed in our outlook, just to be more confident, clear in our 
confidence going forward, is we have not really assumed that China is going 
to get better in the rest of 
the year. So if it did, that would be great. But we 
are assuming it's not in terms of our outlook and guidance, but obviously 
we're working to try and make it better.
 
Now, as I said, as you kind of tried to split the difference, what's changing is 
both the
 
consumer and the supply chain. I think in round numbers from a 
revenue perspective, you've got about half the impact coming from the 
consumer and half coming from the supply chain.
 
What's happening on the consumer, you can see is it in the scanned Neilson
, 
and the non
-
scanned Neilson is probably a bit worse than the scanned 
Neilson in terms of slowdown in sell
-
out to the consumers of all types of 
FMCG categories, so it is a kind of a broad
-
based consumer slowdown. 
Within that, from a beverage point of view
, you've got juice drinks and 
juices, which were kind of more for the rural areas and blue
-
collar, they are 
down double digits in terms of revenue from a consumer point of view. 
Something like Coke is down low single digits and premium waters is 
growing. S
o there's a shift in the category mix going on, which is also 
actually impacts revenue because juice drink prices tend to be higher than 
sparkling or water, so that doesn't flow through to profitability. So there is a 
kind of rebasing going on in there.
 
Bu
t as I said, about half of it's the supply chain, the whiplash effect of the 
de
-
stocking by the customers and that, as you say, is likely to be a much 
shorter
-
term impact, but, again, we're working on it, but we're not including 
an improvement in that in o
ur outlook, although clearly, we want to get 
focused on it and get it to work.
 
I agree with you. The consumer thing will take a little more time to come 
back, which is why we're focused on our kind of the game plan we know that 
works in downturns, where we
 
focus on affordability, on premiumizing for 
those parts of the country, like the premium metro areas, and bringing out 
new products for them. And that way, we believe we can gain value share, 
which we continue to do, in China, so that we're set up as the 
consumer 
starts recovering. So about half and half and we believe that the consumer 
will come back and the supply chain will sort itself out in the relative short
-
term in the rest of this year.
 
Now, with regard to the refranchising, obviously, can't really
 
comment on 
the M&A, but I would say that we and our partners all believe in the long
-
term potential of the China market. We're very excited and, as I said, 
because a large part of what's happening in the short
-
term is de
-
stocking in 
inventory. Everyone's 
looking past that and looking to the long
-
term, and I 
think there's still good motivation and animation by everyone to get the deal 
done. And we'll obviously, from our point of view, make sure we do it on the 
right terms for ourselves. And they'll be looki
ng for the right terms for them, 
but we still think it's the right deal for everyone and with a good likelihood of 
getting done.

r
 
Dara, I'll just comment first and then maybe ask Kathy and James if they 
want to add anything. But certainly you've answered part of it by saying 
that, yes, revenue challenges are coming from those areas that have much 
lower margins, number one, for sure
. And then, secondly, productivity 
efforts are continuing that's driving the margin expansion in quarter two. 
Kathy mentioned the significant margin expansions that we have achieved. 
And I think productivity efforts are going to continue.
 
And then, finally
, I think there's also a mix. Some of our better markets, 
more profitable markets, are doing well, like the United States and Mexico 
and also in the Far East and Japan, so there's a mix issue. And then, finally, 
the commodities continue to be pretty benign
 
in terms of the outlook. So 
those are the things that play into all together, but primarily, the one that 
you mentioned, which is the revenue challenges are coming from much 
lower margin areas in terms of our business. Kathy, anything to add?
 
Kathy N. Wal

we will still be on our guidance.
 
Ahmet Muhtar Kent

Yeah, we're overall very confident that the changes in marketing, the 
strategy on innovation pipeline, the One Brand strategy, which is jus
t at the 
beginning, the promotions that we have in store in the summer around the 
Olympics, the price/mix expansion that we've experienced in quarter two, all 
of that we feel play very into the equation and feel, give us confidence in the 
back half that th
ere are likely more challenging comps in the back half that 
we can actually cycle them and achieve them going forward and feel 
confident that we can.

6% to 8% range for 2016 relative to Q1 guidance, so you gave that sam
e 
guidance in Q1, and the structural move only went from negative 3% to 4%, 
to negative 4%, so, like a 50 basis points change there, currency is still a 
8% to 9% drag. I guess I'm confused about what's driving the EPS guidance 
effectively down by two point
s at the midpoint. So what's going on between 
profit before tax and the EPS to drag it down another two points? Because 
the only thing that seems like it's changing is the structural, in what you've 
told us, relative to Q1. That's my first question. I have
 
another one, if you 
permit me.
 
Kathy N. Waller 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
 
Okay, Ali. So basically, it's in the rounding. So, yes, we gave comparable 
currency neutral guidance on EPS of 4% to 6%, and that was comparable 
currency n
eutral. So then when you either take out another rounded point of 
structural, so it rounded down, but it's really is a rounding point of 
structural. And then you take out currency, that gets you basically in the 
actual numbers, if you take out only a point
 
of structural, gets you to 3% to 
6%, but then it's in the rounding, so that's how we came up with the 4% to 
7%.
 
Ali Dibadj

Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC
 
Okay.
 
Kathy N. Waller 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
 
If you start with the 
4% to 6%, you back out the currency and you back out 
a rounded point of structural, that gets you down to your 3% to 6% and 
then it's really in the rounding to get to the 4% to 7%.
 
Ali Dibadj 
-
 
Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC
 
Okay. I have trouble getting th
ere. Maybe I'll follow up. I still see it being 
kind of an incremental point somewhere in there. But basically you're saying 
there's no change in the gap between PBT and EPS. Tax isn't changing. 
There's no other things in there, right?
 
Kathy N. Waller

Ch
ief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
 
No. That's correct.

The second piece is in the press release and, James, in some of your 
comments, I think, you said, look, we are, from the release, ""reassessing 
local market initiatives"". Can you tell us a little bit
 
more about what you 
mean exactly, so where? Is it all about China, perhaps Argentina? And is 
advertising spend as a percentage of sales still up for you in the quarter? 
And does it impact, in any way, this confidence we had a year ago, six 
months ago, abo
ut really good ROIs on the marketing spend? Thanks.
 
James Quincey 
-
 
President & Chief Operating Officer
 
Sure. I think perhaps that's two questions in the second question there, Ali, 
but let me have a go. Look, in terms of reassessing the actions, that's bo
th 
on the places with momentum and the places that are suffering. There are 
parts of the business that are growing strongly, whether that's at one end of 
the spectrum like the U.S. and Japan, where we've got good momentum. 
And the U.S. grew organically 4% 
in the quarter. Japan is growing well. We 
are increasing the amount of spend as we see the tailwinds and the 
effectiveness of the marketing, the innovation, the execution.
 
So we're reallocating money to the places that have momentum. And that's 
on the deve
loped end, like the U.S. and Japan. It's also on the emerging 
end, like Indonesia and the Philippines and places like that. So we're going 
where we see the opportunity to get the biggest bang for the buck.
 
Now, we're taking some of the money from those mar
kets that are under 
most pressure, and, in those places, we're prioritizing. Yes, there's still some 
advertising, but we're doing innovations and we're doing execution and very 
importantly, doing affordability. So the most extreme example perhaps is 
Venezu
ela, where there was no sugar. And we've actually doubled
-
down on 
really driving Coke with zero sugar in Venezuela with kind of a full red One 
Brand look. So there are places where we are adjusting to the need that just 
because you advertise, doesn't mean 
people are going to buy if it's an 
affordability problem. And I think China is a good example of where 
affordability is in there as well, and I think I've talked a bit about China.
 
But the game plan that we've used in those emerging markets under 
pressure,
 
we're really (30:44) rolling out, so that reassessing is moving 
some top line money to those with momentum and doubling
-
down on 
execution and affordability and innovation in those pressured markets. And 
that kind of goes a bit to the advertising. Advertis
ing is up this quarter as we 
continue to see the value of advertising as part of the marketing mix in 
combination with innovation and execution. It's only when you get all of 
those together that you really get the best returns, and we always look to 
make s
ure that all three are there. Otherwise, we'll end up wasting our 
money.
 
So we're out there and we're pushing ahead with it. And I think what we 
always have said is that advertising takes some time to work. So, for 
example, the One Brand strategy that we a
nnounced in the first quarter, we 
started the rollout, the latest iteration of the graphics went into Mexico a 
couple of months ago. That sort of marketing innovation takes time to build 
up an effect. So we'll keep pressing away with the investment and kee
p 
assessing. It's too early to call the success. We'd do that towards the end of 
the year, but we are focused on making that work.
 
Ahmet Muhtar Kent

Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
Ali, just to add to the point of ROIC on the marketing, when you take 
into 
account the price/mix expansion going from 1% to 3% in the quarter, when 
you take into account the core business that we have, which is really the 
company that's emerging out of this very rapid transformation and 
refranchising, is growing still at a p
oint ahead of the total company currently 
consolidated number, which is at 4%, which is within our sort of long
-
term 
growth target that we've espoused to and talked about. I think that's also 
not maybe a micro metric, but certainly an important metric to c
onsider in 
terms of the payback on also all the activity. And we are still in the early 
days of the One Brand strategy. It just launched in Mexico a few months 
ago, just launched in Europe and parts of Europe. So again, we feel 
confident that that is going
 
to continue to work in our benefit, coupled with 
the marketing that James talked about.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Nik Modi of RBC Capital Markets. 
Your lin
e is open.
 
Nik Modi 
-
 
RBC Capital Markets LLC
 
Yeah, thanks for the question. Just two quick ones for me, there is a lot of 
stuff going on at Coke right now, international organization management, 
refranchising at an accelerated pace. I'm just curious if yo
u can give us 
some clarity on maybe how much of the volume issue this quarter was partly 
related to disruption. And then, just on the price/mix, I mean, it's pretty 
good number. We've seen a kind of 3% price/mix a couple of times over the 
past two years. J
ust curious on what you think the sustainability of that 
magnitude of price/mix is as we think out the next one to two years.
 
James Quincey 
-
 
President & Chief Operating Officer
 
Sure. Let me start. I don't think any of the unit case pressure in the 
second 
quarter was due to the reorganization. I think the trends on unit cases, and 
let me just throw out another way of looking at it, has started at the 
beginning of the year. I think it's probably one of the few times we've seen 
the developed and our de
veloping countries grow volume and actually seen 
the emerging markets decline in aggregate. I know we only put out the 
numbers by groups. But if you look at developed companies and developing 
economies, you see volume growth in both those blocks of countri
es.
 
So in the end, our business, when you take the segmented roles, we've got 
volume growth and price/mix growth in developed and developing countries, 
which is very positive in terms of the long
-
term trajectory of the business. 
North America has got multi
-
years of making that work at the revenue line, 
so that's very strong. The volume weakness is all in the emerging markets, 
and it's all concentrated in a few of the emerging markets. It's big in some 
of those markets, but it's very concentrated. And the pe
ople then on the 
country levels are all largely still the same and working on these problems. 
So hopefully, that gives you a little insight on where the volume weakness 
is, but I don't think it has anything to do with the reorganization. In fact, I 
think t
he reorganization is helping us bring some refreshed views and some 
experience on what to do in emerging market weakness going forward in the 
downhill this year and into the future.
 
And then on the price/mix, 3% is a good result. I think we've always talke
d 
about our long
-
term growth model calls for 4% to 6% revenue growth. And 
we see a balanced split between volume and price/mix into the future. So 
that gives you a 2% to 3% for price/mix as the component of the long
-
term 
growth. And also, 3% is a strong re
sult. Long may it live. For the long
-
term 
growth model, we're looking for 4% to 6% in a balanced way.

Two questions, one on Europe specifically, James, I
 
guess I am surprised 
Spain was down in the quarter. You cited weather, but it's been doing pretty 
well, so what is going on in Spain beyond weather? And can you give us any 
color on Great Britain, because Europe overall had a nice sequential 

 
or at 
least
 
did better than where consensus was, so looking for some color there? 
And then, Kathy, on FX, really no change in your FX view for the year. Can 
you remind us how you're hedged on some key currencies and how that 
might play out, the duration of those hedg
es and what those currencies are?
 
James Quincey 
-
 
President & Chief Operating Officer
 
Sure. On Europe, I think Europe got a little bit better this quarter. There are 
things weighing on our business. I'm not a big fan of calling out weather as a 
driver of p
erformance. The weather occurs, for good or for bad, all around 
the world. Now, in the case of Spain and also France, at kind of that end of 
the Mediterranean, it was particularly poor in the middle part of the quarter. 
So that's really what's driving what
's going on in the Spanish business and 
also it impacted the French business. So we see Europe getting a little bit 
better.
 
I mean, we had some good results out of Germany. And, as you said, some 
sequential improvement out of GB cycling out of some of the 
supply chain 
problems and as they got fixed, that came out of the first quarter. So we see 
that starting to improve going forward, but I think I hate calling out the 
weather, but I think that's really the reason in Spain, and France. And I 
think we'll star
t to see those businesses get better.
 
Now, it is worth saying that we've got a lot of good programs in Europe, but 
the recent tragic events in Belgium, in France, and recently in Germany, do 
weigh on consumer sentiment and consumer behavior. They go out le
ss and 
we have strong on
-
premise businesses, in fact, particularly in Spain. And 
that is being dragged down as people respond to some of these tragic events 
by, perhaps, staying at home a little more. Now, that hopefully will get 
better in time as the secu
rity situation improves, but I don't want to get into 
weather and global events. I think the business in Europe can get better. 
We've got a lot of launches coming up and we've got some strong programs. 
I think Europe can continue to perform.
 
Mark Swartzber
g 
-
 
Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.
 
Great. And quick follow
-
up on that specific to Spain, what does your work 
say about underlying health of the business, either because of performance 
in July? You're saying it sequentially should get better but I'm kind of 
w
ondering what's underlying that view. How are you getting to that?
 
James Quincey 
-
 
President & Chief Operating Officer
 
I mean, I'm not going to comment on the beginning of July from a volume 
perspective. I would note that I think July was the biggest
-
ever 
month for 
Spain last year, so they've got some tough comps to cycle. They had a 
record summer last year. The underlying business in Spain is improving. 
Firstly, the economy is getting better. Secondly, the supermarket 
environment in terms of rational prici
ng and some of the activities is getting 
better. And the Spanish bottler made a massive investment going into last 
year to reinvest in returnable glass, which is one of the preeminent places in 
the world where this is true in the on
-
premise accounts. And t
hat's starting 
to show good results, notwithstanding the weather and the security impacts 
in the year
-
to
-
date. And now, with the CCEP deal closed and management 
fully focused on leveraging the best of the marketing, the best of the 
innovation and really do
ubling
-
down on the execution, I think we'll start to 
see improvements in Spain and the other CCEP territories.
 
Mark Swartzberg 
-
 
Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.
 
Excellent. Great. Thank you, James.
 
Kathy N. Waller 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice Pre
sident
 
And on currency, so, yes, we did not change our guidance this quarter. 
We've had a lot of movement in some key currencies, but basically they are 
offsetting each other. Given the volatility that we've seen kind of across the 
portfolio, some currenci
es are getting better, like Brazil. Some are staying 
the same or getting worse, like a Mexico. Our hard currencies, we are 
hedged 100%, basically, and then we hedge our emerging market currencies 
on a short
-
term basis as kind of opportunistically. With 201
7 being fully 
hedged for our hard currencies and, obviously, our exposure then would be 
basically in our emerging market currencies.
 
Mark Swartzberg 
-
 
Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.
 
So you said you're fully hedged for hard currencies for calendar 2017, for 
t
he duration of 2017?
 
Kathy N. Waller

Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
 
Yes. For 2017, that's correct.
 
Mark Swartzberg

Judy E. 
Hong

Goldman Sachs & Co.
 
I wanted to go back and follow up on the price/mix question. And clearly, 
the 3% is a good number, but obviously you're benefiting from pretty high 
inflationary markets. So I just wanted to better understand how much of this 
is r
eally coming from your segmentation, the revenue segmentation strategy 
versus the price growth that you're seeing in inflationary markets, so any 
granularity that you can give us would be helpful. And then a little bit related 
to that, I think the flat vol
ume growth that you've seen this quarter, I can't 
recall the last time you had this kind of volume trend. So, again, how much 
of this is really a function of your strategy to focus more on revenue and not 
chase unprofitable volume growth and if this is som
ething that you'd be 
willing to accept for some period of time?
 
Ahmet Muhtar Kent 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
Judy, good morning, again. It's Muhtar. First, I think James talked in detail 
about where the volume shortfalls were coming from and spec
ifically related 
to certain large emerging markets that drove that number, and so that's 
related to Brazil. That's related to China being the large ones, but also 
Russia. All of those emerging markets that used to have better disposable 
incomes, better mac
ro conditions, basically drove some of that. And going 
forward, certainly, we expect some improvement in that area. So that's 
number one.
 
Number two, I think important to note that, again, mentioned that the 
developed markets grew and developing markets gr
ew volume and were 
ahead of the total company number, which was flat and ahead of emerging 
markets.
 
That itself will tell you that certainly the price/mix coming from those 
markets and then the total geographic mix that coupled with that, is 
something that
 
was instrumental in driving our price/mix number in the way 
it landed in the quarter. So all of those factors and algebras, all the algebra 
coming together is what made that, the country mix coming out of that, the 
geographic mix and then the volume, coup
led with the pricing that we got. 
And today, when you look at our U.S. business, with 4% organic revenue 
growth in North America, that tells you that that is in, certainly, in very 
much in the upper quartile of all large consumer businesses in the country.
 
We are doing very, very well. Japan performed well.
 
Again, Mexico performed very well in terms of the volume and pricing 
combined, driving the total number of price/mix. So all of that really goes to 
explain and hopefully answers your question on that. An
ything to add, 
James, there? Okay.
 
Kathy N. Waller 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
 
On the price/mix question, Judy, so we did have this quarter, price/mix was 
positive across in all of our groups. Yes, primarily driven by Latin America
 
and inflationary pricing, but also operational pricing in EAG, but then it was 
offset by some segment mix coming from the Bottling Investments segment. 
So, as James said, pricing of 2% to 3% is what we expect and what we 
would think would be very good pri
cing and in line with our segmentation 
strategy, even though EAG was probably more than kind of out of its normal 
range at this point, but North America, pricing is still very strong. So we do 
believe in the segment strategy and the 2%, 3% is kind of what 
we expect 
going forward.
 
Ahmet Muhtar Kent 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
And then, the sparkling segment, just to finalize that, continues to be a 
segment of the non
-
alcoholic, ready
-
to
-
drink, where consumers continue to 
spend a very large amount of
 
money and in terms of consumer spend and in 
terms of the dollar value, is still very, very healthy. And that's why it gives 
us confidence looking into the future about what we're doing in terms of the 
segmented revenue growth strategy and in terms of the 
marketing approach 
and the One Brand strategy in taking the lion's share of that spend going 
forward.

Bank of America Merrill Lynch
 
Just two quick ones, one, for James, just you've talked a lot I think on this 
call about some of the 
short
-
term things that have affected organic sales 
and kind of changes, I guess, sequentially in the environment since the start 
of the year. Can you just update us on kind of what your view for the 
industry forecast is, maybe not so much for this year but
 
just over the 
medium
-
term, has there been any change in terms what you think the non
-
alcohol ready
-
to
-
drink beverage industry is going to grow over the medium
-
term?
 
And then, second question, just you had mentioned Coke FEMSA earlier and 
it looks like you
've got an agreement with them to negotiate on a preferred 
basis. Could you just sort of expand upon that a little bit? Are they 
exclusively looking at some of these territories or is it a matter that they're 
just getting a first look? Thank you.
 
James Qui
ncey 
-
 
President & Chief Operating Officer
 
Sure. I think in your first question, I mean, our medium
-
term outlook for the 
industry hasn't really changed. We're still expecting robust growth in the 
industry in the long
-
term, driven by the disposal income, ur
banization, the 
middle class, innovation. We see these things expanding. Now, we've talked 
about that being in the 5% sort of ballpark and then probably in the next 
few years, talked about it being in the 4%. So we do see it coming back over 
time. But we d
o see industry growth slightly moderated in the short
-
term, as 
we talked a little bit about in some of the previous conferences.
 
Now, you did ask the question, which kind of seemed short to me because I 
think I would 

 
give me a second to just re
-
underline
 
from our point of view, 
the biggest mechanical impact in the quarter and the year
-
to
-
date is this 
asymmetry between where we own bottlers and where it is less than 20% of 
the volume or about 20% of the volume versus being in 200 countries. If 
you part the
 
bottling side, and just look at the core concentrate and 
franchise, we're running organic at 4% and we're meeting our profit 
guidance.
 
So we're not trying to say small ups and downs in the macro economies is 
what should buffet us every quarter, we just ne
ed to deal with those things. 
I just think there's this one asymmetrical effect of the bottling thing, which 
is kind of important, which is affecting the number. But I don't want to give 
the impression we're seeing a massive 

 
or trying to signal a deterio
ration in 
outlook for the concentrate and franchise business.
 
Now, with regard to Coke FEMSA, yeah, we talked about looking at some 
territories on a preferred basis. I'm not going to get into exactly how that 
means in terms of what preferred means versus e
xclusive, et cetera, but 
they're our biggest bottling partner. We have a very strong relationship. 
We've made an agreement on how we're going to create more value 
together in Mexico and how they can look to participate in some of the 
refranchising of the t
erritories that we own in bottling and we're very excited 
about doing more stuff together.

Hi.
 
Vivien Azer

Cowen & Co. LLC
 
So as I look at some of the disclosure in the press release, it seems like 
you'v
e broken from convention a little bit, a lot less brand disclosure, 
Trademark Coca
-
Cola only called out in North America. You guys aren't 
breaking out sparkling and stills anymore. So I'm just curious if we can get a 
little more color on Trademark Coke out
side of North America and China, 
and also whether the change in convention speaks to a broader shift in 
terms of how you're thinking about balancing volumes across your portfolio? 
Thank you.
 
James Quincey 
-
 
President & Chief Operating Officer
 
Yeah, I think
, yes, I mean, in part, please read into this that we're moving 
the business to more of a revenue focus. I mean, absolutely under the 
heading everything communicates, that is part of what we're trying to say. 
We believe in our segmented revenue approach. I
t's not that we have 
forgotten about volume or don't believe it's an underlying driver in the long
-
term, particularly in the emerging markets of what's going to create the 
business over the long
-
term, but as we look at places like North America and 
some of
 
the other developed markets, clearly, we're going after more of a 
revenue strategy that's driven by smaller packages, by some pricing actions, 
so we do want to call out that perhaps the best way to think about health of 
the business going into the future 
is the revenue growth.
 
And that's where I think what we're trying to say is, not just the beverage 
industry, the sparkling industry category and brand Coke all remain healthy 
in terms of revenue growth. All three of those are growing revenue globally, 
and 
we continue to see good attraction both in the U.S. in terms of sparkling 
revenue growth and internationally in terms of sparkling revenue growth.

ing the

Thank you, Operator. Good morning and thank you for being with us today. 
I'm joined by Muhtar Kent, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; James 
Quincey, our President and Chief Operating Officer; and Kathy Waller, our 
Chief Financial Officer. Be
fore we begin, I'd like to inform you that you can 
find webcast materials in the Investors section of our company website at 
www.Coca
-
ColaCompany.com that support the prepared remarks by Muhtar, 
James and Kathy this morning.
 
I'd also like to note that we h
ave posted schedules under the Financial 
Reports & Information tab in the Investors section of our company website. 
These schedules reconcile certain non
-
GAAP financial measures, which may 
be referred to by our senior executives during this morning's discu
ssion, to 
our results as reported under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. 
Please look on our website for this information.
 
In addition, this conference call may contain forward
-
looking statements, 
including statements concerning long
-
term earnings 
objectives, and should 
be considered in conjunction with cautionary statements contained in our 
earnings release and in the company's most recent periodic SEC report.
 
Following prepared remarks this morning, we will turn the call over for your 
questions. I
n order to allow as many people to ask questions as possible, we 
ask that you limit yourself to one question. If you have multiple questions, 
please ask your most pressing question first and then reenter the queue in 
order to ask any follow
-
ups.
 
Now, I'd l
ike to turn the call over to Muhtar.

few key highlights before handing off to James to provide a more detailed 
operational review of our perfor
mance. I'm pleased to report that we 
delivered third quarter results in line with our expectations, and we're on 
track to deliver against our full
-
year expectations.
 
Our continued focus on our five strategic initiatives enabled us to report 
another quarter
 
of global value share gains, with 3% organic revenue growth 
and over 50 basis points of comparable currency neutral operating margin 
expansion. Our core business continued to perform well, delivering 4% 
organic revenue growth year
-
to
-
date, in line with ou
r long
-
term target, 
driven by our segmented revenue growth strategies, improving marketing 
and portfolio diversification. Within our core business, developed markets 
performed well, delivering solid revenue results with 2% unit case volume 
growth year
-
to
-
d
ate and a continued focus on price realization.
 
While we continue to see challenges in many emerging and developing 
markets, we're taking action to improve our performance. Importantly, we're 
delivering the profit target we laid out at the beginning of the
 
year. 
Excluding the impact of structural items, comparable currency neutral 
income before tax grew 7% year
-
to
-
date. And we're confident we will deliver 
our full
-
year profit outlook of 6% to 8% growth, excluding these same 
items.
 
We continue our journey of
 
transforming our company to a higher margin 
and higher return business, focused on building strong brands, enhancing 
customer value and leading a strong, dedicated global franchise system. This 
quarter, we continued to make solid progress to strengthen an
d evolve our 
global system. In North America, we signed definitive agreements on six 
territories and closed transactions on four territories, thereby remaining on 
track to complete our refranchising efforts in our flagship market by the end 
of 2017.
 
In Jap
an, our two largest bottlers, Coca
-
Cola West and Coca
-
Cola East 
Japan, reached a definitive agreement to merge their operations and create 
a strong consolidated bottler, representing over 85% of our system volume 
in Japan. In Latin America, we reached a lo
ng
-
term comprehensive 
agreement with Arca Continental regarding joint value creation in Mexico, 
along with a similar agreement with FEMSA in July.
 
Separately, Coca
-
Cola FEMSA reached agreement to acquire Vonpar, one of 
the largest privately
-
owned bottlers 
in the Brazilian Coca
-
Cola system, 
increasing its scale and leveraging FEMSA's strong commercial capabilities.
 
In Europe, Coca
-
Cola European Partners finished its full quarter of 
operations as a combined company and we're executing an aligned plan. And 
fin
ally in Africa, we recently exercised our call option to acquire ABI's stake 
in Coca
-
Cola Beverages Africa. We have a number of partners who are 
highly interested in and qualified for these bottling territories, and we intend 
to implement our long
-
term str
ategic plan for these markets.
 
Over the coming months, we will negotiate the terms of the transaction with 
ABI, followed by a regulatory approval process. Simultaneously, we have 
commenced discussions with potential partners and plan to complete this 
impor
tant process as soon as feasible.
 
When I take a step back and think about the magnitude of change we have 
implemented over the past couple of years, I am truly encouraged. We've 
implemented segmented revenue growth strategies for our markets, 
invested in c
apabilities and created clear incentives for the entire 
organization to drive revenue growth rather than volume only. We're 
shaping our plan portfolio across the full range of sparkling and still 
beverage categories to meet changing consumer needs through 
leading 
marketing, innovation and targeted M&A, which James will discuss in more 
detail.
 
We launched Taste the Feeling, a new marketing campaign for Trademark 
Coca
-
Cola at the beginning of the year and are seeing positive response 
from our consumers and cu
stomers. And through our ongoing $3 billion 
productivity initiative, we're taking cost out to both reinvest in the business 
and drive margin expansion. And, as I've discussed, we are re
-
architecting 
the bottling system in key geographies and regions to bet
ter capture growth. 
To put it in perspective, these affected regions account for almost half of our 
global volume. So the actions we're taking today are going to have 
significant impact on our system's future performance.
 
Through these actions, we're becom
ing a much stronger company with 
higher margins and returns and better positioned to deliver on our long
-
term 
growth targets.
 
I will now hand the call over to James, who will provide you with a more 
detailed outlook at our operating performance.

Thank you, Muhtar, and good morning, everyone. As Muhtar said, we 
continue to implement our five strategic actions for growth and we're 
making the necessary changes to have the speed, agility and the focused 
leadership needed to win
 
today and into the future. So before I jump into 
the results, as you know, we made a number of changes to our operating 
leadership structure during the quarter. I'd like to say these transitions 
occurred seamlessly, are a testament to our leaders and asso
ciates, and 
these new leaders are bringing a fresh perspective and are working diligently 
to identify opportunities to accelerate our performance around the world.
 
Now, let me turn to the results. I'd like to talk to you about these through 
two lenses: fir
stly, the traditional operating results in the quarter, somewhat 
seen by geography; and second, how we continue to evolve our brand 
marketing and portfolio to stay relevant and meet consumer preferences.
 
So, our performance in the quarter; our results were
 
in line with our 
expectations, with 3% organic revenue growth and 2% underlying income 
before tax growth. Our core business grew organic revenue 3% in the 
quarter and, as we expected given the strong growth we were cycling from 
the third quarter last year
, it's important to note that year
-
to
-
date, our core 
operations continue to grow organic revenue 4% and we remain on track to 
deliver this performance for the full year.
 
Our company
-
owned bottling operations grew organic revenue 2% in the 
quarter, an accel
eration from the first half of the year, driven by North 
American bottling and an improvement in China. Unit case volume grew 1%, 
cycling a pretty strong 3% from last year and an acceleration from last 
quarter, due largely in part to the return to growth i
n China and a stronger 
performance in our Western European business. It's worth saying that the 
macro challenges persist in certain emerging markets, particularly, for 
example, Argentina and Venezuela, negatively impacting consolidated unit 
case volume gro
wth by 1 point.
 
So, turning and looking around the world, we continue to push hard where 
we have momentum, take action where needed and manage through some 
of the difficult operating conditions. So, we continue to do well in a number 
of key markets with mo
mentum, including places like North America, Mexico 
and Japan and so seek to further advance our strategies. For example, North 
America, we grew organic revenue 3% as we continue to successfully 
implement both our accelerated refranchising program while de
livering top
-
tier growth among FMCG companies in the U.S. The strength and breadth of 
our full brand portfolio led to value share gains in both sparkling and still 
beverages. So that actually overall, we captured 40% of NARTD beverage 
retail sales growth y
ear
-
to
-
date.
 
Also, as I said, we did well in Japan and Mexico, and both benefited from 
strong marketing and innovation, as the combination of the One Brand 
strategy and new product launches drove continued solid performance.
 
Turning to some of the 
other key markets, we saw improved performance in 
the quarter. Our actions are starting to bear fruit, but we still have more to 
do. In China, we returned to growth, driven by strong activation of our 
Olympic campaign, improved execution and, frankly, bett
er weather. Our 
system has largely worked through the wholesale inventory issue. And we 
are continuing to innovate across the business towards the premium 
segment with examples like the launch of ZICO Coconut Water through the 
e
-
commerce channel, but also,
 
at the same time, we're paying proper 
attention to the mass consumer segment. There, we're driving the 
availability of entry
-
level small packs, such as the 300
-
milliliter bottle, to 
address affordability issues, as the economy remains challenging and we 
e
xpect continued near
-
term volatility.
 
Another key market that got better, Western Europe; solid marketing, 
innovation and commercial plans with the increased alignment with the new 
CCEP in its first full quarter as a new company and, again, a little bit of
 
good 
weather resulted in strong performance in the quarter with our system 
gaining both value and volume share.
 
Now, while we're moving quickly in several markets and seeing success, it's 
true that we still compete in a number of markets with challenging 
macroeconomic conditions. The economic environment in Russia is 
improving slightly as the price of oil stabilizes; however, Brazil, Argentina 
and Venezuela all remain difficult operating environments for consumer 
products companies.
 
Therefore, we will cont
inue to concentrate on what we can control. In Brazil 
and Argentina, we're focused on affordability by maintaining key consumer 
price points while evolving our price/pack architecture to protect our market 
share. And in Venezuela, we are addressing raw mat
erial shortages by 
rapidly scaling the availability of our Zero Sugar portfolio.
 
Now, as we look at this quarter but also at the future, I'd like to build on 
what I've shared in the past about our productivity efforts and evolving 
revenue growth strategies
 
with an update on our growing and evolving 
brand portfolio. Of course, we recognize the consumer tastes and 
preferences change and are changing, and we are building a strong, 
diversified brand portfolio across sparkling and the stills categories to meet 
t
hese needs, including through internal innovation, bolt
-
on acquisitions and 
a lift
-
and
-
shift geographic expansion model.
 
If you look at our still portfolio today, it includes 14 of our 20 billion
-
dollar 
brands, with number one or number two positions in ju
ice, coffee, water, tea 
and sports drinks categories. Year
-
to
-
date, our system sold 5.8 billion 
incremental servings of our stills brands, capturing over 25% of the value 
growth in stills globally.
 
This performance has been driven by action around the worl
d to expand our 
stills businesses. For example, take our Japan business, which has one of 
our most diversified portfolios. On top of good growth in our sparkling 
brands, we continue to drive strong performance across multiple categories 
through innovations
 
like new premium packaging for our Georgia coffee 
brand, a new line extension of our Ayataka tea brand and new flavors of our 
premium I LOHAS water brand.
 
In the U.S., we extended smartwater into sparkling water. We revamped the 
packaging graphics on DASA
NI Sparkling, resulting in retail value growth of 
over 80% in the quarter for these two products. We expanded the Honest 
Tea trademark into juice drinks, with Honest Kids becoming the number one 
organic juice drink chosen for kids.
 
We see ready
-
to
-
drink co
ffee as an important growth category in the U.S. 
Today, we are the global leader in ready
-
to
-
drink coffee category with strong 
positions in Japan and Korea, so we are leveraging on this strength and 
launching Gold Peak ready
-
to
-
drink cold brew coffee and D
unkin' Donuts 
branded ready
-
to
-
drink coffee to begin capturing this opportunity in our 
flagship markets.
 
In Europe, we're expanding our stills portfolio by lifting our smartwater and 
Honest Tea brands from the U.S. and shifting them to Europe. We are also 
leveraging strong existing brands. For example, we're expanding 
geographically Innocent, our very successful premium juice and smoothie 
business, into a strong regional brand, but also extending ViO, our popular 
water brand in Germany, into juice drinks an
d sparkling lemonades. This has 
resulted in strong double
-
digit volume growth year
-
to
-
date for both brands.
 
And finally, bolt
-
on M&A and investments, when available, will continue to be 
a part of our portfolio expansion strategy, particularly in the value
-
added 
dairy and plant protein beverage spaces. We are pleased by the early results 
of fairlife in the U.S. and Santa Clara in Mexico and we look forward to 
closing our acquisition of plant
-
based brand AdeS in Latin America in early 
2017.
 
Now, turning to ou
r sparkling business, I'd like to talk a little bit about how 
we're doing things differently. We are bolding our sparkling portfolio strategy 
so that we can grow while reducing sugar consumption. Through these 
actions, we've been able to outpace a category
 
that is growing retail value 
by 3% for the first nine months of the year. So let me give you a few 
examples of how we're doing this.
 
First, our Taste the Feeling marketing campaign is engaging consumers with 
better advertising around both the extrinsics a
nd intrinsics of the brand. 
Second, we are also providing more sugar
-
free options. In several markets 
around the world, we have launched Coca
-
Cola Zero Sugar, with a new and 
improved taste as well as a new visual identity system under our One Brand 
strateg
y. And this is contributing high single
-
digit volume growth for this 
brand globally in the quarter.
 
Take GB, for example. While we're only 12 weeks in, we've seen a significant 
expansion in the consumption versus the former Coke Zero product, 
resulting in 
strong double
-
digit volume growth for Coca
-
Cola Zero Sugar 
during the quarter. And we are rolling this out, this new and improved 
product out across other European markets.
 
More broadly, we've been taking multiple actions to shape choice, to address 
changi
ng consumer preferences around added sugar while working 
proactively with governments to provide positive solutions. We've been 
driving a systematic reformulation effort across our portfolio to reduce added 
sugar while delivering superior consumer taste an
d improving margins.
 
For example, we currently have over 200 reformulation initiatives underway 
to reduce added sugar. And so an example of where that might take us as a 
step forward in GB, for example, we reduced the sugar and the calories in 
brands such 
as Sprite and Fanta by 30%. In our Latin Center business unit, 
we reduced the sugar content in almost two
-
thirds of our flavored sparkling 
beverages.
 
And then in combination with this reformulation and innovation effort, we 
have also focused on small pack 
sizes: a great way to enjoy a drink with less 
calories. These packs can provide both a premium experience as well as 
being affordable, yet profitable, way to bring people into the franchise.
 
In Mexico, for example, small packs such as our sleek can and 8
-
o
unce glass 
bottle are growing rapidly through both increased distribution and higher 
velocity per outlet. In China, our premium
-
priced fleet count for Diet Coke 
and Coke Zero is growing strongly. And in India, where we recently launched 
our new lightweight
, affordable PET bottle in just a few territories, we have 
already sold over 20 million servings.
 
These actions and the results we are seeing give us confidence that we can 
further accelerate our sparkling business. So looking forward, we're working 
to gro
w by ensuring ongoing relevance and engagement with our existing 
brands, while also expanding our brand portfolio so that we can meet 
consumer preferences.
 
So, as I think about the rest of the year, from an operationals perspective, I, 
like Muhtar, am conf
ident we will achieve our full
-
year outlook.
 
So with that, let me turn the call over to Kathy to take you through the 
numbers.
 
Kathy N. Waller

The Coca
-
Cola Co.
 
Thank you, James, and good morning, everyone. I'm going to talk quickly 
about our financial p
erformance in the quarter before moving on to our full
-
year outlook.
 
Starting at the top line, organic revenue growth was driven equally by 
volume and price/mix. Consolidated price/mix in the quarter was driven both 
by rate and product mix initiatives acro
ss many of our markets, partially 
offset by 1 point of segment mix, due to slower growth in our Bottling 
Investments Group than in our core concentrate operations.
 
At gross profit, our comparable margin increased about 45 basis points, as 
solid pricing, a 
slightly favorable cost environment and productivity was 
partially offset by about an 80 basis point currency headwind. Our North 
America refranchising roughly offset the benefit from deconsolidating our 
German and South Africa bottling operations, resulti
ng in a slight structural 
benefit to margins.
 
Excluding the effect of currency and structural items, our underlying gross 
margin expanded over 100 basis points. Our comparable operating margin 
declined about 35 basis points. Similar to gross margin, curren
cy headwinds 
impacted our operating margins by about 90 basis points, while structural 
items, primarily the deconsolidation of our German and South African 
bottling operations, positively impacted our operating margins.
 
Turning to the cash flow, we continu
e to exercise strong cash flow 
management. Year
-
to
-
date, we have generated $6.7 billion in cash from 
operations. And we have returned $5.7 billion to shareowners through a 
combination of net share repurchases and $4.5 billion of dividends paid 
year
-
to
-
date
, and that includes our third quarter dividend that was paid on 
October 3, right after our quarter closed.
 
Net share repurchases year
-
to
-
date were $1.2 billion, and we continue to 
expect them to be $2 billion to $2.5 billion for the full year, in line 
with our 
initial guidance.
 
Looking ahead to the remainder of the year, with one quarter remaining, we 
continue to expect our full
-
year comparable EPS to decline 4% to 7%, in line 
with our previously
-
communicated expectations. However, we now expect to 
spen
d slightly less than $2.5 billion on capital expenditures for the full year, 
down from our initial expectations of $2.5 billion to $3 billion.
 
As you construct your models, there are a few items to consider for the 
fourth quarter. Our fourth quarter has tw
o additional days as compared to 
last year, which will result in stronger top
-
line growth than we saw in the 
third quarter. We expect structural items to be an 11
-
point headwind on net 
revenue and a 6
-
point to 7
-
point headwind on income before tax in the 
f
ourth quarter. And finally, we expect currency to be a 1
-
point to 2
-
point 
headwind on net revenue and an 8
-
point to 9
-
point headwind on income 
before tax in the fourth quarter.
 
So, in closing, our strategies are working in key markets. We are on track to 
d
eliver over $600 million in productivity this year, and we remain confident 
in our abilities to deliver our profit targets this year.
 
So with that, Operator, we are now ready for questions.
 
Question

and

Answer Session

from Nik Modi from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now opened.

Thanks. Good morning, everyone. So just a quick question for me on the 
refranchising, now that you've kind o
f gone through the process and we're 
getting towards the end of getting all of the announcements out of the way, 
can you give us any early indications on kind of what the growth delta has 
been in the markets that have been refranchises versus not? And then
, also 
wanted to get some context of what's going on in Western Europe, 
obviously, with the CCE integration going on there, have you seen any 
disruption, and if you think that'll start to phase out over the coming 
quarters. Thanks.
 
Ahmet Muhtar Kent 
-
 
The 
Coca
-
Cola Co.
 
Nik, good morning. This is Muhtar. Thanks for your question. Look, I think 
first, once again, I want to reiterate the scale of what is being done here on 
a global basis. As I mentioned in my remarks, the geographies and the 
regions impacted b
y this refranchising, massive refranchising, is really when 
you aggregate it all, will impact 50% of our global volume. So this is really, 
really big, number one. Number two, the early indications that we have from 
both the U.S. refranchising efforts, whic
h is the largest one, but also the 
European restructuring under the Coca
-
Cola European Partners umbrella, 
which was the biggest refranchising in Europe in history in its structure, 
essentially early indications have been positive.
 
In the United States, if 
you look at it, the last six quarters, consecutively, 
we've had volume growth and very encouraging price/mix in the United 
States continued. And the last sort of year, four quarters have been the 
highest in terms of refranchising activity, so early indicat
ions are positive. 
Europe, the same; James mentioned the positive numbers coming out of the 
last quarter. Yes, helped by many other things other than just refranchising, 
but the impact is that there hasn't been the disruption. It's been going on 
very smoot
hly. And when you look at it going forward, we've got four to five 
quarters of intense refranchising remaining, as we bring out the other end of 
the tunnel another a company that is going to be totally transformed, 
revitalized in terms of its organizationa
l capability, leadership structure, 
revitalization of the brands also with the investment in our brands and the 
new marketing, revitalization of our portfolio, of our bottling system as well 
as our cost base.
 
So we're encouraged with what we see as the tra
nsformed Coca
-
Cola 
Company coming out and also the integrity of the refranchising, as 
evidenced by the continued good results in North America and in Europe.
 
Operator

So develop
ed market volume growth obviously outperformed emerging 
markets in the quarter. That's fairly unusual. So I was hoping you could give 
us a bit of a review in the emerging markets. You obviously had a number of 
cautionary notes in the prepared remarks, but 
are you seeing any signs that 
the macros may be close to bottoming here or are things pretty tenuous? 
And, more importantly, as we look out to 2017 and beyond, do you think the 
year
-
to
-
date trends are more of a new normal or is there hope that with 
easier 
comparisons, that some of the strategy adjustments you've made, we 
can start to see emerging markets rebound closer to historical levels?
 
Ahmet Muhtar Kent 
-
 
The Coca
-
Cola Co.
 
Dara, it's Muhtar here. I'll just mention very briefly, and then pass it over to
 
James, that it is unusual. What you've just said is definitely 

 
the fact that 
developed markets are growing at a higher pace than the developing and 
emerging markets, but it's not a surprise given the volatility that we all know 
that is taking place. But
 
it is a mixed bag. It's not just a uniform, all 
emerging markets. Africa, for example, continues to be a very strong 
performer, both West Africa, led by Nigeria, but also other markets in Africa. 
Mexico, to name another one, so it is a mixed bag, but let 
me ask James to 
comment in more detail on how we see the future also in terms of the 
balance between emerging and developing versus developed markets.
 
James Quincey 
-
 
The Coca
-
Cola Co.
 
Yeah, I think it is worth, as 

 
morning, Dara 

 
it is worth as we go in
to this, 
just underlining the collection of the developed markets are growing volume, 
growing price, strong revenue growth. We think we're taking actions to 
sustain that. The emerging markets, I think it's going to be a combination 
here of doing the things
 
that we know we need to do and can control; and 
then, of course, is a question of what do the macroeconomics do and what 
actions do each country's governments take to put them on a better course 
or not? So that's part of the unknown going forward at this 
stage and the 
uncertainty.
 
But I think quite clearly, you see, as Muhtar commented, is a mixed bag. 
Across the world, you see those markets that are doing well sustain growth. 
He called out Nigeria, South Africa, the Philippines, other parts of the 
emerging markets. So it's good. But it's a mixed bag, and I think the actions 
are underway in a number of these countries to stabilize them where they're 
a little tougher, like Brazil, like Argentina, which I called out on the call 
earlier.
 
And we'll have 
to see how long it takes for this to take hold in the countries 
from a macro view. We don't have a clear sight on that. But what we do 
know is we need to focus on what we can control in those countries, go back 
to affordability, go back to execution, go ba
ck to the basics and build 
ourselves a better position with more market share, so that when it does 
turn and that combines with the growth in developed markets, we can be 
solidly in growth rates for our long term model.

Thank you. And our next que
stion is from the line of Bill Schmitz from 
Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.

A couple of quick questions; the first one is how do you get to 3% organic in 
the quarter from 1% and 1%? (30:44) So was volu
me better or price/mix 
better? I know they both probably rounded. I was just curious there. And 
then, the second question is the inflationary pricing in Latin America, is that 
mostly currency pass
-
through or is there sort of real price realization in the 
m
arket? And kind of what happens into next year if these spot rates hold 
when some of the currency cross
-
rates starts to ease a little bit? Thanks.
 
Kathy N. Waller 
-
 
The Coca
-
Cola Co.
 
Hi, Bill. So on your first question about the 3%. Yes, we did find anothe
r way 
to make 1.1 equal 3. It is rounding, and it's really balanced. So it was in the 
rounding, but it was a balanced impact from volume as well as a balanced 
impact from pricing.
 
James Quincey 
-
 
The Coca
-
Cola Co.
 
On your second question, Bill, James here,
 
I think what's worth 
remembering is essentially, we are not trying to pass through the 
devaluation. We focus on being competitive in each local market beverage 
and fast
-
moving consumer goods industry, and especially when the 
economies are in tough times f
ocusing on staying competitive and gaining 
share for the long term. The net of all of that means we are much more 
likely to follow or be close to local inflation rates rather than adopt the 
strategy of a full pass
-
through of the devaluation of the dollar. 
So obviously, 
if the exchange rates change, that'll mean different dollar numbers for the 
corporation. But the local strategy remains stay competitive in the 
marketplace, and it looks more like local inflation. Does that answer your 
question?
 
Operator
 
Than
k you. And our next question is from the line of Steve Powers from 
UBS. Your line is now open.
 
Stephen R. Powers

UBS Securities LLC
 
Thanks. Good morning. I was hoping actually to go back and focus on the 
stills versus sparkling portfolio, changes that, J
ames, you referenced in your 
prepared remarks. Today, correctly me if I'm wrong, but I think your global 
portfolio still skews at least 70%
-
30% towards sparkling. But as you look 
forward, I'm curious as to what percentage of your growth you expect will 
com
e from traditional sparkling versus stills. I'm guessing it's probably not 
70%
-
30%, but is it 50%
-
50% or is it some other split you could frame for 
us? And then, more importantly, do you think your growth investments 
today are aligned with that distributio
n?
 
In other words, if it is 50%
-
50%, for example, are your incremental growth 
investments aligned with that or is there still a legacy skew towards 
sparkling that might need to be rethought? Because I think from the outside, 
there's still a perception, rig
ht or wrong, that your incremental investments 
are a bit over
-
indexed towards core CSDs versus their future value 
contribution. And I was just hoping you could help clarify at least your 
thinking around that. Thanks.
 
James Quincey 
-
 
The Coca
-
Cola Co.
 
Sure.
 
I mean, let me start by saying you're approximately right in volume 
terms on the current split between sparkling and stills, about 70%
-
30%. I 
think it's worth noting that that split has been moving in the favor of stills by 
about 1 point a year. At the tu
rn of the century, 10, 15 years ago, it was a 
single digit percent of the mix, so it's going up at about 1% a year. Now, 
part of that organic on the things we're doing and part of that is the net of 
some of the bolt
-
on acquisitions. But it's going up about
 
1% a year of mix.
 
I think as you look forward, clearly, given that we have 50% of the sparkling 
industry value share and 15% of the sum of all the stills categories value 
share, we fully expect to be able to grow faster in the stills categories 
because it
 
will be the combination of the category growth rate but plus our 
ability to gain share, which then feeds into your third question, which is how 
are the investments aligned? I feel they're aligned. Obviously, it's an 
ongoing process. Each year, we look at 
it in the business planning process 
and we'll be doing that again this year. But I would not characterize it as we 
are over
-
invested in sparkling and under
-
invested in stills. We are invested 
behind what's growing.
 
And actually, just to add a little more t
exture to it, we're doing the right 
things on sparkling. We tend to be pushing more money towards driving the 
zeros, the lights, the smaller packages in the sparkling business. In the 
stills, it's not a one
-
size
-
fits
-
all category. It's actually a noteable 
(35:07) 
category. And there, we're selective on which ones have 

 
are most on
-
trends with the consumers, which one have more premium pricing. And 
therefore, we're very selective about where we funnel the dollars and invest 
ahead of the curve or in line wit
h the growth rates we're expecting.

I was actually hoping you could give us a little more detail on your stills 
portfolio in North America. You reported high single
-
digit growth in 
vitaminwater and then solid results in smartwater, but yo
ur still portfolio 
only grew 2%. So curious what's been the drag there? And then do you 
expect some of the innovations that you mentioned to drive growth in your 
stills portfolio back up towards the mid or even high single
-
digit range?
 
James Quincey 
-
 
The 
Coca
-

Yeah. Bonnie, yeah, we certainly did well in a number of the categories, 
particularly some of the premium categories. What was a little weaker in this 
quarter were some of the juice businesses and some of the tea businesses, 
which are not as 
high value to us, so that's what netted out on the 2%. 
What I think you see is over the year, you see very strong growth in 
vitaminwater, in sports drinks, in some of the other categories as well. So I 
think it's a broadening of the portfolio, a focus on i
nnovation, but yet there's 
some headwinds on juice linked somewhat to commodities.

...a little bit of your perspective on two markets, kind at the extremes of 
maturity right now for you guys
. So first on North America, which obviously 
remains a key concern when I talk to investors, just given the views of 
consumer preferences. But North America's doing pretty well, right? Pretty 
robust, stable growth, 3% organic sales growth, relatively good 
volume, 
relatively good price/mix. What's working well for you in that market? Is it 
price/pack architecture or stills, just better marketing? I'm assuming it's all 
that stuff.
 
And what are you learning from that that might work for similar 
geographies, li
ke Western Europe or Japan? And so should we expect kind of 
in those markets a little bit of a similar ramp up as we're seeing in North 
America?
 
And then at the other extreme, can you tell us a little bit more about the 
China rebound, so to speak. I know y
ou mentioned weather there; clearly, 
weather must have helped. Could you give us a sense of what you think the 
underlying growth is? Has the market gotten any better? Clearly, you've 
worked through, thanks to weather, some of your destocking issues, but 
wa
nt to get a better sense of China at the other extreme. Thanks for those 
two.
 
James Quincey

The Coca

Cola Co.
 
Sure. Morning, Ali; James here. Look, North America, I think is a 
combination of many, many things. I mean it's, I think, been the result of a 
number of years working on multiple fronts: working on innovation across 
the portfolio, getting into categories, refining the propositions, learning, 
refining the propositions. It's about, in the sparkling business, the better 
marketing, the more media spe
nd. It's about the focus on the pricing and 
packaging architect. There will be more smaller packages. It's about getting 
the execution right. It's the refranchising, bringing new excited bottlers.
 
In the end, this is a result that has been built by a great
 
team of people who 
have been very focused over a number of years about regenerating growth 
in the North American business. As Muhtar said, they've had six very solid 
quarters of volume and revenue growth. And I think there are a lot of 
learnings. There's 
no silver bullet, but there are a lot of learnings.
 
Now having said that, actually, Japan has also been on a good run. I mean, 
it's had three quarters of very good volume growth, doing well on offsetting 
deflationary pressure. Again, it's a similar story. 
The team is very focused on 
a multiple category approach, innovation in the products, increasing the 
quality and quantity of the marketing, but always in parallel and in 
alignment with the bottler, where you've got to get better execution. Good 
marketing o
n its own is not going to get you the answers. It's got to be 
more and better marketing, along with more and better execution, and I 
think that's what you see.
 
And to some extent, Western Europe, they kind of came new Coca
-
Cola 
European Partners came well 
out of the stables on the first quarter. I think 
the formula is going to be the same. More and better marketing, more and 
better execution and a multi
-
lane focus on categories and cranking out the 
learning, the trying stuff, the innovation and pushing ahea
d. And I think 
that's going to be something we'll continue to press across the developed 
markets.
 
Now, turning to China, I think China, again, if I gave the impression it was 
all weather, that would unfair to the team on the ground in China and the 
system there. They've done a lot of work to address the big change in how 
the consumer responded to the e
conomic circumstances in China.
 
I think part of it is you know, it's a part of the world that's had such 
consistent growth rates over the last decade, but a little bit of a slowdown 
maybe caused some exaggerated pull
-
back on spending, so I think there is a
 
little bit of stabilization coming through in the macros. We saw that.
 
We've definitely taken action in the things we can control, not just in the 
commercial policies to strengthen the wholesaler and distributor network 
and working through the inventory p
roblems, but also on the pricing and 
packaging. To give you one example, a very small example, but it's 
symptomatic of how fast China can change. If you go to the cafe channel in 
China, there are all the noodle shops up and down the streets. People go 
ther
e at lunchtime.
 
Last year, they were packed with people. This year, you go, they're a third 
empty. You go, okay, maybe the economy has slowed down. No, that's not 
what's happening. The explosion of online to offline ordering and the 
availability of lots of
 
people on motorbikes to deliver stuff, and the apps and 
the aggregator apps to buy food has seen an explosion of ordering of online 
and delivery food, such that there is just as many people buying from these 
cafes, but sometimes in some parts of China, a 
third of it's being delivered 
to people, whether they be at work or as students.
 
And so we've had to adapt our packaging. Having a returnable glass bottle in 
that cafe doesn't help you with off
-
line delivery. So we've had to revamp the 
packaging offer so t
hat we're there with the right package to go where the 
consumer is going.
 
And that's a micro example of the sorts of things we have to do China to 
adapt to how the market is changing and is contributing to stabilization. But 
it is, again, as I said, a coun
try undergoing change in its economic model 
and that'll throw up new and different consumer behaviors to which we'll 
have to adapt.

Could you give us an update on the Philippines? You know, in listening to the 
Coca
-
Cola FEMSA results last night, it sounds like volumes were up there, 
margins are improving. It's one of those markets where it's been sort of a 
long
-
term project to get that turned around. Could you just give us a sense 
of sort of where you feel the Philippines are at this point and maybe what 
you've done to improve things there? Thanks.
 
James Quincey 
-
 
The Coca

Sure. Hi, Bryan. It's Jame
s. Yeah, I mean, look, we've had a much better 
run in the Philippines in the last few quarters, actually, strong numbers the 
first three quarters of this year. Actually, last year was three very strong 
quarters as well. So I think since FEMSA's been in the
re, they've built on the 
work that BIG did. They've gone about fixing the fundamentals There were 
some fundamental structural stuff that still needed to be improved and I 
think they grasped the nettle in the early days. And we're starting to see the 
benefi
ts of that coming through in the last six quarters.
 
Again, it's not silver bullet stuff. Is not too complicated in the sense of it's 
been about adapting the price/package architecture. It's about some of the 
emphasis on some of the sparkling brands in the 
Philippines. There were 
some of the local brands that we de
-
emphasized and re
-
emphasized some of 
the more global brands and the stronger local brands, rebuilding and 
continuing to construct a more solid distributor network. Obviously, 
Philippines is compli
cated, given all the islands and the issue in moving 
product around, but I think they've kind of worked the system in terms of 
getting the thing nicely oiled in terms of the cogs so the product can get 
everywhere, backed up with a little more marketing and
 
a little sharper 
focus on certain categories. And I think that's played through and I think the 
team on the ground has done a good job of taking the performance to a 
higher level.

If we look back, we've seen you implement a pretty significant cost savings 
program, what I think we would describe as accelerated or accelerating M&A 
activity in your bottling system, yielding syne
rgies. And now, there's talk in 
the system looking outside in seeking efficiencies in Japan. Are there more 
innovative ways that you're open to to help the system find funds to be 
more competitive?
 
Ahmet Muhtar Kent 
-
 
The Coca
-
Cola Co.
 
Hi, Brett. This is M
uhtar. First, let me just say that over the last four, five 
years, we've been actually working really, really hard to reconfigure the 
Japanese bottling system. We had 13 bottlers, what, back five years, six 
years ago. And now, we're moving towards having 8
5% of the total business 
in Japan, which is, as you know, a very large business for us, under one 
roof. And I think that in itself first, without looking outside, without looking 
anywhere, is a huge re
-
architecture that is yielding substantial savings that
 
we can re
-
deploy that into the route to market, into ways we actually get 
our products the most effective, efficient way to the customer and through 
the customer to the consumer in Japan.
 
So regardless of any encouragement from the outside, we are on a tr
ack to 
end up in a very efficient, very 21st century bottling system, a consumer 
goods delivery system in Japan that is working well. Now, are there are 
other opportunities? And that is not just related to cost saving, and yes, 
there has been early, very e
arly, discussions in Japan, can't say any more 
than that. And we will continue to look at opportunities to see if we could 
even make our Japanese system even stronger. But that's very early days, 
again, in terms of the level of discussions that have taken 
place.

Just wanted to follow
-
up back on Steve Powers' question. I mean, there's 
definitely 
a noticeable kind of increase in talk about the still growth and 
investment at the last conference and on the call today. And just trying to 
understand, I mean, certainly understand there's an opportunity, but what 
that means for margins as we move, especi
ally gross margins, going 
forward? Because I think it's still much lower gross margin and so do you 
expect margin degradation or has the mix of business, with tea or higher 
end
-
type products offset that so as we can look to kind of 2018, 2019, we 
don't see
 
that kind of margin degradation?
 
James Quincey 
-
 
The Coca
-
Cola Co.
 
Sure. Let me say a couple of thoughts and then Kathy will give you some 
comments on the margin. Look, the stills, I think if I could say one thing, 
which is the stills is not a category. I
t's a combination of many different 
categories. And even those categories re
-
segment between premium, 
mainstream and more affordable. And so, what we are focused on doing as 
we invest in the stills business is, yes, growing in aggregate and top
-
line 
number
s, but we are being selective on focusing on those places where we 
think we can generate a better return in the long term.
 
It's not a growth of bulk water. It's focused on where is the consumer 
demand, what's on
-
trend. And if you just pick out a couple of 
things that are 
on
-
trend, things like coconut waters of premium juices or premium ready
-
to
-
drink coffees, these are all very high revenue products.
 
Kathy, do you want to say something about the margins?
 
Kathy N. Waller 
-
 
The Coca
-
Cola Co.
 
Sure. So, hi, Bil
l. You are going to see some impact on margins, but mostly 
initially, because as we are going into these businesses, whether we are 
developing them internally or whether they're through bolt
-
on acquisitions, 
they do have a margin impact, but then as we get
 
scale, as we continue to 
work on the supply chain, et cetera, we do start to improve the margin. So I 
would say it's an initial issue for margins. And then, over time, we are able 
to do things that will improve the margin impact. But initially, yes, as a 
category itself, a lot of these stills have higher cost of goods. They have 
higher revenue, but higher cost of goods, so that does impact margins.

I wanted to go back to China and ask a couple of follow
-
ups. So one is within 
the 2% growth in China, can you talk about sparkling versus still? And then, 
I think, James, we've seen certainly in that market, the premiumization is 
one of the key trends and 
just wanted to get a sense of how big you think 
that premium segment within NARTD in China is and what the growth rate is 
and kind of what you're doing to sort of tackle that consumer preference. 
And then separately, Kathy, the structural impact; obviously
, fourth quarter 
is still a pretty big headwind. Is there any color you can give us as we think 
about 2017, sort of how much of the structural impact kind of lingers into 
2017 and maybe even 2018? Thanks.
 
James Quincey 
-
 
The Coca
-
Cola Co.
 
Sure. James here.
 
Look, I think it's important to say that the premium 
opportunity in China is big, but it's not as big as the mainstream 
opportunity. We are absolutely going to focus on investing in that premium 
opportunity. It's very much about the big cities, the white
-
collar. It's going 
to be also about some of the premium parts of the stills categories, and 
we're going to go after that. But in the end, the biggest mass of consumers, 
the biggest mass of disposable income will be in the mainstream. So it will 
have to be 
a combination of, yes, addressing the premiums, but also going 
after the mainstream with a greater affordability, expanding the distribution 
reach, upgrading the execution into the third tier cities in the rural areas. 
That is also going to be a big driver
 
of our revenue.
 
In terms of the categories, I think what has been going really well, by 
example, is we've taken an approach of premiumizing our water business in 
China. One of our most recent billion
-
dollar brands, (52:43) comes out of 
China effectively. 
And we're driving the business from a 

 
in the end a 1 
RMB price point to a 2 RMB price point. That's one of the biggest drivers of 
growth is the water at the 2 RMB. The places where we have a little tougher 
time is perhaps in the juice category, with spar
kling in the middle.
 
Again, when you look at what's growing in terms of the categories, what you 
do see is it maps quite closely to the consumer segments in terms of who's 
suffering and who's not suffering in terms of disposable income. The juices, 
that we
re kind of ambient, that were more going to the rural areas, are 
being hit a little harder. The premium waters, which are perhaps more the 
cities, have been doing well.

Hi, Judy. On your second question about the structu
ral impact, so we will 
obviously give more guidance on 2017 later as we get closer to the 
beginning of the year, but I will say that, particularly in North America 
refranchising, the impact will be significant in 2017, because as we are 
moving to get all o
f the refranchising completed in 2017, we will be moving 
more than we have moved in all of 2015 and 2016 combined. So it will be a 
large impact in 2017. And we will work to give you all more color on that 
later in the year or early 2017.
 
As far as 2018 is 
concerned, the refranchising will be done, but the impact 
will be basically the cycling of it, because, obviously, the timing of these 
transitions will be significant, not only to 2017, but also the impact it will 
have on 2018.
 
And then, we have some costs
 
that we have to get out in 2018 that we will 
be working to get out in early 2018 that would be basically a function of the 
refranchising as well. So we'll give you more color as time passes.

what has arguably been the toughest and most complex quarter in Coca
-
Cola history. And given the global p
andemic, of course, this comes as no 
surprise. From the initial lockdowns and closures of hundreds of thousands 
of our customer outlets to the gradual reopening and now another round of 
spikes in various countries, the impacts have been profound.
 
In this c


on the frontlines who are working to improve our communities worldwide. 

ss The Coca
-
Cola Company 
and our bottling system for their tireless efforts in prioritizing the safety of 
our people, ensuring the resiliency of our supply chain, supporting our 
millions of customers globally, and for being a force of good in their 
communi
ties.
 
As we navigated the quarter, we used a combination of focus and flexibility 
to manage through what we believe will be the peak levels of global 
lockdown. John will discuss the results in further detail, but as you think 
about the quarter and consider
 

relationship of our performance with the intersection of two key factors. The 
trajectory of our business trends in the near term is closely linked to the size 
of our away
-
from
-
home business in any given country
 
and the level of 
lockdowns in the market.
 
For example, markets like Western Europe, which had high levels of 
restrictions and a meaningful away
-
from
-
home exposures; and in India, 
which had an intense lockdown, experienced significant impacts. However, 
man
y of our Latin American markets with less restrictive measures and a 
lower away
-
from
-
home presence fared better.
 
Further as we went through the quarter and restrictions generally eased 
globally, our business saw improvements from the 25% volume declines in
 
April to the single
-
digit declines we are seeing now in July. The lockdowns 
also affected our share performance in the quarter. Our underlying 
performance in NARTD was positive and benefited from strong share gains in 
the at
-
home channel. However, this wa
s entirely offset by a full point of 
negative channel mix due to the away
-
from
-
home pressure where we have 
strong shares. And as on
-
premise begins to revive, we fully expect to return 
to share growth, and we are already seeing sequential improvements in 
mo
nthly trends.
 
Moving forward, we are maintaining that same level of focus on flexibility 
that helped us navigate the quarter as we focus on winning during the 
reopening phases. Thankfully, a good starting point matters. As a system, 
we went into the crisis
 
in a strong position and the system has rallied. There 
is a sense of optimism about what is possible as we move forward. 
Importantly, we are leveraging the crisis as a catalyst to accelerate the 
business transformation that was already underway, and we re
main guided 
by our purpose, which is to refresh the world and make a difference, and we 
are clear on how we will emerge stronger. We will win more consumers, gain 
share, maintain strong system economics, strengthen our impact across our 
stakeholders, and e
quip our organization to win in the future.

term realities of the pandemic and consumer 
shifts, the uncertainty around the trajectory of the macroec
onomic 
environment is significant. We generally align with forecasts that imply the 
global economy could take 2 to 3 years to fully recover. Notwithstanding the 
macros and NorthStar its return to pre

Second, we see the underlying structural reasons that Beverages for Life 
strategy with the consumer at the heart of everything we do remains 
essential. The commercial beverage industry will remain vibrant in the years 
to come. We know consumers will co
ntinue to spend more on commercial 
beverages and they will continue to demand greater choice. This drives the 
need for a broad, strong portfolio and a powerful scaled distribution system 
to supply that demand.
 
Our Beverages for Life vision began a transfor
mation of the organization, 
supported by a refreshed culture focused on a growth mindset. We are 
already well on our way down this path and seeing good results. The 
pandemic is prompting us to move even faster. At CAGNY, earlier this year, 
we introduced th
e key elements of our strategy to accelerate top
-
line growth 
and maximize returns. We recognize that some elements need to evolve and 
others need to be pushed harder to reflect the new reality. So, we are 
accelerating our strategy across five priorities.
 
F
irst, we are prioritizing a portfolio that combines strong global brands plus 
regional and scaled local brands to address critical age cohorts, need 
[indiscernible] and drinking occasions. Second, we are establishing a more 
disciplined innovation framework
 
and a new path forward for increased 
marketing effectiveness and efficiency. Third, we are strengthening our RGM 
and execution capabilities to drive relevance and responsiveness. And to 
capitalize on these initiatives, we are enhancing our system collabor
ation 
and capturing supply chain efficiencies to fuel growth.
 
And as a result, we are continuing to evolve our organization to support the 
accelerated strategy and invest in new capabilities to accomplish these 
objectives. John will discuss how we are leve
raging each of these initiatives 
to drive improved return and prioritize our capital allocation to the most 
attractive opportunities.
 
Turning to the portfolio. At the outset of the pandemic, our goal was to 
ruthlessly prioritize core brands and SKUs to str
engthen the resilience of our 
supply chain. In China, we placed a big emphasis on our sparkling portfolio 
during the height of the lockdown. And as a result, the category grew 14% 
in volume this quarter, led by trademark Coke with strong growth in Zero 
Sug
ar offerings. The learnings from the last several months and the insights 
from our already accelerated SKU rationalization has convinced us to go 
even deeper on this opportunity by streamlining brands.
 
We are shifting to prioritizing fewer but bigger and s
tronger brands across 
various consumer needs. At the same time, we need to do a better job 
nurturing and growing smaller, more enduring propositions and exiting some 
zombie brands not just zombie SKUs. As a reference point, of our 400 
master brands, more t
han half are single
-
country brands with little to no 
scale. The total combined revenue of those brands is approximately 2% of 

still requires resources and investments. So in the case o
f a brand like 
Odwalla and its chilled direct store delivery, which has struggled over the 
last several years, we started to stop operations effective July 31. This gives 
us the flexibility to support our investments in brands like Minute Maid and 
Simply a
nd to continue to scale rising stars like Topo Chico.
 
Turning to innovation and marketing. Innovation remains critical to our 
Beverages for Life strategy and launch activity has been on the rise over 
several years. While this expansion of innovation has be
en a considerable 
growth driver for the Coke system, many launches failed to escape the tail 
and struggled to grow. We can do better.
 
We believe the best way forward is to be more choiceful and target bigger, 
more scalable bets and be disciplined in our ex
perimentation. Over time, our 
Leader, Challenger and Explorer brands can grow to positions that deliver 
scale and profitability. We are raising the bar and adding more discipline to 
our innovation pipeline against the fine criterias, either recruiting new 
consumers, increasing the frequency of existing consumers and/or being 
margin accretive.
 
We are leading with global bets like the continued opportunity with reduced
-
sugar offerings in brand Coke. We also continue a high potential regional 
and local bets li
ke AHA
-
flavored sparkling water in the U.S. AHA captured 
double
-
digit retail value share in its first 18 week and has even more 
potential given its wide appeal.
 
With consumers prioritizing health, safety and hygiene even more, there is a 
runway for innovat

prioritize innovation centers on products, packaging and equipment. Last 
week, for example, we announced the introduction of touchless Freestyle 
machines in the U.S., which allows consumers to cho
ose and pour drinks 
from their phones in just a few seconds without the need to create an 
account or download an app.
 
This is an example of leveraging increased flexibility to create a solution, 
test it and roll it out in a few months. In addressing our ma
rketing 
effectiveness and efficiency, we are targeting several areas to improve how 
we do things. In effect, taking a fresh approach to ensure all our 
investments have a future role. We are increasing our focus on the cut 
through quality of our messages an

focused investment. Further, on the efficiency side, we are
 
pushing our 
marketing ratios and reassessing our overall marketing return on investment 
on everything from ad viewership across traditional media to improving 
effectiveness in digital.
 
Turning to RGM and execution. Beyond these brand and 
innovation 
initiatives, we are deploying our capabilities in revenue growth management 
and execution to adapt to changing channel dynamics. Providing beverages 
people desire at a price they can afford is increasingly important, given the 
macroeconomic pres
sures could be substantial and enduring.
 
By segmenting our markets to provide solutions to fit every budget, revenue 
growth management also creates opportunity to deliver value through more 
profitable channels and premium packages. RGM is not just about pr
ice. It is 
about offering a range of solutions to consumers at every part of the value 
chain and balancing profitability to maintain and grow our consumer base.

We are continuing to invest heavily in executing digital strategies to drive 
sales, efficiencies, and data analytics across our busines
s. We recently

the system has been extraordinary. In the last few months,

opportunity to collaborate even more closely across the supply chain and to 
leverage our collective global scale. Ultimately, we aspire to grow faster

wide and deliver stronger results that will enable us to continue 
investing and putt
ing our purpose into action.
 
Turning to the organization. Since we set out on the Beverages for Life 
journey, we have evolved our organization every step of the way and we 
continue to do so to ensure structure follows strategy. To focus on a growth 
portfol
io of profitable brands with quality leadership positions that is 
supported by an efficient and effective marketing model, we need to be 
flexible.
 
Our system is continuing to move further away from a complicated three 
dimensional organizational structure t
o more of a network model, improving 
our agility and maximizing scale. As the pandemic acts as a catalyst to 
accelerate our strategy, our organization is moving into the future faster too. 
And we must set up properly to empower our system to win. This will
 
require 
us to reallocate people resources and could mean some reductions due to 
our evolving approach.
 
There is no doubt that we faced significant pressures in the second quarter 
but we exited the quarter with promising signs the most challenging period 
i
s indeed behind us in much of the world. There is still a lot of work to do. 
There is no doubt the world will be different following the crisis. In many 
ways, the future is coming at us faster than ever. We are embracing the 
changes and pivoting our busine
ss to take advantage of new opportunities.
 
We are poised as a system to accelerate our transformation to return to 

to take a moment to comment on the social justice movements th
at had 
significant impacts around the world. Let me be clear, our stance is there is 
no place for racism or institutionalized inequality in the world. We are taking 
an active approach and focusing our efforts on listening, leading, investing 
and advocating
.
 
We are engaging stakeholders, employees and other business leaders and 

ensure a higher level of accountability and transparency. We recently 
committed to spend an incremental $5
00 million with black
-
owned suppliers 
and are actively contributing to communities on this important issue.
 
With that, John will discuss our results and provide more details on how we 
plan to drive returns as our increased focus provides the flexibility we
 
need.
 
John Murphy
 

this morning focused on three things. One, some commentary on the quarter 
and the rest of year outlook. Two, thoughts on the broader and longer
-
term 
implications to 
value creation for our company and our system. And, finally, 
on our capital allocation priorities.
 
As expected, our second quarter was one with significant hurdles to 
overcome as lockdown and social distancing requirements placed profound 
pressures on our 
customers and consumers. In the second quarter, volumes 
were down 16% driven by declines in higher revenue per case away
-
from
-
home channels. Organic revenues declined 26% driven by a 22% decline in 
concentrate shipments and a 4% decline in price/mix. The g
ap between 
concentrate shipments and unit cases this quarter is attributable to cycling 
the timing of shipments from last year, primarily in EMEA and Latin America, 
along with rationalization of stock levels after some safety stock building in 
the first qu
arter.
 
The majority of the price/mix pressure during the quarter was driven by 
segment mix from meaningful declines in our cost of business in Global 
Ventures, as well as Bottling Investments. Underlying gross margin was 
down approximately 300 basis points
, primarily driven by volume declines in 
capital intensive finished goods businesses like Costa, foodservice in North 
America and our Bottling Investments, in addition to negative package and 
channel mix pressure.
 
Despite the significant pressure of top
-
li
ne and gross margin, in addition to 
the currency headwinds, comparable operating margins were only slightly 
lower than last year, given the effective management of our SG&A expenses. 
While we had a considerable amounts of leverage during the quarter from 
c
ost management, part of it is attributable to timing due to modifying our 
full
-
year marketing spend forecast, which included an adjustment from the 
first quarter.
 
As we look to the remainder of the year, we will continue to hold off on 
providing full year 
guidance, given the amounts of uncertainty that remains. 
That said, there are some factors worth highlighting as you think about the 
second half. While we believe the second quarter will be the most severely 
impacted, we do expect the top
-
line trajectory t
o continue to correlate 
closely to the level of mobility of consumers and the health of the away
-
from
-
home channels, as James discussed earlier. The pandemic is not 
behind us. There is still good reason to be cautious as global COVID 
infections continue to
 
increase with case growth generally shifting from 
developed to emerging markets.
 
While we are seeing sequential improvements, recovery will likely not to be 
linear. Some markets that were recovering are having a second spike in 

Iran, Australia, Romania and here in the United 
States. Depending on the trajectory of recovery in away
-
from
-
home, 
channel and package mix will continue to put pressure on our gross margin. 
At the same time, while we do expect continued cost savings in the
 
back 
half, the amount of leverage should moderate as we look to accelerate our 
marketing investments, given improving ROI characteristics in a number of 

-
line improves faster than expectations, 
we are prepared to reinv
est more aggressively to further strengthen our 
position heading into 2021.
 
And finally, moving to below the line, in an effort to extend the duration of 
our outstanding debt in the first half, we issued $11.5 billion of long
-
term 
maturities, resulting in 
higher interest expense. While we firmly believe this 
is the right thing to do longer term, you will continue to see a year
-
over
-
year increase in interest expense in the back half of the year.
 
James laid out the approach we are taking on the portfolio, inn
ovation, 
marketing, execution and system efficiencies to return our company to top
-
line growth at the high end of our growth algorithm. We believe strongly in 
our future being propelled by top
-
line growth, but we also appreciate the 
top
-
line must ultimatel
y create value that meets or exceeds our shareholder 
expectations.
 
To this end, we are focused on the following critical objectives. First, we are 
defining, even more sharply, the optimal set of our P&L and balance sheet. 
We have developed a clear mission,
 
strategic drivers and financial 
expectations for each of our business segments and have set objectives to 

improved returns and invest what is needed to fund continued growth, while 
ensuring our balance sheet remains fit for purpose for our future needs.
 
Second, opportunities abound because of this more efficient growth. As 
James discussed earlier, we are moving with speed to optimize marketing 
spend, consolidated behind our growth po
rtfolio and business segment 
priorities. Using our productivity mindset, we are continuing to uncover cost 
saving opportunities across the supply chain and operating expenses. While 
the hallmark of our business is winning locally with our consumers and 
cus
tomers, we continue to see opportunities to scale several services across 
the system to unlock synergies.
 
In addition, as we evolve the organization to follow the strategy, this too will 
drive better resource allocation. And as James mentioned, our global system 
will continue to collaborate as our strategy accelerates and evolves and 
together, we are working t
o be nimbler to sustain the growth that follows.
 
As we pursue these objectives, our capital allocation priorities remain the 
same 

 
reinvest for appropriates in the business to drive momentum and 
continue to grow the dividend, returning cash to our shareho
lders. M&A and 
share repurchase are unlikely to play a prominent role in the near term. Our 
balance sheet is strong and we remain confident in our liquidity position as 
we continue to navigate through the crisis.
 
As we work through the system to manage thr
ough the current challenges 
caused by COVID
-
19, our bottlers are not immune to the effects of the 
business disruption. That said, approximately 80% of our business, 
volumetrically, is in the hands of our top
-
15 bottlers or run through our 
Bottling Investme
nt group. The remaining 20% are small to mid
-
sized. Our 
large public bottlers are well managed companies with healthy balance 
sheets. Nearly all of our small
-
to
-
mid
-
sized bottlers are in a stable position 
and taking proactive steps in efficient working cap
ital management, 
expenses and capital to manage the situation.
 
As we close the books on the second quarter, there is no doubt that this has 
been a challenging time for the Coca
-
Cola system. Throughout, our system 
has remained focused on the journey ahead, 
pivoting and adapting to ensure 
that we accelerate our transformation, allowing our system to emerge 
stronger.
 
With that, operator, we are ready to take questions.

Answer Session
 
Operator
 
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first
 
question comes 
from Bryan Spillane with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Your line is now 
open.
 
Bryan Spillane
 
Hi, thank you, and good morning, everyone.
 
James Quincey
 
Good morning.
 
Bryan Spillane
 
I guess my question is just around the balance between ef
ficiency and 

to be at the top end of the revenue growth algorithm. And I guess, now 

with a focus on effi
ciency. So, James, maybe if you could talk a little bit 

both of those things at the same time.
 
James Quincey
 
Yes, thanks. Thanks, Bryan. Look, clearly we've got to do both. If we ju
st 
aim for top line growth, we 

 
I'm sure we'll get back up to the top end of the 
algorithm where we were for the last few years. But if we do that without 
focusing on efficiency, that's not going to work for the company or work for 
the bottlers or work fo
r the shareholders. And the inverse is true. If we just 
stop worrying about the top line and focus on efficiency, we'll do well for a 
year or 2, but then the wheels will come off. So we've got to do both. And 
the way we're going to approach it is to really
 
attack the priorities we've 
talked about. In the good years, the pre
-
COVID years, we got up to the top 
end of the revenue growth thing. We were doing a lot of innovation. We 
were curating a lot of brands. We knew we had things that were working 
really wel
l and other brands that were struggling.
 

not just remove the zombie SKUs but prune down some of the explorer 
brands so you can refocus on those with most potentials. When times are 
go
ing well, you set a certain pace for that sort of activity. And now in the 
COVID times and in these more impaired economic times, for at least for the 
near future, we need to accelerate that. So that's why we said, look, we 
need to 

 
let's really bring for
ward the agenda of which every wave of 
innovation generates, you diverge and then you need to converge on the 
best 

 
the best product to excel. Let's accelerate that. Let's get really 
focused.
 
That will also allow us to get more focused and more efficient 
on how we do 
the marketing and where we direct the marketing investments. So the 2 

because we're more able to get back to the sort of growth rates we want, all 
the top line, and be
 
able to win new consumers and win share in the 
marketplace and yet do so in a more efficient way. We've also seen over the 
last number of years, as we've moved to platform services as we've evolved 
their organization, we can see that we have things that w
ere ahead of us 
that could also be done, and we're going to accelerate those.
 
Not just as a company, but we're looking for ways as a system, so how can 
we build on some of the great collaboration that already exists, like the 
cross
-
enterprise procurement g
roup, where we buy collectively our core 
imports, our core commodities. How can we take that to the next level? So, 
we're really looking for the really 

 
to build on the learnings of the pre
-
COVID. We knew we had things that were to 

 
that had to be done. 
Let's 
accelerate those so that we can generate the efficiencies that will both fuel 
the growth and getting the top line back up and allow us to bridge in terms 
of resources given that revenue is still impacted in the near term.
 
So it's got to be done, and 
we're going to 

 
the last part of that is really it's 
going to build on the culture of work we have done in recent years to focus 
on a growth mindset. We've got to keep pushing that idea and keep looking 
for what's working, and take the resources from the 
brands and the ideas 
and the projects that aren't working and funnel them back to those with the 

-
to
-
end idea from the consumer 
backwards through to the structure and the culture of the organization, so 
that actually 
you end up with an agenda that's not just a mix of 2 things, 
strategy and growth and efficiency, but actuallyeach of those components is 
necessary and enables the other.

Your next question comes from the line of Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. 
Ple
ase go ahead. Your line is now open.
 
Lauren Lieberman
 
Great, thanks. Good morning. I was hoping 
--
 
you touched a bit, of course 

been, I think, well educated on revenue growth manageme
nt as a great tool 
to drive growth in, let's call it, roughly economic expansion. And then in an 
economic downturn, still probably a bit less explored, the price/mix 
performance in Latin America, and I think you highlighted Mexico in 
particular in the pres
s release, was really notable. So, if you could talk a 
little bit about where you are in terms of implementing revenue growth 
management strategies to benefit you or to help support the business in a 
downturn, is Mexico simply a lead market and there's muc
h more to come 
on that front? But additional color there, I think, could be helpful. Thanks.
 
James Quincey
 
Sure, sure Lauren. Yes, I mean, interestingly, the whole approach for 
revenue growth management, certainly in one of its early iterations at the 
comp
any with the bottlers actually came at times of economic difficulty, 
particularly in Latin America. So, it is an approach that is a capability, a way 
of doing things that is just as useful in the good times as it is in the bad 
times.
 
And so once you see us
 
applying that capability, which the company, 
together with the bottlers, have spent the last few years refreshing, it's now 
being directed at the new challenges. And as you say, whereas we might 
have been putting more emphasis on using it to develop the p
remium 
opportunities in the last few years, we're going to have to use it to focus on 
some of the affordability opportunities.
 
Examples of those is really, for example in Mexico, but also places like Brazil 
and a number of others, really focusing down on r
efillable packaging. The 
benefit of refillable packaging in the context of RGM is, of course, you can 

 
the economics allow you to offer the product at a lower price point. So we 
can really connect to what is likely to be some economic stress on disposable
 
income, and therefore the need for affordable products, for refillables and 
that works in Latin America, that works in Africa, that works in a number of 
different places. But it also can 

 
as a capability, RGM can work in countries 
like Japan.
 
In 
Japan, we sell a lot of half
-
liter PET bottles for something like Coke. And 
in this current environment, what we're going to do is try and split that up. 
So have one slightly bigger package and one slightly smaller package. The 
smaller package, obviously, 
will allow us to offer a lower price point; and the 
slightly bigger package will be a sharing package which will offer more 
advantage per liter.
 
And so we can really use this capability to come in and adapt the portfolio, 
not just in the emerging markets, 
but also in the developed markets, 
knowing that, yes, there will still be people looking for premium products 
and stock up. But there are also people under a lot of disposable income 
pressure, and there, the number 1 objective, at least in the beverage 
cat
egory for us, is to bring down the entry price point. What's the lowest 
price at which you can buy a Coke?

Your next question comes from the line of Dara Mohsenian with Morgan 
Stanley. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.
 
Dara Mohsenian
 
Hey, go
od morning guys.
 
James Quincey
 
Good morning.
 
Dara Mohsenian
 
Just taking a step back, obviously, the June and July to date unit case 
volume trends showed a significant sequential improvement versus April and 
May. Do you feel like you have enough visibility 
that it's reasonable at this 
point to generally expect sequential progress from those July numbers as we 
look at the balance of the year and the remainder of the back half?
 
I know you obviously won't give us a specific number, but more 
conceptually, perhap
s you could touch on that. And that's a global question. 
But within that answer, I was hoping you could parse out thoughts by region 
a bit more and imagine the answer may be very different in Asia and Europe 
versus the U.S. and Latin America, just given th
e relative differences we're 
seeing in sequential COVID case counts.
 
James Quincey
 
Sure. I think the simple answer is no. And by no, what I mean is there are 
too many, to use the famous Rumsfeld little framework, there are too many 
known unknowns ahead of 
us. Because whilst, yes, we have seen sequential 
improvement through the second quarter and into the beginning of July, in 
all geographies, all major geographies around the world, the principal 
unknown is the degree of lockdown going forward. As we talked 
about it in 
the second quarter, the biggest variables affecting the business were: One, 
the degree of lockdown; and two, the degree of away
-
from
-
home business 
in that country with the lockdown.
 
And the simple fact remains that while things have got better 
undoubtedly, 
July is better than June, June was better than May, May was better than 
April, the reality remains that the virus is not completely under control. 
There have been countries which have repeated lockdowns or cities and 
states within countries th
at have repeated lockdowns. And so honestly, I 
think we could 

 
if we saw the virus starting to be under control, we would 
imagine, yes, we would see sequential improvement through the months 
and quarters going forward. But we cannot discount there might b
e further 
waves of lockdowns, partial or full.
 
Having said that, I am pretty confident that second quarter will ultimately 
prove to have been the most difficult and the most impacted quarter, 
principally because I think the governments are getting smarter 
about how 
they apply public health measures and getting things under their control, 
such that we're unlikely to see the whole world entering a lockdown at the 
same point in time. I'm not sure that completely helps, but unfortunately, 
that's the outlook we 
see, with a strong degree of uncertainty.
 
Operator
 
Your next question comes from the line of Nik Modi with RBC. Please go 
ahead. Your line is now open.
 
Nik Modi
 
Yes, thanks. Good morning everyone. Maybe I could just take another spin 
on Dara's question and
 
ask specifically on areas where we've seen the virus 
kind of come back. So you think about Australia, parts of Hong Kong, Texas, 
et cetera. James, I mean, it's very helpful on understanding kind of the July 
trends, but things have been moving so quickly. 
Perhaps you can talk about 
maybe what you're seeing or just give us some context on some of those 
markets just so we can get a better understanding of how things have 
shaped since the end of June.
 
James Quincey
 
Sure. I mean, look, the 

 
I think the fairest
 
thing would be to say that those 
markets where we've seen repeat lockdowns, they have never 

 
or they 
have not yet gone down at the same sort of degree they went down in the 
first round of their lockdown, whether that be February, March or April. And 
on a
 
global basis, obviously, April was the most difficult month. So we are 
not seeing that round 2 is as bad as round 1.
 
I think that if you take somewhere like Japan, which started off with the 
lockdown and they opened up a bit then they locked down again, y
es, the 
number started getting negative again, but they weren't really as bad as 
they had been at the initial stage. So you do get a bit of a wiggly line, so 
you can't 

 
that's why I made the point on Dara's question, you can't 
assume, not that I necessari
ly think you were, you can't assume it was a 
straight line from where we are now to good. I think there's going to be 
some variations as you start to look across the months. But the second 
waves have not yet looked as bad as the first waves, whether I look
 
across 
any of the countries you really mentioned or some of the other ones.

Your next question comes from the line of Rob Ottenstein with Evercore. 
Please go ahead. Your line is now open.
 
Rob Ottenstein
 
Great. Thank you very much. James, I would 
like to focus on the chart that 
you had on the 400 master brands, with 50% accounting for 98% of revenue 
and 50% just 2% of revenue. And I know this is a very big question that you 
could probably talk about for a long time, but kind of high level, how 

 
wh
at 
do you think the right mix is? And how do you get to that right mix? 
Presumably, there were certain incentives, relationships with the bottlers 
that got you where you are now. How do you see that evolving over time? 
And what do you 

 
how do you think th
e financial impact will be when you 
get to a more optimal mix? Thank you.
 
James Quincey
 
Sure. I am not sure there is a destination where there's one right number of 
the mix between leaders, challengers and explorers. And we will always have 
a tail of small
er brands. That's not the issue that we're after. And actually, it 
would probably be a sign of weakness to have no smaller brands in the 
portfolio because it would mean we're not nurturing the future, we're not 
nurturing the explorers that will be challeng
ers, that will be leaders in the 
future. What we want to see is a steady pipeline of progression of creating 
ever
-
stronger brands that have real quality leadership.
 
Obviously, they've got to pass through the challengers phase. And therefore, 
you've got 
to launch a whole series of explorers, small brands, to try and get 
there, knowing that most of them will not make it. What we're looking at 
here is that we have not been as assertive enough and directive enough at 
weeding out the explorers that have not w
orked and are unlikely to work so 
that we can redirect the resources on to the explorers and the challengers 
that have the most opportunity into the future.
 
So it's not a question of a certain number of explorers are right or wrong, it's 
a question of, are
 
they succeeding or not? And we 

 
I think we talked at the 
Investor Day that the success criteria for explorer is very fast growth and 
starting to gain a core of very engaged and loyal consumers, and that you're 
really starting to make waves in the categor
y even though small.
 
And that the success criteria for a challenger was being able to gain enough 
market share that, over time, you could believe you were going to get to 
leadership. Because at leadership, you have both scale and 
disproportionately more fa
vorable economics and margin versus the other 
two categories. So what we're looking at here is, in a way, the result of lots 
of experimentation and exploration, which is a good thing, but we are 
looking at an incomplete task of weeding out the ones that wo
rk.
 
And so what we're looking at, particularly in a large bucket of smaller 
brands, is they stayed small for some good period of time, and they're not 
growing, so they're not meeting the success criteria for saying 

 
there as an 
explorer brand. And that's 
true across all categories. I mean, our objective 
remains to create a broad portfolio of leaders across all sorts of categories.
 
And so really, we are just accelerating the work that we knew needed to 
happen on all those explorer brands that were not meeti
ng our own success 
criteria, if they were going somewhere, they were growing, et cetera. And 
that will allow us to redirect resources to those that are best positioned to 
grow. So again, we'll be fueling top line growth more efficiently, allowing us 
to get
 
back to where we were in 2019 and emerge stronger ahead of the 
pack with better margins for our system.

Your next question comes from the line of Steve Powers with Deutsche 
Bank. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.
 
Steve Powers
 
Yes, hi everyo
ne. Good morning. I guess a question for me on capital 
allocation. John, you were pretty clear on the priorities and the near
-
term 
deemphasis on M&A and share repurchase. But the implication there is that 
you have high confidence in your ability to both re
invest heavily in the 
business and also continue to maintain, even grow, the dividend, whereas 
the market's been increasingly concerned about your ability to do just that in 
recent weeks and months.
 
So can you maybe expand on what drives your confidence th
ere? And is 
there any set of circumstances that you can envision in the near to medium 
term that might better challenge your ability to defend the dividend, again, 
given the takes in your prioritization?
 
John Murphy
 
Thanks, Steve. First and foremost, I thi
nk the decisions on capital allocation, 
we take into account not just the short
-
term, but also taking a view as to 
where we think the business will be over the next couple of years. And as we 
look at that, even though, as James said, there are a number of 
known 
unknowns, you got 

 
I think you got to divide the calendar into a few parts. 
One is what's happening in the here and now, number two is the sort of the 
length and shape of the recovery and then number three is getting back to 
some degree of what peop
le are, I think, calling a new normal.
 
So we've got tremendous confidence in the beverage industry in general. We 
think that the fundamentals for growth going forward longer
-
term remain 
the same, albeit with the challenges in the near
-
term. And we think th
at we 
can and we'll get back to the high end of our long
-
term growth algorithm 
over time. And so with that context, we're comfortable in maintaining our 
position around our capital allocation and, first and foremost, continuing to 
support the business as w
e go forward in terms of capital and marketing 
investments; and then number two, continuing to support the dividend in 
that period.
 
Wrapped around that, of course, is our overall debt strategy. We are 
confident, with the decisions we've taken year
-
to
-
date,
 
that the balance 
sheet is strong enough to withhold the near
-
term pressures. And we're 

 
while we may go slightly outside of our range this year, we see that being a 
short
-
term blip. So I'll also say we're confident in the industry, in our ability 
to emer
ge stronger.
 
And with that in mind, the priorities that we lay out, we think, are 
achievable. Obviously, as James just said, there are lots of kind of known 
unknowns, and we will continue to review and adapt as those unknowns 
become more known.

Yo
ur next question comes from the line of Laurent Grandet with 
Guggenheim. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.
 
Laurent Grandet
 
Yes, good morning everyone. James, I'd like to focus my question on the on
-
premise channel. Can you please unbundle the on
-
prem
ise performance and 
trends? So what are you seeing in QSRs versus casual dining, contract 
caterers or sports/concert venues or travel? Trying to figure out the pace of 
the recovery by those subchannels. And is it fair to assume that the piece 
that is recov
ering the fastest, like QSR, is probably not 

 
less profitable? 
Thank you.
 
James Quincey
 
Sure. I'll try and add a little bit of texture on this one for you. But the first 
thing to bear in mind is the predominant effect is the degree of lockdown in 
the coun
try as it relates to those channels. So there isn't really a way to 
describe the global trends by those different channels because it very much 
depended 

 
or does depend still on what sorts of measures governments 
have put in place to 

 
for health reasons.
 
And so there's 

 
the global trend is not really that meaningful. I would just 
urge you to look more at the degree of lockdown on the total business. If we 
take one country and look at what we see as to have happened there, and 
take the U.S., which is the 
one you're probably most familiar with.
 
If we look at the away
-
from
-
home channels, first point to know is there was 
sequential improvement as we went from April to May to June. And so things 
got better. Clearly, the biggest determinant of how our channel d
id was what 
percent of its business needed people to be inside the building. So you 
mentioned QSR.
 
Actually, QSR was one of the, in aggregate in the U.S., was at the better end 
of the impact. Why? Because many of them have well
-
developed drive
-
thru 
and dig
itally enabled takeaway businesses. So actually, they not only 
improved but they were not the most affected of the eating
-
away channels. 
The sorts of channels that were most impacted by the lockdowns were bars, 
full
-
service restaurants, at
-
work locations. 
Some of these places were, 
simply put, there was no foot traffic. And so the declines were significant.
 
And given that many offices are still not going back to full working, if at all. 
For example, at
-
work remains one of the most affected channels, much 
mo
re so than QSR or other casual dining or even bars and restaurants. So 
the simplest way to think about or to analyze the away
-
from
-
home channels 
is simply to look at the degree that the restrictions in place at any moment 
in time and how that affects their
 
business, vis
-
à
-
vis do they have takeaway 
or business that can leave the location? And to what extent are they 
dependent fully on people being in the location?

Your next question comes from the line of Bonnie Herzog with Goldman 
Sachs. Please go 
ahead. Your line is now open.
 
Bonnie Herzog
 
Good morning. I actually had a question on the ramping of your marketing 
spend in the second half as it sounds like you've started to accelerate 
spending ahead of the recovery. So I really wanted to 
understand how 
quickly you expect the spending to impact the top line, given there's 
typically a lag. And then I assume there will be a bigger drag on your 
margins from the stepped
-
up spending in the second half. But maybe clarify 
that and then maybe highl
ight any offsets you might have or levers you can 
pull to minimize the impact from this? Thanks.
 
John Murphy
 
Thanks, Bonnie. Let me take that one. Again, as I mentioned here, I think 
it's important to kind of divide the calendar up. As you know, for the se
cond 
quarter, we did take a significant step back from marketing because we 
didn't think it was going to be that effective. And as we look to the second 
half of the year, I think the name of the game is to stay flexible and be able 
to adapt as quickly as p
ossible. With that in mind, as we see the shape of 
the recovery taking place around the world, there are opportunities to step 
up, to step back up our investment levels.
 
And I think there's also an opportunity to use this time to completely rethink 
the amo
unt of investment a market actually needs in an optimal level going 
forward. So that's very much a key priority for the second half of the year. 
In terms of specific numbers, I don't have specific numbers to provide 
because I think it's, again, going back 
to what I said about being flexible, it's 
a function of being able to adapt and react as markets demonstrate the 
trajectory that they're on.
 
But as we go forward and as we go into 2021, a key priority is to emerge 
stronger, as James alluded to earlier, and
 
to emerge stronger faster. And so 
with that in mind, it's a key objective in the second half of the year, is to 
position ourselves well for 2021, and particularly in the markets that are 
really important to us and the markets where the competitive pressur
es are 
strongest. So stepping it up on a case
-
by
-
case basis in the second half of the 
year and being ready for 2021.
 
And for sure, as I said in the script, as we look into the second half of the 
year, you're not going to potentially see the same cost effic
iencies that 
drove the sort of the operating margin impact in the second quarter in the 
second half of the year as we continue to look at our marketing needs and 
take decisions accordingly.

Your next question comes from the line of Bill Chappell w
ith SunTrust. Please 
go ahead. Your line is now open.
 
Bill Chappell
 
Hey, thanks. Good morning. James, I just wanted to step back, trying to 
understand like how we should look at the 

 
in the slide deck, the 
announcements today, because, I mean, on one side
, you can say, look, 
we're trying to be more nimble, we're trying to be stronger coming out. The 
other side, you can say, look, earnings don't matter this year, they might 
not really matter this year.
 
Let's 

 
don't waste a good crisis, let's step up all ou
r spending and move 
forward and we can really accelerate everything over the next year. And if 
it's the latter, then you didn't really talk about kind of how much this is 
going to cost and whether it's going to impact this year and next year in 
terms of co
sts. So maybe a little more color on which way it is and what 
you're expecting to spend?
 
James Quincey
 
I'm not sure whether you are referring as much the DME or any additional 
costs because we're changing our product. But let me try a couple of things 
and 
then see whether it answers the question. I mean, firstly, let me just 
underline what John said. We are going to be good stewards of our capital. 
And yes, of course, we could just pile on the marketing spend because ""no 
one cares about the earnings this ye
ar."" Yes, but that still comes from our 
bottom line and our capital available. And if you look 

 
if you ignore calendar 
years and just think about the business, why would I want to spend money 
in a period if I can't get the return, particularly if there's 
a strong lockdown?
 
So we don't take an approach of overly thinking in the calendar years when 
it comes to marketing. We're about generating momentum for the brands 
and the business. And as John said, if we see opportunities to invest and 
generate and accel
erate the top line growth, that's what we're going to do, 
which is the inverse of what we saw in the second quarter. We thought no 
marketing is going to make much difference in the second quarter, so we 
pulled back heavily.
 
And then we'll have to gauge and
 
be adaptable as we work through the 
uncertainty in these known unknowns as to where or which countries and 
which categories versus which lockdowns is it going to make sense to 
spend? So we are going to be judicious in our use of marketing, in our use of 
c
apital expenditure. We 

 
much as you can see the sales trend improving 
through the quarter to July, our expectation is that the general direction of 
travel is sequential improvement, therefore, we expect to come back and 
spend more marketing. But we're goi
ng to be focused on getting that right.
 
But said more generally, if we're going to emerge stronger, we need to get 
the business back to the right level of investment to drive the top line 
growth. That's what's going to create the profit growth for the Coca
-
Cola 
Company. And that is going to go behind the revamped approach to the 
portfolio, the revamped approach to how we continue to do marketing. If we 
do have to let go of some brands, potentially even ones we've acquired, like 
Odwalla, we may need to take 
some charges. And even though it wouldn't 
affect the cash flow because we're using it, perhaps we converted the brand 
to something else or maybe it wasn't making any money, but there might 
have to be some charges. Obviously, our intent would be to make tho
se 
decisions as quickly as possible and recognize them as soon as they're 
made. I hope that provides something of color to your question.

Your next question comes from the line of Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan. 
Please go ahead. Your line is now op
en.
 
Andrea Teixeira
 
Thank you. Good morning. So I'm wondering if you can elaborate more on 
the efficiency and ROI commentary that you guys just made. If you can see 
operating margins inflect already in the third quarter year
-
over
-
year, or 
more of a fourth 
quarter aspiration? And a clarification on John's comments 
about capital allocation. Is there any room to accelerate the divestitures of 
the Bottling Investments that you've done so far and become even more 
asset
-
light to repurpose the funds into dividends
 
and buybacks? Thank you.
 
John Murphy
 
So on 

 
thanks, Andrea. On the second question, there's 

 
as we've in 
previous calls, I think we have a very open book with respect to the balance 
sheet and rightsizing and optimizing the balance sheet as we go 
forward. 
And there's no investment on the balance sheet that does not get a regular 
review and determination as to whether it should still be there.
 
With respect to that part of the decision
-
making, our Bottling Investments 
group is an important piece of t
he equation. We don't have a timetable for 
further refranchising, but it certainly is our longer
-
term goal to be more 
asset
-
light, just as we have, I think, stated on previous occasions, and have 
acted accordingly with previous refranchising efforts. So th
at will and 
continues to be a part of the agenda, but not a specific time line on it.
 
And then with respect to the comment on operating margins, I don't have a 
clear number to give you for either Q3 or Q4. But it goes without saying, is 
that as we looked a
t the opportunities that present themselves, we're not 
necessarily as focused on the months, but we're more focused on building 
momentum for the business and sustaining it in the 

 
particularly in the 
markets that have got outsized importance to us. So we'
ll make those 
decisions as they come and as they appear to be the right ones to make at 
the right time, and the consequences will flow through accordingly.

Your next question comes from the line of Carlos Laboy with HSBC. Please 
go ahead. Your lin
e is now open.
 
Carlos Laboy
 
Yes. Good morning, everyone. You note big sparkling declines in India, 
Western Europe and fountain in the U.S. Have deep structural changes, such 
as heavy client turnover, in any of those three situations prompted you to 
move to
ward a reset of the model in those three businesses?
 
James Quincey
 
Carlos, no, I don't think I would describe any of those as a deep structural 
change that has driven some sort of reset of the model. Again, they're very, 
very linked to the degree of 
lockdown that has been mandated because of 
COVID. And if you just take those three 

 
both, I mean, fountain or food 
service and on
-
premise in the U.S. and a lot of EMEA, particularly the 
Western Europe, has a lot of away
-
from
-
home business, the outlets wer
e 
shut. And what we found is that as the outlets start to open, the business 
starts to flourish again.
 
And India, simply put, there isn't a modern trade as you'd understand it in 
the developed markets at a large scale. And so when they had a lockdown, it 
l
ocked down all the small stores. And so literally, the whole marketplace was 
closed down at that point in time in what would have been a peak season in 
India. So it's really lockdown
-
related. And I think as they come off, you'll see 
the reopenings. We are 
social creatures, as humans, and we like 
experiences. People will want to go out. There will be habits that will have 
changed, but we will go out and experience the world, and these channels 
will bounce back. John?
 
John Murphy
 
Yes, James, just 

 
if I could
 
just add to that. I think, Carlos, I think what we 
will see, both in some of the developing markets like India and even here in 
the United States, is I think there will be a higher turnover, particularly of 
small customers, in both the sort of more modern
 
away
-
from
-
home as well 
as the traditional away from home. So I think we expect to see that. But 
that in and of itself, I don't think means a structural reset is necessary. It 
could just mean there will be more new ones coming along. And for our 
system, it
 
just 

 
it will be a key area of focus as we come out of the 
recovery period.

Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Grundy with Jefferies. 
Please go ahead. Your line is now open.
 
Kevin Grundy
 
Hey. Good morning, everyone. And thank you fo
r taking the question. I 
wanted to come back to investment levels. It was talked about with a couple 
of different prior questions, but ask it differently and really focus on North 
America. And my question isn't so much about cadence, but really more 
about 
adequacy. And the context being that your key competitor has 
committed to supporting its brands, this is on the heels of stepped
-
up 
investment levels last year. They're now trying to hit an external earnings 
number, and market share is an increasing focus.
 
If I'm not mistaken, it's 
also a bigger part of executive comp. And then of course, the snack side of 
the business is thriving, which gives them some flexibility to lean in on 
beverages.
 
So setting aside the COVID
-
related pressures, can you comment on wha
t 
you're seeing competitively in North America? I think you commented a 
moment ago that there's also willingness internally at the Coca
-
Cola 
Company to forgo any sort of profit targets to lean in and make sure that 
you're adequately reinvested in key marke
ts, presumably the U.S. would be 
included in that. Maybe you just can confirm it. And then maybe talk a little 
bit about some of the governors and key metrics that you guys are looking 
at: Brand equity, market share, absolute levels of A&M spending, to ens
ure 
that your brands are indeed adequately supported and that you don't end up 
vetted into year
-
end, and looking out to next year, falling short if you're 
underinvested? Thank you.
 
James Quincey
 
Do you want a go, John? So I'll go ahead. I'll start, then ma
ybe you can 
jump in. Clearly, we are go 

 
I mean, we've set a North Star: Emerge 
stronger, which is gain more 

 
engage with more consumers, gain more 
drinkers, gain share and reestablish system economics for us and the 
bottling system. So that is where we'
re headed. And very clearly, that we're 
going 

 
if we have to choose between investing and not investing in making 
more money, but damaging the top line, we're going to invest to drive the 
top line.
 
The fundamentals of the Coke system work when we can get 
back where we 
were precrisis, which was the top end of the growth algorithm on the top 
line, and that then flows through with the leverage into the bottom line. So 
that is going to be the North Star globally. And in North America, we need to 
make sure that
 
happens. And clearly, we're going to do that in a flexible way 
that John talked about the DME. Having said that, we fully expect to be 
spending sequentially more DME in North America in Q3 and into Q4.
 
Obviously, we have key metrics by brand as to what we
 
expect from each 
brand and what they're doing and going for that. And what we see in the 
marketplace is, again, a bit like the total volume performance. In terms of 
share, what we see is that where the world is open, we've been able to gain 
share. The pre
dominant negative effect is channel mix. And it's worth 
remembering that our 

 
we have half as much a gain market share in away
-
from
-
home channels as we have in at
-
home channels.
 
So the closing of the away
-
from
-
home, of course, makes a negative impact 
to o
ur market share. So what we've done 

 
what we're focusing on is in the 
channels that are open, let's focus on gaining share where the world is still 
working, knowing that as the reopenings occur, and being social humans, 
we'll go out for the experiences, t
hat we will structurally have gained share 
in channels and then we'll be favored as those where we have historically 
been stronger start their reopening. So that's our approach overall and in 
North America.

Thank you, Tim and good morning everyone. During our last Earnings call 
we articulated 5 strategic actions to reignite our growth and committed to 
providing you an update on our progress as we move forward and into
 
2015. 
So today, I'm going to start with some highlights from our fourth quarter 
performance and then review the progress we've made against our 5 
strategic actions.
 
For those of you following our Web cast, you can see our quarterly 
performance on our new 
scorecard on Slide 4. Overall, our performance 
came in slightly ahead of where we had previously expected. This was driven 
by some net positives above the operating income line slightly offset by 
higher than expected returns to remeasurement impacting prof
it before tax. 
As the top line structurally adjusted comparable currency neutral net 
revenues grew 4% in the quarter driven by a balance between volume and 
underlying price mix in what was a challenging macro environment.
 
At the profit level, structurally 
adjusted comparable currency neutral 
operating income grew 7% in the quarter, while we continue to invest 
heavily behind our media with double digit increases in the quarter and full 
year. Importantly, there are some highlights for the quarter. We continue
 
to 
focus pricing and revenue realization in key developed markets with North 
America and Europe both delivering positive price mix in the quarter and for 
the full year. Our core strategies and our diversified global portfolio enables 
us to gain global val
ue share in non
-
alcoholic ready to drink Sparkling 
beverages as well as Still beverages in the quarter.
 
This is a key metric for us particularly in a challenging macro environment. 
As we announced last week, we also continue to strengthen our overall 
portf

premium tea brand in the United States benefited from great marketing, 
strong media and stepped up execution to achieve this status. Furthermore 
FUZE TEA, our popular mainstream t
ea brand now available in nearly 40 
markets around the world reached this status in less than three years 
demonstrating the strength of our systems marketing and executional 
capabilities. And finally, LOHAS our innovative water brand in Japan 
regained bill
ion dollar brand status in 2014. This brings our total number of 
billion dollar brands to 20 out of which 14 are Still brands. Just five years 

more than one new billion dollar brand eac
h year to the list.
 
Stepping back from our quarterly performance I would like to talk about the 
bigger picture in 2014 a year of significant change for our company that will 
continue in 2015. Specifically I want to discuss our five strategic actions to 
rei
gnite our which are first; targeting disciplined brand and growth 
investment, Second; driving revenue and profit growth with clear portfolio 
roles across our market, Thirdly; refocusing on our core business model, 
Fourth; driving efficiency through more ag
gressive productivity and fifth 
--
 
last but not least streamline and simplify our organization.
 
While we're making solid progress we have more to do. In 2014 we invest 
significantly in both our brands and in incremental growth opportunities. We 
substantial
ly increased our media investment in markets and categories 
where our media was underfunded relative to the market opportunity, where 
we had the right price tag, channel architectures and where we had clear 
executional alignment with our bottlers. The qual
ity of our media has been 
increasing and we intend to improve it even further under the leadership of 
our new global Chief Marketing Officer Marcos de Quinto.
 
We're seeing initial success as exemplified by North America where our 
incremental media investme
nts coupled with our segmented price tag 
strategies drove revenue growth in our Sparkling portfolio through strong 
4% price mix in the second half of the year. This gives us confidence that 
when we invest in our brands, align on our system plans and focus 
on 
execution we do see positive results.
 
And looking beyond our existing portfolio we continue to focus on expanding 
our participation across a range of consumption [occasions]. Today the 
average household globally consumes 26 beverages per day and of thes
e 26 
beverages only 1.4 are Coca
-
Cola company brand. Our opportunity to 
capture more beverage [occasions] is just immense. And for that reason 
we've announced strategic investments in Keurig Green Mountain and 
Monster Beverage Corporation both of these inv
estments underscore not 
only our ability to adapt to changing consumer trend but also our 
commitment to accelerate innovation.
 
Next we expanded our market segmentation recognizing that each of our 
markets has a specific role in order to sustainable revenue
 
growth. Some 
markets focus on price realization, others on volume and the remainder on 
the balance of the two. Importantly our proxy statement will be coming out 
in the coming weeks and you will see the revised intensive metrics which will 
add revenue gro
wth directly aligned to those market roles.
 
We also made headways in refranchising our bottling operations both in the 
United States and internationally. In North America we closed several 
refranchising transactions in 2014 and laid out a clear path and ti
meline to 
refranchise the remaining territories. Specifically, we refranchised territories 
representing approximately 5% of the U.S bottler
-
delivered business in 2014 
and have already signed definitive agreements to continue refranchising a 
similar amount 
in the first half of 2015.
 
These agreements along with our ongoing work give us confidence that we 
will continue to accelerate our rate of refranchising each year and achieve 
our goal to retain a maximum of about one
-
third of the U.S bottler
-
delivered 
busi
ness by the end of 2017. And it is our intent to refranchise the 
remaining territories by 2020 at the latest. As we reached the end phase in 
North America these actions will drive higher operating margins, lower 
capital spending and invested capital and im
prove the ROIC for our 
company.
 
Outside of North America we announced two transformative changes to our 
bottling landscape in critical high growth markets around the world. First in 
Indonesia we announced a joint venture in Coca
-
Cola Amatil Indonesia that 
will help our system to capture the long
-
term opportunity in this extremely 
attractive emerging market. We also entered into an agreement to re
-
architect our African bottling system with the creation of Coca
-
Cola 
Beverages Africa which will serve 12 Southe
rn and East African countries 
and will be a top ten global bottler once the transaction is completed.
 
Importantly, Coca
-
Cola Beverages Africa will have the scale, resources and 
efficiencies to fund the investment required to capture the strong long term 
gr
owth potential in Africa. These markets will be long term growth engines 
for our company so it is absolutely critical that we invest sufficiently today to 
prime those engines for decade to come. In order to reinvest our business 
and deliver against our lon
g term financial targets we embarked upon an 
expanded productivity plan that will result in a total $3 billion in annualized 
savings by 2019.
 
As Kathy discuss in detail during our modeling call in December this 
represents the significant reduction to our i
nvestable spend base and our 

reducing positions that are no longer aligned to our growth priorities or are 
deemed redundant as we streamline our operation. While this is never an 
easy pr
ocess, it is absolutely essential to ensuring that our business is wired 
for greatest speed, responsiveness as well as innovation. And importantly, it 
also frees up the resources we need to reinvesting in the business to 
accelerate our growth.
 
Fifth and fi
nally towards the end of 2014 we begin the process of 
streamlining and simplifying our operating model. We announced the 
streamlining of group functional layer and began standardizing the key 
processes across our business units. This will not only reduce o
ur cost 
structure but more importantly will create a more nimble organization that is 
wired to act swiftly and rapidly in today's dynamic landscape.
 
In summary, I am confident that these strategic actions are laying the grand 
work for accelerated top and b
ottom line growth in the future and delivering 
the long term shareowner value you expect. Looking ahead we will continue 

said before 2015 will be a transition year for the company as we 
implement 
our new operating model and our incremental media investments in both 
2014 and 2015 taking time to pay off in full. Further we expect the global 
consumer environment to remain volatile, geo
-
political hotspots around the 
world and potential deflat
ion environment in Europe and continued softness 
in many emerging and developing markets around the could to be partially 
offset by an improving environment in the United States.
 
So against this back drop what remains to be seen is how quickly and to 
what extent lower oil prices trickle down to impact consumer discretionary 
spending in both importing as well as oil exporting nations. Therefore we will 
focus on what we can control; we will implement our strategies with focus 
and conviction, investing fo
r the long term in emerging market as well as 
taking advantage of opportunities to solidify our position in the growth 
market of today and tomorrow. While in 2015 we expect to grow comparable 
currency neutral EPS mid
-
single digit, from 2016 on we intend to
 
be back to 
delivering again a long term target of high single digit comparable currency 
neutral EPS growth.
 
We will strengthen our leading brands through incremental media 
investments and best in class marketing campaign. We will deliver a [net] 
change in
 
productivity and complete the majority of North America 
franchising both of which will drive growth and improve our margin 
structure. And finally we will continue to enhance our marketing leading 
capabilities to provide our customers and consumer with the
 
innovative and 
refreshing product they expect from the Coca
-
Cola Company.
 
I will now hand the call to our Chief Financial Officer Kathy Waller who will 
provide you with a more detailed look at our financial performance as well as 
the outlook on our busine
ss for 2015.
 
Kathy Waller
 
Thank you Muhtar and good morning everyone. Our performance in the 
fourth quarter was slightly ahead of our expectations due primarily to three 
factors. First, several markets around the world delivered slightly better top 
line pe
rformance thanks to a strong finish during the holiday season. 
Second, gross margin came in slightly better than anticipated and third, 
operating expenses were lower than expected which led to comparable 
currency neutral margin expansion. We are pleased wi
th where the quarter 
landed. Structurally adjusted comparable currency neutral revenue growth 
was driven by 3% growth in concentrate shipment and 2% underlying price 
mix. Concentrate shipment outpaced unit cases in the quarter driven by an 
extra selling da
ys. However for the full year concentrate shipment were in 
line with unit cases. Consolidated price mix in the quarter was driven by 
pricing initiatives in North America, Latin America and Europe.
 
Importantly as we've done throughout 2014 we continue to in
vest the 
behind our brand. During the quarter our marketing expenditures grew high 
single digit resulting in mid
-
single digit growth for the year. This increase in 
annual marketing expenditures was driven by a double digit increase in 
media investment as w
e continue to drive efficiencies within our overall 
marketing budget to put against our media spend. Our fourth quarter 
comparable EPS was $0.44 which included a 10 point currency headwind. On 
a comparable currency neutral basis our EPS grew 5% in both the
 
quarter 
and the full year. Items impacting comparability in the quarter were 
primarily related to the impact of changing the exchange rate used to 
measure our Venezuela subsidiaries, net monetary assets into U.S. dollars, a 
write down on the competent sal
es receivable from our bottling partner in 
Venezuela, non
-
cash charges related to refranchising certain territories in 
North America and cost associated with our previously announced $3 billion 
productivity program.
 
Given increased uncertainty and lack of 
liquidity in Venezuela, we 
remeasured our bolivar
-
denominated net monetary assets at the end of the 
quarter using the SICAD II exchange rate. We are also using the SICAD II 
exchange rate to translate our Venezuelan subsidiaries local currency income 
statem
ent into U.S. dollars beginning in January 2015. The receivable write 
down was recorded as a result of revised assessment of the U.S. dollar value 
we expect to receive. Despite a difficult operating environment in Venezuela, 
the Coca
-
Cola system remains co
mmitted to the market and will continue 
producing and selling our products that Venezuelan consumers enjoy on a 
daily basis.
 
As you saw on our scorecard, full year free cash flow with $8.2 billion, up 
3% primarily due to the efficient management of working
 
capital and cycling 
incremental pension contributions last year, partially offset by an 
unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations
 

July 2013.
 
For the year, 
cash returned on invested capital declined 32 basis points due 
to the $1.5 billion investment we made in Keurig Green Mountain. As we 
look ahead to 2015, we anticipate continued challenging macroeconomic 
conditions in many markets around the world. Despite
 
this, we're on track 
with the access we laid out during our last earnings call and we remain 
confident in the outlook we provided in December. Therefore we expect our 
comparable currency neutral EPS growth in 2015 to be mid
-
single digit, 
roughly in line w
ith our growth rate in 2014.
 

takes to our P&L in 2015 with the exception of currency these are not 
changed. Therefore I'm not going into detail on this call, but you can see the 
v
arious line items on Slide 13. After considering our hedge positions, current 
spot rate and the cycling of our prior
-
year rates, we now expect an 
approximate five
-
point currency headwind on net revenues with a seven to 
eight
-
point headwind on profit before
 
tax for the full year 2015.
 
This is a stronger headwind than the previously communicated five to six
-
point for profit before tax due primarily to the effect from translating our 
bolivar
-
denominated profit at the SICAD II rate and to a recent decline in 
se
veral emerging market currencies which we do not hedge. In terms of 
coverage, we're fully hedged on the Euro, Yen and Sterling for 2015. We 
also have near term coverage in place across several other major currencies. 
There are a couple of phasing items you
 
should consider when modeling the 
first quarter. Due to our fiscal calendar, there are six additional days in the 
first quarter of 2015 as compared to the first quarter of 2014.
 
Although that will benefit revenue, variable cost such as marketing, sales 
an
d distribution expenses will also occur to a much greater degree in the 
first quarter. We expect the Venezuelan pricing provision will continue to 
negatively impact our net revenue and operating income in the first quarter 
of 2015 as we began to recognize 
the impact in the second quarter of last 
year. And we expect structural items primarily related to North America to 
be a headwind in the first quarter. Taken together, we expect structural 
adjustment and the Venezuelan pricing provision to be an approximat
e two
-
point headwind on net revenues and an approximate three
-
point headwind 
on a profit before tax.
 
In addition, we will cycle the timing of expenses in the first quarter of last 
year when we had four
-
points of operating leverage. Therefore we expect 
the 
comparable currency neutral operating leverage will be negative in the 
first quarter. Finally, we currently expect currency will be an approximate 
six
-
point headwind on net revenues and an approximate eight
-
point 
headwind on profit before tax in the first 
quarter as we cycle more favorable 
rates from the prior year. We currently anticipate closing the transaction 
with Monster Beverage Corporation at the beginning of the second quarter, 
note that there is a slightly later than our initial expectations of the
 
first 
quarter due to various closing considerations. At this stage we do not 
anticipate any material changes to our structural impact guidance from 
December and of course we will update you along the way if there were to 
be a change.
 
In closing we're conf
ident in our strategies and in the actions we've already 
taken to regain our momentum. 2015 will be a transition year as we 
implement significant change in our company and continue to reinvest in our 
business. We absolutely believe that the Coca
-
Cola Compa
ny is best 
positioned to capture growth in the non
-
alcoholic beverages and to continue 
to deliver long term value to our shareholders.
 
Operator, we're now ready for questions.
 
Question

and

Answer Session
 
Operator
 
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our firs
t question today is from Bryan 
Spillane from Bank of America.
 
Bryan Spillane
 
Hey, good morning everyone. I've got a question about 
--
 
Muhtar, in your 
prepared remarks you mentioned the consumer environment remain volatile 
in terms of your expectations for 
'15. Can you talk a little bit about sort of 
what type, what range of volatility you might have embedded in your sort of 
plan for '15, maybe talk a little bit more specifically about the consumer 
environment both in Europe and Latin America where those are
 
really two 
important markets for the company and where it seems volatile and then 
finally just maybe how that might affect your decision to spend more 
vagaries in those markets this year given the volatility 
--
 
I know there is a 
lot there but? Thanks.
 
Muh
tar Kent
 
Sure. Thanks, Brian. First just at a very high level 10,000 feet, 2015 I think 
we expect the macro environment to even become a little more volatile 
versus 2013 and 2014. As the micro economic vagaries get worse in certain 
parts of the world, so r
ate of interest, currency certainly will add to volatility, 
growth gaps will in some parts are going to 
--
 
versus other parts are going 
to grow. Take for example the United States and Great Britain two large 
western economies starting the year of 2015 stro
ng whereas the Euro zone, 
Japan and most of the emerging worlds starting the year slower. So there is 
this kind of gap and some catching up to do.
 
We're gaining share across the world in Sparkling juices, important 
categories. The industry 
--
 
we see some e
vidence that there are some things 
that are working for us but we need to be cautious and take it quarter
-
by
-

concerned I think Columbia seems to do continue to do really well as an
 
economy and I think there is some more lifting to do in Mexico and Brazil 
and South zone. I was recently in Latin America and our business there 
continues to 
--
 
we have fantastic group of bottling partners investing for the 
short and long
-
term growth and 
we continue to gain share, we have a 
fantastic 
--
 
very strong packaged product channel segmentation and 
architecture and pricing, competitive, but at the same time great revenue 
growth, management strategies working there.
 
And so Europe as towards the last
 
quarter, quarter four which we're just 
reporting on the Southern European countries continue to be challenged. 
Germany, our business was very much in the positive, Northern Europe had 
a better environment for us 
--
 
was a better environment for us than the
 
South and Eastern Europe is again challenged by some of the macro 
volatility that spills over across from the East. So I think that how will see.
 
And then Asia I think we're still very bullish and Africa and you see the 
actions we have taken related to th
e reorganizing our bottling structure to 
even better suit the growth potential and opportunities there in both 
Indonesia, the fourth most top of the nation in the world as well as the very 
dynamic one plus billion consumers in Africa.
 
Bryan Spillane
 
And ju
st 
--
 

contingencies for that type of volatility built into the 2015 plan to 
--
 
maybe 

 
Muhtar Kent
 
Yes and I think when you look at LRP 
or non
-
alcoholic ready to drink 
beverages, Brian I think what you would see probably is maybe a hundred 
basis points less growth versus the sort of previous years. It's again 
anybody's guess as to how quickly some of those economies are going to 
come back.
 
So that we have definitely all those contingencies built in and 
maybe I can refer to Ahmet to give you a few more sort of snapshots of the 
world in terms of micro and macro picture. Ahmet?
 
Ahmet Bozer
 
Thanks, Muhtar. Brian, the only thing I would add to M
uhtar's calculation is 
that volatility sort of comes on top of sort of slowdown. But what's working 
for us is that we're getting more and more traction on our plans and 
programs working with our bottlers. I was in about four, five different 
countries over 
the last couple of weeks and even though we witness 
economic volatility or uncertainty even in Northern Europe, yes there is 
quantitative easing, yes there is lower oil prices but it is uncertain yet 
whether the consumer will really benefit from that. But 
even within that our 
plans that address the right pricing and packaging and the right level of 
media investment and our alignment with our bottling system is giving us 
confidence that we could actually weather this volatility in line with the 
guidance that
 
has been provided.
 
So couple of bright spots too, I was in India probably one country where 
there is a lot of optimism inside the country in terms of economic 
development. And as you know we have an incredible momentum in India 
over the last seven or eigh
t years especially last year. And our plans 
continue to build on each other from year to year, so that's pretty. I was in 
Brazil, again a similar story. After the elections there was come cautious 
optimism and that sort of caution side of that continues th
ere is still a bit of 
optimism. But we do continue to deliver our results despite that environment 
as you know Brazil had a mid
-
single digit growth at the end of the quarter. 
Yes, it was cycling better numbers from last year. But we've also had very 
strong
 
share gains in Brazil. So I would say that is our story, there is 
volatility on top of a slowdown but we do have traction with our plans and 
programs in the marketplace with close alignment with our bottlers.
 
Muhtar Kent
 
Bryan one last thing I want to add
 
to what Ahmet said and what I had said 

marketing. And the answer is absolutely yes, when we are able to target our 
investments in media and the way we're doing it, segmenting them by
 
the 
different countries and the different regions of the world and improving not 

main important factors that we see driving a better revenue number 
--
 
a 
better price mix number. So
 

really want to 
--
 
so gain in share improving on the top line through all the 
actions we're taking of which targeted media increased an improved quality 
media is one of those.
 
Bryan Spillane
 
Alright thank you 
for that look forward seeing you next down at Cagney.
 
Operator
 
Our next question is from Judy Hong from Goldman Sachs.
 
Judy Hong
 
So I guess my question is really relating to the strong price mix that you 
saw in North America in the quarter. Obviously you'v
e been focused on 
getting mix impact and rational pricing can you just speak to how much of 
the improvement was mix driven as opposed to maybe cycling some of the 
height and promotional environment last year. And as you think about 2015 
and beyond just thi
nking about some of the mix acceleration potential on the 
pricing spot in North America.
 
Muhtar Kent
 
I'll let Irial answer that question and then also Sandy will add labor to that 
too.
 
Irial Finan
 
I think the most important things are 12 quarters ago Sandy
 
and I spoke on 
this topic and we iterated our belief in having balanced price mix volume 
growth in North America. And we delivered another epic quarter this year 
and our plan is to deliver again next year in the same way. But in terms of 
your question on 
mix and headline price it's a balanced approach. Yes in the 
fourth quarter last year we were trending some lower numbers when we had 
some heavy promotional activity, but when you look over the half year as 
Muhtar said we grew pricing 4%. So we feel very go
od about the actions 

more importantly we're feeling very good that our marketing and our 
execution are coming together in a way that really adds incremental value to 
our system. But 
I'll ask Sandy to add to that.
 
Sandy Douglas
 
As Irial said it's a consistent strategy and the strategy is born of where the 
consumer wanted to go. The consumer is buying smaller special packages of 
our Sparkling beverage brand and accelerating that purchas
e and we're 

coupled with the disciplined approach to rate and volume. Because in the 
end what we're trying to do is expand the values and usefulness of our 
brand and create value for o
ur customers and through the consistent 
execution of that strategy we're seeing in 2014 solid year, but a year of 
improving performance through the year and we'll continue to pursue that 
disciplined strategy in 2015.
 
Judy Hong
 
Got it okay and Kathy if can 
just have a quick follow up on just in terms of 
the commodities in 2015, what have you locked in, in terms of your 
exposure there. And as you think about different commodity complexes that 
are turning more favorable. How much of that could we expect to see
 
drive 
some of that margin improvement, particularly markets like North America?
 
Kathy Waller
 
The commodities environment for 2015, commodities we expect really to be 
benign for 
--
 
there are some that are absolutely favorable. But then we have 
other challe
nges and depending on the amount in North America, but of that 
in North America we also have impact of secondary exchange embedded into 
our commodity. So we really anticipated being more of a benign commodity 
environment for us versus they have any signifi
cant impact or benefits from 
it.
 
Operator
 
Our next question is from John Faucher from JPMC.
 
John Faucher
 
Wanted to follow a little bit on Muhtar on your comment on Europe and 
obviously it's been a difficult market over the past couple of years. What's 
the 
right way to think about sort of glide pass getting back to growth there? 
Is it something where QE works and we start to see the economy come 
back, you think you can get back to consistent growth and what are some 
realistic sort of ranges of expectations f
or 2015 and potentially into 2016? 
Thanks.
 
Muhtar Kent
 
Yes well I think we're all going to watch what's happening with the quantities 
easing, John, in Europe 18 months of the planned amount 60 billion and 
month of Euros coming kicking in whether that 
will have an impact or not we 
will watch and see. I think stability is the key word for Europe as we go into 
2015.
 
So, not getting much worst and I think in some areas continued volatility 
and South Europe is going to continue to be, certainly to be a chal
lenge. So, 
I don't think there is going to be suddenly a lifting of the cloud for the 
consumers in the Southern belt of Europe, I think Germany is the very low, 
-
-
 
current exchange rate I think will help exporting countries for sure, how 
soon will that tri
ckle in related to Germany, related to other export markets 
from Europe. But that's a positive; the quantitative easing is a positive.
 
The notion that most consumers now are used to this environment and feel 
that it's not going to get much worse, it may ge
t a little better because of 

be challenged and then you've got of course the whole political environment 
to sort of basically weave into the equation, that political environmen
t is 
something that is an unknown for us all. I think that's how I would see, as 
far as growth, yes, there will be pockets of growth in Europe and there will 
be continued pockets of challenges but I think what we see was our 
--
 
we've 
very strong plans in p
lace with our bottling partners for growth in Europe 
and we'll see how 
--
 
we've all kinds of contingencies built into the plan in 
Europe also and we're going to take it quarter
-
by
-
quarter.
 
John Faucher
 
Great, thanks and if I can ask one follow up to Kathy.
 
Kathy, you talked 
about your FX coverage on translational for '15, obviously what this can lead 

manage what could potentially be some FX headwind there as the hedges 
roll
-
off? Tha
nks.
 
Kathy Waller
 
Yes, so John, for 2016 we are also hedged on our major currencies and at 
this point also have some on other currencies as well. So, we'll manage the 
impact and we're at pretty good rates at this point with that hedging. So, 
basically we d
on't think that there is a relative issue at this point.

Thank you, our next question is from Steve Powers from UBS.
 
Steve Powers
 
Hey, thanks, good morning. I guess one quicker clarification question and a 
slightly more thematic one. First, obviou
sly there are lot of moving parts 
driving pricing mix in the quarter globally, and I was wondering if you could 
just focus in on rate increases and talk about trend there because my guess 
is that rate lagged overall price mix in North America which you tal
ked about 
but Europe, the volume [best] looks like in Latin America and then rate was 
probably stronger than price mix and Eurasia, Africa, Pacific and across the 
whole company, so any help there would be great just parsing our overall 
rate trend. And then
 
more broadly, it sounds like your productivity targets 
remain unchanged from last fall, which isn't really surprising as it's only 
been a few months, but at the same time we've already seen 
announcements of headcount reductions that likely we're not envis
ioned 


absorbed by the macro headwinds, so if you can clarify that, that would be 
great.
 
Muhtar Kent
 
Steve, this
 
is Muhtar, good morning again. As far as the rate versus mix I 
think it's basically completely depended on the country and the environment 
and the region. So there is no trend globally, this is on average, this much 
rate and this much 
--
 
it all depends on
 
price tag channel architecture, our 
position in the market, the strength of our brand, how effective is our 
marketing driving the result that we need, which is all work in progress. So, 
I think it all depends on 
--
 
and I'll let Sandy comment on the United
 
States, 
on that but it's very much dependent on the region and depended on the 
country and depended on the circumstances.
 
I think that's really what I would say and then Sandy, you want to just 
address the United States part of that question?
 
Sandy Dougla
s
 
Sure, I mean our strategy in the U.S. is again as Irial sad very consistent. 
We view there to be a significant upside pricing opportunity in the Sparkling 
beverage category. We are driving that with significant investments in brand 
building and execution
 
of price package architecture that will expand 
margins for our system and also for our customers and that involves a very 
healthy rate program but at the same time, we're executing with 
tremendous amount of energy, multiple proprietary and other small 
pac
kages that the consumer is buying at accelerating rates, I mean for 
example mini Cans increased by 15% in the fourth quarter and that's 
following the consumer to smaller packaged sizes of the brands they love 
and that combination of rate and mix is creatin
g a good balance with volume 
to healthy top
-
line growth picture.
 
Muhtar Kent
 
And see just on your question on why 
--
 
what on productivity, I would say to 
you that they reorg and how we're flattening the organization and the 
number of 
--
 
and announced cuts 
were all part of the program 
--
 
totally part 
of the program. So there is nothing that just being executed and that's all. 
And as Kathy 
--
 
we standby what Kathy said in the modeling call in 
December we're on track with the 500 plus million dollars piece of 
the 
productivity program for 2015 and we're on track with that. So but just to 
emphasize all of what you see, what you hear, what you read was part of 
the program.
 
Steve Powers
 
Okay. So just two points of clarification just a follow
-
up on those answers, 
th
ank you very much. On the price mix I guess maybe just Kathy 
--
 
specifically to Eurasia, Africa where I am assuming great pricing in Russia for 
example is quite positive should we be expecting this negative mix trend to 
persist in '15, this is one pop on p
ricing. And then Muhtar to your point on 
the part of the plan, does that mean the headcount reductions for example 
that were announced, was that part of the original $1 billion or is that part of 
the additional $2 billion that was announced last call? Than
ks.
 
Muhtar Kent
 
Just quickly on the last piece of your question, it was part of the additional 2 
billion and then as far as the rate increases I will defer it to Ahmet, if you 
want to just refer to that part of the question.
 
Ahmet Bozer
 
On the markets like
 
EAG we price in line with inflation, we may be slightly 
below inflation, slightly ahead at times, so you should expect to see 
consistent rate increase more or less in that range. Fourth quarter for EAG 
was a bit of an anomaly, there was a sort of geograph
ic mix impact that was 
driven by cycling of Galland shipment. So if you look at full year price mix 

any conclusion.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question is from Ali Dibadj from 
Bernstein.
 
Ali Dibadj
 
So, given the pressure that currency is placing and kind of all this macro 
volatility. Do you anticipate or can you actually accelerate anything around 
your cost cutting plans to offset this or do you plan taking even more pricing 
in 
places like Europe, Eurasia, Africa, or Asia
-
Pacific where does it not look 
like you are offsetting your currency moves as much?
 
Muhtar Kent
 

really critical that we balance the needs in the marketplace and the needs 
for us to be healthy in the marketplace on a both medium and long
-
term 
basis that's why we hold accou
ntable all our business unit President's for 
local currency. And I think that, we're very happy with our progress so far 
with what we're doing with our productivity initiatives and what the current 
results are for those productivity initiatives so far, ear
ly days. But we 
certainly are looking to do more where it makes sense. But one thing you 
will not see us is taking 
--
 
basically actions in the marketplace that weakens 
our position for the medium and long
-
term that's the critical piece that I 
want to stres
s.
 
Ali Dibadj
 

at a negative pressure. And if you can answer that also in the context of the 
benign mix of commodities in 2015 and if that's a limit on your ability to 
take pricing
 
again to offset FX in the bottle price
 
context?
 
Muhtar Kent
 
I think we work with all the different levers that are available to us. How our 
better marketing 
--
more marketing is working driving results, how the 
investments are working, with that we're putt
ing in the marketplace with our 
bottling partners, our basic brand strength in the marketplace all of those 
things. And especially in terms of commodities, again that's something that 
is very volatile in the world that we live in. Four or five months ago i
f 

believed this. So I think everything is changing very rapidly and we are 
remaining flexible on what we can achieve to the best of our ability, both in 
pricing, both in terms of i
nvesting for the future as well as making sure that 
our investments are targeted and our segmentation works. So I think there 
is not one solution, the segmentation is really driving better results than we 
have anticipated when we put that program into plac
e.
 
Ali Dibadj
 
Okay. So I am just trying to understand, so we could anticipate if the 
consumer is ready to do it and if the segmentation suggest, we could see 
more pricing align with inflation because of currencies being so negative. Is 
that kind of 

 
Muhtar Kent
 
Ali I'll just leave to what I said.
 
Operator
 
Our next question is from Mark Swartzberg from Stifel Financials.
 
Mark Swartzberg
 
Just a quick one Kathy a technical question, the six additional days in the 
first quarter, is the
re some level to get back later in the year. Do we see 
reverse of that in the fourth quarter for example?
 
Kathy Waller
 
Based on our corporate calendar the six additional days get pushed into the 
first quarter. But they come out in the fourth quarter.
 
Mark 
Swartzberg
 

 
Operator
 
Our next question is from Bill Schmidt from Deutsche Bank.
 
Bill Schmidt
 
Wanted to ask sort of a housekeeping question. Can you just tell us what the 
pricing would have been in Latin Amer
ica if you were at SICAD II for this 
year and last?
 
Muhtar Kent
 
I think what we talked about is oil pricing in terms of the local currency we 
pick. So whether we re
-
measured that in SICAD I or II it will be the same 
number.
 
Bill Schmidt
 
Okay I was just try

just for modeling for next year I think there was sort of Venezuela anomaly 
this quarter that might have taken that pricing down next year.
 
Kathy Waller
 
So for next year the impact of share 
pricing law will continue in Venezuela. 
That is what actually impacts our revenue in Venezuela, so its caps our 
ability to take revenue that does continue obviously it's kind of cost 
--
 
that 
are over in 2015. But it will not be a structural item because we
 
[indiscernible] as of the second quarter. But then 
--
 
yes we also do have an 
impact to our revenues from a different exchange rate and that will be 
considered into currency.
 
Bill Schmidt
 
And then just on Asia Pacific we came in a little bit late then our 
expectations. And I think it's one of the lowest volumes outcomes in while 
and in you prepared comments it seems like you're fairly safe about that 
segment. So was there an anomaly this quarter that took the volume a little 
bit softer and the price mix of 
negative and other is a mix element there. 
But any comments on that would be very much appreciate.
 
Ahmet Bozer
 
Hey Bill, this is Ahmet. I'll try and address that; one big thing was the timing 

hout 
saying that the market in China specially the food and beverage market has 
been weakest in the last 10 years. But I would also say that we've been 
consistently applying our strategy that we have covered with you guys 
number of times before. And result
ing in fairly significant share gains in 
China and as you know in Japan and in the middle of last year there was 
increase in taxes and we're continuing to see the effect of that. But still 

So 
--
 
but the 
biggest item there was the timing of the Chinese New Year as well as 
continued sort of industry headwinds in China.
 
Bill Schmidt
 
And just one quick last one if I could. Just too kind of gauge the progress of 
the productivity program is it goo
d metric to look at the cooperate and 
allocated line in the segment data. So should that come down as kind of the 
restructuring savings come through?
 
Kathy Waller
 
The cooperate on allocated line. So yes that is one place where you will be 
able to see the r
estructuring come through, but as Muhtar said we are on 
track with everything that we have announced to date.
 
Operator
 
Now I would like to turn the call back to Muhtar Kent for closing remark.
 
Muhtar Kent
 
Thank you Kathy, Ahmet, Sandy and Tim. In summary, 

to regionalize revenue growth while simultaneously driving cost out of our 
business during an aggressive productivity plan. While we've already made 
progress against our five strategic actions to regain our momentum we're 
just beginnin
g 2015 will be a transition year as we rewire our operating 
model for growth and mix in uncertain global consumer environment. While 
the macroeconomic environment remains challenging in the near term we 
are confident in our ability to return to sustainable
 
growth as the long term 
dynamics of our industry remain promising. Our brands and our global 
system are unparalleled and we are fully dedicated to strengthening our 
position as the world's leading beverage company. As always we thank you 
for your interest
, your investment in our company and for joining us this 
morning.

Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
Thank you, Tim, and good morning, everyone.
 
Eighteen months ago, I communicated a clear five
-
point plan to reinvigorate 
our growth and increa
se profitability. In February, we reported a successful 
transition year in 2015, where we made tangible progress on our plan and 
delivered the full
-
year expectations we laid out.
 
I'm pleased to report that in the quarter, the first quarter of 2016, we took
 
another positive step in the macro environment that continues to be 
challenging. Today, I will touch briefly on a few key highlights in the quarter 
before handing off to James to provide a more detailed review of our 
operational performance.
 
We're in the 
midst of transforming The Coca
-
Cola Company to one that is 
even more focused on our core value creation model of building and 
supporting strong brands, enhancing customer value and leading our 
franchise system. During the first quarter, our continued focus
 
on our five 
strategic initiatives enabled us to gain value share and deliver positive top
-
line growth with underlying margin expansion. With the first quarter behind 
us, we see the challenging global environment continuing, but we remain 
committed to our 
full
-
year targets we laid out in February for both the top 
and bottom
-
line performance.
 
From a highlights perspective, we continued to execute our strategic 
initiatives. In the first quarter, we unveiled our new global one brand 
marketing strategy for Trad
emark Coca
-
Cola under the Taste the Feeling 
campaign, which is elevating system engagement with our employees, 
bottling partners and customers. The initial consumer response is 
encouraging and positive.
 
Additionally, we added to our portfolio of fast
-
growi
ng still beverages. We 
closed our Chinese plant
-
based protein acquisition of Culiangwang in March. 
We also invested in Chi, the leading juice and value
-
added dairy company in 
Nigeria, Africa's largest economy. Both transactions are further proof points 
of 
how we are strengthening our leading stills position, effectively 
responding to evolving consumer preferences.
 
Finally, we are accelerating our global refranchising efforts. In North 
America, we continued to make progress against our stated goal of 
refranc
hising 100% of our bottling operations by the end of 2017. Including 
the territories announced this morning, we have transferred or signed 
agreements on almost two
-
thirds of the U.S. territories we originally 
acquired from CCE.
 
Looking outside of North Ame
rica to Western Europe, our Coca
-
Cola 
European Partner's transaction remains on track to close by the end of the 
second quarter. In Africa, the regulatory approval process continues. The 
South Africa Competition Commission has recommended for the Competiti
on 
Tribunal to approve the Cola
-
Cola Beverages Africa merger with certain 
conditions. The Tribunal is set to meet in May to review the pending 
transaction.
 
In summary, we recognize that we still have much work to do, but we have 
defined a clear path to tra
nsform the company and we're making consistent 
progress to create long
-
term value for our shareowners. The Coca
-
Cola 
Company is becoming stronger, more efficient and more focused on our core 
strengths of marketing and brand
-
building, customer value creatio
n and 
leading our franchise bottling system. We're making progress implementing 
our disciplined global revenue growth management strategy.
 
We're also building new growth opportunities with still and sparkling brands 
that we develop internally, we acquire f
rom the outside and we invest in 
through partnerships. And our franchise bottling system is also getting 
strong, faster, more nimble and more closely aligned. In short, my 
colleagues and I are getting up every single day with a fresh passion for 
doing the 
things that will create long
-
term sustainable value.
 
I'll now hand the call over to James, who's going to provide you with a more 
detailed look at our operating performance in the first quarter.
 
James Quincey 
-
 
President & Chief Operating Officer
 
Thank you
, Muhtar, and good morning, everyone. From an industry 
perspective, we gained global value share in NARTD beverages in the 
quarter, with increases in both sparkling and still beverages worldwide. We 
gained value share in all but one of the subcategories in
 
stills, where there, 
we maintained value share. We delivered 2% unit case volume growth. Our 
solid performance in many of our developed markets was partially offset by 
challenges in emerging markets suffering from the worst of the macro 
slowdown. This had
 
a disproportionate effect on sparkling volume growth, as 
the non
-
alcoholic beverage industry in many of these markets is more 
weighted towards sparkling beverages.
 
Consolidated price/mix grew 1%, cycling 3%. Our solid underlying pricing 
was partially offs
et by one point of segment mix. We accelerated our 
price/mix across every operating segment, except Asia Pacific, versus the 
first quarter lap. Given the geographic footprint of our own Bottling 
Investments Group, our consolidated price/mix was lower.
 
Given the scale of our pending refranchising, as you consider the 
sustainability of our disciplined pricing strategy, I think it's helpful to exclude 
BIG and focus instead on our core business, which delivered two points of 
global price realization.
 
Result
s were also impacted by one less day in our fiscal quarter compared to 
the same period last year, which reduced organic revenue growth by roughly 
one point. As a result, we delivered 2% organic revenue growth, including 
one point headwind from one less day
. In the quarter, structurally adjusted 
comparable currency neutral income before tax grew a solid 9%, with the 
underlying margin expansion reflecting our focus on productivity, as well as 
the timing of operating expenses. Notably, this expansion occurred 
alongside 
the continued growth in our marketing investments.
 
Now, to describe more clearly our operating performance, let me briefly 
describe our results in three groupings of our markets. First, in markets 
where our strategies are in place and being execu
ted fairly well, we are 
seeing strong results. This cluster is led by North America, Latin America, 
also includes Japan and India. Here, strong marketing, disciplined revenue 
management and improving execution are driving results.
 
For example, specifically
 
in North America, we delivered: 2% organic 
revenue growth, with one less day; three points of price realization, led by 
3% sparkling price/mix and good operating leverage in the quarter. North 
America also grew value share again this quarter, and continue
d to 
successfully implement its accelerated refranchising program.
 
Latin America delivered double
-
digit organic revenue growth, due to a strong 
focus on consumer and customer segmentation, despite worsening 
conditions in Brazil, Venezuela and Argentina. In
 
Mexico, brand investments, 
including new products, such as Del Valle Nada (9:57), a sparkling fruit 
drink, as well as Ciel mineral water and Ciel flavored water, helped increase 
unit volume by 5%, with growth across all major categories.
 
Our Japan busines
s unit had a very strong start to the year, supported by 
several recent innovations, such as I LOHAS Peach, an extension of our 
premium water brand, and our premium priced Georgia Coffee bottle/can. 
We also leveraged innovation from China, launching Lemon+
C, which has 
seen strong early results. These hit products enabled our value share to 
outperform volume share, as they skew to higher revenue, single
-
serve 
packaging.
 
And finally, India; here, we delivered strong performance in the quarter, due 
to the rapi
d scaling of a new price/pack architecture across sparkling and 
juice segments, coupled with brand marketing and execution efforts. In 
addition, we expanded our still beverage portfolio in India with the launch of 
VIO, our latest value
-
added dairy beverage
.
 
These positive results give us confidence our strategies are working. While 
we are making progress in these markets, we also recognize there's more 
work to be done, and the opportunity for improvement in these good 
performing markets continues to be sign
ificant.
 
The second group is comprised of markets where we are taking action to 
positively transform our business for the future. Here, I would include 
Europe, where we continue to make progress to the establishment of our 
newly
-
integrated Western European
 
bottler. And here, several key markets 
performed very well, led by Spain, up 3%; Germany, up 1%; and in the 
Central and Southern European business unit, we grew volume 2%. We look 
forward to improving performance in Europe as the year progresses.
 
A second
 
transition market is our African business, where we are taking 
steps to strengthen our bottling business through the creation of new Coca
-
Cola Beverages Africa bottler. As Muhtar mentioned, we are also taking 
steps to diversify our brand portfolio through
 
our investment in Chi. And we 
continue to improve our execution in key markets on the Continent, as 
exemplified by improving performance in South Africa and Nigeria, where we 
grew unit case volume 7% and 13%, respectively.
 
There's a final bunch of markets
 
where we face clear macro headwinds in 
2016. Russia and Brazil continue to be challenging. China's transition to a 
consumer
-
led economy is putting pressure on commodity
-
dependent 
emerging and developing markets. The lower oil price continues to weigh on 
t
he Middle East and other oil
-
driven economies. And while Argentina is 
taking the right steps to secure its economic recovery, short
-
term results are 
challenging.
 
So let me refer to a few of these markets. In China, we are adjusting our 
plans to reflect the
se realities. China's macro environment was challenging 
in 2015, and that continued to be so in the first quarter. While the economic 
slowdown is not new, the degree to which the NARTD industry was impacted 
this past quarter was worse than expected. Key su
ccess factors going 
forward require focusing on both affordability and premiumization through 
segmented growth strategies.
 
The more premium segments continued to grow in China, as consumers who 
purchase these products are relatively insulated from broader 
economic 
issues. We are working to increase our premium offerings, like sleek cans 
and Schweppes+C, in high value channels. At the same time, however, we 
continue to evolve our price/pack architecture to deliver affordable options in 
both single
-
serve and 
multi
-
serve packages to ensure we can capture key 
occasions and recruit new consumers. While the top line has been 
challenging, our initiatives have enabled us to gain both value and volume 
share in China in the quarter.
 
Turning to Brazil, here, we are seg
menting our price/pack architecture to 
provide packages at key affordable price points while delivering and driving 
pricing to cover inflation. This strategy enabled us to gain volume share 
during the quarter. And finally, in Russia, we gained value share,
 
driven by 
good marketing and promotional activities, with a focus on premium 
sparkling beverages and juice.
 
Given the volatility in these markets, we are proactively managing our 
investments, keeping an eye towards the long term, but ensuring our near
-
ter
m investments have the right payback.
 
The challenging macro environment is also a key reason why productivity is 
critical. We remain on track to deliver more than $600 million in productivity 
savings this year, enabling us to fund our brand and growth inve
stments 
while covering cost inflation and driving margin expansion. We are delivering 
these savings through a disciplined process that involves our entire 
leadership team and associates. Ultimately, it's about building a culture that 
is focused on getting 
better every day, whilst also improving the employee 
experience. This quarter, the results of our ongoing efforts were evident in 
supporting the underlying strong operating margin expansion.
 
Before I hand over to Kathy, let me conclude by saying we are res
olutely 
focused on evolving our growth strategies and transforming our business to 
deliver sustainable shareholder value. With the challenges around the world, 
we will focus on what we can control in order to deliver solid revenue growth 
and strong underly
ing operating margin expansion through the effective 
management of our portfolio, price/mix and productivity efforts.
 
So with that, I'll turn the call over to Kathy.
 
Kathy N. Waller 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
 
Thank you, James, and
 
good morning, everyone. I'd like to touch upon a few 
areas of our financial performance in the quarter before providing our full
-
year outlook.
 
Starting at the top line, as James mentioned, our 2% organic revenue 
growth was impacted by one less day in the 
quarter as well as by our 
segment mix, as our Bottling Investments Group grew at a slightly slower 
rate than our core business.
 
Let me take a moment to explain what we mean by segment mix and why 
the impact will be more pronounced in 2016 and 2017 until we
 
have finished 
our previously
-
announced refranchising actions.
 
Starting in the first quarter, we revised our operating segments so that our 
company
-
owned bottling operations in North America are now reported 
within our Bottling Investments Group. This grea
tly increases the relative 
size of the Bottling segment to the rest of our geographic segments. Since 
our bottling operations earn significantly higher revenues per case than 
concentrate operations, slower growth among our company
-
owned bottling 
operations
 
results in negative pressure on our consolidated price/mix, 
regardless of the underlying pricing in either the bottling operations or our 
core business. However, due to the relatively lower profitability of a bottling 
business, slower growth among our bot
tling operations has an opposite 
effect on our consolidated margins.
 
At gross profit, our comparable margin declined, as we were impacted by 
currency headwinds, the effects from North America refranchising and the 
sale of our legacy energy brands to Monste
r. Excluding the year
-
over
-
year 
effect of these items, we would have seen gross margin expansion driven by 
a benign cost environment, benefits from productivity and segment mix. As 
you think about the downhill, keep in mind that the cost environment 
become
s more difficult to cycle in the second quarter and beyond, due to the 
timing of when commodity prices eased last year.
 
Our comparable operating margin improved about 25 basis points on a 
consolidated basis. Similar to gross margin, currency headwinds, the
 
North 
America refranchising and the sale of our legacy energy brands to Monster 
impacted our operating margins. Comparable currency neutral operating 
margins increased 140 basis points in the quarter. Excluding these effects, 
we achieved strong operating 
leverage in the quarter, driven by the benefits 
of our productivity initiatives, the timing of certain expenses and segment 
mix.
 
Looking at our productivity initiatives, the first quarter benefited from the 
timing of when certain productivity initiatives w
ere implemented last year. 
For example, the majority of the head count reductions began in April, with 
Europe's implementation closer to the mid
-
year. So the associated expense 
savings began in the second quarter. As you think about the remainder of 
this y
ear, while we expect solid currency neutral ex
-
structural operating 
leverage, we expect some of these drivers to moderate as we begin to cycle 
more difficult comparisons. This was reflected in our previously
-
provided 
full
-
year guidance.
 
Let me stop here an
d touch briefly on an ongoing structural impact to 
provide additional clarity based on some of the questions I have received 
from you. At CAGNY, we noted that by the time we complete our 
refranchising, we will see significant increases in both gross and op
erating 
margins. While that is the case, I want to remind you that until we begin to 
increase the transfer of our production operations in North America, the 
existing refranchising of the distribution business actually has a dilutive 
effect to both gross a
nd operating margins. Given that we do not expect the 
sale of production assets to significantly increase until 2017, our margins will 
continue to be affected by this dynamic this year.
 
Moving to cash flow, we generated $1.1 billion in cash from operations
 
before making a nearly $0.5 billion contribution to our pension plans. 
Looking ahead to the remainder of the year, we expect our cash flow growth 
rate to be more in line with our earnings growth rate. For 2016, we 
increased our annual dividend by 6% to $1
.40 per share, our 54th 
consecutive annual dividend increase. Our net share repurchases during the 
quarter totaled approximately $150 million. For the full year, we expect to 
achieve the $2 billion to $2.5 billion range that we communicated during our 
last
 
earnings call.
 
Turning to outlook, the first quarter reflected more challenging operating 
environments in markets like China and Brazil. We see that our strategies 
are working, however, in key markets like North America, Japan and India. 
Further, our 
strategies allow us to scenario plan to adjust to market 
dynamics. Therefore, we are maintaining our currency neutral outlook we 
previously provided; however, we are updating the expected impact from 
currency. We expect organic revenue growth of 4% to 5% a
nd comparable 
currency neutral EPS growth of 4% to 6%, inclusive of a three to four point 
structural headwind to income before tax.
 
Moving to currencies, while current spot rates have improved since our 
fourth quarter call, these rates have been extremely 
volatile as well. 
Therefore, I will caveat our currency outlook, knowing that it is definitely 
subject to change. We will update you accordingly as we move through the 
year.
 
Based on current spot rates, hedging activity and what we are cycling, we 
now expe
ct the full year impact of currency to be a two to three point 
headwind on net revenue versus our previous expectation of four points. 
Relative to income before tax, we now expect an eight to nine point 
headwind as compared to our previous expectation of a
 
nine point headwind.
 
As you model the second quarter, there are a couple of items to consider. 
We expect the net impact of acquisitions, divestitures and other structural 
items to be a two to three point headwind on net revenue and a three point 
headwind 
on income before tax. Based on current spot rates, hedging 
activity and what we are cycling, we expect that currency will be a two to 
three point headwind on net revenue and a six point headwind on operating 
income. In addition, we will be cycling the euro
 
debt remeasurement gain we 
recorded in other income during the second quarter of 2015. For this reason, 
we expect an 11 point currency headwind on income before tax as we cycle 
this gain.
 
In closing, we are working diligently to deliver our commitments fo
r 2016. 
We continue to focus on our core capabilities of building brands, driving 
customer value and leading the system so that when we complete our 
refranchising, we will be a lower risk, higher return business with even 
greater confidence to achieve our 
long
-
term growth targets.
 
Operator, we are now ready for questions.
 
Question

and

Thank you. We will now begin the question
-
and

answer session. Our first 
question is from John Faucher of JPMorgan. Your line is now open.

John A. Faucher

JPMorgan Securities LLC
 
Morning.
 
So as I look at your revenue performance this quarter, I guess it 
highlights a concern that maybe the portfolio is still a little too CSD heavy, 
despite some of the great results on the non
-
carb side. And James talked 
about this at CAGNY, 5% NARTD dollar 
growth longer
-
term, but given the 
fact that you guys still under
-
index on the non
-
carb side, that's providing 
really the majority of the growth in both dollars and volume for the 
category, don't you need to, I guess, further accelerate the shift in the 
por
tfolio away from CSDs, sparkling, into non
-
carb, and is there a way to 
move that faster? And I guess on top of that, obviously the weakness in the 
CSD side this quarter with flat volumes, what do you think is really the right 
volume number on the CSD side 
going forward that gets you to your 
algorithm? Thank you.
 
Ahmet Muhtar Kent 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
Hi, John. It's Muhtar here. I'll just preface just by saying the following and 
then pass over to James, but first, you know how much we've done
 
and how 
much we focus on creating successful brands in our still portfolio. And of the 
20 $1 billion brands we have now, 14 of them are still brands. And our still 
business is performing well.
 
And whether we take value
-
added dairy or enhanced hydration, o
r juices 
and nectars, or juice drinks, we play in all of those categories. In 2015, we 
gained share in all of those categories. And if you look at whether it's in 
developed markets or emerging or developing, our still beverage portfolio is 
being enhanced a
ll the time and even in the case of waters and premium 
waters from Japan all the way through to Latin America, performing very 
well.
 
You just heard now again that we've invested. We just recently invested, as 
you know, in Suja in the United States. We've i
nvested in Chi and 
Culiangwang in China. And we continue to always reference that, wherever 
we look and if there's opportunities for bolt
-
on acquisitions, we will look at 
those favorably. If there are also opportunities for organic development of 
brands, l
ike fairlife, we will certainly look at those also favorably, as we've 
done.
 
So I think we're very satisfied with our portfolio. And certainly, we've got 
more work to do, as we said in the call and in the remarks. But right now, 
we feel that our portfolio 
is being transformed very well, and transitioned 
very well. And we're in a pretty good place, and more work to continue. 
James?
 
James Quincey 
-
 
President & Chief Operating Officer
 
Yeah, just let me add one last thought perhaps, John. At CAGNY, we talked 
ab
out, we have a 50% share of sparkling and a 15% share of the stills, but I 
think it's worth remembering that, over the last 15 years, we've gone from 
stills being less, a single digit part of our portfolio, to now over 25% of our 
portfolio. So I think ther
e's a long
-
term track record of generating growth 
and value in stills. Even given today our market position, we expect to 
continue to grow faster in stills. As we said in the call, we are gaining share 
in every subcategory, apart from one where we held it,
 
and we'll continue to 
look for bolt
-
on acquisitions to accelerate our growth. So I think it's going to 
continue to be a faster growing part of the business.
 
Ahmet Muhtar Kent 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
And also, just on sparkling, you asked, we 
certainly see also continued 
growth opportunities in our sparkling portfolio. And that is naturally, with the 
focus on revenues, it will skew more towards revenues, but certainly also, as 
we have demonstrated and with our new campaign, Taste the Feeling 
ca
mpaign, just being launched, and everything else that we're doing in 
terms of the investments with our aligned partners, we see growth 
opportunities in revenue and also in volume, in our sparkling beverage 
portfolio.

Maybe sticking with the top line, I just want to better understand where you 
expect to source top
-
line acceleration from over the remainder of the year, 
against a difficult macro environment and inc
reasingly difficult year
-
over
-
year compares? I get that you were probably closer to 4% organic growth 
this quarter, excluding the calendar shift and the price/mix drag of BIG, but 
BIG will be with you over the balance of the year. So in that context, is th
ere 
truly enough in your control to have confidence in sequential improvement, 
or are you expecting the macros to improve? And I guess, alongside all that, 
is it fair to say that you're guiding us more towards the lower end of 4% to 
5% at this point, versu
s the midpoint?
 
Ahmet Muhtar Kent 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
Hi, Steve. It's Muhtar. Well, first, I think we did expect the first quarter to 
trend slightly below the full year, driven by a couple of things. One, the 
macros are trending toward the
 
bottom in the first quarter, recognizing that 
the environment continues to be challenging. But we will continue to monitor 
that closely. The launch of our new campaign in the first quarter will 
certainly benefit the back half of the year. The benefit of O
lympics marketing 
as we move into the second and third quarter; one less selling day, which 
certainly you also mentioned; and I think we are confident, definitely, in the 
strategy and initiatives in place to support our growth targets over the 
course of th
e year, and believe that we will land again in the corridor that we 
stated in the past, in February. James or Kathy, you want to add anything?

Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Question on North America, we now have 
the filings you've given u
s and we can, therefore, see the level of 
profitability here in CCR, which is pretty low. I think, when you back out the 
numbers, you get kind of like a 2% operating margin. And I'm sure there's 
some accounting matters in there that this isn't the forum to
 
go into, but it 
does raise the question of what really has been going on in terms of 
profitability for CCR here in North America. If you think it's appropriate, I 
think it would be helpful to talk a little bit about the trends in that business 
as you've s
een them, now that we're seeing a level 

 
the margin I'm getting 
is a 2% operating margin. So can you just talk a little bit about the trends 
and what you think they reflect? It certainly speaks well to what you get left 
behind, if you will, but it raises 
questions about what someone might pay for 
that kind of business.
 
Kathy N. Waller

Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
 
So sure, Mark. We look at the margins and CCR, there are three primary 
drivers of what you're seeing. First of all, we ha
ve shifted some of the 
territories, so we have transitioned some territories to
-
date. And we did 
that, obviously, before we put the financials out there earlier this quarter. 
Then if you remember, we incurred, back in early 2010, 2011, 2012 time 
period, th
ere was a significant hit to us from a run
-
up in commodity prices 
that certainly adversely impacted margins. And then I guess the third thing 
I'd say was we had to incur incremental costs to prepare that business for 
now being ready to be refranchised and 
to strengthen that business. And I 
think what we are seeing is improvement in the results that I would say 
today. But those three things really are impacting what you saw in the 
financials that we put out there.

Hi. Good morning, everyone. I just wanted to go back and tie, I guess, a 
couple of comments that have been made about the effect that BIG had on 
o
rganic sales growth for the quarter. So I just want to make sure I 
understand it correctly. If we look at sales excluding BIG and we add back 
the effect of the extra day, organic sales growth was around 4%. Is that 
correct?

Thank you. Good morning. So I guess one of the markets where you pointed 
out you were taking more actions is Europe, and certainly, from a top line 
perspective, continues to be a pret
ty challenged market, deflationary 
pressure there. So wanted to just get a little bit more color, just really what 
are some of the more tangible actions that we can see? And how much 
dollars are really going in in terms of the marketing investments that we
 
should expect to see some of that improvement really coming through and 
how long that would sort of take as you think about for the balance of the 
year?
 
James Quincey 
-
 
President & Chief Operating Officer
 
Yeah, Judy. It's James here. A couple of things on
 
Europe, one, it is worth 
noting that in this quarter, there was a disruption to the business in GB due 
to the supply chain. So there's a one
-
off impact that we expect to see not 
recurring in the balance of the year. So I think that's worth taking into 
acc
ount. And it was a material impact.
 
Now, as looking for the rest of the year, you will see in the numbers we had 
pretty decent price/mix in Europe in this quarter. And we are also looking to 
see volume improving versus the first (34:40) quarter, not just b
ecause of 
the supply situation, but also the new programs, the launch of the new 
marketing campaign, the launch of a new Coke Zero variant starting in GB, 
plus the Europe Cup, which will be in France this year. And, of course, 
shortly, we will hopefully co
mplete Coca
-
Cola European Partners, where 
there are very strong plans being put in place to drive that forward. So I 
think some temporary factors and the buildup of our ongoing investments 
should drive a better result in Europe in the balance of the year.

Hi. Good morning. I wanted to delve a bit more into the Asia Pacific pricing 
number in the quarter, a negati
ve 5%. Can you run through how much of 
that was due to geographic or product mix or other factors and thoughts 
going forward in the remainder of the year on if that pricing pressure will 
moderate and how mix should trend in that segment?
 
James Quincey 
-
 
Pr
esident & Chief Operating Officer
 
Sure, James here. I'll come to the numerical piece. Let me start off with the 
conceptual. (35:54) The Asia Pacific price/mix is always a little bit of an 
oddity, because it's a group that brings together Japan and Australi
a, which 
are very high revenue markets that don't grow as quickly, along with a lot of 
emerging markets, not just China but India, Indonesia and the Philippines, 
which grow much faster. So there's a kind of an ongoing mechanical effect 
that creates a negat
ive price/mix for this group, which you can see over the 
years in Asia Pacific. So in 2013, full year, it was minus 4%. In 2014, it was 
minus 2%. In 2015, it was minus 2%. In the first quarter of 2016, 
obviously, it was minus 5%, but it was cycling a very 
atypical plus 3% in the 
first quarter of last year. So I think what you will see is in the future 
quarters, it is a little volatile and bumpy, but the long
-
term trend is for a 
negative price/mix in Asia because of the dynamic of the fast growth of the 
emer
ging markets versus Japan and Australia.

Thank you. Our next question is from Ali Dibadj of Bernstein. Your line is

Ali Dibadj

Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC
 
Hey, guys. So I'm still getting a lot of skepticism from investors about the 
4% to 5% organic revenue growth target for the year. And openly, you don't 
sound 100% confident and it feels like there's a lot of kind of messiness and 
moving parts. So can you try again? Can you talk about what specifically 
you're seeing right now that g
ives you confidence in the 4% to 5% organic 
sales growth for the year? I mean, clearly, whether it's a 3% or a 4%, you 
kind of delivered a 3% in some sense this quarter, so you're below pace, so 
maybe in that you can tackle where you expect Eurasia Africa 
to get to, why 
you'd expect it to get better. Europe, you mentioned you're going to invest 
more and you hope that to get better, but we've sometimes heard that 
before. So why is it going be better in Europe?
 
And then, maybe as a jumping off point as well, 
you can talk about what 
you're learning in North America, because that seems to be doing better, for 
sure. And a footnote, I'm not quite sure what you grow organically North 
America because you want us to add three points back for concentrate sales 
up to u
nit case sales for one day missing. I'm not quite sure how to get 
there, so some explanation there would be great. But just more specifics 
very clearly on what gives you the confidence in your top
-
line target for the 
year. Thanks.
 
Ahmet Muhtar Kent

Chair
man & Chief Executive Officer
 
Ali, I'll start just by saying, as I indicated, first, on the core, with one less 
selling day and on the core price/mix of the core business without BIG, we 
certainly did get to the 4% in this quarter. So what we feel looking 
at the 
downhill comparisons and looking at also all the programs in place, looking 
at how our business performs in all the different quarters and different 
groups, we feel confident that we still will achieve what we have said in 
February in terms of the t
op line for the full year.
 
The marketing program, the additional marketing, the new marketing 
program, that is just being launched and then not having the one less selling 
day and then also the continued franchising and all the programs that the 
bottlers h
ave in place. So our U.S. business is performing very well with its 
revenue growth, with its price/mix, with its brand, with its portfolio and that 
will continue. We have every confidence that it will continue.
 
And we do believe that macros are at the bott
om and that there will be in 
the second half a certain degree of improvement in the macros. Or even if 
they stay the same, we feel confident with the current macro situation that 
we will get to the corridor that we have indicated and shared with you in 
Feb
ruary. Any other comments, James, Kathy?
 
James Quincey 
-
 
President & Chief Operating Officer
 
No, I think the one thing I would add, Ali, is obviously there's a strong 
momentum in the North America business. We called that out as the place 
where the 
strategies are working. And then the other countries I put in the 
other two buckets, there's degrees of implementation of the strategy. So 
you can go to around the world, there were places which were struggling in 
2014 and maybe even in 2015, and as we've 
been executing the strategy, 
the momentum is starting to come back to some of those countries and it's 
starting to build over time.
 
So I think, as Muhtar said, the first quarter was kind of within the envelope 
of expectation for our guidance. And we can se
e, based on what we're doing 
within our control, within a reasonable scenario of macros, we will stay 
within that corridor for the rest of the year, but in the end, I guess, only 
results will answer the question.

Thanks. The refranchising that you announced today includes a creation of a 
new bottler from outside the industry. You've spoken a lot about the 
collective willingness of your existing bottlers to invest and a desire for more 
territories. So can you help us understand why you went outside of the 
existing system for this refranchising? And is there something you're seeing 
from other new bottlers tha
t makes this more appealing to you guys?
 
Ahmet Muhtar Kent

Yeah. I think on that, predominantly, we have existing bottlers that are 
expanding, if you look at the percentages of territories that have been 
franchised. And
 
then we have, in order to ensure that we can get the right 
level of diversity in our bottling business and the right level of also 
representation, we have also selected some new partners like in Florida, like 
in Chicago and like now the most recent one an
nounced. And we feel that 
that is a healthy mix and that that's also a healthy balance. And we have, 
very much, the right approach and the right alignment with our expanding 
bottling partners, whether they are just entering our system or they are 
proven ex
panding bottlers, like the ones that we've mostly franchised new 
distribution to in the past year.

Yeah. Certainly, Bill. So really, the gross margin decline is
 
really impacted by 
just two things really. It's currency and it's the structural impact. Currency, I 
think added like 80 basis points 

 
would have added 80 basis points back to 
our gross margin and the structural impact actually would have added 
significa
ntly more than that. So it's really as simple as that. It's really about 
currency and our structural adjustments.

Kevin Grundy

Jefferies LLC
 
Thanks. Good morni
ng. So question, how much slip
-
down in the top line in 
the quarter was macro slowing in the NARTD category versus execution? You 
spoke to share gains in both stills and sparklings, so it would certainly seem 
to be just broader slowing in the category. And 
then, of course, there's been 
a lot of discussion on the top line. It would seem like the lower end of your 
4% to 5% organic sales outlook would be prudent at this point. So a follow
-
up question on that, how much visibility do you have on productivity and 
other levers to deliver the high end of the EPS growth guidance range, 
should you come in toward the lower end on the top line? Thank you.
 
James Quincey 
-
 
President & Chief Operating Officer
 
Let me take a bite of that, Kevin. I think the answer on the slow
down, we 
don't get all the category numbers necessarily. And but clearly, as we're 
gaining share in that top
-
line number, there's got to be some weakness in 
the category versus the long
-
term target of 5%. I think we talked a little bit 
about that at CAGNY 
about how our expectations for 2016 and 2017 were 
below the long
-
term 5% dollar value for NARTD. So there's definitely some 
of that. And I think you can see the macros influencing the industry in the 
sense that it's the number of the emerging markets, part
icularly the 
commodity ones, where we've had the slowdown, and that's clearly flowing 
through into the industry.
 
I think what I would highlight is, we're going to focus on what we can 
control. We have a long
-
standing game plan of what to do in countries th
at 
are in crisis, focusing on really gaining a lot of share, to set ourselves up 
profitably for the long term. It's worked in a lot of countries in the past, and 
it seems to be working now as we gain share in the Chinas and the Russias 
and the Brazils. It'
ll pay off in the end. I think the visibility, look, we're 
managing to our corridors at the top and the bottom line. We feel that this 
quarter was within the envelope. Clearly the macros, slightly better, slightly 
worse, will be an influence on where we en
d up. But we've got a lot of 
management left to do in the balance of the year.

expectations for that, and maybe what you've learned as you've tested it 
out? And I say that just 

 
I understand it's certainly going to be more 
efficient from an a
dvertising, marketing front to kind of, on the one brand 
strategy, but didn't know if you expected a sales lift, or if there's been any 
confusion from consumers as they've seen it, just kind of thoughts as we

Yeah, Bill, this is Muhtar. We said from the beginning, first, that the new

of the one brand strategy, and that it's got many advantages. And we expe
ct 
it to give us significant efficiencies and effectiveness. But also, in terms of 
how we communicate with our consumers, it will certainly play into that as 
we execute the strategy. And we've now launched the new campaign. And 
then I'll let James comment 
in terms of, you asked the Mexico
-
specific 
example, but also, there's also many other places where it's being tested, 
and tested favorably. Go ahead, James.
 
James Quincey 
-
 
President & Chief Operating Officer
 
Yeah, Bill, a few thoughts. One, the initial pi
lot markets, the two sources of 
very clear impact were, one, it helped us expand and grow the zero calorie 
variant of Coca
-
Cola by driving availability and driving trial. So we would 
expect to see benefits on the zero sugar variants. The second big area of
 
benefit is, it helps us create what we would call corporate blocking. In other 
words, we execute in stores all the variants of Coca
-
Cola together as one big 
block, has a much greater store impact, visual impact, engagement with 
people who are shopping the
 
stores.
 
I think slightly more strategically, and back to Muhtar's point, this is an 
implementation of a strategic idea. I'm sure we'll evolve it. I'm sure we'll 
make it better, but it's the strategic idea that's important. It's not just about 
the efficien
cy in the advertising. It's about helping consumers join and stay 
in the Coca
-
Cola franchise, whatever of the ingredients they want to 
manage, including their management of added sugars, whether that's in 
drinks or any other categories that have added suga
r in. So this has a 
number of benefits that are going to play out strategically, and we will keep 
improving the execution.

James, I ju
st wanted to, as we look to the rest of the year and 2017 as well, 
can you also talk about the progress of the small pack architecture? Like, 
we've heard a lot about that in North America, but if you can give us a little 
bit more detail as, where are we wi
th that in rest of your divisions? And is 
that a source of incremental growth or price/mix as we go forward?
 
James Quincey 
-
 
President & Chief Operating Officer
 
Yes. A few thoughts then. Clearly, North America has had a lot of traction in 
pushing forward s
maller packages, away from the traditional two
-
liter and 
multi
-
pack of cans. It is worth noting that some of those packages are 
premium packages, and some of those are intended to create affordability or 
low price point entry points for the category, wheth
er it be the mini cans. 
And that combination does generally help price/mix. You can see that 
starting to roll out across other parts of the world.
 
I think Latin America's traditionally been very good at that. You do see more 
of it coming in to Asia Pacific
 
and Eurasia on a global basis. The immediate 
consumption packages outpaced general volume growth. So it is part of our 
strategy to push more into smaller packages.
 
Just this last month, India launched a new technology, a very small package 
with a special 
technology that allows a much longer shelf life in ambient 
environment of rural India, so it will be able to get to many more places.
 
So, a lot of innovation in the technology, a lot of innovation in the package, 
in the sizes and the occasions and the chan
nels, so that we can bring down 
the price points for affordability, take advantage of premiumization, and also 
offer people the right amount of any beverage that they want to actually 
consume.
 
Amit Sharma

BMO Capital Markets (United States)

Ahmet Muhtar Kent

One point I'd just add, Amit, would be that the U.S. compared to the rest of 
the world, the prevalence of small packages was much less in the United 
States three, four years ago compared to the rest of
 
the world. If you look at 
Europe and places like Spain, or if you look at many countries in Latin 
America, you had much more prevalence of smaller packages than in the 
United States.
 
So in a way, the United States in the last four, five years, but particu
larly 
the last two and a half years has moved very rapidly to the 12
-
ounce glass 
to the 8
-
ounce glass to the 7.5
-
ounce can to the 8.5
-
ounce aluminum bottle. 
And that has really worked and those are all growing double digits in the 
United States because the
 
consumer and customer preferences, and also 
benefiting our system because they have a higher price per liter. And so 
that's in a way playing out from what was already prevailing in many parts 
of the world in the past.

I was hoping we could talk a little bit more about the health of brand Coca

brand family 
or Trademark Coca
-
Cola in a number of geographies. And while 
I appreciate that you have a lot of new initiatives, between Taste the Feeling 
and new packaging. In the past, you guys have said that it does take time 
for some of those advertising initiatives 
to actually gain traction and show up 
in brand health and volume. So how should we think about the trajectory of 
Trademark Coca
-
Cola as you roll out these new initiatives, please? Thank 
you.
 
James Quincey 
-
 
President & Chief Operating Officer
 
Yeah, Vivien,
 
I think a couple of things. One, obviously most of our 
campaigns are weighted into the second, third and fourth quarters. So those 
are the biggest quarters. And even Taste the Feeling, we announced it this 
quarter, but it's only really hitting at towards 
the end of the quarter and 
rolling out in the rest of the year, as with the Euro Cup and the Olympics. So 
I think a lot of the programs are going in later this year. They, obviously, the 
execution is there. So we would expect to see better performance from
 
Trademark Coca
-
Cola going into the downhill.
 
I would make one other note, which is the relative change in where global 
growth is coming from, or industry growth is coming from, a little more in 
developed and developing, a little less in emerging, tends to
 
create a kind of 
a portfolio effect that weighs a little more against sparkling and, therefore, 
Coca
-
Cola, because those emerging markets tend to be more sparkling 
orientated. And so you see North America, Latin America, Japan, with 
stronger stills growth
. So we do expect to see growth. We would expect to 
see it coming back. There is a geographic mix impact, but when we look at 
the markets, we believe we will be back on track with Coca
-
Cola.

hree years from now, do you think the benefit 
will be 50%

50% between cost savings and efficiency and greater demand

drive trial and availability for Coke Zero? Thank you.
 
Ahmet Muhtar Kent 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
Yeah, Robert, it's Muhtar here. I think, first, in terms of the efficiencies, the 
most important benefit will be simpler and less fragm
ented communication 
with the consumer. That will be the biggest benefit, but also it will certainly 
help create more efficiencies and effectiveness in our non
-
working EME 
(55:32) and, therefore, will also provide some productivity in that respect. 
But the 
most important benefit will certainly be a less cluttered and better 
and more direct communication with the consumer base.
 
And in terms of the trial of product, that will certainly come as a result of 
that, of what James mentioned in terms of better presen
ce in the store, in 
terms of better merchandising, in terms of better interruptions in the store 
and also in terms of the communication piece. And we believe that the most 
important benefit of this will ensue and will come to brands like Coca
-
Cola 
Zero wit
h more availability, better communication and have the broad 
perspective of the global campaign as opposed to the every different brand 
under the Coca
-
Cola trademark having their own campaigns. That will be 
how I think the benefits will come. And we triale
d and pilots so far have 
proven that in Europe and other parts of the world.

Let me now hand the call over to James.
 
James Quincey
 
Thanks, Tim, and good morning, everyone. 2018 we conclu
ded another 
quarter of solid operating performance capping off a successful year. The 
nonalcoholic beverage industry was stronger in 2018 as emerging and 
developing markets accelerated from the prior year while the developed 
world held hits volume trajecto
ry on top of stronger pricing. Our business 
performed well across all key dimensions in 2018 as we leveraged our 
transformation as a total beverage company.
 
Most notably, we gained global value share and those share gains were 
broad based. We held or grew 
value share across each of our geographic 
segments. Organic revenue grew 5% versus our goal of 4% driven by 
strength across all operating segments. Underlying operating income grew 
11% versus our goal of 8% to 9% as we built momentum through the year 
while
 
accelerating the capture of productivity savings. This resulted in an 
approximate 170 basis point expansion in the underlying operating margin. 
And comparable EPS grew 9% in line with our guidance of 8% to 10% 
despite absorbing $600 million in stronger cu
rrency and structural 
headwinds than we anticipated at the beginning of the year.
 
Our results reflect actions taken over the past several years to transform our 
business for long
-
term success. Execution is getting better. We set ourselves 
up for the future
 
with an energized bottling system that is bringing a 
renewed focus on execution around the world and in particular several key 
markets including North America where we have completed our refranchising 
activities.
 
Pricing power is improving. We are deliver
ing accelerated top line growth as 
we continue to implement revenue growth management initiatives in 
markets around the world and marketing is becoming sharper. We are 
focusing on innovation that leverages brand edge and retro building, with 
increased effo
rts to digitally connect with consumers. And we have begun 
embedding a productivity mindset across the organization.
 
Now let's talk specifically about how we drove disciplined growth this past 
year. First, we strengthened our sparkling soft drink portfolio
 
leveraging 
brand edge and innovation to build consumption rituals by offering people 
what they want, when and where they want it. Trademark Coke grew 
volume 2% driven by solid performance in brand Coke and supported by 
innovations such as Coca
-
Cola Plus C
offee and Coke orange juice as well as 
strong growth in our no sugar variants.
 
Coca
-
Cola Zero Sugar delivered yet another year of double
-
digit volume 
growth globally and in North America we reinvigorated Diet Coke with the 
brand growing retail value 3% aft
er multiple years of declines. Very much 
Sprite also performed well growing global volume 2% through premium 
innovations such as Sprite Plus Fiber in China.
 
Second, we rapidly scaled successful brands like Fuze Tea, smartwater and 
AdeZ across more markets.
 
With the launch of Fuze Tea in Europe we 
delivered over 100 million incremental cases in EMEA offsetting the volume 
loss from the dissolution of Beverage Partners Worldwide. This enabled us to 
gain leadership positions within the ready
-
to
-
drink tea catego
ry across 11 
European markets highlighting what an aligned system can accomplish.
 

portfolio, we need to allocate resources to those brand and strategic 
initiatives that are delive
ring the highest returns. To that end, we eliminated 
over 700 underperforming zombie SKUs. By finding ways like this to reduce 
complexity we ensure that our system sales force is focused. Our supply 
chain is efficient and our latest innovations get more sp
ace and visibility at 
the point
-
of
-
sale.
 
Third, we expanded our portfolio through M&A and strategic investments. 
This included smaller investments like BODYARMOR, one of the fastest 
growing beverage trademarks in the U.S. Of course our biggest 
announcement
 
was the acquisition of Costa which we closed on January 03, 
this year. Costa platform will give us the ability to scale within the $500 
billion global hot beverage category and create a world
-
class global coffee 
business allowing us to better serve our cu
stomers and strengthen our 
ready
-
to
-
drink portfolio. All of this shows how we've been pursuing the 
vision we first shared with you a couple of years ago.
 
Now, one of the most important aim of this work is having the right 
leadership team and operating stru
cture in place. In 2018 we appointed a 
President and Chief Operating Officer to bring accelerated focus on execution 
and talent development. We are now in orderly transition for the CFO with 
Kathy' retirement and John's shift from Operations to Finance. We
 
added two 
new Group Presidents with considerable experience and we created a new 
group, Global Ventures to ensure we connect and globally scale key 
acquisitions, investments and partnerships like Costa Coffee and Monster. 
The changes we made are significa
nt and they help set us up for more 
success in the years to come across our geographies.
 
Looking around the world we are already delivering better performance in 
key markets. In EMEA we grew organic revenues 7% delivering a second 
sequential year of accele
rated top line growth. We accomplished this in part 
due to revenue growth management initiatives that focus on small baskets 
and pack sizes. These were phased into multiple markets over the years. As 
we continue to build all these actions in 2019 we expect
 
continued group 
performance.
 
In Asia Pacific good results across several large emerging markets drove our 
strongest organic revenue growth in over five years. We had a stronger 
innovation pipeline, solid digital initiatives and steadily improving executio
n 
by our bottling partners. For example, in India, 25% of our revenue growth 
came from new products. And in China, digital initiatives coupled with a 
robust innovation pipeline resulted in solid performance. During the fourth 
quarter our B2C business capit
alized on Singles Day, the massive online 
shopping holiday. Both our digital B2C and B2B businesses grew over 40% 
for the year and now account for over 5% of the system revenues in the 
market. And collectively across the group, our bottling system opened 
a
pproximately 1 million new customer outlets.
 
Turning to Latin America, we delivered 11% organic revenue growth for the 
year as we continued to execute against the fundamentals amidst varying 
macro environments in argentina. The economy tipped into recessio
n in the 
back half of 2018, so we adjusted quickly our plan to maintain affordability 
and protect our consumer base. In Mexico, our business continued to 
perform well amidst a volatile backdrop and in Brazil the operating 
environment became more certain af
ter the elections with turnaround of our 
business there is taking hold and our strategies are driving improved 
performance.
 
Finally, in North America we continue to deliver strong performance in the 
marketplace and gain value share supported by a stronger,
 
fully refranchised 
bottling system. During the year we undertook a significant package resizing 
initiative across our chilled juice and tea portfolios and implemented pricing 
actions across our sparking soft drink portfolio to mange through a 
challenging 
cost environment while adding over $1 billion in incremental 
retail value to our customers for the brands the Coke system sells. Due to 
the strength of our brands and increased investments from our independent 
bottling partners, we were able to capture pri
ce mix in the marketplace while 
beating historical elasticity.
 
So, lots of activity across our various regions. Overall, there is a consistent 
thread in what's driving better results across our territories. We 
strengthened our brands including Coca
-
Cola th
rough strategic innovation 
and more disciplined ritual building. And our bottling partners have increased 
investments and improved execution and together we are aligned with the 
system on how to capture the growth opportunities before us.
 
Before moving on 
to 2019, let me provide some context on the fourth 
quarter. We continue to grow global organic revenues 5%. The composition 
of the growth changed. We delivered stronger sequential price mix while unit 
case volume was flat. Volume was impacted by slowing ec
onomic conditions 
in some countries like Argentina, plus decisions to focus on value of our 
volume in certain margins. However, we have seen a good start to 2019 
with more balance to volume and price mix and this is consistent with our 
expectation for the 
full year.
 
Looking ahead, we're seeing the impact of some increasing uncertainty and 
volatility in global macroeconomic conditions. Consumers are under more 
pressure as we head into the New Year. However, demand for our categories 
remained healthy and our 
business is built to perform even if the tailwinds 
behind us moderate somewhat. Ultimately we will focus on what we can 
control taking steps to manage the business as we become a total beverage 
company.
 
Further lifting, shifting and scaling entrée brands l
ike Fuze Tea, smartwater 
and Innocent across markets, reformulating products to reduce sugar levels, 
rolling out revenue growth initiatives across additional territories to improve 
performance within our sparkling soft drink portfolio, connecting costs acr
oss 
many of our business units build a leading global coffee business and 
leveraging digitization to build a business for the future. Therefore, we feel 
confident that we can deliver against our 2019 guidance.
 
Finally, I'd like to thank Kathy. Kathy has 
made significant contributions to 
our company, our systems and our people, working her way from financial 
analyst all the way to the most senior finance role in the company, truly a 
testament to the value she has brought through every phase of the journey.
 
As CFO, she has steered the company's financials through an extremely 
complex refranchising process and she is leaving a strong foundation for 
John to build upon. Finally, she has been a critical partner to me and I 
appreciate all of her valuable support.
 
With that, let me turn it over to Kathy.
 
Kathy Waller
 
Thank you, James and good morning everyone. During my time as CFO, I've 
met personally with many people who are on the call this morning, from 
analysts who follow our industry to investors in our compa
ny and many of 
our associates and partners that I know are listening this morning. I thank 
each and every one of you and many others for your help, whether it was in 
the form of guidance, support, plotting or accounting. Each encounter helped 
me to be a be
tter CFO and a better representative of this company that I 
love.
 
Effective March 15, I retire after 30 plus years at the Coca
-
Cola Company. 
From the very beginning with my start in accounting research I've had 
amazing opportunities to learn and grow and e
ventually become a leader in 
the company. I am very proud to have been a part of this company and this 
system.
 
Coca
-
Cola is about experiences and making lives better for everyone who 
touches our system, from the smallest shop or kiosk owner to the largest 
customer, those who simply enjoy drinking our products. It has been my 
privilege to be a part of this extraordinary business and it would be my 
pleasure to watch Coca
-
Cola continue to grow and evolve under the 
leadership of James, Brian, John and the rest 
of the leadership team. Along 
with the hard work and support of the 700,000 people who are taking this 
symptoms into the future.
 
And with that, I will hand this call over to the future. I'll let John take it from 
here.
 
John Murphy
 
Thank you, Kathy. You've 
been a great partner over the years and you leave 
behind a tremendous legacy. My congratulations to you on our retirement 
and my appreciation as well for your many contributions over the years to 
the company and especially to many people in the company.
 
No
w I look forward to partnering with James and Brian to drive the business 
going forward, and before I begin, let me just take a moment to talk about 
my key priorities going into this role. Number one, will be rise, healthy top 
line growth leveraging our ex
panding portfolio. Number two will be to 
improve margins in all our operating segments. Number three will be to 
optimize our balance sheet and allocate capital in a disciplined manner to 
our highest return activities. Number four, will be to drive a cultur
e of agility 
and productivity across the enterprise. And number five will be to develop 
our people and build the capabilities that we need in the company going 
forward. Ultimately, I will be looking to push our enterprise to find 
opportunities to sustainab
ly maximize free cash flow and returns.
 
Turning to our financial performance, as James said, 2018 was a good year. 
We delivered 9% comparable EPS growth due to momentum in the 
underlying business, accelerated productivity, and a favorable tax rate. Our 
pre
ss release covered our fourth quarter results in detail so I will focus on 
our 2019 guidance. At our high level we expect 4% organic revenue growth, 
double
-
digit comparable currency neutral operating income growth, 
comparable EPS to range from plus 1% to m
inus 1%, and free cash flow of 
at least $6 billion.
 
Now, let me touch on the key considerations and assumptions embedded in 
our outlook. We expect global growth to be slightly lower than in 2018 with 
continued growth in the developed world and macroeconomi
c challenges in 
certain emerging markets. However, there is a significant amount of 
uncertainty and geopolitical tension which could result in further changes in 
this macro environment.
 
That said, we focus on the things we can control and the actions we've
 
taken 
over the past few years has set us up for continued success despite shifting 
macros. We expect organic revenue growth to benefit from our continued 
focus on lifting, shifting, and scaling products such as good quality of sugar 
and Fuze Tea, as well 
as implementing revenue growth management 
activities across lower markets. In addition to the solid organic growth we 
expect an 8 to 9 point benefit to revenue from net M&A and structural 
activity.
 
We completed our North American franchising efforts and di
vested our 
company owned bottlers in Uruguay and Guatemala last year. We also took 
full ownership of our Philippines bottler in the fourth quarter. And earlier this 
year we closed the acquisitions of both Costa Coffee and the remaining stake 
in Chi, Africa
's leading value
-
added dairy and juice company. We expect the 
net effect of these transactions to result in lower comparable gross margins 
for the year driven by the Philippines bottling operations.
 
In the U.S. while freight costs are expected to remain ab
ove historical levels, 
we do not expect to see the same level of year
-
over
-
year increases as we 
saw last year. And we have $600 million remaining in growth productivity to 
capture in 2019. A portion of these savings will be reinvested in the 
business. Rece
nt investments are generating a good return as evidenced by 
our strong top line relative to most CPG peers.
 
So all in, we expect solid pricing, a continued focus on expense 
management, and a net benefit from acquisitions to deliver 10% to 11% 
comparable cu
rrency neutral operating income growth. We expect currency 
to be at 6% to 7% headwind to operating income as we faced strength in 
dollar and cycle hedging gains in 2018. Below the line we expect the 
leverage driven by higher net interest expense and we exp
ect an effective 
tax rate of 19.5%. However, this rate could vary from quarter to quarter.
 
So in summary, we expect double
-
digit, comparable, currency neutral 
operating income growth, but the impact of currency along with higher 
interest and taxes will lea
d to the standard range of plus 1% to minus 1% or 
comparable EPS growth in 2019. As you model the flow of the year there are 
a few items to consider in terms of phasing. The first quarter will have one 
less day than in 2018.
 
Easter will fall in the second 
quarter this year compared to the first quarter 
last year. Due to the timing of fed rate increases the year
-
over
-
year increase 
in interest expense will be more heavily skewed to the first half of 2019 than 
the back half. And similarly because of when the d
ollar strengthened last 
year we expect a more significant currency headwind in early 2019 which 
will then begin to moderate as we move through the year.
 
As James said, we created a new operating group, Global Ventures. This will 
be a new reporting segment 
in 2019 and will include Costa Coffee, 
[indiscernible] tea, Innocent and Monster. As such we will provide the 
revised operating segment financial information reflecting this change before 
first quarter results are released. There are times our company can 
be 
complex to model. For example our M&A and structural changes impact 
several of our operating segments this year. Our investor relations team will 
hold a call at 10:30 this morning to answer any further questions as you 
build out your models for the year
.
 
So in summary, we delivered against our EPS guidance in 2018 amidst 
stronger headwinds than anticipated at the beginning of the year. We 
maintained a disciplined approach to the use of capital and we are well 
positioned to capture growth opportunities as
 
we enter 2019.
 
Operator, we are now ready for questions.

Operator
 
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Bryan 
Spillane with Bank of America. Your line is now open.
 
Bryan Spillane
 
Hey, good morning eve
ryone.
 
James Quincey
 
Good morning, Bryan.
 
Bryan Spillane
 
And Kathy, just to get in one more time, just congratulations on a great 
career and wish you all the best as you move on.
 
Kathy Waller
 
Thank you, Bryan.
 
Bryan Spillane
 
So I guess James, just my 
one question is really around EPS guidance this 
year being flat and I think previously we've talked before about kind of a 
commitment to dollar EPS growth. So I guess one is that's still sort of a 
commitment going forward, but more importantly maybe could 
you maybe 
talk about some of the considerations? I understand the currency headwinds 
being a big part of it this year, but just what other trade
-
offs you might have 
made in terms of what you are choosing to invest this year versus maybe 
dropping more to th
e bottom line?
 
James Quincey
 
Sure, good morning Bryan. Firstly, the whole idea of the in a way the three
-
legged stool is still absolutely valid and important and just to recap what I 
meant by that. This is a business that predominantly wins all those, but 
our 
focus is on wining in the local marketplaces. We focus on getting the 
consumers and growing customer value in each and every country and so 
there is very much a focus on getting that to work and I think over the last 
few years you've seen accelerated p
erformance of us able to drive the 
industry grow and capture share within that and that's a starting point of 
value creation for the Coke company to work on that and making sure the 
operating margins of how we do that are all the same or better, such that 
we turn that revenue growth into profit growth at the local level.
 
And then as you said we have in more recent years had a more intense 
focus on making sure that sum of the parts is more than just the sum of the 
parts and the lever is necessary to turn tha
t into U.S. dollar EPS earnings 
after a number of years where currency had eroded that and the EPS had 
effectively declined. That's still our going in objective.
 
The guidance is where we stand today, it's a really strong operating plan for 
2019. I think we
 
are being cautious about the macroeconomics and how 
that's going to be a little softer than 2018, but a strong plan behind the 
marketing, the execution and innovation. And absolutely we are reflecting 
here in our guidance where currency and interest rates
 
and tax sit today 
which are the three in a way non
-
controllable factors. There is a long way to 
the end of the year and they could change markedly. But our focus will 
remain and our mission will remain to end the year with positive EPS 
growth. We would be
 

share with you where things stand today and we will focus on pulling the 
levers that we can pull to get to the result that we want.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. And our next question comes from Lauren Lieberman 
with 
Barclays. Your line is now open.
 
Lauren Lieberman
 
Great, thank you, good morning.
 
James Quincey
 
Good morning, Lauren.
 
Lauren Lieberman
 
Hey, I was hoping you guys could talk a little bit about North America this 
quarter. So the flat organic sales growt
h looks pretty different than what 
we'd seen in the Nielsen data. So I think a big question would be kind of 
what drove that gap and if you could give us any updates specific to North 
America outlook I think everyone is worried about is you had a resurgenc
e 
set of competitors, is that driving an impact or even how you're planning for 
that as you look into 2019? Thanks.
 
James Quincey
 
Sure, yes, we were a little softer in the fourth quarter in North America and I 
think part of that is we took the medium price
 
increase going into the 

 
or in 
the middle of the summer and it took a while for it to flow all the way 
through to the consumers. That's a really 

 
I think it was more fully in the 
marketplace by the end of the summer and obviously then coming into the 
fo
urth quarter. So I think you saw a little of the effect of the price increase 
more actually in the fourth quarter than in the third quarter when the 
system was taking it and I think that kind of combined with a little bit of 
consumer outlook malaise in tha
t period of time, so a little softening of the 
volume.
 
But then it started to pick up and so we started the year well, this year in 
terms of North America volume and price mix was also continued to be 
positive through the back of the year. I know it's only
 
comes through as 2% 
in the fourth quarter for North America. There remain 
-
 
this carries with it 
some of the oddities of which business system was growing because the 
juice business which is finished goods business where we were rightsizing 
the packaging 
and seeing volumes go down, obviously finished goods versus 
the sparkling which is concentrate and it has that mechanical effect that the 
faster the sparkling business grows the more it actually affects mix in a 
negative way, but that does not affect profi
ts and it does not affect the 
marketplace.
 
So there's a little bit of mix and the freight and all the noise, but let's draw a 
line because the good news is 2018 has ended. The freight accounting issue 
is disappeared for 2019. The marketplace pricing is cle
ar and positive going 
into 2019 and the businesses started with a foot forward and so we are 
confident we have the right strategy for North America and that we will see 
the benefits of that strategy flowing more simply and more clearly through 
the results 
in 2019.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. And our next question comes from Judy Hong with Goldman 
Sachs. Your line is now open.
 
Judy Hong
 
Thank you, good morning.
 
James Quincey
 
Good morning, Judy.
 
John Murphy
 
Good morning.
 
Judy Hong
 
And Kathy, again 
congratulations from my end as well. I guess James, just 
your comment about good start to the year, was that specific to North 
America as you alluded to the prior question? And then as you kind of think 
about the comment about increased volatility in the g
lobal macro 
environment maybe you can talk a little bit about some of the key markets 
where, some of that concerns persist and how much is that sort of factored 
into that 4% organic revenue guidance? Thanks.
 
James Quincey
 
Sure, my comment about good start 
to the year was both about North 
America and globally. We have started the year only six weeks. It's a long 
year, but the 

 
what is good is it started off well in terms of volume and 
therefore we see ourselves start the year with a good balance of volume 
g
rowth and price mix that is very consistent with having a balanced 
contribution to driving the top line guidance and as I said, North America is 
good.
 
We have seen to have had a good Chinese New Year. You never quite really 
know until the end of February, 
but it seems like it has been a strong Chine 
New Year. Brazil is looking a little better. Mexico seemed to have started 
well given some cold weather at the back end of last year.
 
You heard about the European outlook today this morning. So we think we 
start
ed well, a long year to go, great plans. Also that will need managing no 
doubt and the volatility, so we baked in what we know today. Clearly there 
are places where weakness is apparent. Argentina went down quite strongly 
in the fourth quarter and that's l
ikely to continue in the first half of this year. 
Turkey, very similarly, some parts of the Middle East.
 
We've baked in what we see and what we believe is likely to be the softening 
of the global macro outlook and in the countries which are more apparent. 
Clearly the visibility is more apparent in the first half of the year than the 
second half. Hopefully the world will turn a little and the second half will 
improve and that will certainly help us reap even more benefits from our 
strong plan. But that's kin
d of where we stand today.

I think you may have missed the memo on 
lowering 2019 expectations. So 
we are all kind of thinking Pepsi would do that tomorrow and not Coke 
today. And so I'm a little confused about the drivers of it and if we start with 
top line, you're saying approximately 4%. Not too long ago you insist on 
q
uarter 6% being the right number. Then you have a big gap from that to 
10% to 11% OI which seems aggressive, so a big improvement there.
 
And then I'm still confused about the move from 10% to 11% OI to flat EPS, 
even with FX at I guess, I think it was 6 to
 
7, that does not jive as what 
we're seeing from a currency level today, so you are assuming things are 

know why. So I know you've tried to explain in bits and pieces but there are
 
a lot of moving parts and I want to understand the moving parts. I don't 

understand the drivers of why we're getting so disappointed her both on top 
line and on the EPS? Thanks.
 
Jam
es Quincey
 
Sure. Well I think at the highest level the story is a simple story. We started 
off last year, well obviously we had the long term growth model of 4% to 
6% on the top line. We've been delivering within that range for the last six 
quarters. We ar
e being prudent in our outlook for 2019 given the multiple 
reductions in global economic growth outlook for 2019 and our own 
experience in some of the emerging and developing markets. I think 4 is a 
prudent number.
 
We have a strong plan that's backed up by
 
the marketing, the innovation 
and the execution. So I think we're going to be in great shape on growing, 
continuing to grow the top line and I think that number will end up being at 
the higher end of consumer products companies in terms of revenue growth 
for 2019 in the same way the number for 2018 was at the high end of 
consumer products companies.
 
You're seeing then the benefits of a lot of our actions over the last number 
of years in terms of productivity, in terms of our focus on smaller packages, 
and 
revenue growth, and innovation, and premiumization of our portfolio 
such that we are getting operating leverage. Operating leverage is not just 
driven by productivity, but by better work on the portfolio, and you see that 
flowing through obviously with som
e of the tailwinds from the acquisitions 
and the divestitures. A small piece, so that we're getting excellent leverage 
from our revenue growth into our operating income growth at the 10% to 
11%. Obviously the currency is where it is. That is currencies as 
they stand 
today we're not making a forecast as to what the currencies will be by the 
end of the year.
 
There is a piece of that that we're cycling hedging gains in 2018 as we 
commented earlier. But the number of the 6 to 7 is as things stand today. 
How it 
will stand at the end of the year we will see. And then of course we're 
losing some leverage from operating income. Finally down to EPS through 
the higher tax rates which the Fed has taken through the year and through 
the changes in the tax rates. The inte
rest rates from the Fed and the tax 

So that's pretty straightforward.
 
Clearly that's leading to EPS growth. That is not what we aspire to. We're 
going to focus on controlling wh
at we can control and driving the business. 
We'll be pulling the levers as I talked about earlier on the call to make sure 
we focus on our aspirations of turning our winning local plans into growth of 
dollar EPS. But we want to be prudent in our outlook gu
idance given the 
macro environment, despite a strong good momentum winning plan and to 
put the FX as it stands today. The only thing that is for sure is it will be 
different tomorrow and we will update it as we go through the year.

Thank you. And 
our next question comes from Dara Mohsenian with Morgan 
Stanley.
 
Your line is now open.
 
Dara Mohsenian
 
Hi guys.
 
James Quincey
 
Hi, Dara.
 
Dara Mohsenian
 
So I just wanted to quickly clarify your answer to Bryan's question earlier. I 
understand that 2019 
underlying profit outlook is solid ex
-
items if in fact you 
deliver it. But I think you had intimated before that you were really looking 
to drive earnings growth even in the face of FX pressures. So obviously 
we've talked about 2019 guidance already, but a
s we think about the 
earnings trajectory post 2019 is it more in line with the long term algorithm 
that you guys have outlined plus or minus currency or do you still think 
there's some levers that you can pull over time that even if FX continues to 
be unfa
vorable, you can hit your earnings growth targets? I don't know if 
that will count as my question or not, but first maybe clarify that and if I can 
ask another and you're ready to be generous, go ahead if not move to the 
next person. Thanks.
 
James Quincey
 
Okay, I think it sort of seems all wrapped up in one burst of the same idea. 
We are committed to growing the earnings of the company. I mean, in 
simple terms, the earnings of the company are the fuel to pay the dividends 
of the company and drive the stock 
price and reinvest back in the business. 
So without dollar increased earnings of EPS it is not going to be a growth 
company and therefore we reaffirmed the long term growth model at some 
of our previous investor presentations, the 4 to 6 on revenue and the
 
growth 
in EPS. Yes, there'll be years where currency will weigh on it more heavily. 
We certainly have the aspiration that there will be no negative years.
 
We have said we will not do things that are irrational just to get a positive 
EPS, but we will focus
 
on trying to pull levers to get there. But as you look 
out into the future, we absolutely expect to keep focusing on coming back to 
the long term growth mode. Now, to the question well what happens if the 
dollar always gets stronger? Well, then that simpl
y put assuming that there 
still is a global trading system that will export inflation to the other parts of 
the world. And therefore, if we enter some very long extended period of 
dollar strengthening then we will logically expect to see higher pricing in 
other parts of the world that will compensate for some prolonged ongoing 
strengthening of the dollar. So either way we want to get back to our long 
term growth model in dollars realized for the shareholders.

Thank you. And our next question comes 
from Steve Powers with Deutsche 
Bank. Your line is now open.
 
Steve Powers
 
Thank you very much. Kathy, thank you from me as well, and best wishes 
for the future and John, my congratulations again on the new role. James, 
for USA good job and I'm actually my 
gift to you is I am going to ask Kathy 
and/or John a question, related to the to the free cash flow guidance for next 
year. It implies another year of about two thirds conversion of net income to 
free cash flow which is below the company's 90% plus target.
 
So I'm 
assuming there's still a good number of structural costs flowing through with 
respect to refranchising and the recent acquisitions, but can you help us get 
underneath those dynamics at all and paint a picture of what it will take to 
get back to tha
t or get to that 90% plus conversion ratio on a consistent 
basis and can we can we look to 2020 to be that year of inflection?
 
John Murphy
 
So let me start, for 2019 while your cash from operations is expected to 
increase at least 10% it's going to be large
ly offset by increased CapEx from 
a free cash flow standpoint and that's increased CapEx is primarily due to 
three factors. One is the acquisition of costs and some CapEx related to 
investing for the future there. Secondly, with BIG [ph] taking on the 
Phil
ippines and then thirdly, we have a couple of strategic initiatives in the 
digital arena and in our concentrate business to invest in 2019.
 
As we go forward, we do have a clear line of sight to get to the 90% to 95%. 
One area of focus is going to be to dri
ve greater efficiencies in working 
capital productivity. Secondly, it would be to reduce the cash flow impact 
from the timing of payments of onetime items related to restructuring and 
re
-
franchising. And then finally, we would love to see some of our upfro
nt 
CapEx investments scaling back. So whether it's 2020 or 2021, I think it's 
too early to say, but clearly the focus is to have that number back to the 
95%, so I think we have a very clear line of sight as to how to get there.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. And 
our next question comes from Bonnie Herzog with Wells 
Fargo. Your line is now open.
 
Bonnie Herzog
 
Thank you. Good morning everyone. I wanted to circle back to your top line 
guidance which James you did mention is prudent. So I guess, I was hoping 
you could
 
drill down a little further and give us a sense as to how fast you 
expect your different category questions to grow over the next year and 
then maybe where you see potential for faster growth? I guess I'm just 
trying to understand how we should think abou
t your sparkling cluster 
growth for instance versus some of the other clusters like tea and coffee, 
especially everything that you've done last year and then possibly touch on 
your juice and dairy? Thanks.
 
James Quincey
 
Sure. I think that, well firstly, be
fore I jump into the clusters, I think that 
some of the prudence is being derived from developing and emerging 
markets, whether it 
-
 
that be some of the ones like Argentina or Turkey, 
aforementioned Middle East and some parts of Africa as well. So I think 
the 
prudence on the softening is more geographic based than it is cluster based. 
Having said that, I think we are expecting to see in 2019 continued growth 
of the sparkling category.
 
We've clearly aimed going into the future to see a strategy that is more 
price 
mix than volume in the developed markets and more perhaps volume 
centered in the developing emerging, so as we look out into 2019 I expect 
the sparkling business to continue to grow and I think we'll see a little more 
price mix than volume given some
 
of the things that are happening in the 
developing markets. As we move through some of the other categories, I 
mean clearly coffee is going to grow much faster because of the 
incorporation of posture and as we start to realize that synergy plans. But 
that
's not driving obviously the 4% organic which is like for like so it doesn't 
include the acquisition in that sense.
 
In terms of tea, we're expecting to do better in tea in 2019 than we did in 
2018. 2018 has the kind of base effect of pulling out of the bev
erage 
partners worldwide joint venture which where we counted volume but we 
didn't count revenue, and then obviously that sort of made it very hard to 
cycle the volume in 2018 but made it easier to get the revenue.
 
As we go into 2019 we expect to see conti
nued growth in tea in Fuse and 
leverage Gold Peak in the U.S. which should see a bit more balanced growth. 
In juice will come off the period of the rightsizing of the packaging in North 
America. And so I think we will see a better performance from the juic
e 
business particularly the premium end of the juice business that speculate 
may be part of the world where we will question some of the juice drinks 
and the values that they bring.
 
Obviously in aggregate juice will do better because we'll have the 
incorpo
ration of tea which is a great business in West Africa. But that's not 
part of the organic growth drivers. And then in hydration we'll be focused on 
more of the premium parts of hydration whether it be sports drinks, 
leveraging our partnership with BODYARM
OR, driving things like Topo Chico 
and smartwater or smartwater with its new variants like alkaline.
 
We still may see some backing off of very low value water in some parts of 
the world. So I think you'll see positive results in the in the different cluste
rs 
going forward and I think versus 2018 you're likely to see a continued strong 
picture across the portfolio. I think the places where you would see some, 
places where we would sacrifice some volume would be the lower value end 
of water and juice drinks, 
but otherwise a strong focus across the portfolio 
and balanced growth.

Thank you. And our next question comes from Laurent Grandet with 
Guggenheim. Your line is now open.
 
Laurent Grandet
 
Yes, good morning James, Kathy, and welcome John. 
Kathy, I mean 
congrats on your extremely successful carry out Coke proscenium [ph]. I'd 
like to thank you for helping me head back into the Coke system a few years 
ago. Really a question about Costa, you mentioned at the time of the 
acquisition that Costa 
would be a slightly accretive to earnings in first full 
year, in the current context of the UK economic and political situation and a 
potential hung Brexit looming, did that change?
 
And if you can update us more on the Costa integration and the expansion 
p
lan and specifically we'd like to understand if you are planning to 
refranchise this still 51% fully owned stores? Thank you very much.
 
James Quincey
 
Sure, look on the Costa thing obviously we managed, the team did a great 
job in closing the acquisition we
ll ahead of schedule in January rather than 
April and we're now in the phase of the transition period of really connecting, 
it in a systems sense and also being able to finally sit down with 
management and bring together that kind of base underlying growth
 
plan 
with our views on synergies and acceleration. That's a process that's going 
to take a little bit of time to work through to really validate all those synergy 
plans.
 
Once we got to the end of that process of course we'll be able to come out 
and be mor
e specific about how we see the cost being rolled out against our 
coffee strategy of driving coffee against the pillars using the stores that we 
have as the experience, serving as a provider of a total beverage portfolio in 
foodservice, whether it's beans 
or machines or the vending, selling the 
coffee at the at home and of course the potential for ready
-
to
-
drink. So 
that's the strategy remains clear.
 
We're putting more flesh and detail on the bones of the plans as it rolls out. 
And then of course you know B
rexit will be Brexit. I'm not sure anyone 
knows how it's going to end at this stage. We clearly have contingency plans 
for this business and for our other businesses in the UK and in the European 
environment. It's something that will be have to manage thro
ugh, but it will 
be, whatever it is going to be, it is likely to only be a short term disruption 
effect if indeed it ends up in that scenario and we will manage through it.

I wanted to come back to advertising and marketing levels in the 2019 
outlook and what's embedded in your guidance because as wa
s alluded to 
earlier in the call, the market widely expects higher investment from Pepsi, 
this year likely directed at North America Beverages and we'll find out less 
than 24 hours whether that's true or not. So can you talk about advertising 
and marketing
 

sales, higher as a percent of sales, many companies in CPG will guide on 
that. So I'm not sure if you can comment on it. And then number two to 
that, have you left adequate cushion in your guid
ance should you need to 
react to higher levels of investment spending? Thank you.
 
James Quincey
 
Sure. Look we grew advertising spend in 2018. We expect to grow our 
advertising spend in 2019. Of course, we continue to work on how to drive 
productivity in ou
r non
-
working marketing investments and to leverage our 
scale with our advertising partners and with our property.
 
So we're going to continue to invest in advertising.
 
I think it's also worth saying that we are being even more disciplined as we 
look throug
h the framework of leader, challenger and explorer. Obviously is 
our leader brands which are the brands that make best use of TV 
commercial, advertising spend. As we drive the challenges and the explorer 
brands, there in some other parts of the marketing m
ix that often become a 
more predominant element of making them work.
 
And then, if our competitors are going to increase investment, you know 
what it is going to increase the growth of the categories. Ultimately, if there 
are more competitors investing, it 
drives more market growth. We believe 
that we have strong brands and strong plans. And I think net
-
net it's going 
to be overall beneficial to the industry.

Thank you. And our next question comes from Andrea Teixeira with J.P.

Andrea Teixeira
 
Hello. Hi. So thank you and good morning. Kathy, I wanted again to thank 
you for your leadership and legacy and all the best to you and John in the 
new role. So thank you. So I was hoping if you could revisit the 2020 
operating ma
rgin expansion targets that you outlined at CAGNY last year of 
34% plus. I realize there have been a number of key changes in accounting 
and acquisitions and FX is there, but with the guidance that you have now 
implying operating margins now year
-
on
-
year i
n 2019 and the noise like the 
puts and takes, but how should we think about the reinvestments and other 
moving pieces that relates to the 2020 target?
 
James Quincey
 
Yes, so the 34% target that was outlined is one that was outlined I think at 
the time to 
provide guidance to the refranchising process and today we are 
on track to get to that 34% over the next couple of years. We've had some 
margin expansion over the last couple of years and there's implied margin 
expansion in our 2019 numbers. However, given
 
the fact that we have new 
businesses coming into the mix, I would like to really focus on improving 
margins across all of our different business segments as we go into 2019, 
2020.
 
Maintaining the underlying objective outlined in the 34% margin target, but
 
being a lot more focused on making sure that our core business, our Global 
Ventures business and our BIG business are delivering margin expansion as 
they develop their respective portfolios and businesses.

Thank you. And our next question comes f
rom Robert Ottenstein with 
Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.
 
Robert Ottenstein
 
Great, thank you very much. Over the last year, year and a half or so, 
you've been more assertive on taking price and driving that in North America 
and then in Europe and we 
see some of the results. But I was wondering if 
you could kind of stand back and give us an assessment of what you've 
learned from that change in tactics or strategy if you will. And in terms of 
your brand equity and need to perhaps tweak investment in cer
tain areas, 
your bottler execution in terms of executing on those price increases and 
then obviously kind of the general customer demand suggests you know 
kind of big picture what you've learned from the price initiatives over the 
last year or so? Thank yo
u.
 
James Quincey
 
Sure, Robert. Look, I think the simple conclusion is the following. If we just 
think we can depend on headline rate increases in the absence of other 
everything else then we're very likely to see high elasticity. And therefore 
what we've l
earned and I guess relearned is that it's really important that 
pricing become part of our strategy. A strategy that starts with the right 
brands, the investment behind the brands to build equity with the 
consumers and then to provide the consumers the inn
ovation not just in the 
brands and the product, but also in the packaging that allows pricing to be 
taken sometimes with the headline price, sometimes through mix.
 
And there's the sum of all those pieces backed up by good execution that 
creates the willing
ness of the customer to go with the plan because it 
creates more value for the customers in their stores often the beverage 
industry then grows faster than the average, and so the learning and the 
relearning it's the complex task of pulling all the pieces 
together that earns 
you the opportunity to drive price mix, perhaps ahead of where we had 
been. And I think that's something that we and the bottling partners have 
dedicated ourselves to even more over the last number of years, I think it's 
showing through
 
in some of the headline numbers that you see and we 
absolutely are going to stick to strategy.

James Quincey

John Murphy
 
Good morning.
 
Carlos Laboy
 
James, your Brazil business looked unbelievable last week. Lots of 
innovation and new SKUs, but how do you see beer in Brazil and the 
importance of keeping these Coke bottlers competitive on beer? And while 
on the sub
ject of M&A if you could just give us a quick update on the 
refranchising process in general and the urgency to see through the sale of 
the remaining properties?
 
James Quincey
 
Sure. Well thank you for the feedback on the Brazil business. I'm sure the 
Brazi
l team will be pleased with that. They have had a number of years 
trying very hard to adapt and update the business and bring the affordability 
and the innovation in line with the marketplace. And I think with the 
improvements in the macro conditions in Br
azil that business is starting to 
do a lot better and it's a multi
-
channel business and they distribute the beer 
only in some of those channels. So that's a work in progress as the 
relationship with Heineken is a question.
 
And I think as we see the refranc
hising business or the refranchising 
strategy, we've largely refranchised the world. We're down to just a small 
percentage of the volume. It's been very successful whether it was North 
America, the creation of bottlers like European Partners or the Japan b
ottler. 
And so we think that has been very successful. Clearly, we're still working on 
our beverages Africa, in terms of refranchising started it has obviously been 
slower than anyone would have liked. I think some of that has been process 
and macros relat
ed. We're still working on that one.
 
And that leaves us obviously with the Southeast Asian set of bottlers. 
Obviously, we'll be thinking about what's the right strategic direction for that 
part of the world. But the ongoing, you know curation of refranchis
ing is not 
refranchising for the sake of franchising. It's in the service of creating a 
stronger and more energized bottling system that is aligned set of partners 
with the company to drive our collective business with more growth and with 
better margins i
nto the future and that takes different forms and places and 
of course we allocate capital within the process whether it's owning bottlers 
or having stakes in bottlers. We drive that process with the objective of 
using capital as and when necessary, someti
mes yes, sometimes no, to get 
the most energized bottling system out there and bringing new partners in. 
That's an ongoing management as we curate our remaining bottling 
operations and some of our other investments in bottlers

answer portion of the 
call.
 
I would like to remind everyone that the purpose of this conference is to talk

Tim Leveridge
 
Good morning and thank you for joi
ning us today. I'm here with James 
Quincey, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and John Murphy, our 
Chief Financial Officer.
 
Before we begin, I'd like to inform you that we posted schedules under the 
financial reports and information tab in the Inves

website at www.coca
-

non

executives during this morning's discussion to our results as reported under 
generally ac
cepted accounting principles.
 
I would also like to note that you can find additional materials in the 
Investors section of our company website that provide an analysis of our 
margin structure. In addition, this conference call may contain forward
-
looking s
tatements including statements concerning long
-
term earnings 
objectives and should be considered in conjunction with cautionary 
statements, contained in our earnings release and in the company's most 
recent periodic SEC report.
 
Following prepared remarks t
his morning, we will turn the call over to your 
questions. We recognize there will be a good deal of questions. [Operator 
Instructions]
 
Now, let me turn the call over to James.
 
James Quincey
 
Thanks, Tim and good morning everyone. I'll start by noting that 
we're 
operating in truly extraordinary times, times of great challenges, but also 
times in which we can see many key opportunities ahead. First and 
foremost, on behalf of our company and our entire system, I'd like to share 
our deepest sympathies for all t
hose who have been affected by this global 
pandemic. We also sincerely thank those who've been working to keep all of 
us safe through the crisis, particularly those on the front lines in the health 
care community.
 
I also want to recognize our system associ
ates, who are ensuring we can 
continue to supply beverages all around the world. We're still in the most 
intense first phase of the crisis in many places, if not most of the world. 
Through it all, we remain grounded in our purpose to refresh the world and 
make a difference. We start with employee health and safety which is 
paramount, followed by business continuity and our support of communities 
around the world. The vast majority of our office
-
based employees are 
working remotely.
 
For those associates in o
ur manufacturing and distribution facilities, we're 
using enhanced hygiene and sanitation practices. Through these practices, 
we are ensuring, our system associates are well and our products are safe 
and that they're delivered safely to our customers and c
onsumers. We're 
closely linked with our bottlers on business continuity, which includes 
contingency planning for our global supply chain. And thanks to this hard 
work 
--
 
efforts across the whole system we don't foresee any material 
disruptions at this time
.
 
It's important to note that our business has a long heritage of supporting 
communities in times of need. The Coca
-
Cola system has made significant 
commitments to support relief efforts in markets impacted across the globe. 
Our system is committed to cont
ributing more than $100 million and is 
focused on community relief programs, medical supplies and equipment 
during the outbreak phase, as well as on developing other actions for the 
recovery phase in markets hit hardest by the pandemic. Those commitments 
t
o date include the $40 million charitable grant from the Coca
-
Cola 
Foundation.
 
We are working collaboratively with governments at all levels, federal, state 
and local to help steer the nation and the world towards recovery. We are all 
confident that we can
 
with the communities we proudly call home rebound if 
we all work together for a better future.
 
Now, as we look to the future, we recognize these are truly unprecedented 
times. And for that reason, we will take a different approach to our guidance 
and our 
discussion today. Recognizing that the operating backdrop has 
changed rapidly in the last several weeks, we will spend limited time 
discussing our first quarter results. In addition, given the great uncertainty 
in the current environment, we feel it's prud
ent to hold off providing fiscal 
year 2020 guidance. We expect to come back in our second quarter call in 
July with greater clarity.
 
Today, I'd like to share, one, what we've been learning and observing as the 
situation evolves. Second, the actions we're t
aking now both to adapt to the 
current environment and to best position ourselves for the future. Third, and 
finally what gives me confidence that we will emerge even stronger. And 
lastly, I'll turn it over to John to discuss our financial strategy.
 
The fi
rst quarter began with good momentum coming off strong results in 
2019. We were successfully executing our long
-
term strategy. Through 
February, we had solid broad
-
based strength across the globe with the 
exception of China, where the progression of the vi
rus was already well 
ahead of the rest of the world. Looking at it excluding China, our business 
was growing volumes 3% and we were continuing to gain value share.
 
But as shelter at home and social distancing practice increased rapidly and 
globally, there 
has been temporary but profound pressure on our customers 
and our business.
 
The biggest impact has been a sharp decline in the important away
-
from
-
home portion of our business, which includes our eating and drinking 
channels as well as our on
-
the
-
go orient
ated channels like convenience 
retail. While our exposure varies across markets, away
-
from
-
home broadly 
represents about half of our business given our strong share positions.
 
In some markets like the U.S., drive
-
thru operations and carryout have 
helped of
fset some of the pressure, but most restaurants are operating on 
limited hours and are seeing overall trips decline sharply. In the at
-
home 
channels, we've seen some early pantry loading particularly in certain 
developed markets at the beginning of many of
 
the lockdown phases. Then, 
as we get past the initial phases of the lockdown however, we are seeing 
levels normalize.
 
In other markets like India, for example, the severity of the distancing 
measures has negatively impacted at
-
home as well, simply due to 
the 
significant reduction in shopping trips. At this stage, it's a little too early to 
determine exactly what level at
-
home trends will stabilize at.
 
We've also seen a significant increase in e
-
commerce channels where we 
have been accelerating our presence
 
versus the pre crisis. However, given 
the net effect of these shifts we expect a temporary but significant impact on 
our business in the second quarter primarily coming from the slowdown in 
our away from home business.
 
For context, if we look at our April
 
month
-
to
-
date trends we are seeing 
volumes down globally approximately 25% driven by the sharp declines in 
our away from home businesses. Fortunately based on the latest 
projections, we do expect the second quarter to be the most severely 
impacted.
 
With t
hat said, there is still a good deal of uncertainty around the trajectory 
of the pandemic as well as the resulting macroeconomic impact. While we're 
seeing different impacts across geographies and at different times, generally 
we expect three phases. The o
utright with its corresponding social distancing 
measures, a period of graduated re
-
openings; and finally a return to a new 
normal.
 
Consumer mindset and shopping behavior will be different in each phase and 
they'll vary across markets, but we foresee some 
similar patterns that I'll 
discuss in greater detail. Of course, we can look to China for some early 
learnings about the various phases. I'm happy to say that our plants there 
are all operating and employees have returned to company offices in 
Shanghai.
 
We
're seeing encouraging signs of increased consumption as outlets reopen 
resulting in sequential improvement in China. However, the consumption is 
still lower than prior year and we expect the full recovery to take time 
especially as there are still limits 
on crowd sizes.
 
As we anticipate a recovery in China, we're planning key actions with 
bottlers to regain momentum including our pre summer sales promotion and 
increased cooler placement. We will follow the strategy that has proved 
successful before the 
pandemic adjusted with greater focus on channels and 
packages that will have traction as the new normal unfolds.
 
While we're encouraged by the improving trends in China, we recognize 
other countries may not follow the same trajectory and changes in social 
distancing practices may be gradual. And the situation in China could 
certainly continue to evolve. It is simply too soon to estimate exactly what 
might lay head. That's why we're taking swift action now to adapt in the 
near
-
term while best positioning our
selves for success later.
 
Our global workforce is a critical asset and protecting people and roles is a 
high priority. Teams around the world are being asked to work differently 
and they're rising to the occasion. We have implemented real
-
time network 
coll
aboration routines to accelerate knowledge sharing. We're adapting local 
market strategies across our system including supply chain, stakeholder 
engagement and workforce management. We've adopted dynamic resource 
allocation practices in many regions matchi
ng people to projects and scaling 
the best ideas across geographies.
 
In many ways the strategy we laid out at CAGNY remains the same, 
centered around brand building innovation, revenue growth management 
and execution. Having the ability to dial up and reca
librate aspects of that 
strategy is critical in this environment.
 
A culture of agility is key. We are working seamlessly with our bottlers and 
retail customers to meet real
-
time demand given the rapid shifts in customer 
patterns. Bottler alignment has neve
r been more important and the work 
we've done to strengthen the system in recent years is bearing fruit in step
-
up execution.
 
For our retail customers, grocery stores for example, we're focused on 
maximizing system efficiency by ruthlessly prioritizing to 
deliver on core 
SKUs and key brands and help customers simplify their supply chains. We're 
also taking this opportunity to reshape our innovation pipeline to eliminate a 
longer tail of smaller projects and allocate resources to fewer, larger, more 
scalable
 
and more relevant solutions for this environment.
 
With shoppers spending less time browsing, it's crucial that we work to 
minimize out of stocks and maximize share of visible inventory. In markets 
around the world, we've redeployed on the ground sales rep
s and especially 
those orientated towards the on
-
premise trade and refocus them on 
merchandising, resulting in increased share of displays of stock on the floor. 
As consumers adjust to stay at home lifestyle, they're making fewer 
shopping trips and filling
 
bigger baskets often based on availability and 
orientate to known trusted brands.
 
Therefore, we are working with our customers to maximize promotional 
effectiveness and reconsidering multipack promotions and frequency to 
ensure the mix of our product and 
packaging offerings are meeting their 
needs.
 
Our consumer centric total beverage strategy has enabled us to deliver 
products that shoppers want when stocking up on essentials whether it's to 
refresh, hydrate or provide functional benefits. We also recogniz
e the 
importance of customers both big and small and are working to support 
independent retailers. We're implementing measures to support small 
retailers in many countries. For example in Brazil mom
-
and
-
pop stores face 
mounting pressure and they are a key 
pillar not only of our business but 
local communities.
 
We have played a leading role in the formation of the Small Trade Activity 
Recovery or STAR program. Along with consumer product peers, the STAR 
coalition will connect companies, government and small r
etail associations to 
help small and medium retailers.
 
We've also experienced an upsurge in e
-
commerce across the globe with the 
growth rate of the channel doubling in many countries. Consumers are 
getting necessities delivered to their door in many cases 
with contactless 
delivery. Revenue growth management plays a key role in our current 
strategy as we shift towards package sizes that are fit for purpose online 
sales and as we reallocate consumer and trade promotions to digital.
 
For grocery e
-
delivery comp
anies, we've increased in
-
app visibility with a 
focus on multi packs, so consumers can access our beverage within a click's 
reach of desire. We are also acting fast to address the needs of restaurant 
partners as they adapt to the current environment.
 
In No
rth America, we've offered our foodservice restaurant partners an 
alternative to fountain drink by ensuring bottle can availability for delivery. 
In the U.S. we partnered with the national leading food aggregators to 
increase our product profile and accele
rate customer menu optimization by 
included beverage options and value bundles.
 
Also, we've recently played an active role in The Great American Takeout 
movement with the National Restaurant Association. We're also being 
mindful about the right level of br
and marketing and new product launches 
given the consumer mindset across markets. We've developed and 
determined that in this initial phase there is limited effectiveness to broad
-
based brand marketing.
 
With this in mind, we've reduced our direct consumer 
communication we'll 
pause sizable marketing campaigns through the early stages of the crisis 
and reengage when the timing is right. These plans will vary from market to 
market with our earliest reengagement focusing on the recovery in China.
 
At the same ti
me, we are leveraging our associates to address longer
-
term 
opportunities recognizing that near
-
term realities will subside. Looking 
ahead, we may not know the exact shape of the recovery but we are taking 
action today to be prepared for the future.
 
For th
e recovery phase RGM is key as we prepare to strike the right balance 
of affordability and recruitment packs in addition to premium offerings. This 
is one area where we are much better positioned versus our system 10 
years ago when our portfolio and SKU op
tionality was not nearly as 
sophisticated as it is today.
 
We'll also embrace some seismic consumer behavior shifts that are taking 
place, especially in e
-
commerce. We believe the accelerating expansion of 
the channel is sustainable and we want to continue 
to be well positioned for 
long
-
term growth.
 
We are investing in digital capabilities to strengthen consumer connections 
and further piloting several different digital
-
enabled initiatives using 
fulfillment methods, whether B2B to home or B2C platforms in ma
ny 
countries to capture online demand for at
-
home consumption in the future. 
We're seeing good results in these early days and are looking to scale similar 
partnerships with more customers.
 
In times when a crisis hit it can be easy to lose sight of the lon
g
-
term but we 
will continue to build a more sustainable business for the future. Late last 
year, we refreshed our purpose statement: to refresh the world and make a 
difference and our company's purpose is now more important than ever.
 
Tomorrow the company 
will publish its 2019 Business and Sustainability 
Report, reflecting a continued journey towards driving a more sustainable 
business. While there are still many unknowns ahead, we do know that over 
134 years of business we've seen many types of crises, be 
they military, 
economic or pandemic and the Coca
-
Cola Company has always emerged 
stronger in the end.
 
We are in a better position today than we were heading into previous 
periods of challenge. We've made meaningful progress in accelerating our 
capabilities
, reshaping our bottling system, pivoting our portfolio and 
transforming our culture. Undoubtedly, there will be ups and downs in the 
coming months. But with our bottling partners, we are clear on what needs 
to be done both now and into the future to manag
e our business, focus our 
strategies, accelerate our actions and redirect our investments.
 
With that, I'll turn the call over to John.
 
John Murphy
 
Thank you, James, and thanks to all of you for joining us. I'd like to 
complement James' remarks with a parti
cular focus on the following areas: 
our people, 2020 profitability and cash flow, capital allocation priorities, our 
bottling system and our post
-
COVID readiness.
 
It maybe a little unusual to start the finance review on people, but in these 
times it is abs
olutely the right place to start. The manner in which we have 
seen sacrifice, commitment, resilience and adaptability in the past weeks has 
stood out, and we have been able to accomplish things which in normal 
times would have seemed impossible.
 
As with ma
ny companies, job security is a concern for our people. And for 
us, it has been a key priority as we navigate through this period. Where 
necessary we have furloughed some employees and we have done so on full 
pay through June. The length, severity and over
all impact of the crisis will 
ultimately determine how we will come out of this and we will be very 
thoughtful on our approach.
 
What we do see as James mentioned is a lot of redeployment enabling the 
company to pivot quickly with the work that matters most
 
in these times. 
The agility we are seeing across the world in this regard has been impressive 
and is opening the door to new ways of working that are allowing us to be a 
lot more responsive.
 
For me some of the work that matters most is smart use of the 
many levers 
we have at our disposal to maximize profit and cash flow. On the revenue 
side, we have made substantial changes to our brand pack portfolio focus 
and are leveraging the playbooks on affordability and value that have served 
us so well in past cr
isis around the world.
 
On the expenditure side, I would divide it into four key focus areas and with 
a particular emphasis on quarter 2. One, as James mentioned, we have been 
pulling back on our marketing spend for now. Staying close to our 
consumers in a 
relevant way is a key guiding principle, and staying 
disciplined to demand an appropriate ROI is a close second.
 
Two, we are taking a similar approach with our trade dollars. While much of 
that spend is managed by our bottlers in both our bottling investme
nts and 
North America businesses this is an important area to effectively manage 
and be willing to reengineer.
 
Three, we are attacking all discretionary operating expenses and challenging 
what is essential and making sure every dollar being spent on servic
es, 
travel, meetings, et cetera is appropriate.
 
And four, we have paused all capital spend other than what is absolutely 
essential or has already been committed. By moving quickly and decisively 
we will avoid waste, improve ROI and spend and give us maximu
m flexibility 
for the second half of the year as we gain clarity on the outlook.
 
Finally as a quick reminder for your models, the reductions to marketing and 
trade spend will get phased over the balance of the year. Our capital 
allocation priorities should
 
be framed against our liquidity position and our 
balance sheet. With the actions taken since March, our overall liquidity is 
strong and so to is our balance sheet.
 
We will of course continue to focus on protecting the progress we made on 
working capital a
nd free cash flow in 2019. And in this context, our capital 
allocation priorities remain very much focused on investing wisely to support 
our business operations and continuing to prioritize our dividend.
 
Specifically with regard to the dividend, we curren
tly have no intentions to 
change our approach. Regarding M&A, we do not foresee any significant 
activity going forward this year, nor do we intend to repurchase shares. We 
are also mindful of staying close to the debt range we have previously 
highlighted. 
We will of course review our overall approach to capital 
allocation as we know more about the length and severity of the crisis.
 
James spoke earlier about how our global bottling system is adapting to the 
coronavirus pandemic. I cannot overstate the admira
tion we all have for 
everything our bottling partners are doing to stay close to their people, their 
customers and their communities. Many of them are battle heartened when 
it comes to managing crisis and I know they are proactively taking steps to 
preserv
e cash, strengthen their balance sheets and manage their P&Ls.
 
Currently we do not have any major concerns surrounding our bottling 
partners from a liquidity perspective and we are working closely with them 
to anticipate and deal effectively with a scenari
o where the coronavirus 
situation is longer and more severe than currently anticipated.
 
As we noted in our release, we are unable to provide an update to our full 
year 2020 financial outlook. We expect to have a better picture of how the 
recovery will unfo
ld when we report our second quarter results in July.
 
Meantime, I would like to highlight the following. In looking at currency 
impacts for comparable net revenues based on current spot rates and 
including the impact of hedge positions, we expect a mid
-
sin
gle
-
digit full 
year headwind. For comparable operating income also based on current spot 
rates, expect a high single
-
digit headwind with most of the headwind coming 
from our developing and emerging markets. We still expect the company's 
underlying effectiv
e tax rate to be 19.5% for the year.
 
Looking ahead it's important that we adapt quickly to the current 
environment while also best positioning ourselves to win in the post
-
COVID 
world. Emerging stronger from this crisis, demands a willingness to 
challenge 
the status quo. To that end we are using this time to do just that. 
The last couple of months have already taught us how to do many things 
very differently.
 
In closing, let me say, I have never been more proud to be part of the Coca
-
Cola system are indeed 
more optimistic. It's a testament to the culture of 
transformation taking hold across the organization. Our people and the 
strategic alignment of our system gives me the confidence in our ability to 
not only manage through the current crisis but to emerge 
from it stronger.
 
With that operator we are ready for questions.
 
Question

Answer Session
 
Operator
 
[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Steve Powers with 
Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
 
Steve Powers
 
Thanks. Hi, guys. Good morning. I h
ope you're all well and thanks for all 
that detail. I guess building on where you focused your prepared remarks 
James, I think everyone on the call is likely trying to tease out to some 
extent the depth and duration of what hopefully is a bottom in 2Q and 
then 
how the system is likely to emerge on the back side.
 
When you think about what you and your bottling partners have seen thus 
far in China but also Italy, elsewhere in Europe and the U.S., are there 
common experiences whether positive or negative that 
you can pass along 
that can help us better get underneath that question? And how are you 
handicapping the forward prospects in key emerging markets like Brazil or 
India, where arguably the implications are just now taking shape? Thanks.
 
James Quincey
 
Let m
e offer a few thoughts and see whether that helps. Firstly, there's a set 
of in the famous expression known unknowns here that heavily influence the 
shape of how long this 

 
the virus crisis will last and the resulting economic 
crisis and the degree of ups
 
and downs and volatile on the way.
 
And those known unknowns are all out there and we can't determine which 
way they're going to take us. And I think that's important because while 
there are some learnings from the earlier markets like China, South Korea o
r 
even some of the European markets, we're still at the beginning. We're still 
at the beginning. What do I mean by that?
 
We can see the path of how China or South Korea or Singapore, some of 
those countries came into the crisis, how the lockdowns occurred 
by 
channel, by pack, by brand, the change in consumer behavior; and then 
being able to follow that journey as they have opened up and the thing has 
started to stabilize.
 
And you can see China, we were doing great in January. We had a fantastic 
start to the
 
year double
-
digit growth. It was a very profound lockdown in 
February, much deeper than the minus 25% we're currently seeing globally 
and we started to build back up volatile from week
-
to
-
week in March. And 
we're kind of getting close towards neutral in C
hina now, still below where 
we were last year and where we were in January. But I think it's important 
to emphasize that doesn't mean it's over.
 
We can see from Singapore or Tokyo Japan they have a kind of a second 
wave of the lockdown. So what we see is v
ery clear experiences on what 
happens in the first phase of the lockdown pantry load channel changes et 
cetera, et cetera. And we've done a great job of moving those, link around 
the world.
 
Now we expect to see the next phase of the crisis come which is po
st 
generalized global lockdowns. We're going to see a graduated set of re
-
openings around the world. How long they will take to get from where we 
are now to the new normal depends on these known unknowns, and could 
include further retreats to lockdowns as 
we've seen in a couple of countries.
 
So we can't 
--
 
known unknown. What we can do is focus on what we're good 
at. We can focus on a few simple ideas. One the beverage industry is a great 
industry. As I said on the call, every previous crisis 
military economic or 
pandemic in that last 134 years, the Coke Company has come out stronger.
 
We've done that by doing essentially two things at the same time. One, 
using the DNA of our system which knows how to manage in an economic 
crisis resulting from 
whatever, manage the business on a day
-
to
-
day, week
-
to
-
week, quarter
-
to
-
quarter basis, having the flexibility and adaptability to 
do the right amount of brand building innovation, revenue growth manage 
our next Houston market.
 
But at the same time, have an
 
eye on where is this going in the long
-
term 
such that, as we work our way through the winding path of what the crisis 
takes us, we end up emerging stronger.
 
And so I would emphasize. And that's obviously why we haven't provided full 
year guidance. We are 
still at the beginning. We may be at the end of the 
big global lockdown, but we are still some way from the new normal.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question comes from Bryan Spillane with Bank of 
America. Your line is now open.
 
Bryan Spillane
 
Hey. Good mo
rning, everybody. So I guess, just thinking about the 
comments James that you made about maybe changes in packaging. And 
maybe linking that to as we get past this initial lockdown phase and thinking 
about the business, maybe a year out. What is the sort of
 
dynamic that 
you're sort of trying to focus on?
 
Is it one a recession and a consumer maybe more focused on value, or is it 
the second being more the consumer
-
focused changes in consumer behavior 
patterns?
 
Maybe consumers buying more e
-
commerce more reluct
ant to have that 
away
-
from
-
home consumption just trying to understand how you're kind of 
thinking about how the business changes once we get past that lockdown 
phase?
 
And again does it imply maybe a greater shift to the at
-
home packaging 
versus away
-
from
-
h
ome?
 
James Quincey
 
Yeah, great question. Look, you could clearly see a set of clear trends on the 
packaging. I mean in the lockdown, obviously the away
-
from
-
home channels 
are down heavily which means the immediate consumption packaging are 
down heavily. An
d we're much more focused on at
-
home which tends to be 
larger or multi packs.
 
But it also sees a big step
-
up in e
-
commerce. We've seen a near doubling of 
our 
--
 
of the importance of the growth of e
-
commerce for us. So once we get 
past the lockdown I think,
 
we'll see an environment through these graduated 
re
-
openings of society still with the spectre of the virus over us with a reality 
of an impacted economy.
 
And I think what we'd like to see is a step change in some already ongoing 
trends like a step
-
up in 
e
-
commerce. It is both economically attractive and 
kind of spectre of the virus friendly, so I think we'll see a lot more e
-
commerce.
 
I think it will take time for the highest aggregation channels to come back. 
But I think they will come back in the end. I
n the new normal there will be 
new consumer behavior at that point in time, because ultimately we are 
social animals.
 
That aggregation will come back. But I think, we're also going to see a very 
profound theme of affordability. What we're seeing in the loc
kdown is not 
just the effect of the lockdown of certain channels.
 
But I think that anticipation by the consumer of where the economy is going. 
There's going to be an economic impact. We're in the face of all this 
uncertainty. So we're going to see a lot mo
re 
--
 
a lot more affordability 
where we've launched refillable PET back again in South Africa.
 
We're investing in refillables in Latin America. We're really looking at how we 
can drive affordability for them. So a lot more e
-
commerce in the future, 
we're c
ertainly going to see a profound theme of affordability coming up in 
the next years.
 
We're going to see a lot of attempts by governments by us as well to 
support the smaller outlet base, as those will be the ones who've most 
suffered in the lockdown, whate
ver channel they're in.
 
So we have been able to pivot and we expect to continue to pivot our brand 
marketing our innovation our revenue growth management and the 
execution by the bottlers through each stage of this crisis as it moves 
forward.
 
In the end, t
he crisis management DNA is out there in the system. We may 
not have faced a global pandemic in living memory. But all around the world 
in the system we have lots of managers who've been in countries which 
have faced crisis.
 
And as the spectre of the virus
 
lifts what we'll be left with is an impacted 
economy 
--
 
some new consumer behaviors but an impacted economy. And 
this is when the Coke system can shine and always has shone in the past.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question comes from Nik Modi with RBC. Y
our line is 
now open.
 
Nik Modi
 
Yeah. Thanks good morning everyone. James you talked about really 
focusing on the core some core SKUs in order to have it in stock obviously 
with the demand surge.
 
But can you talk a little bit about, how your interaction wit
h the retail 
community has been in terms of how they're thinking about some of the 
longer
-
lasting impacts of the decisions they make in terms of how many 
products they shelve and the kind of assortment they carry, any perspective 
around that?
 
I know 
it's early but I'm already starting to hear some of this coming back in 
the retail community, in terms of how they're thinking about streamlining 
their assortment and portfolio choices, so just curious, if you've been 
hearing the same?
 
James Quincey
 
Yes ab
solutely. And two things come together in the short term and they 
both work in the same direction which is the crisis management of keeping 
the supply chain open, while we have all these restrictions in the period of 
the lockdown and the virus crisis. And 
then I think you've got this likelihood 
of an impacted economy going forward for some period of time.
 
In both those circumstances, both of those things lead you to a similar set of 
actions whether you're a manufacturer or an at
-
home retailer which is to 
fo
cus on the biggest most important most well
-
known brands and 
affordability and making sure you can get availability in store.
 
I mean one of the 
--
 
one of 
--
 
we've had a lot of focus on supporting the 
grocery customers. Because of course, we've got a strong
 
bottling system 
that can deliver reliable supply onto the floor. So we've seen ourselves be 
able to gain share of inventory in the store because we've been able to 
sustain the supply chain. So really being able to be there for the customers 
and execute an
d deliver product on the floor.
 
But both us and them will also be driving to a rationalization on focusing on 
what's the most effective set of brands and SKUs to push through which will 
mean a cutting of the longer tail in this coming period. Will more cho
ice, 
more innovation come back when new normal and economy reestablishes 
itself? Yes, I'm sure it will. But in this period it's going to be a question of 
focus.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question comes from Dara Mohsenian with Morgan 
Stanley. Your line 
is now open.
 
Dara Mohsenian
 
Hey guys, I hope you all are well. James I just want to press a bit more on 
Steve's question and I know it's hard to answer it. But if one sort of makes 
the assumption that government
-
mandated closures and the social 
distancing 
all by the end of Q2 doesn't reemerge this disease in a major way 
this summer, could you just give us some thoughts on the pace of recovery 
you're expecting on your business as you look out over the next few 
quarters?
 
And I'm trying to sort of separate out
 
the direct social distancing impact 
more from the secondary economic impact as we look going forward. Is it 
more of a V
-
shaped recovery in your mind for your business or U
-
shaped or 
even L
-
shaped as we look through year
-
end 2020?
 
And then just taking a st
ep back thinking about 2021, obviously you're not 
giving expectations any time soon. But again assuming the social distancing 
doesn't reemerge in a big way in the winter, how confident are you that 
whatever the volume degradation ends up being in 2020 is, 
is mostly 
recovered in 2021? Is it most of it? Is it 
--
 
hard to imagine a lot of that 
comes back? Just conceptually how do you think about these things longer 
term? Thanks.
 
James Quincey
 
Sure. I would love to be able to tell you there's an answer to that q
uestion, 
but there isn't. What we do know is, what is 
--
 
we can see the shape of the 
social distancing measures into the coming months and there are already 
governments that have distancing measures into Q3.
 
We're very focused as ever on picking up on the 
re
-
openings. Those re
-
openings if we take Europe and the U.S. in May and June, there are people 
in government that are talking about three phases and they're talking about 
the reopening part of Phase 1, not yet 2 and 3 are happening in the same 
quarter.
 
So
 
I think we will see social distancing measures for some period of time 
into Q3. Hopefully they will not be as severe as the second quarter. Maybe 
they will last to the fourth maybe not. We just cannot know. What 
--
 
we 
have to focus on is, in a way to use 
your 
--
 
this alphabet soup of scenarios 
the U the V and L. We have to be ready in case, it's a V. If it does bounce 
back, we don't want to be so conservative we are not ready for a spring back 
of the economy and a spring back in demand and we want to be ah
ead of 
the curve. I don't think it's 
--
 
I have said before I don't think the V is the 
most likely scenario, but we will be ready if it occurs.
 
The U, clearly you want to take the middle scenario we understand. And 
certainly, I think the U is more likely th
an the V and how that's going to go 
forward. And clearly we need to prepare to act on that one with a lot of the 
measures we took up. Is the L possible? Yes the L is possible too.
 
Our approach is to make sure we are both flexible and ready and have the 
pla
ns charged and ready to go when the spring back comes. We also need to 
manage the recessionary period and the lockdown periods and social 
distancing periods with specific and tailored plans to do the best we can in 
those things.
 
And of course we need to be
 
prepared and understand that if it is the L or 
anything along those lines, we need to have given ourselves some flexibility 
to respond to those scenarios as well. So the key that we are focused on is, 
how we anticipate the scenarios that could be ahead of
 
us, across the whole 
range how do we give ourselves the flexibility to act on them and make sure 
we manage the business day
-
to
-
day, week
-
to
-
week, month
-
to
-
month, 
quarter
-
to
-
quarter to get the best possible result as we go along this winding 
path; because 
we cannot see over the horizon and yet retain a focus that by 
the end of this crisis the Coca
-
Cola Company will have emerged stronger 
and be better setup for the long term as it has always done in every 
previous crises for its 134 years.

us a little more color on what you're doing to ensure your supply chain, 
really is
 
accommodating some of the demand volatility that we've seen in 
recent weeks. And how is this different in the U.S. versus across some of 
your emerging markets for instance?
 
And then along those same lines, you probably have a lot of excess capacity 
at thi
s point for servicing restaurants and in your fountain business. So 
curious how you manage that side of your supply chain given there's 
probably a lot of excess capacity there? Thanks.
 
James Quincey
 
Sure. We're clearly very focused on adapting the supply c
hain. And if I break 
it down into a few pieces, there's of course sourcing the ingredients that we 
use in the concentrate in the bottling plant, our own concentrate 
manufacturing or fountain manufacturing the bottling plants and then on 
through the distrib
ution.
 
There's been a lot of challenges. But I would like to congratulate the supply 
chain teams at the company and at all of the bottling partners for the 
incredible work they've done at basically keeping everything running. I was 
certainly on record a fe
w weeks ago saying, the supply chains around the 
world will be creaking. There's been a lot of pressure at the borders, whether 
it's the provincial 

 
province
-
to
-
province borders in some countries or 
country
-
to
-
country borders in other parts of the world m
oving some of the 
ingredients that are basically shipped around the world.
 
But once they're within the country, which is the larger of these, the great 
advantage of the Coke system is that the Cokes are made locally. All our 
drinks are basically made local
ly. The drinks in the U.S. are made in the 
U.S., the drinks in Germany are made in Germany, the drinks in Kenya are 
made in Kenya. And so the local supply chain is then able to work 
designated as part of the food system, so an essential service to allow to
 
run 
the production systems and distribution.
 
So, we've had relatively 

 
we've had some issues on timing of ingredients. 
Those are much better than they were a few weeks ago. Production facilities 
are largely running. We made a lot of 
adaptations to ensure safety and 
sanitation and security for the employees and that's true over the 
concentrate plants and most of the bottling plants just a couple of places 
that we see some plant shutdown. And then distribution, we've largely kept 
up and
 
running everywhere and doubled down on that. Yes. There are issues 
in the odd countries here and there on the 

 
on availability of 

 
in some of 
the logistics for drivers or having to swap drivers at borders. But generally 
speaking, it's been 

 
we've been 
able to adapt and it's the great strength of 
having ultimately a local supply chain in each country. And yeah, there are 
some parts of the supply chain that are running 24/7 and there are some 
places 

 
parts like the fountain supply that are much more low 
utilization. 
And we'll have to manage through that as we see how these graduated re
-
openings start to take place in the coming months and quarters.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Kaumil Gajrawala with Credit 
Suisse. Your line is now open.
 
Kaumil Gajrawala
 
Hi. Good morning, everybody. John, if you could just maybe link two things 
you talked about. You mentioned comfort in your liquidity in the various 
areas of liquidity you have available as well as the 

 
a small conversation 
about the bott
lers and such. But can you link them in some way that, if we 
do end up in an environment, where some of the bottlers need some 
assistance do you feel like you have the liquidity to either buy them in again 
or perhaps bail out, or will something like that n
eed to be reliant on 
consolidation within the bottlers?
 
John Murphy
 
Thanks, Kau. Let me frame the liquidity position that we have and indeed 
some of our bottlers first. We've 

 
as I mentioned, we've taken quick actions 
in March to anticipate whatever outco
me in the back half of the year good 
bad or indifferent. Keep in mind that, with our bottlers over 50% of our 
business globally is in the hands of our large public play on bottlers, all of 
whom came into 2020 with strong balance sheets. And I believe we're
 
doing 
a very good job also to anticipate a number of different outcomes for the 
year.
 
We are staying very close to all of our bottlers around the world, small, 
medium and large. And that will be on a case
-
by
-
case basis as to what 
eventually happens in the
 
coming months, but we feel that we have 

 
we 
have plenty of gunpowder available to manage whatever situation evolves in 
that period. So all in all, we're confident in the overall strength of the system 
to withstand the coming months.

Thank you. O
ur next question comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. 
Your line is now open.
 
Lauren Lieberman
 
Great. Thanks. Good morning. I was hoping 

 
you talked a lot about sort of 
the various actions that you're taking on equity expenses and so on and 
ability t
o protect profitability from that perspective. But when you're also 
thinking about gross margins, I was hoping you could just try to weave 
together all the different things you've talked about trimming this fiscal tail, 
I guess the smaller innovation effor
ts, affordability pack efforts, and impact 
on right now just with the shortfall in immediate consumption; the relative 
profitability of fountain foodservice. Just 

 
I think it's 

 
because for me 
anyways there certainly no one that likes talking about the q
uarter, but 
gross margins were quite strong in the quarter. And so I'm just trying to 
think forward as we weave together all these different elements how we 
should think about gross margin as we work through these times? Thanks.
 
John Murphy
 
Yeah. So for th
e quarter gross margins were positively impacted with the 
mix of the inventory build and a relatively poor performance from our lower
-
margin segments.
 
With respect to the outlook what I would focus on a couple of points that 
James also made is that the sys
tem is using a number of playbooks. If you 
think about where revenue growth management started in the world 
--
 
in 
our world, it was really born in Argentina and Latin America during the crisis 
of the early 2000s.
 
And we're leveraging many of the lessons an
d indeed the capabilities to 
focus on our core sparkling brands, which, as you know, have a more 
favorable margin, to be very clear on the price pack architectures to be able 
to get full benefit from both an affordability play, but as well as to be able to
 
segment in our channels and markets with the appropriate packs for value.
 
And also during this period, it's been an opportunity to trim back 
significantly the long tail, which as we've highlighted in previous calls that 
tail is typically comprised of some
 
of the more 

 
the younger explorer and 
challenger brands, which by nature are lower margins.
 
So I think a combination of the playbooks that we know work, a focus on the 
bigger brands and the key packages that typically are higher margin and 
being in the p
osition to prioritize our leader brands and packages gives us 
comfort that the 
--
 
on the gross margin front that we can continue to build 
on the momentum that we've had for the last couple of years.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question comes from Bill Cha
ppell with SunTrust. Your 
line is now open.
 
Bill Chappell
 
Thanks. Good morning. Just more specifically, maybe you can talk a little bit 
about kind of the 
--
 
sorry about that.
 
James Quincey
 
Bill, yes, we lost you. We can hear you now.
 
Bill Chappell
 
Can you 
hear me now?
 
James Quincey
 
Yes, yes.
 
Bill Chappell
 
Sorry about that. Good morning. I just wanted to talk a little bit more about 
the sports event business and kind of how you plan for that over the next 
couple of quarters? And when I say that, 
everything from the Olympics to 
football to what have you, it seems like there's a longer time frame before 
we have those type of group events.
 
And so, I guess, trying to understand how movable some of your 
expenditures are in terms of can you quickly canc
el those and move them 
around? And also, how do you plan for not having those type of events to 
supply for probably six months plus?
 
James Quincey
 
Yes. Certainly, the expectation when you look at the 

 
to the extent that 
there are public reopening plans an
d talk about what the phases would look 
like, most sporting events sit in phase three, i.e., towards the back end. So, 
I think, that it's pretty clear that we're going to see a relatively limited, not 
say none, amount of large sporting events with audience
s in the next couple 
of quarters, but it's not likely. Hopefully, it will come to pass, but I think it's 
going to be difficult.
 
Now, how we adapt to that? And, obviously, the biggest one of that is the 
Olympics, which has now been pushed out to next year. 
Obviously, there's 
some degree of fixed investment in the asset in the sponsorship. And, 
obviously, we're talking to all our partners about how this disruption of the 
virus impact the assets and what we can do together.
 
The majority of the spend is largely
 
in the activation of the marketing 
programs with the asset and those tend to be variable cost media buys, one 
sort or another or a marketing activation, where we can actually repurpose 
that money to other things. So, as John talked about on the call, we h
ave 
been very assertive in increasing the degree of flexibility and reprioritization 
of all the marketing and OpEx.
 
But all the marketing spend in the downhill of the year to maximize 
flexibility, because we just know which channels or events are going to 
open 
up when and potentially change from one day to the next. And so, we're 
maximizing flexibility. The good news is most of the marketing spend, the 
large majority of the marketing spend is variable and we retain the 
opportunity to change our plans as we 
go through the year.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Robert Ottenstein with Evercore. 
Your line is now open.
 
Robert Ottenstein
 
Great. Thank you very much. I was wondering if you can talk a little bit 
about as, kind of, moving into the post
-
COVID environment, how you feel 
you're situated for the affordability issue, given changes in your price pack 
architecture that you've done over the last 10
-
or
-
so years? And also, what 
changes you've done in your culture, right? I mean one of the big thin
gs that 
you've tried to do from the beginning of the first days is make some 
significant changes in the culture of the Coca
-
Cola Company. Perhaps you 
can add to what are you doing along those lines either to push that forward 
and to meet the challenges and
 
accountability and the speed that you're 
looking for given the crisis environment? Thank you.
 
James Quincey
 
Sure. We commented a little earlier that responding in a crisis has certainly 
been part of the DNA of the Coke system. From a cultural point of vie
w, we 
have been clearly focused in the last few years on 
--
 
through some of the 
organizational changes, through some of the work on training skill building 
and developing the culture to increase the degree of agility, the nimbleness 
of the global organizat
ion.
 
But also the degree of networking has become a much more networked 
organization which obviously the two things work together, which has been 
fantastic in a way because there's no better time to have got better at those 
two things than when you've got 
a global crisis. And the value of the 
learnings that can be moved around the world is certainly very high.
 
So we've been focusing on a number of things the culture, but certainly 
ramping up the agility and the network, creating a networked organization 
has
 
certainly helped us in this crisis.
 
And then as we focused in on affordability, John mentioned it earlier, the 
revenue growth management approach has been part of 
--
 
our crisis 
manufacturing was born in a crisis or many crises and we have developed 
that c
apability around the world over the years 
--
 
actually over the last 
couple of years we had another big push to drive revenue management 
capability around the one.
 
It wasn't just that we were looking for premium pricing and smaller 
packaging, yes we were lo
oking for those things but they were an output of 
a capability we were building that is now going to be turned towards 
responding to the different environments that we'll see across the different 
countries as their macros perform.
 
And so the system us and 
the bottlers, have upgraded our ability to really 
pivot towards affordability in whatever shape that means in the country 
you're in and using whichever brands is relevant in the phase we're talking 
about. So I think we are in the best shape we've been goin
g into a global 
crisis than we have been for a long time.
 
John Murphy
 
And James, if I just could add on the cost management side to sort of 
amplify the point on networking and agility. I think as we go into the rest of 
the year we've had the opportunity ov
er the last four to six weeks to work 
very closely with all markets to be clear on what's fixed, what's variable, 
what's committed, what's non
-
committed, and then what are the key 
decision points that we will have over the coming weeks to be able to pivot 
us an appropriately into the second half of the year and it will be very 
market centric.
 
In some markets we will want to accelerate investments and in some 
markets pull back. But the network that's in place the digital infrastructure 
we have to allow us to
 
connect is 
--
 
certainly are elements that are serving 
us very well at the moment.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question comes from Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan. 
Your line is now open.
 
Andrea Teixeira
 
Thank you, and good morning. Are you seeing 
at
-
home consumption 
accelerate or decelerate in April against March? And do you view the fewer 
shopping trips you alluded to mostly offset by commerce in most places and 
the negative impact, mostly localized in some countries like you said in India 
and epi
center cities like New York?
 
In other words, I'm trying to see how concerned are you with center 
destocking at this point? Are there still a lot of out
-
of
-
stocks in your view at 
retail, and we could actually see at
-
home accelerate as you progress your 
reve
nue management initiatives? And should we expect the negative 
price/mix impact because of the bigger weight of the multi
-
serve in the next 
few quarters? I really appreciate. Thank you.
 
James Quincey
 
Sure. Taking it a bit in reverse order, yeah, if we 
--
 
if there's a big shift in 
the mix towards future consumption packages versus immediate 
consumption in any given country that will be a headwind to mix in the 
coming quarters. There maybe all sorts of other effects, as John mentioned 
some of our vertically 
integrated businesses have been impacted. We run 
the fountain business all coursed through our BIGs. So there'll be a lot of 
mix effects in the coming quarters, but that one will be a headwind as we 
think about the future quarters.
 
In terms of the trajecto
ry of at
-
home, one can't simply look at March versus 
April because each country is following its own path. What we see is as the 
virus has started to take off, you start to see footfall starting to decline in 
some of the away
-
from
-
home channels then the lo
ckdown starts to get occur 
and you get big declines in footfall in the away
-
from
-
home channels and you 
get a spike in stock
-
up volumes in the at
-
home for a few weeks, and then 
you obviously are into the lockdown and then the numbers start to normalize 
and 
you start to see some stability in the future consumption.
 
Now what's happening within the at
-
home channel is you have to I think 
layer on conceptually not just a closure of channels and consumers moving 
from A to B, but an anticipation or at least a consu
mer response to the 
uncertainty of where we're all going economically and therefore a shift in the 
prioritization of the categories that they buy even within the at
-
home 
channel.
 
So, it's quite clear and it's a visible pattern not always the same categorie
s 
but it's a very visible pattern around the world. You see what consumers 
deem as essential spikes up and stays up in the at
-
home channels. Some 
things like beverages sell more but not nearly enough to compensate for the 
losses in the away
-
from
-
home chann
els.
 
And then some categories and the smaller SKUs get heavily deprioritized 
both by the customers and by the consumers. So, it's important to see those 
complete trends. It's certainly not the case that e
-
commerce is offsetting the 
losses from away
-
from
-
ho
me relatively 
--
 
e
-
commerce even though it's 
doubled in sales for a beverage category it's still a very small percentage of 
the total beverage category. So, there's a lot of adaptation going on and you 
literally need to go place by place.

Laurent Grandet
 
Hey good morning everyone and many thanks for your detailed comments 
on how you approach the crisis. One question on the advertising spend you 
mentioned
 
in your pre
-
remarks you are pushing back your advertising spend 
to later in the year.
 
So, could you please give us a bit more direction on how we should think 
about the sequencing by quarter and also by brand?
 
And finally, also, should we think your stron
g innovation pipeline and for the 
year is now put on hold? Thank you.
 
John Murphy
 
Sure. Yes.
 
James Quincey
 
Go on John.
 
John Murphy
 
Okay. Go ahead James. Yes, so the approach as we talked for the rest of the 
year has been to really stay close to the consume
r in a relevant way. And in 
the second quarter that actually means in many markets coming off air. We 
have had a number of communications announcing that we will take a pause 
for now while we focus our efforts on our communities and on other 
priorities and
 
that we'll be back later in the year.
 
But back later in the year looks like it's going to be very much dependent on 
the shape of the recovery. And so for the quarter the upcoming quarter, 
we're creating as much optionality as we can so that markets can do
 
the 
right thing in the second half of the year.
 
Tim and the team can take you through some of the implications on the 
--
 
that I alluded to in my remarks on the phasing for the rest of the year.

Yes, good morning everyone. In some key 
--
 
if some key emerging markets 
remain weak or go into a protracted recession here, how do you prompt 
North America and Europe to accelerate the pace of change and grow
th? 
There were some promising momentum what kind of things can you do to 
step up the rate of transformation in developed markets here?
 
James Quincey
 
I mean we're going to have to manage the portfolio here. Certainly, we will 
have to look at each part of th
e world and adopt the strategy and the 
approach and the right balance of marketing innovation, RGM, and execution 
that's appropriate for the macro and the context of the consumer behaviors.
 
We had a great program and a lot of momentum coming back in the No
rth 
American business and also the European business. We'll have to manage 
each step as we take it. I mean certainly [Technical Difficulty] and so we will 
have lots of things ready to roll against the different scenarios we see 
coming out. So, we certainly
 
would be looking to see North America or 
--
 
and Europe doing better as we come out of the new normal.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Kevin Grundy with Jefferies. Your 
line is now open.
 
Kevin Grundy
 
Thanks. Good morning everyone. 
We've covered a lot of ground. I wanted to 
ask James on emerging markets. Historically, the company has tried to 
offset some of these FX headwinds in EMs with pricing. But sort of building 
on some of your early commentary, do you foresee that some of the d
emand 
challenges broadly in a number of these key markets are going to 
compromise your ability to put your pricing to offset some of these FX? And 
how are you sort of weighing market share objectives overall health of 
consumer with profitability over the n
ext 12 months? Thank you.
 
James Quincey
 
Sure. Our starting point is the approach that we compete locally. The 
economics of the industry are more local than they are dollar. So we focus 
on staying close to consumers and the customers and competing locally t
o 
build the franchise is to gain market share and to sustain or improve 
profitability in a local sense. In the short
-
term, we do not 
--
 
that does not 
mean we use pricing to track and try and offset ForEx that will make us less 
competitive in the local cont
ext.
 
Over the long run, clearly, as currencies devalue, they tend to import 
inflation and therefore the pricing over the medium
-
term tends to track to 
offset the FX. We've been hit harder this year than we expected from some 
of the emerging markets and we 
don't see ourselves pricing just to try and 
offset that. We will obviously be driving affordability to try and drive demand 
and sustain the business. And therefore, on the top line, we can try and 
make sure that we get the right level of profitability.
 
Now
 
over the last few years, we have tried to say look we do not aim for the 
Coca
-
Cola Company to just be the sum of all the local wins and occasional 
losses in the local marketplaces. We are pulling levers as a corporation to 
balance out the portfolio to ach
ieve objectives of making sure the 
shareholders get returns in U.S. dollars. Clearly, this year is going to be a 
very atypical year. We're going to manage the year as we've described. But 
going into the future we will certainly be back to try and balance t
he three 
legs of the stool as we have tried in prior years.

Sean King
 
Thank you. I wanted to dig into your commodity hedging exposure and if 
there is any opportunity to benefi
t from the relative correction we've seen in 
certain input prices. I mean, on the other side with ethanol production near 
shuttered, do you see any risk throughout the system for CO2 supply?
 
James Quincey
 
Sean, thanks for the question. I'm glad you raised 
it, because I should have 
highlighted in my remarks earlier with Lauren's question on commodities. 
The commodity outlook is favorable overall and so I expect that both the 
company with our finished goods businesses and indeed our bottling system 
can take a
dvantage of some of those commodity pricing in the rest of the 
year and into 2021.
 
On the CO2 front, yes, we're aware of the challenges, particularly in the U.S. 
due to the bioethanol raw gas feedstock sourcing depletion. But our team 
has got a number of c
ontingency plans in place and we don't foresee an 
issue in the foreseeable future at this point.

Muhtar Kent
 
Thank you, Jackson, and good morning, everyone. I appreciate you joining 
us for an update on our first quarter performance. 
As you know, we started 
2014 with a clear objective of restoring the momentum of our global 
business.
 

in line with our expectations. In the midst of continued headwinds, we 
achieved 
sequentially stronger 2% volume cycling 4% volume growth in the 
prior year quarter, despite the shift of the Easter holiday into the second 
quarter of this year.
 
Comparable currency neutral net revenue growth of 2% after excluding the 
impact of structural 
items, growth of an incremental 100 million unit cases 
or the equivalent of 27 million incremental servings per each day and both 
volume and value share gains in nonalcoholic ready
-
to
-
drink beverages with 
value share gains ahead of volume share gains. Thes
e topline results 

channel architecture across our entire portfolio of leading brands.
 
They are also a reflection of our ability to drive performance, improve 
incidents and simult
aneously enhance price mix which increased 2% globally 
in the quarter and we increased our marketing investments, while 
decreasing other SG&A costs consistent with our commitment to identify 
savings opportunities and to increase support for our brands.
 
Fro
m a geographic perspective, volume in our developed markets was down 
1%. However, volume grew in key developed markets including Japan and 
Australia, while volume in North America was even.
 
Importantly, volume grew 3% in our developing and emerging markets
 
with 
China up 12% and Brazil up 4%. Both India and Russia also grew volume in 
the mid single
-
digit range while gaining nonalcoholic ready
-
to
-
drink volume 
and value share.
 
We remained steadfastly focused on the five strategic priorities we 
announced on our
 
fourth quarter earnings call and later, which I outlined at 
CAGNY. As a reminder, those five strategic priorities are as follows.
 
Firstly to accelerate sparkling growth led by Coca
-
Cola, strategically expand 
our portfolio 
--
 
profitable sales portfolio, th
irdly, increase brand investments 
by maximizing productivity, fourth, win at the point

sale by unlocking the 
power of our system and last but not least, invest in our next
-
generation of 
leaders.
 

out these 


press release issued earlier this morning. These five important strategic 
priorities serve as a 
means to further sharpen our focus. They also serve as 
beacons to collectively align the efforts of our more than 700,000 system 
associates all around the world.
 
Now beginning with our first priority, we are determined to accelerate 
sparkling beverage grow
th led by Coca
-

comprehensive strategies to do so. The foundation of this plan is to invest in 
and deliver great marketing to support our sparking brand.
 

sparkl

overlaying disciplined occasion, brand, price, packed channel strategies, 
supported by revenue growth management capabilities to drive sustained 
value growth.
 

 
meet evolving consumer needs and also 

address category misperception. These strategies to accelerate sparkling 
growth are solid and we expect to see improving results throughout the 
yea
r.
 
Highlights of actions we took in this past quarter included terrific Sochi 
Olympics Campaign executed across all over Russia supported by solid trade 
activations that resulted in 7% sparkling volume growth and 9% brand 
Coca
-
Cola growth, the 17th consecu
tive quarter of growth for brand Coke.
 
A successful recruitment strategy in China where immediate consumption 
tax grow sparkling volume growth of 6%, brand Coke growth of 3% and 
transaction growth of 10% and ongoing sparking innovation in Japan that 
contri
buted to 3% sparkling growth in the first quarter.
 
We clearly see growth potential in the sparkling category and along with our 
system partners we are investing in the wide
-
ranging sparkling innovation, 
world
-
class marketing and unparalleled local executio
n to satisfy our 
consumers thrust for refreshment. It is still early in our journey to restore 
sparkling momentum, yet we are tenaciously focused on building and 

 
This is underscored by the programs and the marketi
ng campaigns that are 
already underway in the second quarter like our FIFA World Cup Campaign 
that has 175 countries participating, the broadest reach of any campaign in 
Coca

United States this week with stops in Washington D.C. yesterday, Miami 
today and Atlanta and LA later in the week, from here, the FIFA World Cup 
Trophy Tour is heading to Brazil on the final leg of its 90

country journey.
 
The activation of thi
s exciting global property coupled with initiatives such as 
our Share a Coke program with individualized personalized Coca
-
Cola bottles 
and cans continue support and innovation on Sprite and Fanta, and a wide 
range of new package introductions across our e
ntire sparkling portfolio is 
going to bring excitement and engagement to our sparkling brands all 
around the world.
 
Moving now to our second priority to strategically expand our profitable still 
beverage portfolio. Our still beverage brands account for app
roximately a 
quarter of our total global volume currently.
 
Today, we are the global value leader in still beverages with $11 billion still 
brands more than any of our competitors. In the first quarter of this year, 
our still beverage volume grew 8%, while 
gaining both volume and value 
share.
 
Given our leadership position in the industry, we are keenly focused on 
working with our global system partners to build strong profitable and 
competitively advantaged brands in fast growing and profitable still beverag
e 
category.
 

volume 3% in the quarter. This was fueled by exceptional brands like Simply 
which grew double digits in North America and Minute Maid Pulpy which 
grew 8% in China. This als
o marks our 9th consecutive quarter of value 
share gains in juices and juice drinks.
 
Our growth global still

global tea portfolio grew 4% as we delivered 
double

digit growth across Honest and Gold Peak in North America, as well 
as Ayataka and Sokenbicha
 
in China 
--
 
in Japan, I beg your pardon. This 
resulted in the 10th consecutive quarter of global ready
-
to
-
drink value share 
gains in tea.
 
We are leveraging our packaging leadership to expand our PlantBottle and 
crushable bottle packaging, creating an impo
rtant point of value 
differentiation for brands ranging from Dasani, North America to I Lohas in 
Japan and we are developing a new profit enhancing beverage drop platform 
that now includes the Dasani, Powerade, Minute Maid and VitaminWater 
brands. As you w
ill note, we continue to innovate across our still portfolio to 
further drive and enhance our leading position.
 
Our third strategic priority is to increase brand investments by maximizing 
productivity. On the brand side and as announced earlier this year, 
we will 
grow our investments by $400 million in 2014 and by $1 billion by 2016.
 
We began to ramp up our investments in the first quarter to support robust 
marketing programs like our Sochi Winter Olympics campaign across 

sing our media investments and quality 

going all the way.
 
In Latin America, the first of our operating groups to launch the FIFA World 
Cup activation, viral marketing efforts targeting
 
Millennials included short 
films that have already exceeded 10 million views on YouTube. And also, our 
worldwide marketing team is collaborating with our partners to deliver 
enhanced consumer experiences. A couple of examples that leveraged new 
technology
 
platforms include Misfit Wearables which produces the Shine 

-
demand music streaming 
service.
 

minority equity investments will enable
 
us to forge even more meaningful 

our increased level of investments, we are confident in our plans and 
approach, which is based on robust analytics across our top markets. The 
i
nsights from this analysis have equipped us with necessary information to 
prioritize both the quantity and quality of our investments across markets, 
across brands and across media channels.
 
With regards to productivity, we are diligently seeking, identify
ing and 
securing efficiencies across all parts of the business. This effort is focused on 
standardizing and streamlining our processes, while also clarifying roles and 
accountabilities.

Second, about 50% of our plants in North America have completed an 
operational excellence diagnostic
 
with the remainder scheduled to do so by 
2015. This is resulting in savings of approximately $1 million for each 
location and following each implementation to focus on year

And third, in our warehouse and delivery operati

point

of

sale by unlocking the power of our
 
system. Our focus on winning at 
the point
-
of
-
sale is not new. What is new is the increased emphasis on 
flawless execution across our system.
 
This includes an accelerated focus on capturing new outlook and greater 
alignment in the execution of new brand an

intent on exceeding our Right Execution Daily or RED targets and ensuring 
that our products are well placed as well as merchandized to optimize our 
sales.
 
This fourth priority emphasizes the importance of capability building
 
and 
collaboration on all frontlines where our sales associates, drivers, 
merchandisers are often the final link in ensuring that our Coca
-
Cola and all 

 
The first quarter, we saw many concrete examples 
of how together with our 
bottling partners, we are winning at the point
-
of
-
sale, including excellent 
execution of our Sochi marketing campaign leading to significant share gains 
across almost all beverage categories in Russia, occasion, brand, price, pack,
 
channel, architecture changes in many countries, including a significant 
focus on immediate consumption package reductions leading to immediate 
consumption volume growth ahead of future consumption growth and an 
improved RED penetration and scores. Right 
Execution Daily now covers 
approximately 40% of our volume, an increase of about three points over 
the past year.
 
And our FIFA World Cup Trophy Tour program has now reached 90 
countries, where our bottling partners have activated the program in 
400,000 ret
ail outlets. Importantly, the partnership required to win at the 
point
-
of
-
sale extends beyond our bottling partners to include our customers, 
the more than 24 million retail outlets that we proudly visit on a weekly 
basis. We are continuously collaborating
 
with our customers to identify ways 
to add value to their business.
 
Our fifth and final priority is to invest in our next generation of leaders both 
here in the U.S. and all across the world. In this context, I want to remind 

 
last quarterly earnings call and I want to 
commend and acknowledge him on an outstanding 14 years as the Coca
-

 
e sincerely thank Gary for his many years of outstanding leadership service, 
his steady focus, countless insights and the eno
rmous value he has helped 
to generate for our company and all of our shareowners. Collectively, he and 
his finance leadership team have carried out a thoughtful and purposeful 
transition.

next week. And this is a great example of the talented and experienced 
bench strength that we are building with our next generation of talented 
leaders. I hope all of you welcome Kathy to the role of Chief Financial 
Officer.
 
As our fifth priority outli

generation of leaders across all levels of the Coca
-
Cola Company and Coca
-

clinical strategic priorities and look forward to providing y
ou with further 
update as we progress throughout this year.
 
Now, let me address a couple of other topics across our operating groups. 
First, there is the question of profitability in North America, where 
comparable currency neutral operating income decline
d 8% in the quarter. 
This decline was largely due to the impact of one less selling day and the 
shift of Easter into the second quarter.
 

several North American markets in recent months. 

the trends that we are seeing.
 
Enhanced marketing and disciplined retail pricing strategies in North America 
resulted in volume that was even to brand Coca
-
Cola. At the same time, we 
achieved a 2% increase in sparkling price/mix. We
 
also gained sparkling 
value share ahead of volume share making this our 16th consecutive quarter 
of value share gain.
 
Our priorities in North Americas remain very clear. As we shared in our year 
end call, our focus remains on building strong 
brands, creating customer 

and identifying ways to operate more effectively and efficiently in our sales 
warehouse and delivery operations.
 
I also want to speak to our results in Europ
e, where our volume was down 
4% as our business was adversely impacted due to the Easter shift and by 
ongoing macroeconomic challenges. Volume in France increased 4% and 
volume in Germany was even with prior year.
 
During the quarter, our Europe group reali
zed 10 points of price/mix, thanks 
to the consolidation of Innocent and to a broad focus on earnings price 
--
 
earning price across our business units in Europe. We seek to continuously 
earn price/mix by balancing disciplined pricing with packaging changes.
 
A 
recent example of this is the transition from a straight
-
wall 2
-
liter to a 
contour 1.75
-
liter at the same price in Great Britain at the end of the first 
quarter.
 

despite the conti
nuing volatile operating environment. The strong and 
integrated programs that we have developed together with our bottling 
partners fuel this optimism. These initiatives will help us leverage our 
marketing assets, implement critical and innovative packagin
g and 
dispensing initiatives and execute impactful marketing programs during the 
year to come.
 
Number of these initiatives in Europe began in the first quarter, including the 
FIFA World Cup promotions and three

offering our Co
ke Zero consumers a chance to win one of the 200 tickets to 
Brazil, a new Fanta marketing campaign and in

ropean belt.
 

the year due to various factors such as the timing of Easter, a ramp
-
up in 
World Cup activations as well as the timing and intensity of our marketing 
programs.
 
Before han
ding over the call to Gary, I want to also remind you about our 
recently announced partnership with Keurig Green Mountain which closed in 
the first quarter. We believe Keurig Green Mountain is the perfect strategic 
partner to collaborate with, to capitaliz
e on the many opportunities we see 
available in the market and we look forward to providing you with further 
updates later in the year.
 
As I complete my prepared remarks, I want to reinforce that there is so 
much runway ahead of us and the Coca
-
Cola system
 
is well positioned to 
capture more than our fair share of growth. This is a business that has 
barely tapped into its full potential.
 
Globally, consumer populations are growing, purchasing power is increasing 
and spreading to a new middle class. Urbanizati
on continues to intensify and 
lifestyles and consumer preferences are changing in ways that significantly 
favor our expanding and evolving beverage portfolio. We have an 
unparalleled reach with leading global brands and a bottling system that is 
investing 
for sustainable growth.
 
Having said that, we do not take anything for granted. We fully understand 
that attaining our 2020 Vision will require more than just counting on 
industry growth. Indeed, it is up to all of us, up to our global system leaders 
and up
 
to each of our associates to make the right decisions and to take the 
right actions that are going to enable us to seize the abundant opportunities 
that are before us.
 
Gary will now provide you with some additional details on our first quarter 
financial p
erformance.
 
Gary Fayard
 
Thanks, Muhtar, and good morning everyone. In the first quarter of this 
year, we began executing and delivering the strategic plan that we outlined 
and shared with you on our 2013 year end call and at the CAGNY and CAGE 
Investor Con
ferences earlier this year. Our clear and focused commitment 
remains a long
-
term value creation and the strategic priorities, which Muhtar 
just outlined today and they are tailored to do just that.
 

 
strategies and 
are fully committed to this plan, as we firmly believe that the Coca
-
Cola 
Company is a sustainable and great long
-
term growth business. As 
mentioned, we grew unit case volume 2%, a sequential improvement from 
last quarter and cycling 4% gro
wth in the prior year.
 
Global price mix increased by 2% and we gained both volume and value 
share in non
-
alcoholic ready
-
to
-
drink beverages in the first quarter, a 
constructive start towards restoring our momentum in 2014.
 
Comparable currency neutral net r
evenue grew 2% after excluding structural 
items, while concentrate sales were even with the prior year. We do expect 
concentrate sales and unit case sales to be in line for the full year. 
Comparable currency neutral operating income grew a solid 7% after 
e
xcluding structural items, while also including an increase in marketing 
investments in support of our brands.
 
Comparable currency neutral earnings per share grew 5% with currency 
creating a 10 point headwind on comparable EPS. And for the math people in 
t

headwind. So, I just wanted to point out that the 10 point headwind is in the 
rounding.
 
We generated $1.1 billion in cash from operations and our net share 
repurchases through the f
irst quarter were $713 million. Our cash from 
operations increased significantly versus the prior year quarter, primarily 
because we made a large contribution to our pension plan in the first quarter 
of last year.
 
Cash from operations also benefited from e
fficient management of working 
capital and these benefits were partially offset by unfavorable exchange. 
Because our largest pension plan is currently fully funded, I do not foresee 
any significant cash contributions to our pension plan in the near term. A
s it 
relates to overall cash management, as we have discussed in the past, we 
follow disciplined guidelines for how we use our cash to create sustainable 
shareowner value.
 

our bra
nds and to accelerate growth. This includes capital investments and 
new cooler placements, route
-
to
-
market enhancements, brand and 
packaging innovations and marketing investments that include not only 
more marketing but better quality marketing as well.
 
Im
portantly, along with our increased investments, our bottling partners are 
also stepping up their investments, thus further enhancing growth for the 
overall system. Second, we continue to reward shareowners by paying a 
healthy dividend, which is $1.22 per 
share this year, a 9% increase over last 

more than half a century.
 
Third, we evaluate opportunities to grow through bolt
-
on acquisitions, 
strategic partnerships and value
-
added joint 
ventures when appropriate. 
Recent examples include the Keurig Green Mountain partnership, which 
opens up an exciting new packaging format for our brands, investments to 
further enhance our leading juice portfolio like Innocent and Rani and 
investments that
 
allow us to broaden our reach like ZICO and Core Power. 
And finally we conduct meaningful regular share repurchase.
 
As we look to the second quarter of 2014, we plan on continuing to execute 
our five strategic priorities and our full year plan remains fir
mly intact. First, 
let me address operating leverage. As you can see in our release, we 
achieved four points of operating expense leverage in the quarter as we 
benefited from the timing of year
-
over
-
year expenses.
 
Consistent with what we shared with you on
 
our year end 2013 call, our 
outlook for operating expense leverage for the full year 2014 has not 
changed. We expect to achieve even the slightly positive operating expense 
leverage for the full year as we increase brand investments.
 
Secondly, let me addr
ess the outlook for currency. We now estimate based 
on current spot rates and hedging that currencies will have a seven point 
headwind on operating income both in the second quarter and for the full 
year. Our analysis reflects and includes the negative imp
act of the Venezuela 
currency devaluation, partly offset by improvements in other currencies as 
compared to the outlook we provided at the time of our year end earnings 
release.
 
While we are very cautious in forecasting currency movements, we have 
managed 
through more than $2 billion of currency headwinds at the topline 
in the last two years. And as you know, we anticipate significant currency 
headwinds for the remainder of this year. As we look further into the future, 

ve the same level of headwinds going 
forward.
 
Third, I would like to comment on structural change. As we previously 
disclosed, the bottling transactions completed in 2013 are anticipated to 
have an unfavorable 1% structural impact on both our full year 201
4 
revenues and operating income. As a reminder, this impact hits the first and 
second quarter results as the Brazilian bottler transaction took place on July 
3rd of last year.
 
As Muhtar noted earlier, I have elected to retire next month after a very 
specia
l and memorable 20 years at the Coca
-
Cola Company. And I want to 
congratulate Kathy Waller on being recommended to the Board for election 

leadership in this position given her 25 years at 
the company.
 
I have to say, as a retiring officer with this company, it is comforting to 
know that I leave the CFO office in great hands and that we have built a 
talented and deep finance leadership organization that will support both 
Kathy and 
Muhtar. It also gives me great comfort to look around this room 
this morning during our conference call with Muhtar, Irial, Ahmet, Sandy, 
Kathy and Jackson and to think about the experience, focus and dedication 

 

en a tremendous honor to serve as CFO of the Coca
-
Cola Company 
over the past 14 years and I have greatly enjoyed building long lasting 
relationships with all of you across our investment community.
 

, I have every 
confidence that our ability to reignite sparkling growth beginning with brand 
Coca
-
Cola. Second, we are continuing to build leadership positions in still 
beverages, much like we have done in the sparkling category since 1886.
 
And third, our 
franchise system is not only the strongest it has ever been but 
it also provides us with a global footprint and an invaluable local resource, all 
at the heart of a real value creation model. And lastly, there is nothing quite 
as refreshing as an ice cold C
oca
-
Cola.
 
So to all of you on this call, I sincerely thank you for your candor, your 
partnership and your thoughtful questions over the last 14 years. And I 
encourage you to continue to reach out to the senior leadership team for 
meaningful dialogue, or wa
ys to further enhance our business and to build 
long
-
term value for you and all of our shareowners.

Consumer Edge Research
 
Muhtar, if you could talk about what g
ives you the confidence that Coke can 
hit its long
-
term growth algorithm in 2014 specifically? And also, when you 
look at the improving momentum during the first quarter, how much would 
you attribute to any relief you are seeing in external headwinds versu
s the 
impact of the internal actions that you are taking? Thanks.
 
Muhtar Kent
 
Thanks, Bill. Good morning. First, let me say again that I am pleased to 
report that our growth momentum is improving in line with our expectations. 
And in the midst of still con
tinued volatility headwinds, achieving 
sequentially stronger 2% volume growth, that means delivering an 
incremental 100 million unit cases in the past 90 days or so, that means 
incrementally every single day, an additional 27 million actual servings for 
ea
ch day.
 
As the base grows, we are still very proud that we can continue to drive 

cycling 4% from prior year, whereas as I said, macro volatility continued and 
where we had the harsh
est winter in the northern hemisphere, particularly in 

right direction to restore momentum.
 
Germany, U.S. was flat in the past quarter. We think given what we went 
through and
 
what economies and consumer and climate. Turkey was up 2%, 
Japan was up 3%, France was up 4%, Brazil was up 4%, India and Russia 
was up 6%, China was up 12%. These show and give us the proof points 
that our actions are working. And I think this is the qua
rter again, where 
only a small fraction of our incremental marketing was deployed.
 
I would say probably around 
--
 
so 5% of our total incremental marketing for 
the year was deployed in this first 
--
 
in this quarter. As we ramp up the 
quality and also quanti
ty of our marketing, I believe that certainly we are 
going to drive better alignment. We have really good plans in place fully 
aligned with our bottling partners and I would be disappointed as would be 

nto the corridor of our 
long
-
term growth algorithm for volume growth.
 
But also importantly, we are driving not just volume growth but we are 
driving immediate consumption growth, which is really important for our 
business. When you look at say in this past
 
quarter, our top five countries 
growing, as China up 18% in IC growth, Indonesia up 9% in IC growth, 
Vietnam up 8%, Brazil up 5%. These are really important numbers because 

w
hich is directly married to the health of the brands and health of our 
portfolio.
 
So from that perspective again, I want to just register a cautious optimism 
that I feel we would be disappointed if we do not fall back into the corridor 
of our long
-
term gro
wth algorithm for the remainder of the year in terms of 
the volume growth picture and also the other key metrics that follow on 
from there.

Hi. Good morning. And Gary and Kathy both 
--
 
congratulations to both of 
you.
 
Gary Fayard
 
Thanks, Bryan.

Just wanted to drill in 
a little bit further on Latin America and I guess sort of 
three topics. One in Mexico with volumes 
--
 
the volume decline was a little 
bit less than we thought, so if you could just talk about whether 
--
 
what we 
are seeing now is sort of the expected elasti
city, or if there is something else 
in the future that might change the elasticity, so has the consumer really 
seen the full effect of the pricing?
 
And then second, if you could just talk a little bit about some of the drivers 
of price
-
mix in the Latin Ame
rica segment in the quarter, how much of it was 
driven by Venezuela? And then finally, just in terms of the Brazil comp being 
better sequentially, how much of that do you think is just that, maybe the 
consumer is a little bit better, was there anything spe
cific that Coke did in 
the first quarter to drive the better performance in Brazil?
 
Muhtar Kent
 
Bryan, good morning. Last question first, on Brazil. I think Brazil was out the 
gate first in terms of the FIFA World Cup activation, a lot of noise around 
that
, lot of activation in stores. And I think that certainly we also see a little 
less malaise in terms of the macro environment. And again, in terms of also 
the relationship between durables and non
-
durable consumer goods was a 
little bit more in favor for u

Brazil will have a better year and I think the government is also aware of 
what they need to do, as they lead into one of the biggest events in their 
history, which is hosting a memorable event like the World
 
Cup.
 
As far as Mexico is concerned, I think sparkling volume for us was sort of in 
the mid
-
single digits decline for the first quarter. The important thing here is 
that because of the strength of our brands, because of also the incredible 
richness of our 
package portfolio and our occasion, brand, price, pack, 
channel architecture, the strength of that in Mexico, we are seeing that we 
are gaining market share versus both local competitors and our international 
competitor in Mexico as well. And again, we cou
ld start 
--
 
till early days 
related to Mexico but I would say that we are again executing with great 
precision and passion in Mexico with our great bottling partners.
 
And then in terms of price
-
mix, including that favorable geographic mix, 
other points cam

ask Gary to comment related to the Venezuela piece.
 
Gary Fayard
 
Bryan, Venezuela definitely contributed positively in the quarter to positive 
price
-
mix. Now with going forward, that will no 
longer really be the case 
because we have adjusted the 
--
 
as of the end of the quarter, we have 
adjusted the exchange rate that will be using the 10.8 exchange rate going 
forward for most of our revenues, a large part of the revenues in Venezuela. 
So that 
will come down but that impact is included in the latest currency 
forecast that I gave you. So again, some of the other currencies actually 
have improved from what we talked about in the February call that offset 
now by Venezuela. So still at the same 7% i
mpact.
 
Bryan Spillane 
-
 
Bank of America Merrill Lynch
 
As we are modeling price
-
mix in Latin America, just going forward, there is 
some price
-
mix in there that is positive, excluding Venezuela, I guess, that 
was what I was after?
 
Gary Fayard
 

finitely positive price
-
mix going in there. And I think the other 

important as you look at this quarter how we drove value share ahead of 
volume share. So we are definitely focused o
n rational pricing across the 
world and getting our earning price.

Thank you. The next question is from John Faucher with JPMC.
 
John Faucher 
-
 
JPMC
 
Thank you very much. 

best of luck as you move forward and Kathy looking forward to working with 
you as well.
 
Gary Fayard
 
Thanks, John.
 
John Faucher

JPMC
 
Gary, I had to finish off with sort of one accounting 
question here, so you 
guys drove tremendous SG&A leverage in the quarter and you talked a little 

yet. So, can you walk us through may be how we should think about the 
sales curve 
over the next couple of quarters and what we should look for on 
the SG&A line, as we look to model out the balance of the year? Thanks.
 
Gary Fayard
 


bout it in two different ways. One is, how 

referring to, how much of the marketing is actually hitting the consumer and 
a lot of our incremental spend actually has not hit the consu

much more weighted starting in the second quarter on through Q4. A lot of 
the first quarter really focused on getting the quality of our marketing up 

 
That is different from the way we account for marketing and market
ing as 
you reference is on the sales curve. So on the sales curve, that incremental 
marketing is included in what we expensed in the first quarter. Now, then, 
we get into the marketing that we are cycling quarter by quarter from last 
year. And so, it was a
n increase in marketing in the first quarter, the 
increase will significantly grow during the year based on what we are 
cycling. That is part of what I said, that 4 points of operating leverage will go 
to even the slightly positive and we are also benefiti
ng from some other 
timing in the first quarter in just some of the OpEx expenses as well.
 
John Faucher 
-
 
JPMC
 
Okay. And then Muhtar, if I could ask you a follow
-
up question on, you 
talked about the strength of the bottling systems and obviously the equity 
income line is getting hit by FX but we have seen some comments from 

cutting some positions in their soft drink business. Can you just talk a little 
bit about the mood of the bottlers 


how that may be will differ with what happens in the longer term there? 
Thank you.
 
Muhtar Kent
 
Yes. I would say the mood is positive in terms
 
of their willingness to invest, 

--
 

before in terms of litmus test for the health of the business. There is a lot of 
appetite for growing horizontally in territory and trying to get e
xpand. And I 
think in terms of the quality of our marketing, in terms of the quantity of our 
marketing, I feel that based on all the bottlers that I have questioned in this 
past quarter, I feel good, I feel positive about the sentiment both here in the 
Uni
ted States, as we start our path to franchising and as we look at how we 
expand and how we hasten the pace of franchising but also across the world.
 

We have a global system meeting n
ext month also where about 50 of the 
top bottlers get together with their CEOs and Chairman. And we are there to 
further align our plans for 2015 and beyond but I feel good related to the 

o invest 
more into the future.
 
And again, based on the investments that have gone into the marketplace in 
the third and fourth quarter of last year, I feel 
--
 

that you are going to see us back into the corridor of the 3% to 4% l
ong
-
term growth algorithm for the balance of the year, as we keep restoring 

challenges? You mentioned them Coca
-
Cola Amatil. I feel again very 
cautiously optimistic as Alison Watkins assumes 
a new role there and we are 
working very closely with her and her team. And again, we are very much 
aligned to how we move forward with SABMiller and their management team 
related to their non
-
alcoholic beverage business.
 
John Faucher

JPMC
 
Great. Thank y
ou.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. The next question is from Judy Hong with Goldman Sachs.
 
Judy Hong 
-
 
Goldman Sachs
 
Thank you. Good morning, everyone. And I also echo my congratulations to 

 
Gary Fayard
 
Thank you, Jud
y.
 
Judy Hong 
-
 
Goldman Sachs
 
Thank you. So just wanted to may be delve a little bit into Europe in the 
quarter and the question number one, just relating to Great Britain, 
obviously sparkling being down double
-
digits. If you can give us some 
context of tre

out some of the one
-
off factors with respect to the Easter timing as well as 

seeing some improvement there.
 
And then just 
in terms of Southern Europe, we are hearing more from some 
of the consumer companies that things are trending a little bit better in 
markets like Spain and Portugal. So may be you can also just give us 
whether we are seeing a similar improvement for your b
usiness in that part 
of Europe?
 
Gary Fayard
 
Thanks, Judy. I will ask Ahmet to give you a response on to your question. 
Ahmet?
 
Ahmet Bozer
 
Thanks Judy. Yeah, the results obviously for Europe for the first quarter was 
less than what we would have desired wit
h minus 4%. A lot of things came 
into play with that. You mentioned, the Easter obviously that was definitely a 
factor and Muhtar has mentioned the transition into a new future 
consumption back in GB. I would add to that that there was sort of a pricing 
ac
tivity in the marketplace on future consumption facts that had also had 
some impact and we are in very close discussion on alignments with our 
bottlers to make sure that we actually sort of respond in a way that we 
maintain rational pricing in the marketpl
ace but also balance volume growth 
and value growth at the same time, so that was one.
 

sees in Iberia and Spain that we see as well. Our numbers had a bit of noise 

s to the strike in our Iberian bottling partners that you all 

executed them and the negotiations at all the sites, the restructuring is 
expected to end in May and we will continue to se
e improvements in our 
Iberian business as well. So we expect, as we move into quarter two, 
remove the effect of Easter, fully implement OBPPC in GB and continue to 
finish our restructuring in Spain. We expect to see improvements in Europe 
over the next qua
rter and the rest of the year.
 
Judy Hong 
-
 
Goldman Sachs
 
Okay. Great. And then if I can just follow
-
up on North American just on the 
pricing side. So sparkling up 2% seems encouraging but the broader North 
American pricing kind of being flattish. How shoul
d we think about that going 
forward? Do you expect to see the still pricing being a little bit more 
pressured or do we see improvements there going forward for the broader 
North American pricing turning positive?
 
Muhtar Kent
 
Yeah. Judy, this is 
Muhtar. Let me just frame again. Just a couple of 

us in Q1 and the strength of our marketing program, the strength of our 
commercial program leaves us to believe that we will s
ee improvement as 
we go into Q2 and Q3 and Q4 in Britain. That will take a while I would say. 
Again, the same phrase and motto for our U.S. business, rational pricing 

portfolio in the U.S. 

--
 
and Irial to reflect on our further details on that.
 
Sandy Douglas
 
Thanks, Muhtar. The pricing, we expect pricing for the full year in sparkling 
to actually improve from the first quarter. Our plan
s are in place with our 
customers, the market is rationale, our focus on immediate consumption 
growth will drive mix and our rate should continue to be healthy and even 
improved as we move through the second quarter and into the third quarter 

apping some promotional activity.
 

continues to grow, so it pulls down mix. We see opportunities however on a 

on to 
do that. Paul, Irial and I see opportunities on a category
-
by
-
category basis.
 


taking root and ou
r juice business continues to be advantage from a share 
perspective. And I think all of that wraps up from the pricing standpoint to a 
much more favorable profit outlook for the full year.
 

d 

come together with our price and volume plan for the year to produce profit 
growth for the full year. Irial?
 
Irial Finan
 

 
a long
-
term sustainable, 
profitable business in the U.S. And to do that with most of the balance of 
pricing and volume growth and pricing is a really critical part of that. And we 
will, in this year, end up with sparkling to 2% to 3% range in pricing or 
p



growth as well.
 
Judy Hong

Goldman Sachs
 
Great. Thank you.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. The next question is from Michael Steib with Credit Suisse.
 
Michael Steib

Credit Suisse
 
Good morning. I was wondering if you could comment on the performance of 
your key markets in Asia and particula
rly, China and Indonesia. The China 
volumes have rebounded quite strongly now for two or three quarters and I 


wh

low comparison basis still. And then similar question on Indonesia, volumes 

 
Muhtar Kent
 



particularly, pleasing was China, IC was up 18%, Indonesia IC was up 9%, 
Vietnam up 8%. These are really important for us as we drive 
profitable 
growth in our business.
 
And again, our newly architected packaging, our portfolio in China is really 
working with the smaller packs and the new price points. And I think also 
the new team certainly is really delivering what we expect of them as 
well as 
our bottlers with renewed focus. Both our bottling investments group but 
also Swire as well as Copco really doing a good job in the first quarter. And I 
think lot of really good investments and activity and commercial leadership 
is in place to cont
inue to drive that momentum both in the stills as well as in 
the sparkling portfolio in China. And so again Ahmet, if you want to just 

 
Ahmet Bozer
 
Yeah. I think Michael you listed a lot of reasons that my headline will be as 
all of the above but
 
let me color it a little bit. Certainly the new team and the 
new strategy that we covered with you last year is really coming together 

juices are growing and those are the catego
ry that we told you that we were 
betting on for our growth in China.
 

had some recent launches into a 2RMB water, which improves the 
profitability of that very, very early days and
 

encouraged with again very early results on some of our innovation which 
Schweppes be plus and just couple of weeks out, the plant is our isotonic.
 

s 
beginning to work for us. I would just caution us though, you did mention 
the easier cycle race from last year, that is definitely the case and 12% 

continued growth in China, proba
bly in the range of mid
-
to
-
high single
-
digit 

 
Muhtar Kent
 

grew 3% in sparkling and stills 
grew 4% in Japan in the quarter. And again, 
despite the longest monsoon that I have ever experienced in terms of 
season and how long it took, India grew 6% and should do much better 

t 
consecutive quarter of growth in India for us and including continued share 
gain.
 
Michael Steib 
-
 
Credit Suisse
 
Okay. And then Indonesia, could you just comment similarly?
 
Muhtar Kent
 

--
 

s and 
we have been focused on aligning with our bottling partner, Amatil there on 


a recent change in ma


beginning to deliver good results. Certainly, that market has so much more 
opportunity to grow in the coming years.
 
Michael

Thank you. The next question is from Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley.
 
Dara Mohsenian

Morgan Stanley
 
Good morning. First, Gary congrats on a great run and best wishes on the 
firm and congrats there Kathy 
also.
 
Gary Fayard
 
Thank you
 
Dara Mohsenian 
-
 
Morgan Stanley
 
And Muhtar, I was hoping to discuss if your expectations have changed at all 
here over the last year just regarding the long
-
term growth potential of the 
sparkling category. So not necessarily fro
m a market share front but more 
just in terms of category growth and if one looks at industry data, it looks 

categories. So, I was just hoping for some perspective on that, the drivers 
b
ehind it and expectations going forward?
 
Muhtar Kent
 
Yeah, no changes as far as my perspective is concerned. I can confirm that 
both, our entire team and as well as our bottling partners feel the same way 
as the system. We are blessed to be in a great busi
ness, both in the 
sparkling area as well as in the stills. We continue to innovate. I believe that 
we have a great future where so many 
--
 
hundreds of millions of people in 

-
Cola in the last month or in 
the last s
ix months or in the last year.
 
We have tremendous opportunity going forward and I believe that through 
innovation, packaging, equipment and great marketing, we will continue to 
grow our business going forward both in sparkling and in stills. And I feel 
con
fident that we will go back into the corridors of our long
-
term growth 
algorithm this year and years to follow. And with new innovations like 
creating new paths to consumptions, creating new consumption occasions 
like the Keurig Green Mountain innovation, 
like Freestyle that is driving, we 

traffic, it drives incidents, it drives increased sales and it drives excitement 
for the consumer.
 
And at the same time, our contour packages, you
 
will see us being focused 
much more on the contour. Next year is the 100th anniversary of the 


a 
great place where you have a lot of work to do and you believe in your 
future.
 
Dara Mohsenian 
-
 
Morgan Stanley
 
Okay. And on the innovation front in the U.S., can you give us a bit more 
detail in terms of maybe potential timing of sweetener innovation and h
ow 
impactful you think natural sweeteners could be to your topline results 
eventually?
 
Muhtar Kent
 

give you any more details on the timing.
 
Dara Mohsenian 
-
 
Morgan Stanley
 
Okay.
 
Thanks.
 
Muhtar Kent
 
Yeah. Sure. So, just thank you again, Gary, Kathy, Ahmet, Sandy, Irial, 

trajectory in 2014. Our strategic priorities are yielding tangible and 
measurable results 
and they are consistent with our long
-
term goals and our 
overarching business strategy.
 
Increased marketing investments and a focus, a relentless focus on 
execution underscore the confidence we have in our systems alignment as 
we seek to execute these stra
tegies, while we further strengthen the 
foundation for profitable and sustainable long
-
term growth.
 
Our 2020 Vision calls for a well balanced growth, that is growth in sparkling 
beverages and also growth in still beverages across more than 200 markets 
coun
tries and in revenues and margins. And thanks to this balanced growth 
in both portfolio as well as geographic mix, we see a path that leads to 
global volume, revenue and profit growth in line with our long
-
term target. 
Our focus is unwavering and our execu
tion of our five strategic priorities is 
going to enable us to restore momentum to growth to our business.
 
Thank you for your time this morning and for your continued interest and 
trust in our company.

referring to comparable performance from continuing operations. Following 
prepared remarks this morning, we will turn 
the call over for your questions. 
Please limit yourself to one question. If you have more than one question, 
please ask your most pressing question first, and then reenter to the queue.
 
Now let me turn the call over to James.
 
James Quincey
 
Thanks, Tim, and
 
good morning everyone. 2018 is of to a good start back by 
strong financial performance and volume acceleration. Our results build on 
our continued execution against the strategic priorities that we first shared 
with you more than a year ago, accelerating 
ad transformation into total 
beverage with a broad consumer centric brand portfolio and asset light 
business model and a performance driven growth culture. Our strategies are 

deliver o
ur plan this year.
 
Improving global economy help non
-
alcoholic beverage industry grow a little 
faster and our actions enabled us to gain global value share. During the 
quarter, we delivered 5% organic revenue growth driven by growth across 
all our operatin
g segments. Concentrating shipments grew 4% driven by an 
acceleration at developing and emerging markets as well as the timing of 
shipments during the quarter. And price/mix was 1% trending lower than 
our recent rate largely due to timing across multiple m
arkets as well as the 
few factors impacting North America during the quarter.
 
Those of you who followed us closely will know that our organic revenue 
composition was driven more by volume and less by price than last year. 
While I expected top
-
line composit
ion, however, to be more balanced 
between volume and price/mix over the remainder of the year, I am 
encouraged with the stock for this year and the sustainability of that growth. 
Importantly, I am also pleased that we converted top
-
line growth into 9% 
unde
rlying operating income growth even in the face of arising cost 
environment.
 
As such I am confident in our ability to achieve our bottom line outlook.
 
Looking around the world, organic revenue growth and volume growth were 

ery operating segments. In addition to 
momentum in the business, volume benefited from the timing of Easter and 
Chinese New Year this year. We also saw revenue and volume growth in 
each of our category clusters as we continue to focus on our total beverage
 
platform. Even as we evolve our portfolio, our foundation is strong. For 
example, Trademark Coca
-
Cola led the way growing volume a healthy 4% 
globally due to improving trends in our developing and emerging markets 
along with strong momentum in our low and
 
no calorie beverage.
 
In North America, organic revenue grew 1% as stronger volume growth was 
partially offset by 1% decline in price/mix. We delivered solid performance in 
the marketplace gaining value share, innovation across our multiple category 
cluste
rs including sparkling and Zero Sugar portfolio drove strong consumer 
update. North American price/mix declined 1% as positive low single
-
digit 
underlying price was offset by a few factors which Kathy will walk you 
through.
 
We have given the change in repo
rted price/mix; I want to be clear our 
pricing strategy have not changed. We have seen clear benefit in our move 
from volume centric to value centric mindset and that velocity have not 
changed. You can see evidence of this as we achieved positive retail pr
icing 
in Nielsen all measure channels even with these during the quarter and since 
then we have seen retail pricing accelerated. We remain committed to take 
the actions needed to earn the price and value in the marketplace and we 
expect to achieve low sing
le digit price/mix for our total beverage portfolio in 
North America again this year.
 
Now looking at markets outside North America, Europe delivered strong 
organic revenue growth as we launch new products like FUZE TEA while 
continuing to drive revenue gro
wth management initiatives. China and India 
have accelerated top
-
line growth in the quarter and we also saw better 
performance in some of the markets that have been struggling, notably 
Brazil and Argentina. And let me just talk a little bit about some of t
he 
actions we have taken to achieve these results. Across all our markets and 
especially in the development markets, consumers are seeking more 
beverage choices while looking for products that fit different needs, moods 
and moments. To meet these desires, 
we are shaping and expanding our 
portfolio through innovation, expansion of the list, shift and scale model and 
bolt
-
on M&A all being driven by disciplined approach to growth.
 
For example, the global ready
-
to
-
drink tea category represents $60 billion in 
re
tail value and is projected to continue growing solidly as consumers seek 
out more natural beverage choices that can deliver functional benefits. Our 
tea portfolio has grown over the past several years cheaply behind the 
strength of brands, FUZE TEA, Ayata
ka and Gold Peak as well as strong local 
and regional brands such as Honest Tea.
 
Earlier I mentioned the launch of FUZE TEA in Europe. At the end of last 
year, FUZE TEA was available in almost 50 countries, but not yet been 
launched in Europe. At the begin
ning of this year, we initiated a complex 
rollout. This required a flexible and agile approach as we successfully 
launched the brands in 37 countries in a single day, but we still have a lot of 
distribution to build, we are ahead of plan. With this expansi
on, we have 
effectively doubled the value of the FUZE TEA brand globally. This is a great 
example of how we can rapidly lift and shipped proven successful brands and 
scale them quickly.
 
We are also working to get high growth brands we have acquired. Last 
O
ctober, we have acquired the U.S. rights to Topo Chico premium sparkling 
mineral water for Mexico. With that with the intent of using our venturing 
and emerging brands unit as an incubated guide the expansion in the 

nd of the first quarter, our first full 
quarter of ownership, we increased distribution coverage within the highly 
valuable convenience retail channel by 25%. Finally, we continue to innovate 

a
-
Cola Zero 
Sugar. During the first quarter, the Brand continued its trend of strong 
double
-
digit volume and revenue growth globally.
 
And in North America, we've been working hard to reinvigorate the Diet 
Coke brand through an integrated approach. We intro
duced new packaging, 
a new marketing campaign and new flavors designed to appeal to the next 

growth in North America. Now, we recognized it's still very early in the 
process, but 
we are encouraged by the initial consumer response. 
Importantly, I'm pleased to see the team take bold action to change the 
trajectory of the results.
 
Our strategy is to focus on specific growth disciplines and capabilities. Digital 
marketing is a capabili
ty that helps us to build strong connections with 
younger consumers. For example, during Chinese New Year, we launched a 
digital marketing campaign with one of the country's largest online and 
mobile payment providers. This integrated campaign connected br
and Coca
-
Cola with a cultural rituals of Chinese New Year through an augmented 

 
Packaging innovation is another capability that plays an important role in 
building and maintaining relevance, particularly when co
upled with broader 
marketing campaigns. Again in China, we created sleek cans with localized 
labels portraying cities across the country. We partnered with leading 
Internet providers to create an integrated digital experience where 
consumers learn more abo
ut these cities by scanning the counter on their 
mobile devices. This premium price revenue growth initiatives has been very 
successful in interacting a new generation of Chinese consumers. The two 
digital initiatives I just described are help to generate 
nearly 1 billion 
consumer impressions and supported the strong performance of Brand Coca
-
Cola in China where volume grew over 20% in the quarter.
 

challenging to setback and see the commonali
ties of driving 

 
that is driving 
our performance across the various categories and geographies. However, 
when I think about it, the shift in our culture, one that is moving faster, 
taking more risks and approaching growth with discipline, this is the sing
le 
largest driver of our performance. For example after launching FUZE TEA in 
Western Europe, we had an opportunity to enhance the attractiveness of our 
packaging to work with Coca
-
Cola European partners to revamp the 
packaging just launched, revamp the pa
ssion graphics in less than eight 
weeks. At the end of the day, speed and agility are critical for the success in 
this rapidly changing consumer landscape.
 
Of course, all of this is supported by a stronger global bottling system. Our 
bottling partners are 
energized. They are investing in capabilities and assets, 
driving enhanced execution and focused on bringing a total beverage 
portfolio to the customers. Looking towards the reminder of the year, there's 
a lot of activity ahead. We are implementing new rev
enue growth 
management initiatives in several countries, launching new products across 
geographies and adapting to new taxes in certain markets like the U.K. and 
South Africa. With that said I'm confident in our overall plan and with the 
guidance we laid o
ut at the beginning of the year. Specifically, we expect to 
deliver 4% organic revenue growth and 8% to 10% comparable EPS growth 
this year.
 
Kathy, over to you.
 
Kathy Waller
 
Thanks and good morning everyone. We delivered solid underlying financial 
results 
slightly ahead of our expectations due to the timing of shipments 
with 5% organic revenue growth and operating expense leverage driving 9% 
growth in underlying operating income. This translated into strong 
comparable EPS growth of 8%. And based on where we
 
stand today, we 
remain confident that we can deliver our full year guidance of 4% organic 
revenue growth and 8% to 10% comparable EPS growth.
 
Today, I will cover three topics: price/mix, our comparable results and our 
outlook. Starting with price/mix, as 
James mentioned, our consolidated 
price/mix turned at lower than our recent run rate largely due to timing as 
well as a few factors impacting North America during the quarter. However, 
as we move through the year, we expect the timing factors to reverse in
to a 
net benefit and for the pressures in North America to moderate, resulting in 
stronger global price/mix.
 
In North America price/mix during the quarter was unfavorably impacted by 
the timing of new product launches, incremental outbound freight 
costs and 
the shift of the Easter holiday. Like other CPG companies, we faced 
significant headwinds in North America this year. Historically, we have 
accounted for the cost of outbound freight as reduction from revenue. 
Therefore, it impacts our price/mix 
calculations. We estimate that this will be 
a 1
-

loaded due to the timing of when freight costs began increasing last year.
 
Outside of North America, emerging and developing markets outpac
ed 
developed markets in both our Asia Pacific and EMEA operating groups, 
impacting price/mix at the group level. However, at the local level, we 
generated positive price/mix in most of our markets. And in Latin America, 
we continued to benefit from strong 
price/mix in our Mexico and South Latin 
business units while operating in an overall low inflationary environment.
 
Turing to our comparable financial performance in the quarter, as I 
mentioned on our fourth quarter call, there are two factors creating nois
e in 
our comparable financial performance this year, with varying impacts by 
quarter and by operating segment. So first, structural. We expect 
comparable revenue and operating income to decline on an absolute basis. 
The growth in operating margins to impro
ve as we cycle exiting lower 
margins, capital intensive businesses last year.
 
Second, [indiscernible]. As we mentioned on the fourth quarter call, two new 
accounting standards went into effect this quarter. The first required 
companies to split out net pen
sion expense, keeping these service costs and 
SG&A and moving other components of pension expense to other income. So 
in accordance, we issued reclassified 2017 quarterly and full year financial 
information on April 3
rd
 
and now to you are comparable.
 
The s
econd pertains to revenue recognition. The primary impact this quarter 
is that certain revenue and costs and contracts that were previously netted 
together in revenue are now grossed up into the revenue [indiscernible] 
components. We expect this to result 
in higher growth in both comparable 
net revenue and cost of goods sold, with no material impact to gross profit 
or operating income for the full year. However, this will mathematically 
affect the calculation of growth and operating margins. An example is 
o
utbound freight. We just now, after the implementation of the new revenue 
recognition standard, accounted for as part of cost of goods sold.
 
As I said earlier, this was previously recorded as a reduction to revenue 
price of the customer includes outbound f
reight. However, we applied this 
accounting change perspective does not restate our historical financial 
statement. Therefore, in organic revenue, we have adjusted for that change 
to make our 2018 quarterly results comparable to the 2017 compared to the 
pe
riod. As a result, both our organic revenue growth and price/mix will 
continue to be impacted by the outbound freight costs this year.
 
So looking at our performance in the quarter, comparable net revenue 
declined as organic revenue growth and benefits from
 
the new accounting 
standard and a currency tailwind were more than offset by a 26% structural 
impact from cycling bottler refranchising last year. However, comparable 
operating margin increased 600 basis points due to refranchising and strong 
underlying p
erformance, partially offset by an almost 100 basis point impact 
from the new accounting standards.
 
Below the line, higher net interest expense offset higher other income and 
equity income in the quarter and our lower effective tax rate and net share 
repur
chases contributed to comparable EPS of $0.47, up 8% in the quarter. 
Finally, we generated approximately $340 million of free cash flow, up 5% 
driven by reduced capital investment needs as we divest bottling operations, 
partially offset by the impact of on
e less day in the quarter.
 
Now looking at the remainder of the year, our full year guidance remains 
intact, 45 organic revenue, 8% to 10% comparable EPS growth and at least 
$8.5 billion in cash from operations. As you model the flow of the year, there 
are 
a few items to consider in terms of phasing. Consistent with what we 
said on the fourth quarter call, we still expect full year EPS growth to be 
driven by the second half of the year, primarily due to the timing of 
expenses and productivity initiatives. Al
so in the first quarter, concentrate 
shipment outpace the volume growth, particularly in our EMEA operating 
segment. This pulls some revenue and profit into the first quarter.
 
As we move through the remainder of the year, we expect this to normalize, 
with 
full year concentrate shipment running in line with unit case volume 
growth. Now there are also a few things to consider specific the second 
quarter. We are adapting to new sugar excise taxes in both the U.K. and 
South Africa while cycling strong results f
rom Western Europe last year. 
While we feel confident in our strategies and ability to adapt our portfolio to 
the new operating environment, we expect some level of impact, particularly 
as consumers first adjust to the new prices.
 
And we are cycling a low 
SG&A base last year due to the timing of expenses. 
From a nonoperational perspective, we expect a 4 to 5 point headwind from 
structural items and a 1 point headwind from currency on operating income. 
And we expect to change in revenue recognition to be a 1
 
to 2 point tailwind 
to revenue. And while we still expect the revenue recognition to have no 
impact to operating income for the full year, we do expect a 2 point 
headwind to operating income in the second quarter that reverse in the third 
quarter.
 
So thes
e considerations taken together will put pressure on comparable EPS 
in the second quarter relative to our full year targets. As always, our 
Investor Relations team will be happy to walk through each element in more 
detail as you build out your models for t
he year. So in summary, we 
delivered solid underlying financial performance in the quarter. This 
translated into strong comparable EPS growth and we are on track to deliver 
our full year guidance of 8% to 10% comparable EPS growth.

So I just wanted to touch on the mix of your organic sales growth in the 
quarter. Clearly, we saw shift away from price/mix more to volume g
rowth, 
which is opposite of what we've seen in the last few years. And don't get me 
wrong, it was great overall result, but I just wanted you to sort of flesh that 
out a bit more. A, on the volume front, are you feeling more comfortable 
there with the good
 
Q1 result? What drove the pickup? How sustainable is it? 
Maybe can touch on emerging markets there.
 
And then B, on pricing, should we expect more modest pricing going 
forward? And why? And I heard the comments about underlying pricing 
being solid in North
 
America for Coke. But with your key competitors seeing 
weaker pricing in scanner data and some pushback we've heard from 
retailers around pricing across the CPG landscape, I'd love sort of an update 
on the competitive environment commentary in the U.S. Th
anks.
 
James Quincey
 
Sure, let me start with the volume. I mean I think volume has accelerated 
across the board. As I mentioned in the comments, it's not just broadly 
geographically based. It's broad in terms of the categories. So there is no 
silver bullet 
or one lever there. It's really the sum, the right strategies, the 
innovation, the programs, the execution by the bottlers that are creating 
value for the customer. It's really a broad
-
based effort that has been 
ongoing across the system. Yes, the macros i
n some of the emerging 
markets have improved slightly, and of course, that is helping a little bit. So 
I think it's broad
-
based for the right reasons.
 
And I make that point because, actually, what we're doing in pricing is also 
consistent with the strategy
 
and what we've been doing for the last number 
of years. So actually, the two things are working together. But let me make 
a couple of points on pricing. Firstly, now that we've refranchised so much 
about bottling revenue, the revenue of us as a concentrat
e business or 
largely a concentrate business is further down the supply chain. So some of 
these timing impacts of shipments or other things tend to be a little 
magnified but more magnified than they were in the past when you look at 
some of the groups.
 
I 
think that's just worth bearing in mind going forward. And then when you 
look at pricing on a global basis, as we talked about, underlying pricing in 
the marketplace is good. It's very consistent with what we've been doing 
over the last few years. But ther
e are certain types of timing effects that 
have reduced how that looks in the P&L. So the marketplace has the pricing. 
In a way, our operational pricing through to the marketplace is consistent 
with what's going on in the marketplace. But globally, that ha
s been reduced 
coming into the P&L for a couple of timing things.
 
One, some of the gallons that we sold in the first quarter, which were ahead 
of cases, were particularly in some of the developing and emerging markets 
where the average price tends to be a 
bit lower. And so that kind of 
mechanically brings down the price. That's a quarter
-
to
-
quarter effect that 
will wash itself out. Similarly, we had a timing effect that brought out more 
revenue reductions into the first quarter. So again, that will wash its
elf out 
in the rest of the year. Some of the stuff that is more ongoing geographic 
mix, the developing, the reemergence of the developing and emerging 
markets, which is good for volume, tends to be a little more pressure on 
price/mix.
 
And a lower inflation
 
in Latin America, those perhaps is a little more 
contained. But we absolutely believe that once you look past these kind of 
quarter to quarter effect, you will see good global pricing going forward very 
consistent with what we have been doing over the las
t few years. And then 
specifically, our North America, the minus one is not consistent with where 
we expect the full year to end up. There are a number of things in North 
America. One is the timing is much more 
--
 
the Easter is much more in the 
first quart
er. The freight that Kathy talked about and then we're giving a 
kind of an old accounting comparison where is a deduction for revenue, and 
that will mitigate as we go into the rest of the year.
 
And then we're cycling some of the big innovations in the firs
t quarter over 
last year, which drove up price per gallon and some of the packaging stuff 
we're doing. All of these things will moderate in North America for the rest of 
the year. And so we haven't our strategy. You can see in the Nielsen's that 
we're gett
ing pricing in the marketplace. We fully expect that to continue for 
the rest of the year. And so low single digit is much more likely for North 
America, and that's our expectation. So we have an outlook of 4% globally 
for the full year. We expect that to 
be balanced between volume and price. 
And so we look through these quarterly of the timing of things, which as I 
said a little more magnified now given that business model. We are on track 
with our strategy and execution.

And our next question com
es from Bryan Spillane from Bank of America 
Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.
 
Bryan Spillane
 
Good morning everyone.
 
Kathy Waller
 
Good morning.
 
James Quincey
 
Good morning, Bryan.
 
Bryan Spillane
 
I guess, James in your prepared remarks you have mentioned 
or Kathy I 
guess, you have mentioned Great Britain in the second quarter and the 
sugar tax. And now that it's in the market, can you just give any sort of 
early read, not so much on performance, but just how the consumers 
reacted to it, how you feel like y
our marketing, your messaging around the 
preparing for this has resonated with consumers? Just any sort of early sort 
feedback I guess if you will in terms of it being in the market and how 
consumers are responding to it? It would be helpful.
 
James Quincey
 
Bryan, good morning. I honestly think it's too early, but let me tell you what 
we've been doing and what's been happening. The U.K. sugar tax, unlike 
some other countries, is actually a tier tax. So at the certain level of sugar, 

u go down and sugar, it's a more moderate tax and 
then below a certain level, there's no tax. But we have done a number of 
things. We have reformulated a number of our major brands that reduced 
the sugar level. We have really pushed hard on the One Brand s
trategy for 
Coca
-
Cola.
 
So we still have Coke original there, but we put really hard on Coke Zero 
and really hard on the invigorating Diet Coke such that about two thirds of 
that total portfolio will not pay the sugar tax because of the way we have 
adapted 
the reformulations for the GB marketplace. On top of that, we've 
put a lot of emphasis on smaller packaging in the GB marketplace and 
changes in packaging sizes to try and accommodate this in the way that 
shoppers actually go for the occasions and the ritu
als that they are part of in 
the U.K. So we've been building towards this. This is obviously something 
that's been in the works for long time [indiscernible] tax that we have 
adapted.
 
So the first thing is I think about we actually the rest of the industry
 
and the 
retailers have adopted a lot of this regime. So I don't think it's going to be 
as disruptive for the marketplace as perhaps some of the other ones. Yet, it 
is also going to reduce calories effectively. And that's been in the 
marketplace, I guess, 
now for three weeks. It is worth nothing that in the 
course of those three weeks, it's been like the hardest Easter like for a long 
time.
 
It was like 29 degrees centigrade last weekend in the U.K. So I'm sure the 
beverage industry is pretty well in those f
irst three weeks kind of 
irrespective of pricing. But it's way too early to call. I think the GB team has 
done a great job with Coca
-
Cola European partners in preparing for this. I'm 
sure it will have some disruption on Coke original in Q2. The rest of the
 
portfolio is set up to continue with the pricing strategy we have before. So I 
don't think it is going to be too disruptive, but I think there will be some 
impact.

Our next question comes from Nik Modi from RBC Capital Markets. Your line

Nik Modi
 
Yeah, thanks. Good morning everyone.
 
James Quincey
 
Hi.
 
Kathy Waller
 
Hi.
 
Nik Modi
 
Maybe some thoughts James from you on early metrics on the Diet Coke 
relaunch. I know it's still early. I know, obviously, it did well in terms of 
retail 
display activity, et cetera. But maybe you can just key us in on what 
you're seeing at a consumer level in the early innings.
 
James Quincey
 
Sure, yeah, I mean 

 
I am not a big fan of drawing a trend line through one 
quarter. Look, we did three things. We'v
e been learning over last couple of 
years. The team has been learning on what is going to help a great ramp 
like Diet Coke reengage with some of the last consumers and with new 
consumers. And I think this round, we came up with some good marketing, 
soma re
invigorated packaging, shapes, sizes and looks and, obviously, the 
flavors 
--
 
the innovation on the flavors. And I think the combination of those 
three things was bold enough and interesting enough to not just engage 
some of the people who, perhaps that bl
ast from Diet Coke but also 
millennials and even some of the people who are, perhaps, drinking flavored 
sparkling water.
 
So I think, when you look at where the change in volume trend is coming 
from, it's those three groups, which is good news for a brand l
ike Diet Coke. 

we say, we put a lot of our effort in Q1. But whichever way it goes, whether 
it continues or softens a little in Q2, I think we are learning some interesting 
things ab
out what it takes to reinvigorate Diet Coke and brand. And so I'm 
encouraging the team to continue to learn and be bold with the next round 
of actions.

James Quincey
 
Good morning.
 
Kathy Waller
 
Good morning.
 
Carlos Laboy
 
James you have touched on this throughout the call, but with another 
quarter of experimentation done, can you expand on some of the examples 
that would inform us exte
rnally that the firm is becoming a bolder 
consumer
-
centric brand rather than brand
-
centric company?
 
James Quincey
 

experimentation for the sake of experimentation, but in the service of t
he 
consumer, in the service of wondering what will connect and engage with 
the consumer. And I think several of you heard me being use the old adage 
of never say never. And I think that was the main goal of doing anything 
that's great and it's about reconn
ecting with the consumer. And I think 
that's allowing us to go I think beyond our previous boundaries; whether it's 
the campaign that I just talked about on Diet Coke; whether it's the rapid 
expansion around the world of AdeS, which is the soy
-
based plant 
drink that 
we bought in Latin America and we've taken to Europe; whether it's the 
speed with which we've tried some of the reformulations on sugar reduction 
in Latin America or even some of the beverage innovation in Japan.
 
I mean, it's all about trying to
 
connect with the consumer. And then when 
we got something, let's not be shy about moving it around the world quickly, 
sometimes we have had good successes. We've been shy about moving 
them around the world. We've got to lift them. We've got to shift them.
 
We 
got to scale quickly. And examples of that are things like smartwater and 
FUZE TEA. And the last thought I'll leave you with on experimentation is 
we've got to be willing to kill the zombies. We can't have experimentation 
that is either success or cont
inuation. There has to be, no, this is a great 
--
 
it was a good idea. It didn't work for whatever reason, and it needs to be 
--
 
it needs to be pulled out because that's also a key part of experimenting is 
redirecting the resources to the next idea or doubl
ing down on something 
that works.

Our next question comes from Stephen Powers from Deutsche Bank. Your 
line is now open.
 
Stephen Powers
 
Thanks. Good morning.
 
James Quincey
 
Hi.
 
Stephen Powers
 
Hey, so a question on North American operating income. I
t looks like growth 
there was down noticeably in the quarter. Segment margins, I think, were 
down 400 basis points if my quick math is correct. And I just hoped you 
could bridge those year
-
over
-
year movements for me. How much was 
elevated freight effector 
versus accounting changes, the innovation and the 
Easter
-
led investments you mentioned? Just I would have thought that the 
underlying pricing ongoing productivity, the strong sparkling performance 
that we saw from a mix perspective would have all benefited
 
margins more 
than we might be seeing.
 
And maybe just a part of it, but just specifically the release says that profit 
was unfavorably impacted by a 6 point headwind from intercompany profit 
eliminations, elimination benefits last year, just can you remind
 
us what that 
was? Sorry for the rambling question, but I guess, what I'm trying to figure 

representative of what we might be seeing going forward or is it artificially 
depressed by some 
of the factors that we should be taking into effect? 
Thanks.
 
Kathy Waller
 
So, good morning, Steve. So, yes, margins for this quarter were 
compressed. And one part of that is that intercompany profit elimination that 
you talked about, that was a 6
-
point hea
dwind at operating income. As you 
remember when we transition territories, we take onetime benefit from 
being able to recognize the profit that we originally had to eliminate when 
they became intercompany. And that went to the numbers last 
--
 
fourth 
quarte
r of 2017, and now we have to cycle that and the same amount went 
down the P&L. So it's one amount of revenue, and it's the same amount of 
operating income, but it has a different impact at operating income, so the 6 
point headwind at operating income.
 
And then the other factors as we talked about revenue recognition, that's 
about 150 basis points margin headwind in North America although dollars 
are not compressed, but that is a margin headwind. And then there are a 
couple of other things with some timi
ng of SG&A in the quarter. And then 
there are cost pressures that we talked about earlier on inputs and things 
like juice and then there are freight costs. So all of those things are the

Our next question comes from Judy Hong from Goldman Sachs. Your line is 
now open.
 
Judy Hong
 
Thank you. Good morning.
 
Kathy Waller
 
Good morning.
 
James Quincey
 
Good morning, Judy.
 
Judy Hong
 
So, James, I guess I wanted to get a little bit more color on 
Latin America. I 
think it was one of the regions where it was going to be, perhaps, a swing 
factor this year in where it was going to be, perhaps, a swing factor this year 
in improving off of the 2017 base. And you saw a little bit of an 
improvement in Bra
zil, but it sounds like maybe there's more to go there. So 
just a little bit of color broadly there. And if I kind of hear your comments 
about revenue growth expectation for the full year of 4%, seems like if Lat 
Am comes up even more, there's maybe a litt
le bit of room to do better. At 
the same time, maybe your comments on Europe is a bit cautious, tax 
issues, weather comp issue, et cetera. So just kind of reconciling those two 
comments. Thanks.
 
James Quincey
 
Sure, I think Latin America clearly improved pa
rticularly Brazil and 
Argentina. I think as a point of reference or contract is that we're doing good 

from bad to okay, and there was modest volume growth in Brazil and 
Argentina. N
ow that's not to under appreciated work of the teams and to the 
bottlers in those countries, but they've been tough micro economically. 
They've been working very hard on revamping hard on revamping the 
packaging, revamping the execution, revamping the mark
eting. And they're 
starting to get some reward for their troubles. But it's still not out of the 
woods in the case of some of those countries.
 
And no doubt, the improvement will be a bit lumpy. But we're starting to see 
that plans they put in place, the re
turnables in Brazil and the return to 
growth in sparkling working and some of the category growth working in 
Argentina. So there's volume growth, which 
--
 
I mean, most of last year, we 

maybe a bit lumpy, but we're going again on the volume. It's worth saying 
that inflationary pressure is coming down in Latin America. So off 
--
 
you've 
got less pricing, perhaps, than we had over the last few years in Latin 
America, but a better volume perf


underlying fundamental. So I am not sure, I would see that balancing back 
that Latin America because one thing is sort of offsetting t
he other thing, but 
it's kind of a healthier mix.

Our next question comes from Lauren Lieberman from Barclays. Your line is 
now open.
 
Lauren Lieberman
 
Great, thanks. Good morning.
 
James Quincey
 
Good morning.
 
Kathy Waller
 
Hi.
 
Lauren Lieberman
 
I wan
ted to go back to freight again, separate from how the accounting 
change is impacting the presentation. But I was just curious, I guess, how 
much freight is up kind of year
-
over
-
year in North America because I'm just 
--
 
I guess I'm surprised by how much it
's still impacting you, given 
refranchising. So maybe, in that context, it'd also be helpful to just articulate 

not a 100% refranchising. How freight is actually flowing through
 
the impact 
of the business as much. Thank you.
 
James Quincey
 
Yeah, so I will start and if doesn't work that well, then Kathy will help me 
out. Freight in North America is up like 20% or something. I mean freight is 

 
change in regulation in terms of 
number of hours that the drivers can drive, et cetera, et cetera, and the way 
the organization of the freight is put together, and there've been changes to 
regulations. And that does to some extent reduced the number of dr
ivers or 
reduced the number of hours. And so freight is up 20%. Why is freight 
relevant for us?
 
While, we still have some in North America, even postre
-
franchising, we still 
have two bits of the business where we are kind of selling to customer, 

 

involved there to the final end user. And we provide a lot of the hot fill 
products to the bottling system and direct to some of the wholesale 
business. So again, we have freight. This 
is much, much more like the 

 
much 

 
and not like the rest of the world. This is very specific to the U.S. So 
that's where it comes in.
 
Now I would just point out that we, in a way, have taken the more asset 
version of category price/mix, which is under th
e old accounting standards 
where it's a deduction from revenue. In 2018 and going forward, freight is 
actually in cost of goods and not reducing price/mix. So that is 
--
 
if we have 
taken it out, price/mix would have been better, but just to make it apples
-
to
-
apples and make it easier for people to understand, we left it under the 
old scheme, but it's worth about a point of price/mix, and it's going to start 
washing out by the time we get into the second half.

Alright, thank you. Good morning.
 
James Quincey
 
Good morning.
 
Kathy Waller
 
Good morning.
 
Bonnie Herzog
 
I wanted to actually circle back on your price/mix in North America, which 
was negat
ive in the quarter and you touched on. But I guess, I'm wondering 
if you could give us a sense of your performance in the different channels. 
For instance, I'm wondering if the immediate consumption channel showed 
any signs of slowdown in the quarter. And 
then could you guys touch on 
pricing across different category clusters? It seems like you're getting 
healthy pricing in sparkling, driven by innovation and smaller packs, but 
maybe less so in other category clusters. So if you could touch on this, it 
woul
d be helpful. Thanks.
 
James Quincey
 
Yes. Yes, great. Look, in terms of the channels, I think, actually, volume was 
pretty broad based. I mean, we grew the bottle business grew, the fountain 
business grew. The Minute Maid business grew. The venturing and em
erging 
brand business grew. All of them grew in volume terms. And so whether it 
was large grocery, convenience, QSR, I mean, the volume performance was 
broad based in terms of channels. It was broad based in terms of categories. 
Virtually, every category g
rew in volume terms. The one 

 
the main one that 
didn't was juice, but that was actually a conscious decision to change the 
packaging size, to some extent, to downsize the packaging, given the 
pressure on juice COGS. And there we did see slightly less volu
me, but that 
was kind of a known part of the plan. So our broad
-
based volume in terms 
of channels, broad
-
based in terms of categories.
 
And then pricing, as we talked about, the marketplace pricing looks good 
across the channels, and we have a clear expecta
tion that our pricing 
strategy of creating value for our customers are capturing some of that 
ourselves by innovating in the marketing, innovating in the brands, in the 
categories, innovating in the package sizes will help to create value for 
everyone. And
 
therefore, that's our strategy going forward in terms of our 
expectation for the year in terms of pricing. And we're going to continue to 
look for a way to earn price with our customers by doing the right things in 
the marketplace. And so, I think a conti
nuation of what you've seen is what 
we're after.

Ali Dibadj
 
Can you here me?
 
James Quincey
 
Yes.
 
Ali Dibadj
 
Okay. So I'm still receiving l
ots of investor questions about price/mix in 
freight and the pendulum swing there. I'm not sure you're going to say 
more, so I have for you I kind of have questions instead. One is about the 
margin expansion to 600 basis points this quarter, which is obvio
usly strong. 
Could you break that out in terms of how much was productivity versus how 
much was structural? It felt like most of it was structural and not a lot of 
product to be this quarter and what we should think about ramping that up 
for the rest of th
e year and ongoing?
 
And then second question is around EMEA share. You only mentioned 
gaining share on juice, dairy and plant
-
based beverage clusters. And related 
to that, it looks like Turkey and South Africa were really good volumes; 
Nigeria and Western 
Europe not so great volumes. I don't think that's just a 
one quarter phenomenon. So how does that in particular inform your 
decision
-
making on CCBA and the bottlers who own those particular regions 
of Turkey, Western Europe, Nigeria as you think about your
 
September kind 

 
James Quincey
 
I think that looks like about four halves, Ali. There would you like us to focus 

 
Ali Dibadj
 

 
Kathy Waller
 
So I think we have answered the 
freight. I am not sure I can add much more 

 
Kathy Waller
 
Sure, on the operating margin, yeah. So the consolidated operating margin 
has increased of about 600 basis points. That is significantly structural
, 
structural drove about 600 basis points. And then there is an 

 
underlying 
business is positive, operating margin. And then that's offset a little bit by 
the mechanical impact of revenue recognition, which was about 100 basis 
points. So basically that's 
the drivers behind the operational 

 
the operating 
margin...

Great. My question goes around margins, but it's a longer
-
term question. As 
you see the growth in things like teas and other nonsparkling drinks, it just 
seems that investment cost is higher. Your market share comps dominant 
the way they are in carbonat
ed soft drink. So how can one have confidence 
on the longer
-
term story that you get to your four thoughts hopefully 
revenue growth globally? Over time what drives margin improvements? It 
would be really helpful if you could, perhaps, walk us through some a
reas 
that could be the pluses or minuses?
 
James Quincey
 
Yes, okay. I think part of this 
--
 
market share is clearly important by 
category and not just by category obviously, that then is important whether 
it's in an average across the world or whether it's 
concentrated in the few 
places. So clearly, market share matters, and the quality of the leadership 
versus the rest of the competition also matters in terms of scale and 
margins check. We are managing a broad portfolio. There are 
--
 
and clearly, 
as we are 
in some of the more challenging and explorer situations by 
category and by country, yes, it does require more investments to make 
progress. But as I say that it's a portfolio effect, we have the task of 

lity and managing 
those places where we are investing to create more positions and leadership.
 
And in a way as some of those graduating to leadership positions, we can 
cycle the investments into newer challenges and explore. So it's a portfolio 
management 
challenge. And even without having the same kind of shares on 
a global basis as we have in sparkling, there are places where we have got 
good positions in some category country combination, and they are able to 
achieve margins comparable with our sparkling
 
business.
 
So it's not leaving aside a couple of categories, which have inherently 
different economics and they tend to have high
-
dollar returns even if it's the 
percentages are lower like chilled juice and stuffs like that. The inherent 
economics of the d
ifferent categories is possible to achieve attractive 
margins in each category if you can get to a quality leadership. So give an 
example, tea, which has done pretty well in a whole number of countries 
around the world and was getting 

 
it wasn't requiring
 
outsized investment 
and was trying to look better in terms of margin, we rolled that out across 
Europe this year. Yes, we've invested more money with it as we've got into 
the year.
 
So clearly, investing more of a case if you like but more of a dollar of 
r
evenue than we are on the sparkling, but as we get that scale and we 
effectively double the value of the FUZE brand, we will be able to build the 
equity around the brand, can keep it relevant for consumers, keeping 
innovation going. Then that it will allow
 
us to get the scale ultimately in the 
margin structure to make it comparable to sparkling. And of course, then, 
we will likely choose to reinvest in the next brand we're growing to make it 
simple.

Hi. Good morning, everyone.
 
Kathy Waller
 
Good morning.
 
James Quincey
 
Good morning.
 
Amit Sharma
 
James, from all this discussion on pricing, can you just comment on how are 
you seeing it from 
consumer health and retailer perspective? Because your 
CPG peers on the food and HBC, they are not as confident of being able to 
get positive pricing, especially in North America. So can you just talk about 
like what you are seeing and how Coca
-
Cola and ov
erall beverages are doing 
better than your CPG peers?
 
James Quincey
 
Yeah, a couple of thoughts, Amit. Firstly, beverages are growing faster than 
the average of consumer staples on a global basis. It's clearly one of the 
more attractive categories in total 

 
the total consumer staples landscape, 
driven by the investments, driven by the innovation, driven by the marking, 
driven by the execution. Secondly, beverages are more diversified in terms 
of channels. So it's not all concentrated in one place. And espec
ially 
ourselves, we have a global business that we're not 

 
the things that are 
going on and things that we need to adapt to and evolve against.
 
We are in over 200 countries and we're in over 20 channels. So we have a 
broad presence that that means we coul
d adapt to changes in pressures in 
any one channel and in any one place without stabilizing all system, which 
then of course, goes back to one of the reasons why we are able to kind of 
mitigate some of these segments and remain an attractive, attractive 
ca
tegory.
 
Now having said that, we have to respond to the ongoing pressures in the 
marketplace. And just to kind of typify a couple of them, you've got 
consumers doing a number of things that you see happening in the channels 
are moving away from with the mi
ddle in a way. There are trends towards 
premiumization because, in a way, they're responding to trends around the 
types of ingredients that people want and the types of the manufacturing 
that tend to lead to more of a premium product, premium packaging, bu
t 
there are also people looking for value. And beverages and what we can do 
with products and packaging allows us to offer 

 
to create offerings across a 
broad spectrum and really provide that choice in each channel and for every 
channel, and I think that'
s what's allowing us to do a bit better.

Our next question comes from Robert Ottenstein from Evercore. Your line is 
now open.
 
Theo Brito
 
This is Theo Brito for Robert. I am wondering if you could give us some more 
details on the growth in China th
is quarter. I think you said volumes are up 
over 20%. Wondering how much of that was a benefit from timing of 
Chinese New Year or, perhaps, a renewed kind of accelerated growth and 
new trajectory for your business there. Thank you.
 
James Quincey
 
Sure. Chin
a had a good quarter. And clearly, some of it was the Chinese 
New Year was more fully in this quarter than the previous quarter. Secondly, 
the 20% I mentioned was brand Coke, not the total business, actually the 
total business was slightly less because we 
made some decisions around 
some of our low
-
value water to back off on some of those. So we actually 
sold a little less water than we, perhaps, we did last year. But that was a 
clear decision to go for building consumer franchise and value.
 
Net
-
net, we're d
oing better in China. We've got some more effective brand 
communication. As I talked about, we've got some innovative digital 
campaigns. We've got some packaging innovations and premium offers 
around sleek cans and some value offers. And newly refranchised
 
bottlers 
are taking that expanded portfolio. And really, Costco and Swire are really 
working well with some of the key channels to drive the business in China. 
So it's been a strategy that's been in implementation for a while. And we are 
starting to see t
he benefits come through again.

Our next question comes from Andrea Teixeira from JPMorgan. Your line is 
now open.
 
Andrea Teixeira
 
Thank you, and good morning. James, if I want to go back to the Latin 
American question from Judy, you have been hav
ing obviously an impressive 
balance in Brazil. It sounds in the mid
-
single
-
digits and after two years of 
declines a similar CAGR. So I was hoping if you can elaborate more on 
pricing mix in Lat Am on an environment of low inflation, as Kathy 
highlighted.
 
S
o in other words, if your price/ mix was up by 6% in the region, but mostly 

 
if it was mostly driven by Mexico, so I'm assuming price/mix is still 
negative in Brazil because of returnables and affordable juices. So in other 
words, are you starting to see 
a lift and shift in Brazil in mix, in particular, in 
the new high
-
end juice launches as well as Coke Zero? So 

 
or in other 
words are you betting that consumers will take longer to premiumize again 
after two recession years? Or should we think of Brazil mo
re of an offset of 
the decelerating trends in Mexico? Thank you.
 
James Quincey
 
Look, I think a few thoughts on Latin America. There are a number of things 
that are happening here at the same time. One, the macros are improving in 
Brazil and Argentina in terms of GDP, but that's coming with slightly less 
inflation, perhaps in Mexico, 

last year and into this year. So it's one, the macro environment is important. 
Two, we are seeing less inflation. I wouldn't say there's low inflation. 
Inflation in Latin America continues to be above the 
U.S., for example, and 
many of the other developed countries. So it's not that we've gone from 
inflation to low inflation. It's still pretty medium, the inflation. You are seeing 
Brazil perform a little better.
 
That was the packaging strategy around return
ables. And I think, ultimately, 
this is all netting out in more dollars because, along with moderating 
inflation is less losses on the foreign exchange, I know we came to talk 
about currency
-
neutral numbers, but in the end to generate the dollars, 
what's a
lso important to us is some of the FX rates are not as negative in 
Latin America. So I think, I mean, you can 

 
came in the team and get into 
more detail on Latin America, but it's really the sum of lots of moving parts 
here and driving forward.
 
But net
-
ne
t, the teams in Latin America, the bottlers in Latin America are 
using the broad portfolio, a lot of thinking around packaged price architects 
to adapt to the changes in the marketplace, the changes in the consumer 
and the changes in the channels. And I th
ink we started to see more benefits 
of that coming through, not just in kind of currency
-
neutral, but also in 
money.

Our last question comes from Bill Chappell from SunTrust. Your line is open.
 
Bill Chappell
 
Thanks, good morning.
 
Kathy Waller
 
Good
 
morning.
 
Bill Chappell
 
Hey, just I want to actually go back to costs. A year ago, I think you know 
announced the expansion of the productivity and reinvestment program. 
Now I would there've been a fair amount of headcount reductions middle 
and late 
last year, but it sounds like there was kind of continue to fine tuning 
early this year. So maybe just an update on the program if you found more 
savings, if 

 

much we expect to see this year?
 
Ka
thy Waller
 
Okay, hi, Bill. What you saw earlier this year was discontinuation of our lean 
enterprise initiative. So North America was the primary driver of the decimal 
headcount reduction that happened in the 

 
or happening in the first 
quarter. So product
ivity, we are on track to do the total $3.8 billion by 2019, 
which includes additional $800 million that you referred to. And again, the 
initiatives are kind of in line and we are on track.
 
James Quincey
 
Yes. Okay. Thank you very much everyone. To conclude
, we had a solid start 
to the year. We capitalized on our momentum coming out of 2017, and we 
will continue to drive our strategy through the remainder of the year. And 
we absolutely remain confident we will deliver our full year guidance. As 
always, we th
ank you for your interest, your investment in our company and 
thank you for joining us.

Thank you, Jackson and go
od morning, everyone.
 
Earlier this year we established five global strategic priorities to restore our 
global growth momentum. Halfway through the year, I am pleased to report 
that we've delivered another quarter of sequentially improving performance 
resul
ts.
 
While I am pleased with this year
-
to
-
date progress, we're conscious of the 
fact that we still have more work to do. In spite of continued sluggish global 
economic growth, the beverage industry remains vibrant.
 
Consumers today have a wide array of bever
ages to choose from than ever 
before and our system is responding by evolving the way we operate 
leveraging our strength to create new competitive advantages.
 
Our second quarter and year
-
to
-
date performance results reflect the steady 
progress that we are m
aking and that we expect to continue as we further 
solidify the foundation for long term sustainable growth.
 
We closed out the second quarter with 3% global volume growth, including 
global sparkling growth of 2% and importantly price mix increased 2% on a 
consolidated basis as we strive to deliver balanced volume and revenue 
growth.
 
We're seeing a number of encouraging signs across our global operating 
system. In the second quarter, brand Coca
-
Cola grew 1% in North America 
along with solid 3% sparkling pric
e mix.
 
We saw improving volume growth across several key markets in Europe. 
Eurasia and Africa continue to deliver balanced volume growth. Key markets 
in our Asia Pacific operations delivered strong performance including 9% 
growth in China, double
-
digit gr
owth in India and 1% growth in Japan and 
we saw steady execution in the face of a challenging macro environment in 
Latin America.
 
As mentioned, this progress is built on the implementation and execution of 
our five global strategic priorities, priorities t
hat emerged from a disciplined 
fact based look at what drives results and long term sustainable growth.
 
We know for example that great marketing, combined with great in
-
market 
execution are fundamental building blocks of our formula for long
-
term 
sustainab
le growth. When we conducted a comprehensive review of our 
business last year, we identified areas where we could improve and put a 
focused plan in place to address them.
 
With that in mind, I will now provide an update on our progress against each 
of our f
ive strategic priorities. Our first strategic priority is to accelerate 
global sparkling growth led by brand Coca
-
Cola. We grew global brand Coca
-
Cola 1%, a sequential improvement from the first quarter of 2014.
 
As noted earlier, our global sparkling brand
s grew 2% in the second quarter, 
thanks to solid performance across our portfolio of billion dollar sparkling 
brands including Sprite, Fanta, Coca
-
Cola Zero and Schweppes. This led our 
19th consecutive quarter of core sparkling value share gains.
 
Diet Coke
 
and Coca
-
Cola Light declined mid
-
single digits, while this was a 
sequential improvement from the first quarter, we do recognize that we 
have more work to do here. Progress in growing our global sparkling 
beverages is built on proven strategies that includ
e delivering best
-
in
-
class 
marketing, driving immediate consumption transactions and leading industry 
innovation.
 
While I could point to multiple examples of each, I would particularly like to 
highlight our Share a Coke Campaign as it successfully combines
 
all three 
strategies and it is being rolled out in more than 80 markets this year. The 
viral impact of this campaign and the engagement among teens has been 
more than encouraging.
 
We're excited about the campaign's expansion, not only to new markets, but 
also its return for an encore in many markets. For example, this year in our 
Northwest Europe and Nordics business units, we're extending the program 
to include all Coca
-
Cola trademark immediate consumption and future 
consumption packs and increasing the n
umber of names from 250 to 1,000 
per market.
 
This is a tremendous logistical feat and marketing achievement befitting the 
world's most loved beverage brand. The growth of brand Coca
-
Cola in North 
America in the second quarter gives us confidence that our f
ocus on driving 
incidence, delivering best
-
in
-
class marketing and evolving our price pack 
architecture is setting the foundation for well balanced growth in our flagship 
markets.
 
Through these efforts we are reviving the romance of brand Coca
-
Cola 
driving household penetration and increasing consumption frequency, all of 
which contributed to growth in the second quarter.
 
Our smaller size packs contributed significantly to brand Coca
-
Cola growth in 
the second quarter and year
-
to
-
date. Over 60% of the
 
volume growth in 
brand Coca
-
Cola in the second quarter was driven by double
-
digit growth in 
our mini can and 16 ounce immediate consumption packages reflecting 
strong consumer demand for smaller packages of ice cold Coca
-
Cola.
 
So we remain optimistic abou
t our sparkling business in North America and 
around the world and we're committed to supporting our brands, committed 
to driving execution and staying at the forefront of evolving consumer 
needs.
 
Our second global priority is to strategically expand our p
rofitable still 
beverage portfolio. We've delivered 5% still beverage volume growth in the 
second quarter and 6% growth year
-
to
-
date. Sports drinks, tea, energy, 
coffee and water, all contributed to global growth and enabled us to gain 
volume and value sha
re in still beverages year
-
to
-
date.
 
Juice and juice drinks growth slowed year
-
to
-
date due to price adjustments 
primarily to offset cost of goods increases in North America. However, we 
gained volume and value share in North America and also on a global bas
is.
 
Overall, the global juice growth story remains very robust. We are 
strengthening our leading brands as demonstrated by the double
-
digit 
growth of Maaza and Rani year
-
to
-
date along with high single
-
digit growth 
for Simply and mid
-
single digit growth for
 
Del Valle.
 
Our tea volume increased 4% in the quarter growing volume and value 
share in the second quarter and year
-
to
-
date. Importantly our key brands 
within the U.S. and Japan, our two largest tea markets performed very well. 
Tea volume grew 6% in North
 
America driven by double
-
digit Gold Peak and 
Honest Tea growth while in Japan tea volume grew 5% less by 8% growth of 
Ayataka the 21st consecutive quarter of strong growth for this dynamic 
brand.
 
As a system we are enhancing our premium water brands to dr
ive revenue 
while investing in our value chains to improve profitability.
 
Examples of premium water brands growing double
-
digits in both the 
quarter and year
-
to
-
date include Smartwater in North America, I Lohas in 
Japan and Vio in Germany.
 
As we focus on b
uilding great brands, we are pleased to share that 
Smartwater will soon be available in Great Britain and that addition of 
Dasani Sparkling and Dasani Drops is enhancing our brand margins in North 
America. Our water portfolio grew 7% in the second quarter 
and 10% year
-
to
-
date.
 
In the sports drinks category we grew volume 6% in the quarter filled by our 
FIFA World Cup POWERADE activation. As the global value leader is still 
beverages and with $11 billion brands and many more in the pipeline, we 
are diligentl
y working to enhance the value of our still portfolio.
 
And as exemplified by our recent partnership with Keurig Green Mountain, 
we will continue to strategically target opportunities to strengthen our 
position and build our breadth across new categories wh
ile building category 
beverage debt.
 
Moving now on to our third strategic priority which is to increase brand 
investments by maximizing productivity, our productivity initiatives are on 
track as is our commitment to increase media investments in tea market
s.
 
We are delivering more and better quality marketing by focusing on 
increased efficiency and effectiveness. Our global marketing campaign 
charters are fueling in productivity and efficiency while at the same time 
driving media effectiveness through highe
r quality communication.
 
The example of the power of this approach is the full scale activation of our 
FIFA world cup campaign where single creative idea, this is the world's cup 
was executed across more than 170 markets in the second quarter.
 
The success 
of our Coca
-
Cola music anthem for the 2014 FIFA World Cup 
reinforces the engaging nature of this campaign as the anthem reached over 
two billion impressions charting in the top 10 songs in 40 countries and was 
ranked as the number one song in Brazil at the
 
start of the World Cup. The 
full impact of our enhanced marketing and productivity initiatives will clearly 
build over time.
 
Our fourth priority is to win at that point of sales by unlocking the power of 
our system. Our global system is committed to inves
ting in new plans, 
investing in new distribution capabilities, investing in coolers and marketing.
 
Enhancing our immediate consumption capabilities, while optimizing in store 
activations and advancing our customers business strategies and finally 
putting m
ore feed on the street to service these accounts.
 
To that end, you may have read last week that together with our bottling 
partners we will be investing an additional 8.2 billion by 2020 to support our 
long
-
term business plan and vision in Mexico. Since 20
10, our total system 
investments globally have exceeded $60 billion.
 

this by inspiring our people to live our values of focusing on the market, 
working smart, acting like owners
 
and being passionate ambassadors for our 
company and for our brands.
 
We are harnessing the potential of our millennial associates, their optimism, 
their global mindedness, entrepreneurialism and social awareness drive 
them to build sustainable practices i
nto every aspect of what they do 
including right here at the Coca
-
Cola company.
 
We therefore established an internal group of millennial voices and we're 
working with the world economic forums global shapers to provide our 
leaders with insights on how to c
ontinue to evolve to meet the needs of this 
and also future generations.
 
We continue to focus on strengthening the core front facing capabilities of 
franchise leadership, commercial leadership and marketing leadership while 
also embracing emerging capabili
ties in the digital mobile and social media 
arena.

Chairman, Robert Woodruff who's tenure with the company stand from 1923 
to 1985
.
 
Each year our business units President select one of their peers as winner of 
this award and people leadership is the key criteria.
 
Our most recent winner at the South Latin business unit exemplifies what it 
means to inspire our next generation of leader
s as demonstrated by the fact 
that women make up more than half of their workforce and that they've 
consistently been ranked among the top three best places to work in that 
whole geography.
 
Our focus on our five strategic priorities enables us to execute t
he 
fundamentals while simultaneously transforming an advancing our business.
 
An important example of this is our North American re
-

build the 21st century beverage partnership model.
 
Our ongoing work is underpinned by our full 
commitment to create a 
modern, agile, consumer and customer focused operating model and system 
which balances national scale and local capability.
 
As we continue to roll out and evolve business model in North America, we 
expect to franchise the large porti
on of North America territories into a 
handful of regional bottlers, proven regional bottlers that can best serve 
every local community within their contiguous operating territories.
 
These larger bottling partners will be complemented by a select group of 
local bottling partners enabling us to benefit from the passion and local 
touch of a franchise model and to grow our business faster and more 
profitably over time.

It is important for us to follow this deliberate process as we establish a

We will provide you with additional details regarding this transformational 
initiative before the end of the year.

Kathy Waller
 
Thank you Muhtar, and good morning everyone. I would like 
to start by 

-
Cola Company.
 

and grow over time while remaining strategically focused on doing the right 
things to drive long te
rm sustainable growth, that's why I am confident 

 
As Muhtar mentioned, we continue to execute the five strategic priorities we 
laid
-
out at the beginning of the year. We achieved 3% volu
me growth in the 

start by reviewing a few key drivers of our financial performance.
 
Unit case growth was ahead of concentrate sales growth in the quarter, 
primarily due to tim
ing of shipments. Importantly, after considering the 
impact of one less selling day, unit cases and concentrate sales were in line 
year
-
to
-
date and we expect them to be in line for the full year.
 
Comparable currency neutral 
--
 
net revenue growth was 3% for
 
both the 
quarter and year
-
to
-
date after excluding the impact of structural items. Our 
topline growth includes two points of positive price mix in both the quarter 
and year
-
to
-
date.
 
Comparable currency neutral operating income was up 5% in the quarter 
and 
6% year
-
to
-
date after excluding the impact of structural items. 
Operating leverage was even in the quarter as we continue to make the 
necessary investments behind our brands to accelerate growth, including a 
mid
-
single digit increase in [DME] [ph] as we in
vest in the growth of our 
brands together with our global system partners.
 
On a comparable basis, currency unfavorably impacted this quarter's 
operating income by 4%, which was three points better than the outlook we 
provided during our last earnings call.
 
The difference between the outlook 
we provided and the actual currency impact was primarily due to a new 
provision in Venezuela that imposed a maximum threshold for profit margins 
and decreased our Bolivar denominated revenue and profit.
 
The new provision
 
resulted in an approximate one penny drag on 
comparable EPS in the second quarter, which was partially offset by the 
impact of slight improvements in other currencies, compared to our previous 
expectation.
 
Despite a difficult operating environment in Vene
zuela, the Coca
-
Cola 
system remains committed to the market and will continue producing and 
selling our products that Venezuelan consumers enjoy on a daily basis.
 
We also benefitted in the quarter from lowering our underlying effective tax 
rate from 23% to
 
22.5% for the full year. Cash generated from operating 
activities was a strong $4.5 billion in the first half of the year and we 
continue to make capital deployment decisions based on a consistent and 
disciplined framework as we had outlined before.
 
First
, we reinvest in the business, which includes making the necessary 
investments to strengthen our brand and it includes capital investments, 
which we expect to be roughly $2.5 billion for the year. Second, we reward 
our shareowners by paying a healthy divid
end, which we have increased 
annually for more than half essentially.
 
Next, we evaluate opportunities to grow through acquisitions, partnerships 
and joint ventures. We view these as enablers to help accelerate growth and 
create value and in a capital effic
ient manner.
 
And lastly we repurchase shares. Year
-
to
-
date, our net share repurchases 
totaled $1.3 billion and we are on a track for net share repurchases in the 
$2.5 billion to $3 billion range for the full year. As we look ahead for the 
second half of 20
14, let me take a minute to update you on a few outlook 
items as we model our business.
 
We previously communicated that we expect the structural items to 
unfavorably impact the first half of the year as we cycle the deconsolidation 
of certain bottling oper
ations in 2013. However, we now expect structural 
items, including Venezuela to be a one to two point drag on net revenue 
growth and an approximate three point drag on operating income growth 
during the second half of 2014.
 
The refranchise territories in N
orth America had a nominal impact on our 
comparable results in the second quarter and are not expected to have a 
meaningful impact over the balance of the year.
 
After considering our hedge position, current spot rates and the cycling of 
our prior year rate
s, we expect a three point currency headwind and 
operating income during the second half of 2014 with a relatively similar 
impact on both third and fourth quarters and we now expect a currency 
headwind in the five to six point range at operating income for
 
the full year.
 
This is an improvement compared to the previous outlook we provided, 
primarily due to the decrease in Boulevard denominated revenue and profit.
 
After taking into consideration all these factors, we expect the impact of 
structural items 
net of the benefit from the change in our underlying 
effective tax rate to be a $0.02 drag on comparable EPS during the second 
half of the year.
 
Finally, we continue to expect operating leverage on a currency neutral basis 
to be even to slightly positive f
or the full year.
 
In closing, we delivered sound financial performance in the first half of 2014 
and we expect to continue our sound financial performance over the 
remainder of the year and I believe our company and our global system are 
well positioned to
 
capitalize on the opportunities within our great industry.

Muhtar, if I look at your second quarter performance, volume growth of 3% 
sequential improvement versus Q1, global price mix held steady at 2%, I 
guess 
second quarter also though benefitted in part because of easy comp 
and you have the Easter benefit.
 
So can you maybe talk about your ability to sustain the topline momentum 
as you look out in the back half of the year and be mindful of some of the 
macro ec
onomic conditions that you see in the marketplace?

. Those are really three 
important points.
 
Also another quarter of value market share gains. I think more than 25 
consecutive 
--
 
28 to be exact in the second quarter of gaining value share. 
You see us having a very 
--
 
with our system, very clear focus on p
riorities. 
We had our entire global bottling system get together with us a couple 
--
 
few months ago and again, there a recommitment to the focus on our 
priorities.
 
Sequential improvement in a lot of large markets, particularly Europe, 
France, Germany, Grea
t Britain, Italy, Spain and again good results, very 
strong results out of Eurasia and Africa, improving in Nigeria, South Africa, 
Turkey; improvements again if you take Asia Pacific again very strong 
quarter in China as well as in India. Double
-
digit grow
th in India, Thailand, 
saw again 
--
 
so if you take all of those margins that are improving, gross 
margins has improved in the quarter compared to the prior year.
 
Clear path on North America franchising, strong belief that what we are 
doing is working in ou
r system is really important. Good bottler alignment, 
yes, there are a couple few exceptions, but there always have been and will 
be and more work to be done.
 
So on the purchase, we operate in a very volatile global environment, both 
politically and econom
ically. China slowing down is impacting many 
commodity exporting countries and from Africa to Latin America, but overall, 
what we're doing is working more marketing through productivity gains, 
better marketing.
 
We mentioned Share a Coke program in over 80 
markets. Tremendous 
leverage on our World Cup program in more than 170 markets with probably 
the biggest activation that we've ever had and all these 
--
 
all this will not 
generally have an impact on the quarter that you spend in.
 
It comes in after with bet
ter incidence, better brand loyalty, better purchase 
intent that we're all seeing and what is happening in North America in terms 
of spot 
--
 
in price mix also, you can see that we have a very disciplined 
approach, both in the United States and globally whe
re we've been able to 
achieve a 2% price mix on a global basis and yes, there was an Easter shift, 
but at the same time, our gallon shipments were below our unit case volume 
for the quarter.
 
So that 
--
 
if you say that that would sort of neutralize the bene
fit that we 
may have got from Easter, I think overall, we feel pretty confident with 
again the caveat that we need to do a lot more work 
--
 
continue to do a lot 
more work, more focus, better execution, but the five priorities are working 
and early shoots, 
green shoots, and we expect that the balance of the year 
as I mentioned in my script that we should be able to fall within the corridor 
of the long term growth targets and again there may be issues along the 
way, bumps along the way, but the most important
 
thing is that we're 
resolutely focused on continuing to build momentum here.

Goldman Sachs
 
Okay. That's helpful. If I can just quickly follow
-
up on North American 
pricing particularly in the sparkling side where you got the 3% in the 
quarter, 
maybe a little bit more details around the drivers of that weather it 
was how much was mix versus rate and sort of your views on whether you 
can sustain that kind of pricing and maybe even fee acceleration if you look 

 
Muhtar Kent
 
Sure, 
I'll say a few things and pass it over to Sandy, but all I would say is 
take note of the fact that a very big portion, percentage 60% to be exact of 
the growth came from smaller packages that's obviously an enhancement of 
the mix driving revenue, but also 
rate.
 
So I'll ask Sandy and then may be Irial, if he has any commentary on North 
America, but we are operating with tremendous diligence and discipline in 
the marketplace and success for us is a combination of both the growth that 
we have on the volume, bu
t importantly also growth in transaction, which is 
a really good litmus test of the success of the business that is coming more 
into play each day as we progress. Sandy?
 
Sandy Douglas
 
Thanks Muhtar. Hi Judy. We said at the beginning of the year that our fo
cus 
in North America was going to be a disciplined combination of volume and 
price and that we would see that as a strategic priority and the second 
quarter really reflects that 3% price mix on sparkling while achieving volume 
growth on Coke and Muhtar men
tioned the importance of smaller packages 
in driving that outcome.
 
It's also important in driving growth because consumers want smaller 
packages and we've been working on developing that as a part of our overall 
strategy, so lots of discipline. As we ahead
, we're lapping some very 
promotional activity in the third quarter of last year and our discipline will 
remain and the bottlers and the company around the country are focused on 
marketing and selling our way through and maintaining an extraordinary 
amount
 
of discipline on pricing and we're optimistic that we'll be able to hold 
that strategy.
 
Irial Finan
 
Hi, it's Irial. I guess all I can add is really repeat what Sandy said and I've 
said in the last three calls now which is we really are focused on building
 
a 
long term sustainable business and that's mixing pricing and volume and 
transactions in a very balanced way and coming up with a great result for 
our company and we will do that and we will continue to do it.
 
Muhtar Kent
 
Yes, one thing 
--
 
the only thing
 
I would add here also Judy is that I think 
there is 
--
 
we see a path forward to being able to build more romance with 
the brand through smaller packages and that's really an important element 
in what is also being discussed.

Thank you. Our next question is from John Faucher from JPMorgan.
 
John Faucher 
-
 
JPMorgan
 
Thank you. Good morning. Just wanted to get a clarification if I could. When 
you talk about the $0.02 impact, you mentioned it was compara
ble EPS, but 
it sounds like that's sort of reported EPS as well, is that correct?
 
Muhtar Kent
 
Yes Kathy.
 
Kathy Waller
 
Sure. Hi John. Thanks for the question. So Venezuela impact, yes. That is a 
$0.02 drag on comparable EPS as well as reported EPS. So as yo
u look at 
Venezuela, you take it in two pieces. The currency impact as well as the 
impact of the provision. The provision is less Boulevard denominated 
revenue.
 
It can't move because of capped margins and it has gone straight to the 
bottom line and then th
e FX is 
--
 
the impact is because as well we don't 
have as much Boulevard denominated revenue and income. So you could 
split those two pieces and yes, it is comparable as well as, as reported.
 
John Faucher 
-
 
JPMorgan
 
Okay. Great. Thank you. And then Kathy i
f I could just sort of follow
-
up, 
we're continuing to see sort of weaker volumes in some of the higher margin 
regions like Latin America or Europe what have you, so can you talk a little 
bit in terms of how you are going to look at 
--
 
how should we think a
bout 
margins going forward, if these types of 
--
 
if this type of relative weakness 
in some of these higher margin markets continues to particularly Latin 
America, which is your highest margin region and it's been a little bit softer 
over the last couple of
 
quarters, thanks.
 
Kathy Waller
 
So, I would split them 
--
 
the question is two and actually Ahmet, help me 
answer with it, but the margins in Latin America are impacted this quarter 
by the Venezuela provision and then when you look at ongoing volume 
growth 

 
Ahmet Bozer
 
John hey, just couple of points. Rest of Latin America the margin and the 
growth and profitability overall is in a good direction. No important issues 
there. Also keep in mind that we've been abl
e to realize positive price mix 
and high margin in places like Europe. We've been able to grow in Japan. So 
we are able to balance across the international territory to have positive 
price mix and margins.
 
John Faucher 
-
 
JPMorgan
 
Okay. Great.
 
Muhtar 
Kent
 
Just to add I think yes, you are right in saying that Latin America has slowed 
down to where it traditionally has been and we've seen this kind of cyclical 
slowdowns in Latin America and as some parts will get better, I think 
starting with towards the
 
end of the year.
 
We also see some other volatility 
--
 
continued volatility in like Argentina and 
other markets, but overall I think we from also what we're cycling as well we 
expect Latin America 
--
 
major markets in Latin America to have some 
sequential i
mprovement in the second half of this year. And then overall 
longer term we feel very confident about also what is lying ahead in Latin 
America.
 
John Faucher

Thank you. Our next question is from Bryan Spillane fr
om Bank of America.
 
Bryan Spillane

Bank of America Merrill Lynch
 
Hey, good morning.
 
Muhtar Kent
 
Good morning, Bryan.
 
Bryan Spillane 
-
 
Bank of America Merrill Lynch
 
Kathy, I wanted to follow
-
up on John's question just relative to leverage and 
I guess ther
e are two parts to it, one just I think I caught in the prepared 
comments that you mentioned that on a comparable currency neutral basis 
you would expect 
--
 
you would expect some leverage in the second half. So 
I am just trying to make sure I heard that co
rrectly and that we should be 
thinking about ex
-
Venezuela impact and ex the structural change in 
currencies that would be currency neutral operating profit growth.
 
And then second question is if I am done the calculations correctly, it looks 
like on a comp
arable basis, currency neutral gross margins in the quarter 
were up. So if you could just talk a little bit, A, is that true and; B, if you 
could talk a little bit about how you would expect gross margins to evolve 
going forward. Kind of what type of infla
tion you are seeing and just sort of 
how 
--
 
what factors you might see driving gross margins in the second half?
 
Kathy Waller
 
Okay. Hi Bryan. Thanks for your question. So our outlook for leverage on a 
currency neutral basis remains flat to slightly positiv
e and we've said 
--
 
when you think about gross margins, so gross margins have improved for 
the second quarter and year
-
to
-
date and I think when we look at 
--
 
I guess 
when we look at our margins for the back half of the year, we have we 
delivered sound fina
ncial results and we anticipate that we will continue to 
deliver sound financial results for the quarter 
--
 
for the back half of the year.
 
So we do anticipate that margins will continue to be 
--
 
will continue in the 

half of the year.
 
Bryan Spillane 
-
 
Bank of America Merrill Lynch
 
So there's nothing unusual about the gross margins in the first half we could 
potentially see more progress on gross margins and we're just spending 
more back, which is what's getting the lev
erage to slightly flat is that what 
you think about it?
 
Kathy Waller
 
Yes, we can say we invest behind our brands and we 
--
 
so yes, that is part 
of the leverage story, but that's causing like in North America some negative 
--
 
slight negative leverage and No
rth America because we are spending 
behind our brand.
 
So we are getting pricing and we are committed to rational pricing. So we're 
getting pricing, which is helping us with the margins 
--
 
the gross margins, 
but we are continuing to invest behind our brands
.
 
Bryan Spillane 
-
 
Bank of America Merrill Lynch
 
Excellent. Thank you.
 
Muhtar Kent
 
Just to add to that Bryan, if you look at the second quarter compared to the 
first quarter, marketing is substantially higher in the second quarter than it 
is in the first q
uarter and particularly towards the back end of the second 
quarter, substantially higher.
 
So that explains and some of the things again what Kathy was saying, but 
also our productivity is on target for 
--
 
it has been on target for the first half 
of the yea
r and will be on target for the second half.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question is from Michael Steib from Credit Suisse.
 
Michael Steib 
-
 
Credit Suisse
 
Good morning. Can I ask a couple of questions 
--
 
could of specific questions 
on Latin 
America, first on Brazil given all the investments you made in the 
market and the World Cup, I was just wondering why volume performance 

environment and some competitive activity, b
ut I was hoping you could give 
us bit more detail.
 

related to the tax increase early in the year, but have you also passed on 
pricing now for general inflation in the country. Than
ks.
 
Muhtar Kent
 
Michael, its Muhtar here and I'll Ahmet to provide additional commentary, 
but think of Brazil as having a very tough macro environment in the first 
half, so if you look at the entire consumer disposable and non
-
disposable 
consumer durable, 
consumer goods sectors, we're under tremendous duress 
in the first half of the year, particularly leading up to the 
--
 
particularly it's 
more so even in the second quarter.
 
So think of it this way. Had it not been, the result would have been perhaps 
not wh
at it was 
--
 
it would have been had we knocked on all that activity. So 
from that perspective I think we see brand as getting stronger, incidence 
and purchase intent getting stronger in Brazil as a result of all the activity 
and I think that should benefit
 
us going forward in Brazil.
 
So certainly the macro environment in Brazil as you can read, as we can all 
see, has been very challenging and so given that backdrop, I think our 
results were content with where we are and we believe that what we've done 
will 
benefit us in the second half and going forward.
 
In terms of Mexico, I think both times prices were adjusted. They include a 
certain portion for also inflation, so take it as that, but again, I'll ask Ahmet 
to provide any further commentary for both Brazil
 
and Mexico.
 
Ahmet Bozer
 
Thanks Muhtar. On Brazil, the only thing I would add Michael is that we have 
a pricing packaging architecture which allows us to have different tax, both 
for immediate and future consumption at different price points and we are 
exe
cuting those with great discipline and that in fact is helping us navigate 
this challenging external environment and we expect that to continue bear 
fruit in the third and fourth quarter along with the strong marketing 
programs we have.
 
With respect to Mex
ico, the only other thing I would add is that we do have 
a not just passing the tax and the inflation, but a consumer
-
driven pricing 
approach, which has been very carefully calculated and the elasticity that we 
have calculated in reality are happening bett
er than that we've expected. So 
in another words our Mexican business is showing more resilience in this 
area.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question is from Mark Swartzberg from Stifel Nicolaus.
 
Mark Swartzberg 
-
 
Stifel Nicolaus
 
Thanks. Good morning, gentl
emen. Hi Kathy. I guess Muhtar as you think 
about the sparkling global outlook and your efforts to build on where you are 
here in the second quarter, is it fair to think your emphasis will continue to 
be on volume share gains, more so than dollar share gai
ns or do you think 
there is potential for more dollar share growth in spite of the volumes being 
a little below what you are hoping for?
 
Muhtar Kent
 
I think success for us is certainly continuing our value share gains. You can 
-
-
 
obviously you can't 
--
 
onl
y value share gains without volume is not 
sustainable over the long term, but we have a very disciplined approach just 
like in North America also for our international business related to more 
smaller packs. So benefitting the mix will benefit us, but also
 
very 
importantly it's critical for us to achieve price mix on a global scale.
 
Different geographies will again play differently into the picture, such 
disparate pricing per case depending on which geography we're talking 
about. So geographic mix is an imp
ortant piece of this as is package mix and 
as is rate.
 
Mark Swartzberg 
-
 
Stifel Nicolaus
 
And could you 
--
 
obviously a lot of markets to talk about on this call and 
though for going into many of them, but when you look at North America 
specifically and you 
see that the 3% price mix on the carbonated and a bit of 
growth there on the stills, but you also have the flat volumes and then data 
we look at is CPI for the larger carbonated space, which continues to be 
down. So retailers continue to promote the carbon
ated component of your 
business.
 
How are you thinking about the opportunity for better value share 
performance in North America given the volume share situation you're 
facing?
 
Muhtar Kent
 
I'll just say that once again smaller size packs contributed signifi
cantly to 
say brand Coca
-
Cola volume and revenue growth in Q2 and year
-
to
-
date as 
a matter of fact. So if you take over 60% of the growth in brand Coca
-
Cola 
in Q2 was driven by double
-
digit in our mini can and 16 ounce immediate 
consumption packages, I thi
nk that is 
--
 
that is how I would like to leave you 
with. That is what I would like to leave you with as an opportunity.
 
Mark Swartzberg

Stifel Nicolaus
 
Got it. Okay. Great. Thank you.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question is from Ali Dibadj from 
Bernstein.
 
Ali Dibadj

Sanford Bernstein
 
Hi guys. So if you would have predicted back in December that price mix in 
North America was going to be up as much and your volumes would have 
remained flat and Latin America you indicated volume would have been f
lat 
even with all the Mexico tax issues, I think I would have said you are being 
optimistic, but that is what you are delivering, which is good, but it does 
raise two questions for me.
 
One is it has concentrated your volume growth in only two of your six 
r
eporting segments, so want to get a better sense of how comfortable you 
are with those two currently and your expansion of volume growth in the 
other segments like what gives you confidence that the other ones can grow 
as well?
 
And then secondly, a questio
n about the mix between volume and price mix, 
which if you look over the past 10 years, it's been mainly driven by volume, 
obviously pricing now much more balanced, now I am trying to understand 
how much of that is actually a change in strategic intent tha
t you described 
versus just FX driving you to raise more pricing. So if you can help with 
those two that would be great in a smarter volume context.
 
Muhtar Kent
 
Ali, I'll take the last first. The strategy is driven by what consumers want 
and that is not ju
st phenomenal for the United States, but smaller packages 
are a key focus. So that helps the mix. That helps the revenue. That helps 
also the price mix.
 
Then again couple that with a very disciplined approach towards also having 
the right balance between v
alue and volume share gains. And so it's really 
important. In terms of concentration of volume growth, I think the important 
thing is for you to focus on the improvements from quarter to quarter.
 
If we take key geographies like Europe, France had an improv
ement, 
Germany had an improvement, Great Britain had a significant improvement, 
Italy had a significant improvement, Spain had a significant improvement, 
Europe overall had a huge improvement when you look at total and just 
again this is pure simply from v
olume and then if you look at our pricing and 
other thing you will get also a similar picture.
 
So I think focus on the sequential improvements, focus on us delivering on 
our focused priorities and so what I see there is that we will strive and 
diligently s
trive to continue with sequential improvement, building 
momentum as we go forward and I also mentioned as an answer to a 
previous question that I thought Latin America we would see some also 
some sequential improvement.
 
Ali Dibadj 
-
 
Sanford Bernstein
 
Okay.
 

conference call is about margin and margin mix and one of the things 
obviously that can offset margin pressures is incremental cost cutting, can 
you talk a little bit more about how you view in
cremental cost cutting versus 

think we might hear more about more cost cutting at the company?
 
Muhtar Kent
 
Well, we announced significant cost cuts over the last four, five years, 
d
ifferent programs and as I mentioned earlier again we're on target with our 
productivity and that productivity is being reinvested to drive growth.
 
Ali Dibadj 
-
 
Sanford Bernstein
 
Okay. Thanks.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question is from Steve Powers from
 
UBS.
 
Steve Powers 
-
 
UBS
 
Great. Thanks. Maybe building on that and focusing back on North America, 
as you talked about, you had good price mix realization at sparkling of 3% 
and you did see margin grow in the quarter, which is great. But overall, we 
only s
aw 1% price mix and year
-
to
-
date margins remain slightly below last 
year's level in the U.S. based on my math.
 
So as I think about the path towards refranchise and smoothing that path, it 
seems to me greater profitability is a great enabler of that, is the
re 
--
 
what 
needs to be done? Is there a way to get even more aggressive on price mix 
realization or to Ali's point, pushing on productivity more to get the North 
American profit pool to expand to facilitate entry of new partners, thanks.
 
Ahmet Bozer
 
I'll t
alk about a couple of levers and then ask Irial to join me, but the growth 
in profitability in North America, the major opportunities exist in pricing and 
the overall effectiveness and efficiency in the system.
 
We talked about price as a lever and a area o
f discipline and focus and price 
is achieved through rate as you know and also mix and a whole lot of 
innovation is going on inside of packaging to give consumers what they want 
and to earn a return as a result of that.
 
Couple that with our overall system 
architecture work which Muhtar 
described earlier, which is on track as we overhaul IT product supply, as we 
overhaul customer management and shared services and the refranchising 
progress, which is on track with our bottlers, we'll create a system that is 
on 
one hand more effective and grows faster and on another level is more 
efficient generating better margins.
 
But at the end of the day, that combination needs to be built on accelerating 
growth and a focus of the near term has been to reinvest the proceed
s into 
marketing to rebuild brand momentum and brand momentum at price point 
and we're optimistic about the progress, but we have a whole lot more work 
to do.
 
Irial Finan
 
The only add I would give is delivering to the packing houses is we remain 
absolutely
 
committed to deliver one of our core priorities, which is excellence 
and execution in the marketplace and as every day goes by, I get more 
comfortable that we're starting to do things better every day, every time we 
go an outlet and fundamentally that's t
he other piece that actually gives us 
the capability to get extra price or mix in the marketplace and we will 
continue to do that and it's a journey.
 
It's not turning the light switch on is happens day by day, week by week, 
month by month and I feel 
pretty good that over the next number of years, 
our capability in the marketplace admires the great marketing is going to 
deliver the kind of price mix we all desire and that's why the discipline in 
remaining focused on price mix married with transaction g
rowth and married 
with volume is why we feel confident about our North America business over 
the long term.

Hi. Good morning.
 
Muhtar Kent
 
Good morning.
 
Bill Schmidt

Deutsche Bank
 
Can you just comment about some of the market share losses in Mexico, 
Brazil and then on most about the U.K., so what do you think is driving that 
and then when do you think some of t
hose trends are going to reverse 
because some of these losses are fairly substantial I think it was like a little 
over a point of value share and scan channel loss in Brazil about a point in 
Mexico and then similar trends in the U.K.
 
Muhtar Kent
 
Bill, I th
ink in the U.K. most of that loss was in Q1. If you look at Q2, we've 
had sequential improvement in the U.K. and we expect that going forward in 
both Mexico and in Brazil that more minor losses to brands and local players 
will reverse themselves in the cou
rse of the year and we always see that 
happening in both markets.
 
So I think that was the difficult operating environment in Brazil in terms of 
also us having discipline in our pricing and the same goes for also Mexico.
 
Bill Schmidt 
-
 
Deutsche Bank
 
Got you
. So you think that your losses are really a function of may be the 
more aggressive pricing you took and maybe as that stabilizes this year.
 
Muhtar Kent
 
And very transitory.
 
Bill Schmidt

Okay. Great. I appreciate that. Thanks so much.
 
Opera
tor
 
Thank you. Our next question is from Nik Modi from RBC Capital Markets.
 
Nik Modi 
-
 
RBC Capital Markets
 
Yes. Good morning, everyone. A quick question I had is just if you think 
about the quarter and how trends moved through the quarter, I am just 
curiou
s if you actually saw correlation with the higher level of spending as 
the quarter progressed and your volume growth, just again just trying to 
understand if the spending is actually working and when you think about the 
ROI on that spend, what discrete thi
ngs and specific things is Coke doing to 
make sure that there is a glad path of getting better return out of that 
spend. Thanks.
 
Muhtar Kent
 
Yes, I think two things, spending increased as we moved through the 
quarter. So there was much more spending in let
's say the end of the 
quarter than there was in the beginning of the quarter and therefore you 
would expect that not all that benefit is going to flow obviously into the 
quarter and this is again about generating long term sustainable 
momentum, which we be
lieve is happening.
 
Again I want to remind everyone that I am pleased with these results in a 
difficult operating environment and to get growth back into sparkling is a 
significant achievement to get growth back into Coca
-
Cola and the world 
globally and in
 
the United States is a significant achievement and we will 
continue to focus on where we need to be quarter after quarter, one quarter 
at a time. I just want to say that I believe our approach is working.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question is from 
Kevin Grundy from Jefferies.
 
Kevin Grundy 
-
 
Jefferies
 
Good morning and thanks for the question. So first Muhtar you talked about 
increasing or broadening your product portfolio, so may be without tipping 
your hand too much, what would be the top of your wi
sh list by product and 
geography and do you still feel comfortable with your energy drink strategy?
 
And then separately, Kathy now that you kind of bring a fresh look here, do 
you plan on doing anything differently from a capital structure perspective 
and 
I guess say that within the context if there is an argument to make that 
Coke is under
-
levered income and can potentially add leverage by adding 
leverage could add value to shareholders and we've seen a number of 
companies in the CPG space that have been r
ewarded by the market for 
such actions. So any thoughts there would be appreciated. Thank you.
 
Muhtar Kent
 
Yes Kevin obviously I can't walk you through our wish list. That would be too 
much information to the whole market and everyone that plays in the 
mar
ket, but I would say our portfolio is really very rich as you saw from 
--
 
as we know from our $17 billion brands and so many more in the pipeline 
and again our sparkling brands that really performed well on a global basis, 
Sprit and Fanta and Schweppes in 
addition to Coca
-
Cola.
 
So all of that tells me that what we're doing in different brands and creating 
more incidents, more transactions is working and you heard the numbers 
that I mentioned in tea, both in the U.S. and globally in premium waters, in 
juice 
and juice drinks, in sports drinks all of that we're pleased with a much 
richer portfolio than we had say three years ago and that portfolio is again 
yielding very good results, particularly also simply in the juice category, 
simply [Innocent] (ph) all tho
se different brands that are across the world 
yielding very good results and again both also in China too and Southeast 
Asia with new innovations that are really working well for us in both the 
fusion of dairy and juice as well as pulpy drinks and also jui
ce and juice 
drinks. And Kathy, yes.

On the second part of your question, I believe the company has always been 
very focused on driving long term sustainable growth and we've done that in 
a very consistent and disciplined way and we've clearly
 
focused on 
reinvesting in the business and to accelerate growth and create value.
 
So I believe we 
--
 
obviously we focus on making sure we have share 
repurchase and we do give a healthy dividend back, but we will continue 
basically what we've been doing fo
cusing on driving long
-
term growth.

Okay. Thank you, Kathy, Ahmet, Sandy, Irial and Jackson. Our performance 
year

to

date progressed against each of our strat
egic priorities and the 
positive signs that we're seeing in many global markets all illustrate our view 
that the 20
-
20 vision and strategic plans are solid proof points are out there, 
3% growth in the quarter, global price mix of 2%, increased global media
 
spending reflecting our confidence and building on the strength of our brand 
and also in our ability to engage our consumers and customers effectively 
and global year
-
to
-
date value share growth in our categories and so we're 
winning in the vibrant beverag
e industry and also coupled with sound 
financial performance during the first half of the year.
 
So we're making steady progress and we're where we are expected to be at 
this stage in the year. I look forward to providing you with all of you with 
additional
 
updates as we continue to restore our global momentum in the 
months ahead. Thank you for your time this morning and your continued 
interest and trust in the Coca

Cola company.

Thanks, Tim. Good morning, everyone. Let me start by saying and 
underlining that we're winning in a dynamic and vibrant industry. The global 
beverage industry is growing faster than last year, driven by better results in 
the emerging an
d developing markets and also the sparkling soft drink 
category. We're gaining value share as we execute on the strategies we laid 
out for you in early 2017. And importantly, our operating performance is 
accelerating as a result.
 
So 2018, at the halfway ma
rk of the year, we're seeing good momentum in 
our underlying business. Organic revenue is up 5% year
-
to
-
date, driven by a 
good mixture of volume and price/mix. Global volume is up 3%, which is the 
strongest we've seen in five years. And comparable EPS is u
p 5% year
-
to
-
date, despite stronger currency headwinds than we anticipated at the 
beginning of 2018. And, as we noted at the start of the year, we've always 
expected EPS growth to be back half
-
weighted and that has not changed.
 
So operationally, looking ar
ound the world, we delivered strong top line 
growth in the first half of the year, driven by continued strength in our 
international markets. In Asia
-
Pacific, strong performance in key emerging 
markets like China, India, and Vietnam drove mid
-
single
-
digit 
organic 
revenue growth for this segment during the first half of the year. And while 
we continue to expand our total beverage portfolio across all of our Asian 
markets, our sparkling soft drink portfolio led our top line acceleration.
 
Turning to Latin Amer
ica, even in the face of headwinds, we delivered high 
single
-
digit organic revenue growth for the first half as we focus on the 
fundamentals. Mexico continues to perform well, driven by solid growth 
across our sparkling and dairy portfolios. In Brazil, a 1
0
-
day transport strike 
in late May put a virtual halt to the economy. Prior to that, we were on track 
to deliver the third quarter of sequentially improving volume growth. Our 
system worked hard to recover momentum. And by the end of the quarter, 
we had bo
unced back to pre
-
strike growth rates.
 
In EMEA, we grew organic revenue 7% year to date through balanced 
volume and price/mix. We see solid momentum in the emerging and 
developing markets, with notable strength in Central Europe and Turkey. 
And in the deve
loped markets, we continue to expand our total beverage 
portfolio through additions like Fuze Tea, Honest Coffee, and AdeZ plant
-
based beverages across Europe.
 
In North America, we're delivering strong performance in the marketplace 
year to date. According
 
to Nielsen, our U.S. retail sales are up 3% in the 
second quarter, driven by both volume and pricing. We are pleased with the 
performance of our innovation and brand
-
building initiatives. Our no
-
sugar 
sparkling soft drink portfolio delivered 7% retail val
ue growth in the quarter, 
thanks to the recently restaged Diet Coke and strong growth of Coke Zero 
Sugar.
 
Our hydration and coffee portfolios drove strong results as well. POWERADE 
ZERO, DASANI Sparkling, and our coffee portfolio each grew volume double 
di
gits. These efforts combined with the improving execution from our 
bottling partners have enabled our system to continue capturing strong 
value share gains.
 
Now, let me turn to the pricing environment in North America. Stepping 
back, the overall market rem
ains disciplined, and we remain focused on 
executing revenue growth management initiatives to grow our price/mix 
over time. However, as you can see, reported price/mix in North America 
continued to differ from market
-
level performance.
 
This was principally
 
due to three factors. First, freight costs remain a 
challenge, were slightly worse than our initial forecast. And as we noted in 
the first quarter call, outbound freight costs are reported in price/mix for 
2018. Secondly, the timing of deductions, which n
et out in the year, 
between the second quarter and the third quarter put a point of pressure on 
price/mix. Lastly, business mix put two points of pressure on reported 
price/mix, as our concentrates sparkling business grew faster than our 
finished goods bus
iness, particularly the juice and tea.
 
Combined, these factors put approximately four points of pressure on the 
reported price/mix, driving the vast majority of the difference you see 
versus the growth in scanner data. We're taking pricing actions alongsid
e 
our bottlers on our sparkling beverage brands and expect to see positive 
price/mix in the second half across the portfolio in aggregate, as our 
package downsizing and our marketplace pricing actions are fully 
implemented and the timing items reverse. The
se factors, along with the 
continued execution of our strategy, will result in stronger financial 
performance in North America in the back half.
 
So to summarize, our emerging and developing markets are accelerating, 
with double
-
digit organic revenue growth
 
year to date. And our developed 
markets are performing well, delivering low single
-
digit organic revenue 
growth.
 
Now, turning and talking a little bit about how we're driving disciplined 
sustainable growth in the business, obviously, first, it requires a 
solid 
understanding of the consumer to build the right portfolio in each market. 
Over the last few calls, we've discussed how we're expanding our portfolio 
through innovations, acquisitions, and lifting, shifting, and sustaining 
successful brands across ma
rkets. But disciplined growth also requires that 
our existing brands retain and sharpen their edge by connecting better with 
consumers' needs. We're working diligently to increase our capabilities in 
this area because satisfying key consumption occasions a
llows us to attract 
new drinkers and ultimately achieve quality leadership.
 
One example of this is Georgia Coffee in Japan. Georgia has historically had 
a strong male consumer base in Japan. So we recently launched a new 
variant called Craftsman with recip
es, flavors, and packaging designed to 
appeal more to the new consumer segments, in particular younger adults 
and women.
 
Craftsman's drinks come in premium, glass
-
like PET bottles that are 
resealable, making them portable and easier to consume. This is a c
hange 
from the traditional cans, opening up new consumption occasions that were 
previously untapped. We're off to a good start, with our coffee portfolio in 
Japan reversing recent trends and growing volume mid
-
single digits.
 
This kind of discipline of taki
ng a very tailored approach to consumption 
occasions and channels is also one of the ways we're attracting new 
sparkling drinkers. For our flagship brand Coca
-
Cola, we're leveraging the 
brand's edge, which is centered around uplift and energize, to build 
c
onsumption rituals through consumers with strategic innovation.
 
An example, Coca
-
Cola with coffee, this product started as a trial in 
Australia. Other markets are now introducing it, but with twists based on the 
learning. In Vietnam, for example, the brewe
d coffee category is very large, 
so we introduced Coke Plus Coffee there with great coffee cues like aroma, 
with less sugar, positioning it as an alternative pick
-
me
-
up for the traditional 
coffee drinker. Execution was targeted and deliberate, focusing on 
specific 
occasions and channels, like the mid
-
afternoon pick
-
me
-
up, in coffee shops 
and at work. And the early results are very promising, delivering incremental 
growth for the Coca
-
Cola brand with very little cannibalization.
 
While this is just one specif
ic example, it is indicative of the broader 
strategic approach we are taking to reinvigorate the sparking category. It's 
about leveraging brand edge and innovation to build consumption rituals by 
offering people what they want, when and where they want it.
 
Actions like this around the world have helped us accelerate the performance 
of Coke trademark, with global volume up 2% year
-
to
-
date. Of course, 
driving disciplined growth is not just about expanding our beverage portfolio. 
It's about shaping quality lea
dership for sustainable revenue profit and cash 
flow growth. Therefore, it is critical that we reduce complexity to ensure our 
system sales force is focused, our supply chain is efficient and our innovation 
pipeline gains more space and visibility at the p
oint of sale.
 
To that end, we've been identifying and killing zombie brands and SKUs 
while focusing our teams on the work that matters most. Many of you have 
asked what we mean by zombie brands and where the opportunities are. So 
let me try and give a few examples.
 
Earl
ier this year, our Middle East and North Africa business unit identified 
more than 125 underperforming SKUs to eliminate. To
-
date, we've 
discontinued 60% of those and intend to delist the rest by the end of the 
year, allowing us to reallocate resources to 
brands and strategic initiatives 
that are delivering the highest return.
 
Given the benefits we're seeing, of course, we're embedding the elimination 
of zombie SKUs and brands even further into existing routines, instilling this 
discipline deeper into our b
usiness units. This taking a more disciplined 
approach to our portfolio is only one of the ways we're looking to reduce 
complexity in the business.
 
We're also constantly focusing our teams on the work that matters most, 
driving a productivity mindset in th
e business with the aim of both funding 
reinvestment and driving cash flow improvements. For example, after a 
recent review, we've significantly reduced the number of strategic projects in 
one of our largest business units to ensure that we are sufficientl
y allocating 
resources to the highest return on investment projects, rather than targeting 
too many actions at once. This is building on the previous productivity 
actions we've laid out and helping us to drive strong 8% underlying 
operating income growth f
or the first half of the year, while continuing to 
reinvest behind our brands, because ultimately it's not just about growth for 
the sake of growing. Growth must translate into solid returns for our 
investors.
 
So taking a step back and looking at the remai
nder of the year, global 
economic growth remains robust. Now, of course, there is some level of 
uncertainty from geopolitical risk and escalating trade conflicts, but our 
industry remains vibrant and growing. And we are winning and we have 
momentum in the 
business. At the same time, the U.S. dollar has 
strengthened significantly since the beginning of the year, increasing our 
currency headwinds in the back half. So all
-
in
-
all, with increasingly currency 
headwinds partially offset by momentum in the business
, we remain focused 
on delivering the earnings guidance we laid out at the beginning of the year.
 
Let me now turn the call over to Kathy.
 
Kathy N. Waller 
-
 
The Coca
-
Cola Co.
 
Thanks and good morning, everyone.
 
As James mentioned, we saw strong underlying gr
owth in the quarter. We 
delivered 5% organic revenue growth through balanced growth in our 
volume and price/mix, giving us confidence in our top
-
line acceleration. The 
solid organic revenue growth, combined with our ongoing productivity 
measures, drove 8% 
underlying operating income growth in the quarter. 
While the underlying results are strong, as you know, our reported financials 
continue to be affected by accounting changes enacted at the beginning of 
this year and from cycling bottler refranchising acti
vity last year.
 
Our comparable operating margin increased more than 300 basis points due 
to refranchising and strong underlying performance, partially offset by an 
almost 200 basis point impact of the new accounting standards and 
currency. Productivity hel
ped to drive the underlying operating margin 
expansion, with actions across all of our operating segments. However, we 
saw a particular benefit in our corporate segment due to the Lean Center 
initiative we began during the second quarter of last year. The 
accounting 
impact from the change in revenue recognition was in line with our 
expectations.
 
It's important to note that the impact varied significantly by operating 
segment. For example, the impact to operating margins was the most 
extreme for North Americ
a, resulting in over 200 basis points of compression 
in that segment's margin. Below the line, performance was as we expected, 
allowing us to deliver comparable EPS growth of $0.61, up 3% in the 
quarter.
 
So as I turn to the remainder of the year, consideri
ng our strong 
performance in the first half of the year and for reasons James spoke to, we 
are taking up our guidance on organic revenue and underlying operating 
income growth. Specifically, we now expect organic revenue growth of at 
least 4% and underlyin
g operating income growth of at least 9%. At the 
same time, the expected currency headwinds to full year operating income is 
now expected to be 4%, an increase of three to four points since the 
beginning of the year. And, as James mentioned, we remain focu
sed on 
delivering full year comparable EPS growth within our previously
-
provided 
range of 8% to 10%.
 
Turning to cash flow, we now expect to generate cash from operations of 
approximately $8 billion. This is down from our initial outlook of at least $8.5 
bi
llion, largely driven by higher than anticipated tax payment related to an 
amendment of the prior year's tax return and stronger currency headwinds.
 
And we remain disciplined in our capital allocation. We now expect to 
reinvest $1.7 billion in the business
 
through capital expenditures. And we 
will return our free cash flow to shareowners through dividends of 
approximately $6.7 billion and an expected $1 billion in net share 
repurchases.
 
Finally, we are on track to pay down approximately $7 billion in gross 
debt, 
as previously discussed. So as you model the flow of the year, there are a 
few items to consider in terms of savings. We expect currency headwinds to 
negatively impact both net revenue and operating income in the second half 
of the year.
 
We expect th
e change in revenue recognition to benefit operating income in 
the third quarter, which is a reversal of the headwind we recognized in the 
second quarter. And we expect structural impacts to moderate as we move 
through the remainder of the year.
 
Finally, w
e expect our comparable EPS growth to be higher in the fourth 
quarter than in the third quarter, due to an additional day in the fourth 
quarter and cycling the impact from last year's natural disaster. As always, 
our Investor Relations team will be happy t
o walk through each element in 
more detail as you build out your models for the year.
 
So in summary, we delivered solid financial performance year
-
to
-
date and 
we remain focused on delivering full year comparable EPS growth within our 
previously
-
provided ra
nge of 8% to 10%.

I was hoping we could talk a little bit about the sports drink category 
because you called out POWERADE as particularly strong in the U.S. this 
quarter. We can see in the Nielsen, it's been gaining share. And I remember 
it being called out, the business in
 
Mexico, in particular, as being called out 
as a case study at the Analyst Day. So I was just hoping you could talk a 
little bit about POWERADE's position maybe like in the rest of the markets 
outside the U.S., the big ones that matter, kind of market shar
e growth 
trends, relative importance of the category, because it does seem that it 
perhaps has greater legs maybe than people tend to think. Thanks.
 
James Quincey 
-
 
The Coca
-
Cola Co.
 
Sure. Yeah, I mean, as you say, firstly, we've had a very successful run 
with 
POWERADE in Mexico. We told the story about that on the Investor Day and 
I think it's a great example of where you can bring innovation and long
-
term 
patience to going from challenger to leader.
 
Clearly inspired by some of those learnings, we've been 
looking at that in 
the U. S. We've done particularly well with POWERADE ZERO as well in the 
quarter. We made some progress. We got a lot of opportunity ahead of us. 
It's a very big category in the U.S. I think whilst we're happy that we're 
going in the rig
ht direction, there's much work to be done.
 
And obviously, one of the things that's been helping drive POWERADE in the 
U.S. and, indeed, globally, in the second quarter was, of course, its link and 
the activation related to the FIFA World Cup event, where 
it's one of the 
brands that's both advertised and present, and so we did a lot of marketing 
programs on that. So I think part of what you're seeing is the payoff of the 
marketing programs and the linkage into football.
 
As you look at the rest of the world,
 
POWERADE is charactering (19:33) 
relatively well. The sports drink category is much bigger in the Americas 
than it is in the rest of the world. You tend to see more everyday hydration. 
We have brands like Aquarius, which is big in a number of parts of Eur
ope 
and does well in Japan. So the rest of the world is not as big in sports drinks 
as the Americas is. But we had a good quarter. Good execution, good 
innovation, good link to marketing, but there's a lot more opportunity for us.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. And o
ur next question comes from Steve Powers with Deutsche 
Bank. Your line is now open.
 
Steve Powers 
-
 
Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
 
Great, thanks. So, there are, obviously, a lot of moving parts in the business 
with all the structural items, the accounting c
hanges and FX. But the 
reported gross margin this quarter was just a little light, at least of external 
projections. So I was wondering if you could just get underneath all the 
changes and talk about how the underlying gross margin might be trending. 
It lo
oks to me like maybe they're down modestly year
-
over
-
year, which 
would be consistent with the business mix away from CSDs and towards 
stills. But then again, sparkling has been kind of trending in line with the 
total company growth, if not a little bit ahe
ad, year
-
to
-
date. So I'm not sure 
that's the full explanation. So maybe you could just talk about where gross 
margins have landed year
-
to
-
date versus your own internal expectations and 
how do you expect them to evolve from here? Thank you.
 
Kathy N. Waller 
-
 
The Coca
-
Cola Co.
 
Hi, Steve. So, underlying comparable gross margins expanded about 90 
basis points. That really is driven by structural. So 300 basis points is due to 
structural and then that's offset by some currency and about 200 basis 
points from the
 
accounting changes, as you said, a lot of moving parts in the 
quarter.
 
Underlying is under pressure and it's basically it's still moderate pressure, 
but it's under pressure due to 

 
we said as we're expanding into other 
categories and you said yourself as
 
we go into more finished goods 
businesses, that we were going to have margin pressure. So it is basically 
within our expectations, because we always said we were going to offset 
that through our operating margin.
 
So, yes, there is margin compression, but 
it's very moderate, as we said, as 
we talked about at Investor Day. And it is within our expectations and we 
are managing it.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. And our next question comes from Ali Dibadj with Bernstein. 
Your line is now open.
 
Ali Dibadj

Sanford C. Ber
nstein & Co. LLC
 
Hey, guys. So I had two questions. One is just a follow
-
up on the previous 
question on the 300 basis points of comparable operating margin expansion. 
Can you quantify how much of that was actually productivity in this versus 
structural cha
nge?
 
And then the other question I had, which is not a follow
-
up, is digging a little 
bit deeper into North America tea and juice. Clearly, you downsized there 
metro volumes down, but it didn't really seem to show any price/mix pickup. 
And maybe downsizing
 
was just commodities and it was a smaller deal, but 
if you contrast that to when you were chaining the pack architecture in a 
bigger way or downsizing in sparkling, the price/mix elasticity was much 
better. You got more transactions, so the volume wasn't 
down as much.
 
So I want to understand a little bit more the strategy around downsizing. Is 
it purely commodities, or is there something from a pack architecture in 
juices and teas? And then also looking forward for that, will that continue to 
be a drag for
 
the next several quarters in North America? Thanks for those 
two.
 
James Quincey 
-
 
The Coca
-
Cola Co.
 
Okay. Let me focus in on the North American tea, juices, et cetera, et 
cetera, because that of course links to the price/mix. It's probably a slightly 
long
er answer than just tea and juice because it ladders up into the overall 
price/mix question. And of course, here, there's a temptation to just look at 
the trees and miss the forest. But I'll try and come from the detail up to the 
strategic answer.
 
So what'
s happened in tea and juice, particularly juice, there's clearly some 
cost pressure. The cost of orange juice inputs, the cost of the packaging we 
use for our juice business, in particular our chilled juice business, had a lot 
of cost pressure. So we took,
 
I think, the right strategic decision to try and 
contain the absolute level of price points in the store by downsizing some of 
the packages, which we did essentially at the beginning of Q2. What did that 
cause? It caused us to go down in volume obviously,
 
but we actually got 
positive pricing in orange juice. If you go to the Nielsen numbers, you can 
see that pricing in orange juice is up.
 
And so I think what you see is volumes are down, prices are up. Competitors 
and the retailers, on balance, didn't follo
w us overnight. They probably 
followed us closer at the beginning of the third quarter, so that's starting to 
come through. So we had probably a larger volume impact, which is 
unfortunate, but traditional for the price leader. And so that's the story in 
ju
ice. I think the juice thing will start to improve as we get into the back 
half. We'll do better competitively. And I think the consumer environment 
will adjust to the new packaging and the new price points.
 
Now, what's interesting as you do modeling is it
's really important to 
remember that in our numbers, we are combining the finished product 
business of chilled juice with the concentrate business of sparkling. Why is 
that important? The finished product business has a much higher revenue 
per unit than th
e sparkling concentrate business does. So in fact, what is 
actually happening in North America is we have positive pricing on juice. Our 
pricing is up, not just the market pricing. Our pricing is up on sparkling as 
well as the market pricing. Then you're g
oing to ask the question, how can 
the overall be down. It's because juice is declining, there's a mathematical 
effect where the weighting of the juice decline counts for more 

 
the loss of 
the juice volume counts for more than the fact both are going up.
 
S
o you can actually have an averaging problem, whereby both categories' 
pricings are going up, but the average is going down, which is the 2% 
headwind that we talked about coming from category mix. That will 
normalize itself out as juice does better into th
e year. And obviously, it's not 
really an operating income problem because you're mixing apples and pears 
with the finished product business and the sparkling business.
 
That's why as you start to look through what's happening in Q2 in North 
America, it can
 
be distracting to look at all these negatives. But when you 
layer it up to what's really going on, we're doing the right strategic actions in 
each category. We're downsizing the juice category. We're focusing on low 
and no
-
sugar in the sparkling. We're fo
cusing on smaller pack sizes, all of 
these allowing us, with the exception of juice in the short term, to get some 
volume growth, definitely get some transaction growth, getting price/mix in 
each category. That will layer up over time to generate value for
 
the 
customers and to realize pricing in the marketplace. And so as these 
temporary factors play out, you'll start to see the North America business go 
positive in the second half.
 
It's all about our long
-
term strategy of engaging with more 
consumers with 
smaller packages, more frequency, more frequently to drive value with our 
customers to have a better, more valuable consumer franchise. We've been 
executing that with our bottlers over the last few years. We've been winning 
in the marketplac
e. We're winning in the marketplace so far this year, and 
our strategy is on track. And therefore, I think it's important to look at those 
North American effects and to see them for what they are, and they are not 
a deviation. They're temporal and we'll be
 
back on track with our strategy in 
the second half.

Sure. Clearly, we're doing better with Diet Coke the second quarter than the 
first quarter, the first half of this year than we've been doing for good 
number of years. And I think we were flat in the first quarter. We were 
minus 1% in the second quart
er on volume. Clearly, Diet Coke was growing 
in terms of revenue second quarter and year to date, so it's materially better 
than we were doing before.
 
What's it doing? Firstly, we've got packaging innovation. We've got the 
marketing innovation. We've got s
ome flavor innovation. These are both 
allowing existing consumers to stay and continue to enjoy the franchise, and 
it's getting people to try it. It's not growing in aggregate yet, so there's still 
work to do. But it's certainly causing a reconsideration o
f the Diet Coke 
brand, and the flavors and the packaging and the marketing are part of that.
 
I think as you ladder that up to the overall strategic answer, the interesting 
thing is that the success and the turnaround of Diet Coke or at least the 
work in pr
ogress of a turnaround of Diet Coke is not coming at the expense 
of Coke Zero Sugar. Coke Zero Sugar is also growing double digits in North 
America volumetrically, clearly high teens, double digits in terms of revenue, 
such that we're getting strong first 
half overall revenue growth and volume 
growth with our Zero Diet portfolio in the U.S., which is a part of our 
strategy to go forward. So, good numbers, much better than before, work 
left to do.

I had just a couple of questions around cash flow. I think the cash from 
operations guidance for the year has come down a little bit, so just some 
color in terms of what's driving that. And, Kathy, I think
 
in the prepared 
remarks, you talked about still the commitment to paying down $7 billion of 
gross debt. And it looks like, at least year
-
to
-
date, there hasn't been that 
much done. So is there any connection between the cash flow and the ability 
to sort of
 
hit that goal of paying down debt over the balance of the year?
 
Kathy N. Waller 
-
 
The Coca
-
Cola Co.
 
Hi, Bryan. The cash from operations, the reason we took the shift from $8.5 
billion down to $8 billion is really based upon two things. That's one would 
be
 
the worsening currency environment of about three to four points that we 
talked about. And the second really is basically this impact of an 
unanticipated cash tax payment that was related to two prior year tax 
returns and that's a timing. So that will not
 
reverse in the current year, but 
we'll get that back in subsequent years. So that was why we changed the 
guidance.
 
The cash from operations basically is we build it up from bottoms up. So 
we've got the line of sight to get to our new number. And it does n
ot impact 
the $7 billion that we're going to pay down on the debt. That's how we plan 
to come from existing cash. That paydown, so far, you're right. We paid 
about $2 billion down so far this year. It is basically we're going to pay it 
down as it matures. 
So we've got maturity through 2019 to get to that $7 
billion. So we are continuing and we're on track to pay down the $7 billion 
and the tax guidance does not impact that at all.

So I guess I wanted to dig 
a little bit into the EMEA performance. I think the 
price/mix actually was pretty strong, even though Western Europe volume 
was a little bit down. Obviously, the weather was positive, but you also had 
the UK sugar tax into France that's been kind of a toug
h market, so just 
going through maybe dissecting performance from Western Europe versus 
the rest of the EMEA markets and then kind of the drivers of the improved 
price/mix in the quarter versus what we saw in the last quarter.
 
James Quincey 
-
 
The Coca
-
Cola
 
Co.
 
Sure. We'll try and go through those various pieces. Look, I mean, EMEA had 
a pretty good quarter. We had some strong performance. Now, I mean, 
taking some of the various factors you called out, yeah, weather was good in 
some places. It was actually b
ad in other places. It tended to be hotter and 
drier in the north, but rainier in the south. So I think weather is pluses and 
minuses on the countries, but overall it's not the biggest driver of what's 
going on in EMEA.
 
In the second quarter, we had a numb
er of very positive things occur. First, 
I would call out the broad scale launch of Fuze Tea across 37 markets in the 
EMEA group. As you will remember, we ended our joint venture with Nestlé 
on BPW. We still have Nestea in a couple of countries, but, basic
ally, we 
ended the joint venture, which, of course, meant from the beginning of the 
year, we have to have our own tea in EMEA or in the large majority of 
Europe and Russia, which we launched at the beginning of the year. It's 
driving strong performance and
 
we're very pleased with the launch so far.
 
The other thing that's going really well across EMEA is Coke Zero Sugar 
getting double
-
digit teens volume growth and double
-
digit teens revenue 
growth.
 
I mean, clearly EMEA is a football part of the world. The Wo
rld Cup was 
hosted in EMEA as well in Russia. And so we had a lot of marketing 
programs on Coke the trademark, which has been helping us a lot on 
execution behind the World Cup across EMEA, which has been helping us do 
well.
 
Clearly, some of the countries 
we've adjusted to the sugar taxes, like the 
UK, but overall, I would say it was a strong quarter for the execution of the 
portfolio, for execution of the marketing plans. And clearly, there was some 
ups and downs in terms of some of the countries.

I have a question on pricing in North America. I was hoping you could give 
us some color on your price increase that went into effect earlier this month. 
I know it's early, but how confident are you th
at this pricing will stick and 
that you won't need to promote much of it back? And then, I'd be curious to 
hear what the general response from the retailers and then your competitors 
has been. Thank you.
 
James Quincey 
-
 
The Coca
-
Cola Co.
 
Look, I mean, it's
 
an off
-
cycle price increase, but not generally popular for a 
whole variety of reasons. And clearly, it's disruptive for us. It's disruptive for 
our customers. But I think the conversations have been about how is this 
going to work for each and every custo
mer. Obviously, whilst they may 
understand the cost pressures are out there on freight, on the increases in 
steel and aluminum and other input costs that affect the bottling system and 
affect some of our finished products, clearly, these conversations are 
difficult. I think it's working its way through. We're finding ways of getting it 
to be implemented. I think the pricing will, in large measure, go through. I 
think you're starting to see that come through in Q3.
 
And so I think it's going to be one of those things that goes through into 
consumer pricing. I mean, ultimately, the beverage industry is not the only 
industry that is facing pressure from changing imports and the need to take 
pricing, whatever has been th
e driver of those input costs. And I think that 
that's partly just the general environment. So it's going through. It's been 
difficult, but I think the systems done a good job of helping the retailers.
 
And in the end, we're focused on coming back to our ce
ntral story, which is, 
okay, yeah, this is a price increase, but our focus is on helping you grow 
revenues and profits in your business with our brands and with the beverage 
categories that we often lead. And so I think it's positive.

A quick quantification. Did you or could you quantify on the Brazil strike kind 
of what that impact had on the top
-
line in the quarter? And then on the 
pricing in North America, just try
ing to understand of the four kind of issues 
that hit 2Q, are you just pricing for freight? I mean, or are you pricing for 
more than freight? I'm just trying to understand how much you need in 
terms of to offset that in the back half?
 
James Quincey 
-
 
The C
oca
-
Cola Co.
 
Look, we're not calling out numbers on Brazil. All we said is that we were 
slightly negative and we would have probably been positive if it hadn't been 
for the strike.
 
So let me talk about the North American one. Bear in mind that there's 
mult
iple types of price. The price increase I just talked about on the last 
question is predominantly the price increase from the bottling system on the 
sparkling brands in particular, which faced a whole series of input costs: 
freight, yes; plastic resins, ye
s; metal in all its various forms for many 
reasons, including tariffs. So there is some broad
-
based push on input costs 
that have kind of come in and affected us and many other industries as well. 
And that's what's driving the price increase that we took i
n the middle of the 
year, which was kind of the off
-
cycle price increase.
 
When it comes to the North American business that is in our accounting, 
obviously, the sparkling price increase the bottlers take will eventually flow 
through to the concentrate busi
ness on our sparkling side. The price 
increases that I talk about on juice, we took that effectively in the first half 
of the year, which is already planned with the retailers and the change in the 
packaging size that came into effect around the beginning 
of the second 
quarter. So there are a lot of moving pieces here on pricing in North America 
and I think it's important to disaggregate them. But again, once you 
disaggregate them, step back and come back to the overall picture, which is 
the categories are 
getting positive pricing. We've had positive pricing in the 
U.S. for several years now. We're focused on pricing, growing transactions, 
growing revenue, helping the customers grow and winning in the 
marketplace with more consumers.

So, Kathy, just one detailed question first, can you give us a sense for how 
much the FX hedging from 2018 is helping offset the EPS impact from 
currency? I just wanted to get a sense of the potentia
l headwind in 2019 as 
the hedges unwind. And then, the real question is on Latin America. The 
results were obviously strong in the quarter. We've seen a lot of political 
currency and economic volatility in the region recently. So I just want to get 
an upda
te on your level of confidence if the momentum can continue in the 
second half and I guess your view of the potential impact on your business 
or any risk in that region from the external environment here.

hedging gains from the prior year, which are impacting us in 
this year, 
particularly in EMEA. So they are obviously hedging gains are helping to 
offset to some extent. But really they're more of a cycling issue for us for 
this year. And so therefore, the next year, which I think was your underlying 
question, next ye
ar, I really don't anticipate that there will be much impact 
with us having to cycle hedging gains from 2018 into 2019.

James Quincey

The Coca

Maybe I'm feeling benevolent. I don't know what's going on here. Latin 
America, look, I think partly 

 
we had a good start in Latin America, no 
doubt 
about it. We did call out 

 
Latin America is one of those places where 
you need to look at a few quarters averaged together because it can be 
volatile. And the outlook there is there are some clouds on the horizon, but 
you know what? The thing can also tur
n positive.
 
I think sometimes the fears of what might happen are much greater than 
actually what happens. That may be true of Mexico. I think the Mexican 
environment looks like it's going to be stable and positive. Brazil, the strike 
is over. Clearly, the 
Brazilian economy is doing better than it was doing last 
year and the last few years. Argentina is looking a little more tricky. But 
look, we've been here before in Latin America several times. I don't think 
there's something that says everything suddenly 
all going to go wrong. So I 
think we've got a good plan for the second half in Latin America, together 
with our bottling partners. We're focused on growing the business. It's a part 
of the world we all understand, and I think we've got great plans to engag
e 
with the customers and the consumers.

Hello, how are you? So you have discussed at length how the refranchising 
has helped improved performance, in particular in North 
America. And now, 
as you're starting to lap more and more territories, are you seeing any signs 
that trends may be slowing in some of these markets? And if not, because of 
tough comparisons, or are you still seeing the solid momentum building? 
Thank you.
 
J
ames Quincey

The Coca

Sure. I think the short answer is we've got continued momentum. We have 
volume growth in the U.S., which we didn't have for a long time. We've got 
positive pricing there. So I think the execution of the bottlers continues t
o be 
strong. Our partners remain pleased, exciting. Arca announced a big 
investment recently. So I think there's a lot of belief that we can continue to 
do well in North America. We have a good strategy.
 
As you look around the rest of the world, we had a v
ery good first half in 
China. We refranchised the system in China. We've now got two really 
strong partners with COFCO and with Swire. And we had a much better start 
to the year in China, good volume growth, good revenue growth.
 
And again, as you go around
, look at either the refranchisings we've done or 
new bottler combinations that are coming to being around the world, and 
even honestly some of our existing bottlers who want to be part of the 
refranchising continue to invest and continue to grow. So the s
ystem 
remains strong. Of course, there are countries here and there that are 
challenging. The system remains strong. It's executing, and so therefore, 
collectively we're all doing better. I think the headline growth by the 
company is symbolic and a proxy f
or the fact the system, this bottling 
system is also doing better.

Hi. Good morning. This is Aatish Sh
ah on for Pablo. Just one question, the 
price/mix in LatAm increased 12% in the quarter versus 6% in 1Q. But 
margins fell in 2Q after increasing in the prior quarter. Can you provide 
some color on that dynamic regarding that pricing cost versus margins?
 
Ka
thy N. Waller 
-
 
The Coca
-
Cola Co.
 
Yes, so pricing was up 12% in the quarter and that was driven from strong 
price/mix in Mexico, Brazil, South Latin. So operational price/mix was up as 
well as then the timing of some deductions that were reversing from Q1 
of 
last year.
 
So when you talk about margins, though, the operating margins are down 
120 basis points. Comparable operating margins are down, but year
-
to
-
date 
margins are up 80 basis points. And that is driven pretty much from 
structural. So we had structu
ral in this year as we are refranchising a couple 
of bottlers in Latin America, and that's offset by some currency and a little 
bit from the accounting change. But the underlying business in Latin America 
expanded and is doing well. So most of that 80 poin
ts of year
-
to
-
date 
margin expansion is due to the underlying business and the strong 
price/mix.

I'm just wondering if you could talk a

shipment in the second quarter. Does that reverse in the back half, or what 
are inventories like overall? And how does more finished good product

that, just a little discussion around timing of shipments and what to look for 
in the back half?
 
James Quincey 
-
 
The Coca
-
Cola Co.
 
Sure. Overall concentrate CSD sales, at the headline level, in line with unit 
cases, and of course there's one day le
ss in the first half, which on a straight 
line basis is about 0.5 point, one day in 180. So it's not a massive difference. 
In theory, it will reverse itself in the second half, which in a way is a small 
headwind in the second half. But I think I wouldn't o
ver
-
engineer the thing. 
There's no big buildup of inventory of concentrates or finished products. It's 
largely a building ahead of a strong summer, a strong marketing program 
with FIFA. Therefore, I think it evens itself out over time. We may be 
fractional
ly ahead in the year

So we recently got the biannual use consumption data for the U.S., which, 
not 
surprisingly, showed consistent declines, which you've been seeing over 
the last decade, for high school past week soda consumption. But we don't, 
as far as I know, have this data for any international market. So, James, I 
was wondering. Can you just comme
nt on what's happening on with like use 
soda consumption in like other developed markets? Thanks.
 
James Quincey 
-
 
The Coca
-
Cola Co.
 
Yeah. I mean, look, the Coca
-
Cola sparkling beverage category is in 
developed countries is in slight volume growth with posi
tive pricing. Our 
strategy is to focus on transactions. We'd rather have more transactions, 
even if that meant flat or even slightly less volume, but more transactions 
with less calories and with more revenue. And we think that'll create a 
stronger franchi
se. And I think that's what you're seeing in the numbers 
across the developed markets.
 
And I think when you look at incidence rates, as we would call them, by 
young adults, then I think you see people starting to reengage with the 
category as we bring out 
smaller packages, as we bring out zero sugar 
options. And so I think we're starting to see that trend in the U.S. come to a 
different place and that's the strategy that we're following. We think it's 
going to play out over time.
 
Now, the reality is the rea
son we're doing Beverages for Life is also because 
it's not going to go back to what it was 40 years ago when there were 
relatively limited choice about the number of beverages. When you look at 
any consumption patent data across the developed world or, in
 
fact, the 
developing or the emerging, the two biggest factors to call out is people 
continue to come into the commercial beverage market. Incidence rates for 
commercial beverages continue to go up. Yes, they're trying to have less 
calories, but total inci
dents of commercial beverages is going up. But it's 
more diversified.
 
Therefore, if we want to have and engage with the vibrant industry that's 
growing, we need a bigger portfolio. So we need to do justice and maintain 
the relevancy of the sparkling catego
ry, which is about consumer 
engagement, the marketing, but also smaller packages and the zero calories 
and some innovation, but also about winning in some of the other categories 
we've chosen to focus on. Consumers are buying more beverages, but they 
are b
uying it because of diversity.

A couple, if I could slip them in, James, could we get an update on the 
timing for the CCBA transaction? I think last we heard, it was going to be, or 
at 
least the thinking was, end of September, which would suggest we could 
have heard something by now, but it's been relatively quiet. So an update 
there would be helpful.
 
And then, Kathy, a quick point of clarification on the EPS guidance, just as 
we sort of
 
like tumble through the numbers that's enabled the company to 
maintain the 8% to 10% EPS growth. So FX, freight, commodities, it 
worsened. Perhaps investment levels are higher in North America to match 
Pepsi. You can comment on the last one, if you'd like
 
to, but top line better. 
Price increases in operating leverage. What else has come in sort of a bit 
better? Is it on the productivity side that's enabled the company to offset the 
higher FX rate, et cetera, for the year? So if you could comment there, tha
t 
would be helpful. Thank you.
 
James Quincey

The Coca

You want to take the last one?
 
Kathy N. Waller

The Coca

Sure. So on the EPS guidance, obviously, the underlying business continues 
to perform well, as evidenced by us taking up our
 
OI targets. I think the 
thing you're not focusing on is first, there's less deleveraging below the line 
than we previously talked about earlier in the year. So given the way 
currencies have moved, that impact is actually less on profit before tax than 
it 
is on operating income.
 
And then, we also have, as you remember, there was another accounting 
change that moved pension, split the pension cost, and part of it is now 
below the line, which also puts a little bit more volatility in other income, but 
that's 
helping some of that deleveraging below the line, so below operating 
income. So all
-
in, we feel good about the underlying business and then 
we've got enough other things that are helping us to stay within our 
guidance.

businesses, ultimately, with our bottling partners, in Africa. We make a lot of 
investments there. We think it's got an excel
lent long term future. And we 
continue to invest. I mean, just in the second quarter, we did well in Nigeria 
and some of the other kind of northern and eastern countries in Africa.
 
As it relates to South Africa, I'll say something about South Africa and th
en 
I'll relate it to the CCBA because it's not related. In South Africa, we didn't 
do so well in the second quarter. That was anticipated because of the 
implementation of the sugar tax in South Africa in Q2. We had a reasonably 
good plan. I don't think we 
perhaps were as aggressive on the 
reformulations as we should have been. Competitors were more aggressive. 
And so we quickly course
-
corrected in the quarter and now we're better. So 
in the short term, the biggest thing that's happened in South Africa is th
e 
implementation of the sugar tax and we've adjusted and are sorting 
ourselves out for that. And things will get better into the second half.
 
Nothing that's happened in the second quarter is related to the timing on 
CCBA. Everyone knew that the sugar tax w
as going to come in. As was 
previously commented, we talked about trying to sort this out by the back 
half of the year. Clearly, the process was a little slower at the beginning for 
a number of regulatory and approval reasons, slow in getting started. It's
 
up 
and running. We've got a number of interested parties, existing bottlers, 
potential new South African partners. The data rooms are up and running.
 
The management presentations have happened and we're expecting to get 
back indicative proposals in the co
ming months. And of course in the end, it 
goes back to what it always will be. Once we've got those, we'll be asking 
ourselves the question, do we have the right partner, with the right 
philosophy, with the right investment plan? And can we do this at the 
right 
price? We're looking to sell, of course, at the price that sets them up for 
success, but recognizes the value of the asset.
 
And hopefully, that will all come together in the coming months and we'll be 
on track, but we are going to do the right thing 
for the business there. 
Hopefully, we'll get the right answer, but we're going to focus on making 
sure we continue to invest for the long term in South Africa and the rest of 
Africa. It's a vibrant continent and we're very positive on the growth of each 
an
d every country there going forward.

James Quincey

The Coca
-
Cola Co.
 
Than
ks, Tim, and good morning, everyone. We've had another solid quarter 
that has included a number of notable developments, from M&A to changes 
in our leadership team. And I'll come to all of that shortly, but let me start 
by focusing on our quarter and our y
ear to
-
date performance.
 
We are gaining share in a growing industry. Industry growth has improved 
from last year, driven by better results across both developed and emerging 
markets. Some large emerging markets like China, India and Brazil, are 
clearly doi
ng better. Others like Argentina, South Africa and the Middle East, 
are not doing so well. But collectively, we are seeing solid results.
 
We've been capturing more than our fair share of growth as we've continued 
to execute on our transformation as a total
 
beverage company. And notably, 
the industry has seen better performance within the global sparkling soft 
drink category, delivering both volume and value growth year
-
to
-
date.
 
Turning to our operational performance, we are managing our business well 
across
 
key dimensions. Organic revenue is up 5% year
-
to
-
date, driven by 
strength across all operating segments. Unit case volume is up 2%, led by 
Trademark Coca
-
Cola, which grew 3% globally. Comparable EPS is up 8% 
year
-
to
-
date, in line with our guidance of 8% t
o 10% for the full year.
 
This is despite significantly stronger currency headwinds than we anticipated 
at the beginning of 2018. We accomplished this through a combination of 
top
-
line growth and productivity initiatives as driving underline margin 
expansio
n even as we continue to invest back in the marketing and face a 
rising cost environment.
 
Finally, our top and bottom
-
line growth is broad
-
based. Developed markets 
have grown organic revenues low single digits year
-
to
-
date, and our 
emerging and developing 
markets have grown double digits year
-
to
-
date.
 
Turning to our geographic performance in the quarter, in EMEA, we grew 
organic revenue 9%, benefiting from solid operational price/mix as well as 
from geographic mix. During the quarter, we saw strong growth a
cross 
Europe, driven by Coca
-
Cola Zero Sugar, Fuze Tea and innocent, all helped 
by good weather.
 
In some of the emerging and developing markets like Turkey and the Middle 
East, the macroeconomic environment is tough, but ongoing packaging and 
pricing initi
atives are helping us deliver solid revenue growth while staying 
affordable.
 
Turning to Asia Pacific, despite cycling a more difficult comparison period, 
strong performance in China and India drove another quarter of mid
-
single
-
digit organic revenue growth
 
for the segment. In Japan, a solid innovation 
pipeline was overshadowed by natural disasters in July and September, 
which included a flood that destroyed a production facility for our bottler, 
impacting our capacity. Looking ahead, we'll continue working 
closely with 
our bottler to minimize the impact and protect our position in the market.
 
In Latin America, we delivered 19% organic revenue growth for the quarter 
as we continued to execute against the fundamentals amid a variety of 
macroeconomic environmen
ts. Now worth noting, 9 points of that growth is 
due to the timing of concentrate shipments in Brazil, which will reverse out 
in the fourth quarter. However, even after adjusting for this timing element, 
we still delivered double
-
digit top
-
line growth in t
he quarter.
 
In Brazil, our business continued its recovery, with volume growth 
accelerating to 3% in the quarter, driven by positive performance in all 
category clusters. Argentina, on the other hand, faces increasingly 
challenging macro conditions, so we'
re focusing on expanding our returnable 
packaging infrastructure and adjusting our price/pack architecture to 
maintain key price points and affordability. It's a playbook we understand, 
even one I've personally managed before.
 
Mexico. Mexico continues to p
erform well, benefiting from new product 
launches and strong growth in Trademark Coca
-
Cola, supported by solid 
execution from our bottling system.
 
Finally, North America, we continue to deliver strong performance in the 
marketplace and gain value share. Du
ring the quarter, our system took a 
price increase to address pressure from higher import and transportation 
costs. As a result, our price/mix improved 3 points sequentially, resulting in 
a slight positive price/mix for the first quarter this year.
 
And we 
continue to deliver strong performance, especially within the Zero 
Sugar portfolio. This, in turn, led to accelerated organic revenue growth of 
2% and comparable operating income growth of 5% in the third quarter.
 
Now, let's talk a bit about how we're driv
ing disciplined growth in the 
business. Of course, it all starts with the consumer. Over the last few calls, 
we've discussed how we've been leveraging innovations, like Coke with 
coffee, to grow our portfolio by addressing key consumption occasions. And 
al
so how we're lifting, shifting and scaling successful brands, like Fuze Tea, 
across multiple markets.
 
However, there are times when we need or want to look externally and 
leverage M&A to drive our total beverage portfolio. M&A, of course, is not a 
strategy
 
in of itself. It's an enabler of our strategy. And while the focus of 
M&A continuously evolves, what's consistent is we remain disciplined about 
our allocation of capital and about the mission of M&A as an enabler.
 
Over the last few months, we've 
announced quite a few acquisitions and 
investments. Each one is part of our larger strategy to broaden our 
consumer
-
centric portfolio, but don't read too much into the number of 
transactions in a single quarter and extrapolate that as the pace of activity 
going forward.
 
We, of course, use M&A for many purposes: to fill gaps in our portfolio, yes; 
enter emerging categories; or even obtain capabilities or platforms that 
complement our existing strengths. And we look for opportunity to create 
value by scaling 
brands to be bigger and better than they already are.
 
In North America, we invested in BODYARMOR, a premium sports 
performance and hydration brand that's one of the fastest
-
growing beverage 
trademarks in the United States. In Australia, we purchased Organi
c & Raw 
Trading Company, which gives us MOJO, our first company
-
owned 
kombucha brand. And we invested in the Made Group, which is known for 
products like cold
-
pressed juice and high
-
protein smoothies.
 
In Europe, we purchased Tropico, which gives our French
 
business a strong 
foothold in the still fruit
-
flavored beverages. We believe these brands that 
have strong edge will eventually allow us to gain quality leadership in the 
respective categories.
 
And, of course, our biggest announcement in the quarter was o
ur pending 
acquisition of Costa. What we get with Costa is more than just a brand. It's a 
platform that will give us the ability to scale within the $500 billion global 
hot beverage category. Despite the size of Costa, our approach will be 
similar to the o
ther deals, like innocent and Honest. We'll aim to preserve 
Costa's unique capabilities, while adding the strength of the Coca
-
Cola 
system.
 
As with all our M&A, completing the acquisition is only the first step. What is 
critical is accelerating our results
 
and executing with precision.
 
To ensure we properly connect and globally scale key acquisitions, 
investments and partnerships, we have created a new group, Global 
Ventures, to be led by Jennifer Mann. In this newly
-
created position, Jennifer 
and her team 
will focus on ensuring we get the maximum value from 
acquisition and investments like Costa, our partnership with Monster 
Beverages, et cetera. This group will also partner with colleagues around the 
world to identify and nurture the next series of fast
-
gr
owing opportunities.
 
As you'll recall, this was just one of the organizational changes we 
announced in mid
-
October. Now, more than ever, we must constantly adapt 
our business to the changing marketplace. The leadership changes we're 
making over the coming 
months are significant, and I believe that they will 
set us up for success in the years to come.
 
Beginning January 1, Brian Smith will become our President and Chief 
Operating Officer. In this role, Brian will bring an accelerated focus on the 
execution of
 
our initiatives in the field, while I'll focus on the overall success 
of the company, as well as our long
-
term strategic direction.
 
Brian is a valued business partner with tremendous experience, most 
recently as Group President for Europe, Middle East & A
frica. At a time when 
our business is fast
-
changing and more complex than ever, it's important to 
have a skilled executive who can focus intently on the success of our field 
operations. I can't think of a better fit than Brian.
 
We've also announced a succe
ssion plan for our Chief Financial Officer. 
Kathy, who's had a tremendous 32
-
year career at the company, will retire as 
CFO in March of next year. She'll be succeeded as CFO by John Murphy, who 
will begin the transition to his new job by serving as Deputy 
CFO starting 
January 1. John currently leads our Asia Pacific group and is a great choice 
for the vital work of overseeing our Finance organization. John's extensive 
experience includes financial, strategy and operational roles, so he's a 
natural fit to st
ep in.
 
And, finally, we elected Nancy Quan as Chief Technical Officer. Nancy will 
join my leadership team to focus on product supply, strategic sourcing and 
technical governance as we evolve as a total beverage company. These 
changes led to a number of oth
ers that we also announced. And I'm pleased 
that our deep bench allows us to move a group of diverse, talented and 
experienced leaders into new roles quickly.
 
So, in summary, the global economy is still growing, but remains volatile. 
Some markets are getti
ng better, while others are struggling as the 
economic cycle moves to a different phase. Our industry is growing, driven 
by both developed and emerging markets. And we are winning with 
momentum in our business. So, despite currency moving against us, we 
re
main focused on delivering the earnings guidance we laid out at the 
beginning of the year.
 
Finally, I'd like to thank Kathy. While Kathy will be with us through next 
March, I would be remiss not to take a moment to thank her and 
acknowledge her outstanding
 
career. Over her 32 years here at the 
company, Kathy has made significant contributions to both our company and 
the system, working her way from Financial Analyst all the way to the most 
senior Finance role in the company, truly, a testament to the value 
she has 
brought through every phase of her journey.
 
And as CFO for the past five years, she executed the company's financials 
through the extremely complex refranchising process and she is leaving a 
strong foundation for John to build on. And, finally, she
 
has been a critical 
partner to me and I have appreciated all her valuable support. Thank you, 
Kathy.

Thank you, James, and good morning, everyone. It has been a tremendous 
honor to serve as the Chief Financial Officer o
f The Coca
-
Cola Company. 
During my tenure with the company, I have seen our business evolve and 
grow from a sparkling beverage company with three principal brands to a 
total beverage company with numerous billion
-
dollar brands that span 
across all beverage
 
categories.
 
It has also been a pleasure working for first Muhtar and now James. I'm 
excited for the future of the company. We have a great leadership team that 
will continue to build on and execute the company's strategy. And I'm 
particularly excited abou
t the incoming CFO, John Murphy. John's experience 
and capabilities will allow him to be a great partner to James and a great 
leader for the Finance organization. So, I'm looking forward to working with 
my team as we close out the rest of 2018, and I look 
forward to working 
with John to ensure a smooth transition as he takes over in 2019.
 
Now, turning to our performance in the quarter, as James mentioned, we 
saw strong underlying growth, building on a solid first half. We delivered 6% 
organic revenue growth
, driven by 4% concentrate shipments and 2% 
price/mix. Concentrate shipments outpaced unit case volume growth by 2 
points in the quarter. This was due largely to Brazilian bottlers building 
inventory as a precaution to any further supply disruptions in the
 
country 
around the presidential elections and ahead of changes in local tax 
regulation. We anticipate this inventory build will reverse in the fourth 
quarter, as the elections are now completed and the tax regulation has been 
phased
-
in.
 
So strong organic 
revenue growth, combined with ongoing productivity 
measures and the timing of expenses, drove 20% underlying operating 
income growth in the quarter. While the underlying results are strong, as 
you know, our reported financials continue to be affected by ac
counting 
changes enacted at the beginning of this year, and from cycling bottler 
refranchising activity from last year. Our comparable operating margin 
increased 575 basis points due to refranchising and strong underlying 
performance, partially offset by a
n approximate 130 basis point impact from 
new accounting standards and currency.
 
Productivity helped drive a roughly 400 basis point expansion in underlying 
operating margins, with actions across all of our operating segments. 
However, we saw a particular 
benefit in our North America and Corporate 
segment due to Lean enterprise initiatives.
 
The accounting impact from the change in revenue recognition was roughly 
in line with our expectations. It's important to note that the impact varied 
significantly by op
erating segment. For example, Latin America saw over a 
400 basis points benefit in its margins, while North America's margin was 
impacted by roughly 250 basis points. So I recognize that there are a lot of 
moving parts, but if you were to neutralize each o
f these effects, our 
underlying operating margins expanded about 400 basis points in the 
quarter and about 200 basis points for the year
-
to
-
date period.
 
Below the line, we benefited from a lower tax rate. In order to bring our 
year
-
to
-
date effective tax ra
te in line with our revised full year expectation 
of 20.3%, we recorded an effective tax rate of 19% in the quarter. So all
-
in, 
good operational performance, coupled with a timing benefit and a lower 
effective tax rate, resulted in comparable EPS of $0.58 
in the quarter, up 
14%, which includes an 8% unfavorable impact from currency.
 
So before turning to the fourth quarter, let me provide an update on bottler 
transactions. I am happy to announce that with the sale of our company
-
owned bottler in Canada at th
e end of the third quarter, we have now 
completed our North America bottler refranchising process. We've set 
ourselves up for the future with an energized bottling system that is bringing 
a renewed focus on their local markets.
 
In Asia, we expect to acquir
e 51% of our Philippines bottler from Coca
-
Cola 
FEMSA during the fourth quarter. This will become part of our Bottling 
Investments Group, which is now comprised primarily of Southwest and 
Southeast Asian bottlers. These two transactions should roughly offs
et each 
other, resulting in a minimal structural impact in our P&L in 2019.
 
In Africa, we are moving forward with the sales process for our company
-
owned bottler, but we now expect to sell an equity stake in Coca
-
Cola 
Beverages Africa in 2019 rather than i
n the fourth quarter of 2018.
 
Now turning to the remainder of this year, considering our performance 
year
-
to
-
date and despite an increasingly challenging currency environment, 
we are maintaining our guidance on organic revenue and comparable EPS 
growth. Sp
ecifically, we continue to expect organic revenue growth of at 
least 4% and comparable EPS growth of 8% to 10%. However, there are 
two elements within that guidance that are changing and then there's a third 
element that impacts phasing. While these balanc
e each other for the full 
year, due to the timing of each, they do result in a shift between quarters.
 
So first, we expect the third quarter inventory buildup in our Brazilian 
bottlers to reverse in the fourth quarter. Second, we now expect to sell 
CCBA, C
oca
-
Cola Beverages Africa, in 2019 instead of in 2018. As such, a 
$0.02 structural benefit that we expected to receive from this transaction 
will now shift from the fourth quarter 2018 into our 2019 earnings.
 
Third, we now expect an effective tax rate of 
20.3% for the full year versus 
our original estimate of 21%. Now while this will be a slight benefit to our 
fourth quarter earnings, it was a much larger benefit to our third quarter 
earnings. And this was because we needed to bring our year
-
to
-
date 
effect
ive tax rate in line with our revised full year expectation. So as such, 
we recorded an effective tax rate of 19% in the third quarter. Now, taken 
together, these three changes represent a $0.03 unfavorable impact to 
fourth quarter earnings, while the full
 
year does not change.
 
As always, our Investor Relations team will be happy to walk through each 
element in more detail as you build out your models for the year.
 
Turning to cash flow, we continue to expect to generate cash from 
operations of approximately
 
$8 billion. And we remain disciplined in our 
capital allocation. We continue to expect to reinvest $1.7 billion in the 
business through capital expenditures. And we will return free cash flow to 
shareowners through dividends of approximately $6.7 billion 
and an 
expected $1 billion in net share repurchase.
 
So in summary, we delivered solid financial performance in both the quarter 
and year
-
to
-
date periods, and we remain focused on delivering full year 
comparable EPS within our previously
-
provided range of 8
% to 10%. So, 
Operator, we're now ready for questions.

So I guess my question is related to CCBA. And I think in the press release, 
there's a write
-
down that's been described there. And so, I guess my 
questio
n is a couple of things. One, what's driving the write
-
down in CCBA? 
And how should we think about maybe how you're thinking about structuring 
a deal going forward? Is that just lower the price? Or you're thinking about 
different types of ownership structu
res? Just any update there would be 
helpful.

Kathy N. Waller

Yeah, want me to start? So, yeah, so the actual write
-
down was a function 
of the impairment indicators. So for accounting purposes, we 
have to look at 
all of our investments. And we do that at a certain time of year. And based 
upon the indicators, what happened with the macro environment, and 
particularly the currency devaluation in South Africa, drove us to have an 
impairment that we had
 
to write down, basically. And it's not a function of 
trying to change the price to sell in the future. It's merely an accounting 
impairment.
 
James Quincey 
-
 
The Coca
-
Cola Co.
 
Yeah, and I'm not sure that that radically changes how we're thinking about 
stru
cturing the deal. We've got a number of conversations ongoing with 
different parties about how we might create a stronger system in South and 
East Africa.
 
If you invest in the emerging markets, you don't always expect a straight 
line. And that's kind of wh
at's come through in the impairment driven by the 
macros, and as we've adapted to the sugar tax in the second quarter.
 
But our view of the long
-
term attractiveness of Africa, or the youngest 
billion, remains undimmed. And we think it's a very exciting asse
t. And so 
we're working with different parties on potential setups.

So, James, I, too, was hoping to maybe step away from the quarter a 
moment and just ask a question on how new initiatives are being prioritized 
across the system under the total beverages company strategy. An
d 
specifically, how you've been able to streamline potential points of friction 
between yourselves and your bottling partners.
 
Over the years, I guess, it seems to me, at least, like there have been many 
good intentions, but oftentimes, the systems may hav
e been bogged down 
in debating who should spend what portion of new initiative costs; 
conversely, who should reap more of the benefits. Just everyone seems to 
have a different definition of what equitable means.
 
But today, just by virtue of how fast the sy
stem is bringing new ideas to 
market, both organically and now, as you highlighted, through M&A, it 
seems like you've been able to maybe cut through some of that red tape and 
focus more on the end consumer.
 
So again, maybe just talk a little bit more, if y
ou could, about the changes 
that have been made. Maybe how the new Global Ventures group may fit in 
going forward. And then, ultimately, how should investors, in fact, think 
about what portion of the costs versus what portion of the benefits accrues 
to KO 
versus the bottling partners? Thanks.
 
James Quincey 
-
 
The Coca
-
Cola Co.
 
Well, that is indeed a broad question. I think, firstly, it would be fair to 
recognize that the system is benefiting from the experiments and the things 
we've been doing over the last 
10
-
plus years around the world to try and 
expand into a number of other categories.
 
So we've been experimenting and learning and identifying what's good 
practice and what's not so good practice for a good number of years now. 
And you're seeing that base of
 
knowledge and expertise growing, that's 
allowing us to have a foundation to move faster.
 
Clearly, the end of the refranchising process and having a kind of a clear 
partnership network with well
-
funded partners who want to invest and want 
to win in the mar
ketplace, combined with a greater degree of organizational 
clarity and focus on empowerment and accountability and getting things 
done on the company side, whether that be the marketing, the innovation, 
the M&A, whichever piece of the puzzle is required, h
as clearly helped.
 
And then, I think the Global Ventures is another step in that direction. We've 
had acquisitions in parts of the world. We've had venturing emerging brands 
units in different parts of the world.
 
What we've not been so successful at is tyi
ng that together across regions, 
across the groups, if you like, and I think that's what this represents in 
terms of the Global Ventures. So rather than letting something be successful 
in one group and it taking forever to get to another group, this unit h
ere will 
be there to help push and drive the agenda for greater speed going forward.
 
At the end of the day, how do we get faster? We get faster not just because 
of all those things, but because there are exciting, interesting, financially
-
attractive opport
unities that the system can capture.
 
The relative economics and the capital needed differ by category. They differ 
depending on the starting point of the different systems in the different part 
of the world, what's already been built. And, of course, what 
we've learned 
over the years with our partners is how to move quickly to a place where it's 
attractive for everyone.
 
At the end of the day, if it's not attractive for everyone, it's not going to go 
very far, and that's us, our bottling partners and, ultima
tely, the customers 
and down to the end consumer. So, it just needs to be organized, so the 
incentives are clear and attractive.

So, I wanted to focus on emerging markets. There's obviously been a lot of 
market concern over the slowing macros in China. There's been the election 
volatility down in Latin America. You mentioned a number of emerging 
markets, some of which are lookin
g more positive. Some of which aren't 
looking as positive. So, I guess, James, can you just give us a bit of an 
update on your perspective on the macro outlook here in emerging markets 
as you look around the world; not so much a review of the quarter, but 
sort 
of what you saw sequentially as you moved through the quarter in October, 
and any forward
-
looking thoughts? And while we're on that subject, 
obviously, a stronger dollar sort of reflects those emerging markets 
concerns. So, any thoughts on sort of the
 
FX pressure for 2019 earnings 
based on where we stand today would also be helpful. Thanks.
 
James Quincey 
-
 
The Coca
-
Cola Co.
 
Yeah. Kind of in reverse order; it's a little early to provide FX guidance for 
2019. But I think that, look, when you stand back, 
clearly, there are some 
emerging markets that got better. If we'd been talking two, three years ago, 
we were having a tougher time in China, Brazil, recently India. But those 
have all improved over the last 6 to 12 months. And we have good growth in 
all of
 
them, including Brazil.
 
But in the meantime, it's got tougher in a number, whether that's Argentina, 
Turkey, South Africa and the Middle East. So I think there's clearly some 
additional volatility in the emerging markets. I think you can see that in the 
G
DP numbers. You can see that in the GDP forecasts. At least the IMF and 
some of the others are coming and going, oh, okay, it's getting a little 
softer. And I think that's representative of the U.S. dollar's strength in 
recent months.
 
Exactly what the path
 
forward would be is hard to predict exactly at this 
point in time. We're clearly moving to a slightly different phase in the 
economic recovery, and I think that will bring some ups and downs. But net
-
net, we've got a portfolio across 200
-
plus countries. W
e're seeing growth in 
the developed, in the developing, in the sum of the emerging.
 
And at the end of the day, we could do a lot of crystal ball gazing, but what's 
really important is we focus on what we can do, on what we can control, 
which is about stayi
ng close to the consumer, understanding what drinks 
and packages they want, working with our customers to work out how to 
create value for them, provide the right marketing and the right innovations, 
so the system can execute with excellence, and that will
 
deliver us a winning 
formula in good days and in bad days.

I have a question for you guys on your marketing spend in the quarter and 
so far this year. In general, I'm wondering if you're seeing the lift you 
expected from your spending. And then, could you give us a sen
se of how 
much your spending has increased this year or not, and how we should think 
about that evolving in the future? I guess I'm assuming as a percentage of 
sales, it would likely increase, given your lower revenue base, but on an 
absolute dollar basis,
 
how should we think about this going forward? Will you 
plan to increase spend in the future? Thanks.
 
James Quincey 
-
 
The Coca
-
Cola Co.
 
Yeah. I think, clearly, there are some mechanical parts to the P&L as we sell 
some of the bottling and refranchising has
 
come to a close. But we have 
been pursuing a steadfast strategy of reinvesting in our business for a 
number of years. And so I think there's no big discontinuity happening or 
seen out there at this stage.
 
So I think the marketing spend, I think is produci
ng good results. We are 
winning in the marketplace. We're growing the soft drink category in 
revenue and volume. The Coke Trademark's growing. Coke Zero Sugar's 
growing. We're seeing the sales and volume and transaction uplifts, 
engagements by the consumer
s with the brands, so we think we're in a good 
place in terms of what are marketing is delivering for us. So leaving aside 
the mechanical effects of refranchising to the P&L and the percentage of 
DME, then I think it's relatively steady as we go. So yeah, 
I think you can 
see those examples.

Great. Thanks. I was hoping you could talk a little bit about competiti
ve 
dynamics in North America. Latest Nielsen came out today and shows that 
Pepsi still does not appear to have moved on pricing. So if you could just 
talk a little bit about what you're seeing actually in the marketplace, because 
I know Nielsen is not alwa
ys the most representative. Thanks.
 
James Quincey 
-
 
The Coca
-
Cola Co.
 
Yeah. So clearly, we've taken some price increases this year in the U.S. 
marketplace, whether that be in the juice category by changes in the 
packaging, in soft drinks, in the number of 
channels. And, clearly, we've 
been pushing that through over the years under the headline of we're doing 
a lot of things to engage the consumer with the various categories in our 
portfolio from the marketing and the packaging, working with our customers 
to
 
create value for them.
 
We think this is a strategy that has worked for us over the recent years and 
will continue and is continuing to work for us going forward. So, I'm not sure 
it makes that much sense for me to comment on short periods of 
competitive p
ricing activity. We've always said, look, we're going to follow a 
rational pricing approach with a few points of pricing, which is what's 
happening on an underlying basis. In the U.S., it won't necessarily be a 
straight line for all sorts of reasons, but w
e're going to stick to our strategy. 
And I think that's the one that will see us through to the right place.

So, I guess my question is just on the guidance. So, one is just clarification, 
so for this year, if we 
think about all the moving parts, on the comparable 
EPS, really the only thing that's changing is the tax rate coming down, which 
is about $0.02 or $0.03 benefit to your guidance. And then, I know you're 
not giving 2019 guidance, but as we think about, Jam
es, your sort of 
commitment to continue to grow comparable EPS even with some of the FX 
headwinds, you've got tax rate benefit going away next year, FX probably 
another 2 or 3 points headwind. So maybe conceptually, what are some of 
the P&L levers that you
 
can continue to focus on to really drive growth and 
comparable EPS? Thanks.
 
James Quincey

The Coca
-
Cola Co.
 
Do you want to start with it?
 
Kathy N. Waller 
-
 
The Coca
-
Cola Co.
 
Certainly. So, yes, there's the tax benefit for this year. And given that the 
s
tructural is slightly worse than we said at the beginning of the year, and 
then, frankly, currency is worse than we said at the beginning of the year. 
We are going to stick to our 8% to 10% guidance.
 
James Quincey 
-
 
The Coca
-
Cola Co.
 
Yeah. And 2019, it's t
oo early to get into 2019. But in the end, we said we're 
going to follow three pillars in trying to manage the business going forward. 
We need to grow the top line by doing the right things for the consumer in 
terms of the beverages, the marketing, the pac
kaging, the innovation. 
Create value with our customers, have the right refranchised bottlers to 
execute in the marketplace. That will drive local top line in each of the 200
-
plus countries we operate in.
 
We'll focus ourselves and as a system on being effi
cient stewards of the P&L 
and the capital, such that the margins, again, locally, will be appropriate for 
that business and for driving growth. And then, of course, the piece that we 
have to bring together as the portfolio management is paying attention to
 
what that translates to in comparable EPS earnings. How are we going to put 
that puzzle together for 2019, we'll come back to in a future date.

So, you're delivering pretty well on fanning out the portfolio to effectively to 
meet consumers
' needs, including with M&A. Could you talk more about the 
pace of activity from you and I guess the size of activity we actually should 
extrapolate then for the company going forward?
 
And also, how specifically has management incentive expectations and 
st
ructure kind of changed all the way throughout the organization to really 
make sure that these investments work and allow these brands to come in 
and be successful within your relatively complex ecosystem, without this, 
what we often see and I think what y
ou guys have suffered for in the past, 
some sort of organ
-
rejection issues.
 
And then also from a strategic perspective, you've stuck to nonalcoholic 
ready
-
to
-
drink so far. What are your views about alcoholic right now? 
Clearly, there are some experimentati
ons where your CFO is leaving 

 
or 
your new CFO will be leaving from, but are you open to that world as well in 
the short term? Thanks a lot.
 
James Quincey 
-
 
The Coca
-
Cola Co.
 
Thanks, Ali. Look, I think the pace of M&A, clearly, the third quarter was a 
mor
e active quarter than normal.
 
When we look at M&A opportunities, it's obviously a function of, are we 
seeing things that work for us in terms of a role for that in our business, 
whether it be a role in the portfolio, a role in the capabilities, providing u
s 
with a new entry into something? So clearly, we've got to be focused on 
what does it do for us. Then, of course, there's a question of price and a 
question of availability of the things that we want.
 
So I'm not sure that extrapolation does make sense. An
d I think that's just 
something we'll have to cover as we go forward. We've made a number of 
statements as how we want to see the total company structured in terms of 
growth, in terms of leverage, in terms of returns to the shareholders.
 
So I think it's th
e management of the business that will need to go forward, 
but we've got some guardrails on how we think about the total.
 
And then, as we bought in some of these companies a little, as I talked on 
one of the earlier questions, we've learned over the last n
umber of years on 
how to bring them in and what's the best way and what are the models that 
best work for different categories in different situations.
 
And that's allowed us both to do better as we bring them in, in the place that 
we're buying them, whiche
ver part of the world that is, but also then do 
better in lifting and shifting and scaling them to other parts of the world.
 
We're not as good at that as we would like to be or are perhaps as fast as 
we would like to be, better said, which is why we're bri
nging the Global 
Ventures organizational unit into being, to just give an extra twist to 
accelerating that piece of the strategy of lifting, shifting and scaling.
 
And we'll learn more. And we'll learn more. And that's, of course, tied back 
to the incentive
s. We have general incentives to the broad population 
against revenue and profits and cash flow, which obviously link back to the 
M&A strategy. And then, for those teams specifically doing M&As, we have 
deal
-
specific incentives.

Actually, James, wanted
 
to talk a little bit about the management transition. 
Just a few things. One, why now? I mean, I guess, Muhtar, for a while, 
didn't have a COO. And so it seems an interesting time to add that.
 
And two, looking at all the hires and all the kind of leads, t
hey all seem to 
date back to your time in working in Latin America. And so is this kind of a 
getting a band back together? And with that, are you trying to replicate 
something or expand something that happened in Latin America to across 
the company?
 
James 
Quincey 
-
 
The Coca
-
Cola Co.
 
So I think, the management changes, why now is, I think it's a simple 
function of we've ended a phase. We had some initial reinvestment going 
back in brand KO. We set out the refranchising. We've brought that to a 
conclusion. We
 
built on our foundations of the last number of years in 
setting out Beverages for Life with a clear vision for where we want to go. 
We've added flesh and bone to that vision over the last 12, 18 months.
 
And what's clear is we've got a lot of things to do.
 
And so that's why I think 
bringing Brian in as COO will allow us to be able to execute against the 
leadership agenda with speed.
 
Of course, we could just go slower with less people, but we need to be able 
to execute at speed and be able in a world that's 
volatile. And we're in a lot 
of places, we need to be able to lead the enterprise forward.
 
And I think Brian just brings that extra capacity with a focus on the field 
operations that allows me to look across the whole company, and we'll be 
able to work as 
a double act to bring a lot of that going forward. And so I 
think that's why it's the right time to bring Brian on.
 
On are we putting a band back together, I wish I was good at music. I'd love 
to be in a band, but there was zero chance of that happening. S
o here I am.
 
I think what you're seeing is executives being promoted across a broad 
section of the global talent pool. Yes, Brian spent some time in Latin 
America, as did John. Brian's also been in Europe. He's been in the U.S. 
John's been in Asia. So what
 
I think you're seeing is people who've worked 
around the world coming up through the organization taking on strong roles.
 
Nancy, who hasn't worked in Latin America, worked in Corporate, worked in 
North America, she's come up. You've seen the new Group Pre
sidents, like 
Nikos [Koumettis], come up through the European business, worked in 
Canada as well. Manolo [Arroyo], who's gone to Asia, spent most of his time 
between Europe and Asia. You see Jennifer Mann, who has come up through 
the U.S.
 
I think you're se
eing a lot of people come up through the U.S. organization, 
come up through the organization and take different jobs, and the new 
business unit presidents, you know Galya [Molinas] has gone from Turkey to 
Mexico via the U.S.
 
So you're seeing a lot of movem
ent. And I think it's testament to the talent 
pipeline around the world and our ability to have people grow by giving them 
different experiences in different parts of the world and different types and 
business situations that makes them stronger leaders, t
hat then allows us to 
deploy them to the best use and the greatest opportunity for the company.

primarily in North America, given the structure of the businesses there, the

rom commodities.
 
For the fourth quarter, we anticipate it to be much in line with like we have 
seen year
-
to

date, with freight pressure continuing for North America into 
the fourth quarter.
 
Basically, we have hedges on our primary input costs, input commod

w you

Sure. Yeah, look, we grew. I'm just 
going to go through the clusters to make 
it easy. Sparkling did really well this quarter year
-
to
-
date. We saw strong 
growth around the world in all the groups. In Trademark Coke, in Diet Coke 
in the U.S., and actually Coke Zero Sugar had its best quarter o
f growth in 
10 years. So clearly, a lot of what we're doing in sparkling is working, is 
engaging with consumers. And that's very pleasing.
 
As we go into the other categories, what we see in water is a change to the 
recent trend. So in the last number of qu
arters, we were actually declining 
or doing worse in water. And this time, we've done better because we're 
kind of moving out of the phase of deprioritize something in the low value 
water, and starting to see some of the benefits of our focus on the premiu
m 
waters, whether that's China, some of the innovations in Mexico around CL, 
(48:35) or even North America with smartwater and with Topo Chico.
 
So, I think you're starting to see growth coming back into water as we've 
done a bit of deprioritizing and moved
 
more into premium and innovation.
 
In the case of juice, the juice category, that is down this quarter. A lot of 
that is driven by a couple of pieces. One, we've talked about before, which is 
the North American resizing of the juice; and secondly, the macr
oeconomics 
in the Middle East, in particular, have hit our Aujan juice business quite 
hard. So, there's a clear macroeconomic impact.
 
So, what we're doing as, in fact, we've done across each of the categories is 
focus on if there is bits of the 
business that need to be deprioritized or 
rightsized or reshaped, so that we are going to drive revenue growth in an 
attractive business, we need to get that done, so I think you're seeing some 
of that adjustment still going on in the juice business.
 
Where
 
there is a stronger foundation with the right structures for the 
business and attractive consumer propositions, you saw good growth. So, in 
Mexico, Western Europe, India, Brazil, we saw strong performance in the 
juice, dairy and plant cluster. So, it's ab
out us still focusing on getting some 
bits right.
 
And, lastly, tea and coffee; coffee was up in the quarter, driven by growth in 
Japan. Coffee, at least for now, is largely a Japanese story. And we had not 
done as well as we had wanted recently. We've not 
kept up with the 
innovation. We brought more innovation to the table that allowed us to do 
better in the third quarter. Clearly, the natural disasters and the destruction 
of the plant is going to be a problem, but we think we're back on the right 
track.
 
An
d then, tea, actually we've done really well in tea with the completion of 
the globalization of Fuze, but we have decided to sell less of the non
-
ready
-
to
-
drink tea. That was a focus in Turkey. So, what you're seeing is growth in 
underlying businesses acro
ss all the categories, building better positions 
from which to go forward on. And, of course, there is some netting with 
things that we are deprioritizing or where macros are impacting us.

James, I wanted to drill down a bit on the sports drink s
trategy now for KO, 
following the announcement of the BODYARMOR relationship. So, 
specifically, maybe talk a little bit about positioning of the brand versus 
Powerade, any potential friction you see there, balancing investment at the 
BODYARMOR level versus
 
what maybe incurred at KO or by bottlers' growth 
opportunities for the brand as you see it outside the U.S. And then, lastly, 
with respect to the path to ownership, because limited detail has been 
provided, anything you can share there, even sort of a rou
gh timeline would 
be helpful. Thank you.
 
James Quincey 
-
 
The Coca
-
Cola Co.
 
Yeah. No. So, what we've announced in terms of any future stages of 
timeline are not there yet. But I think the first important point is to 
recognize this is a minority investment f
or us and it's going to be run as a 
separate business. So, the BODYARMOR team are going to make the 
decisions about how to grow the brand, what innovations and formulas and 
packages to bring to the marketplace. We have a clear agreement on how 
they will go
 
through the Coke bottling system, and that will take place. And 
the Powerade team will continue to focus on Powerade.
 
I think it's fair to say the two sit in quite different positions today. 
BODYARMOR is clearly coming from a more premium space with a dif
ferent 
consumer proposition in terms of the ingredients and the setup of the drink. 
So, I think there's space for both. And we expect to be able to go forward, 
but I think it is worth noting that they are going to be run as two parallel 
and separate busine
sses at this stage. And ditto, that goes for any 
expansion outside the U.S. That's a decision that BODYARMOR needs to 
make.

Jam
es, you talked about the coffee category is $500 billion. Can you just 
flesh that out for us a little bit in the context of the Costa acquisition? I 
mean, understanding that potentially, you're not going into the retail side of 
the business, where else do 
you see opportunities? Is it RTD? Is it single
-
serve? And if it includes single
-
serve, like, where is Costa today from either 
a percent of sales or partnership basis?
 
James Quincey 
-
 
The Coca
-
Cola Co.
 
Sure. Look, I think there's a number of exciting things that can be done as 
Costa becomes part of our global coffee platform and our ability to grow in 
coffee. Obviously, ready
-
to
-
drink is an opportunity that makes a lot of sense 
for us to focus on. I thin
k the other pieces where we can for sure grow our 
coffee business is in being a better beverage partner to the many customers 
out there in the many different channels, whether that be through the use of 
a bean to machines relationship within their faciliti
es, or the use of the Costa 
vending machines, which is a bit like our Freestyle machines on the Coke 
side.
 
There are a lot of ways to work with immediate consumption customers to 
bring a coffee offering from The Coca
-
Cola Company, whether in the brand, 
and
 
the drink and the machinery. And, of course, then there's the at
-
home 
market, whether that be pods, capsules, loose beans, there is a substantive 
opportunity to grow that space as well.

So like to focus on pricing, could you please help us better understand the 
price/mix increase in the quarter, whether that's coming from price increase, 
promotional activity or packaging or category mix. And also you had an off 
cycl
e price increase early in the summer to cope with some commodities 
increase. Are you planning still to increase price early next year? And what 
will be the magnitude of it? Thank you.
 
James Quincey

I presume you're talking just about No
rth America rather than globally. And, 
obviously, we're not going to provide a guidance or indications on what 
we're going to do next year on pricing.
 
I think when you look at the North America pricing, of course, you look at it 
and then perhaps it's easie
r just to look at the year
-
to
-
date. You see that 
we're down a point in terms of price/mix in North America year
-
to
-
date. And 
then, obviously, we've been taking pricing in the marketplace. And it 
generated the question last quarter, and whilst it's moved in
 
the right 
direction this quarter, it's still the same sort of gap.
 
What's happening is, firstly, we had the conversation about the freight costs, 
which are a deduction to revenue in the way that we're looking about this. 
That's a point across the year
-
to
-
date. Depending on the quarter, there's 
been some timing of promotional items. The last quarter, it was a headwind. 
This quarter, it was a positive. On year
-
to
-
date, it's all in balance. So let's 
just ignore that for a second. Otherwise, it gets very confu
sing looking at the 
minutia of each quarter.
 
The big picture is it's been down one on freight. Timing and promotions is a 
intra
-
quarter issue. And then, the biggest gap between what we report as 
pricing and what you see in the marketplace and what the bott
lers report, is 
the business mix of the different business models in our North American 
business.
 
Unlike the rest of the globe, the U.S. has a big portion where we have 
finished products, so Minute Maid, juice, the fountain business, but we also 
sell a lot
 
of concentrate on sparkling to the bottlers. And, therefore, you can 
end up with a curious mathematical situation, where you take price 
increases, and prices are going up in each of those three business systems, 
and yet the average is going down because o
f the different average prices 
per gallon of the different business models.
 
And the reality is because of the rightsizing we did on juice, that which is a 
higher revenue per gallon business, it produces this curious mathematical 
effect, which is why I keep
 
underlying that what's going on underneath is we 
have been taking price, given the input costs and given what's going on in 
the U.S. marketplace, and to support the reinvestment in the business, and 
that strategy remains true. And it's helped us win in th
e marketplace.

Muhtar Kent
 
Thank you, Tim and good morning, everyone. Today I am going to start with 
an overview of our quarterly performance and then spend
 
the rest of the 
time addressing the strategic initiatives we announced earlier this morning in 
our set of release.
 

results for the third quarter were below our expectations. Compa
rable 
currency neutral net revenues grew 1% in the quarter and after adjusting 
for structural items due to factors both within and outside of our control. We 
continue to face a challenging macro environment; more challenging than 
was expected when we start
ed the year.
 
In many of our key emerging markets we see deteriorating economic 
environments coupled with continued softness in consumer spending in the 
U.S. and particularly in Japan and Europe. This is placing strong pressure on 
the short term performance
 
of our business. These factors have driven a 
deceleration in personal consumption expenditures and as a result the non
-
alcoholic beverage industry is growing one to two points slower than our 
initial forecast at the beginning of the year.
 
With that said, 
there is no question that we need to improve our execution in 
many markets especially our consumer marketing and commercial 
strategies. Although we could point to various markets, this was most 
prominent in Europe where we saw continued challenging macroec
onomic 
environment and also aggressive competitive pricing. We achieved a 3% 
price mix in Europe which was partially offset by a volume decline of 5%. 
While we are not comfortable with our year
-
to
-
date share performance in 
Europe, we along with our bottlin
g partners know we must light better 
consumer and commercial strategies and execution that can benefit from 

address this situation.
 
That said, we are not discouraged nor are we any less
 
enthusiastic about the 
opportunities in front of us. In markets where we executed our strategies 
well we saw solid progress in North America our disciplined approach to 
pricing supported by incremental media investments, high quality marketing 
programs su
ch as Share a Coke and disciplined price pack strategies as well 
as improved execution is paying dividends with increased incidence 
particularly among teams and revenue growth in our Sparkling portfolio.
 
In key emerging markets including India, Sub
-
Sahara 
Africa as well as the 
Middle East are incremental media investments drove recruitment with solid 
net revenue and volume growth. This gives us confidence that when we 
invest in our brands, align on our system plan and focus on execution we do 
see positive r
esults. But to be clear, we recognize that our incremental 
media investments which already started in earnest around the FIFA World 
Cup will take time to pay off.
 

our progress to date
. Our strategies and our actions and realize that while 
the five strategic priorities we laid out at the beginning of the year are on 
the right track we recognize that we must do more. Above all, the scope and 
pace of our actions must change to improve our
 
ability to capture non
-
alcoholic beverage industry growth.
 


journey we are ready to embark upon. In some
 

enhanced our business with strategic investments in Keurig Green Mountain 
and intend to further do so with our pending investment in master 
beverages which underscore not only our ability to adapt the changing 
consumer trends but also 
our commitment to further innovation. But these 
partnerships alone are not enough that is why we are laying out today a 
series of actions we firmly believe will drive the necessary changes to 
continue to deliver long term shareholder value. First, we are s
treamlining 
and simplifying our operating model in order to speed decision making and 
enhance our local markets focus to drive growth.
 
This work is moving forward aggressively and we expect to focus the role for 
our corporate center and further scale our b
ack office to support processes 
and policies globally. This will also enable our local operations to focus 
intently on demand creation in their individual markets.
 
And as previously announced, we are revising our long term incentive 
metrics to provide a cl
ear line of sight between our employees around the 
globe and the metrics they can best influence. Second, we will drive 
efficiency through aggressively expanding our productivity program. We plan 
to expand the program from 1 billion in savings by 2016 to 2
 
billion in 
annualized savings by 2017 and 3 billion by 2019. This productivity program 
will build on previous successful programs encompassing our entire spend 
base and will supplant our existing plan announced earlier this year.
 
A number of actions are a
lready taking place. We are restructuring our 
global supply chain including optimizing our manufacturing footprint in North 
America and investing in technology to streamline 

 
to further streamline 
our operations. We are implementing zero based budgeting a
cross our 
organization and are dreadfully prioritizing and redesigning our normal 
activities to further reduce costs. As I have previously mentioned we are 
streamlining and simplifying our operating model which will enhance our 
speed and agility and result
 
in lower operating expenses overtime.
 
Finally we are working to drive even more disciplined and efficiency in our 
direct marketing investments. As a result of these initiatives we plan to fund 
the marketing programs and innovation required to reinvigorate
 
and deliver 
sustainable net revenue growth. At the same time, we expect these actions 
will drive margin expansion and increase return on investment capital 
overtime.
 
Our third action is to refocus on our core business model of building the 

t beverage brands and leading an unmatched global system 
of strong local bottling partners. In North America, we have a clear and 
definitive plan to refranchise the majority of our company owned bottling 
territories by the end of 2017, so at that time we w
ill retain approximately 
one third of the total bottling distributed volume in North America. With 
respect to the remaining territories our intent is to ensure the bulk of these 
are refranchised at the latest by 2020.
 
Finally outside of North America we wi
ll continue to pursue opportunities to 
refranchise other company owned bottlers where it makes sense, where the 
business is ready and where we have able and willing partners. Fourth, we 
will drive disciplined brand and growth investments with a long term v
iew 
across both Sparkling and Still categories. We will take a balanced approach 
to ensure we can build our business while consistently delivering bottom line 
results.
 
In Sparkling as outlined earlier this year, we will continue to work to improve 
the qual
ity of our marketing and scale our global investments through a 
network marketing model to improve topline growth across trademark Coca 
Cola, Fanta and Sprite.
 
During the second quarter of this year we began to step up our media 
investments. Our investment
s target markets and categories where our 
current media is underfunded relative to the market opportunity we see as 
well as where we have the right price package architecture and finally off 
course execution alignment with our partners. In Still beverages 
we will 
continue to invest in our core growth priorities where we are a leader and 
notably juice and juice drinks and enhance the hydration.
 
We will expand our investments in selected profitable categories where we 
believe we can capture value such as value
-
added dairy. And we will 
continue to leverage our partnership model with companies such as Keurig 
Green Mountain, Monster and FairLife as w
ell as targeted M&A to enhance 
our growth in key categories. We expect these efforts to build on our global 
leadership in Still beverages and accelerate growth overtime.
 
This we will drive revenue and profit growth across our markets with a 
further focus o
n geographic segmentation recognizing that each market has 

with clear role is to drive topline growth with some markets focused on 
price, others on volume and the remainder on the b
alance of the two. 
Beginning 2015, our incentive metrics will be expanded to include revenue 
growth and will be tied to these clear portfolio roles.
 
We are confident that the action we are announcing today will ensure that 
the Coca Cola Company is best pos
itioned to capture growth in non
-
alcoholic 
beverages and continues to deliver long term value to our shareholders. 
Since its inception our 2020 vision has served to focus our system on the 
opportunity and to align on our common set of strategies.
 
We have b
egun the process of evolving our 2020 vision with our bottlers 
earlier this year, a process that will continue over the coming months. 
Together, we remain confident in the growth potential for non
-
alcoholic 
beverages. While growth rates will be challenging
 
in the short term given the 
macroeconomic volatility, we believe that overtime consumer trends will 
support mid
-
single digit revenue growth.
 
Importantly, the core Sparkling category remains resilient and has growth 
retail value globally for the first nine
 
months of the year 3% outpacing the 
non
-
alcoholic ready to drink industries total value growth of 2%. And we also 
see effective profitable growth opportunities in still beverages, ones that we 
are well positioned to take advantage of but ones that require
s faster action 
and greater and focused investments.
 
While we have more work to do here, it is clear that our 2020 vision will 
remain focused on delivering value growth for our 

 
ahead of the industry. 
Importantly, the goal of doubling system revenues one 
our system can 
always aspire towards it, but it is not a goal to be pursued at any cost over a 
fixed time frame and we are realigning our expectations based on where we 
are today and the outlook for our industry.
 
Let me be clear, we see no change to our lo
ng term target of high single 
digit comparable currency neutral EPS growth. We are updating our net 
revenue target to mid
-
single digit growth in order to perfect current reality 
including the increased contribution from our new partnership model which 
will
 
impact equity income rather than slowing through net revenues and 
operating income. And we are evolving our primary profit metric from 
operating income through profit before tax.
 
Going forward, the profit before tax this will be 6% to 8% on the comparable
 
currency neutral basis consistent with the previous operating income target 
of 6% to 8%. With that said, we must also be realistic. While we are very 
confident in our actions we are cautious in our outlook. The actions 
announced to date and the additional
 
work we had to do will take time to 
implement and deliver improvement in our results. As such, we expect to be 
below our long term EPS growth target for 2014 on a full year basis.
 
We will come back to you with more contexts in December; however we see 
201
5 as a critical year, a year in transition as we flawlessly implement our 
new operating model amidst the continued challenging macroeconomic 
environment. I am confident however that we have the brands, the greatest 
and most wide reaching consumer product d
istribution system in the world, 
the critical partnerships and most importantly the people to return us to a 
more robust growth trajectory.
 

will provide you with a more detailed 
look at our financial performance as 
well as an outlook on our business for the balance of the year.
 
Following Kathy's prepared remarks, Irial Finan, Sandy Douglas, Ahmet 
Bozer, Kathy and I will participate in our question and answer session to 
address any
 
questions that you may have today. Kathy?

Thank you Muhtar, and good morning everyone. In recognition of our time, I 
plan to cover key highlights from the quarter and outlook, and then we can 

he few key drivers of our 
financial performance.
 
After adjusting for unit cases without concentrated sales equivalent, 
concentrated sales were in line with unit case sales for both the quarter and 
year
-
to
-
date. Comparable currency neutral net revenue growt
h was 1% in 
the quarter and 2% year
-
to
-
date after excluding the impact of structural 
items.
 
Our topline growth slowed from the first half of the year due primarily to a 
volume deceleration principally in Europe and China. Price mix was positive 
across each
 
of our geographies with the exception of Asia Pacific due to 
geographic mix, however due to the composition of growth we saw a 
negative geographic mix at the consolidated level resulting in 1% global 
price mix for both the quarter and year
-
to
-
date.
 
Compar
able currency neutral growth profit was up 4% in both the quarter 
and year
-
to
-
date after excluding the impact of structural items. Our gross 
margin expanded in the quarter due to pricing, favorable geographic and 
product mix and a slight tailwind from comm
odity cost. We generated one 
point of operating leverage in the quarter as continued investments behind 
our brand to accelerate growth including a mid
-
single digit increase in DME, 
were offset by tight control over operating expenses and the reversal of 
ce
rtain expenses related to our long term incentive plan.
 
Comparable currency neutral operating income was up 5% in both the 
quarter and year
-
to
-
date after excluding the impact of structural items. The 
impact of currency was a three point headwind on this qu
arters comparable 
operating income results.
 
Comparable ECS was even in the third quarter including a currency 
headwind of six points. Although the currency headwind and operating 
income was in line with the outlook we provided last quarter, foreign 
currenc
y unfavorably impacted EPS by six points due to additional currency 
headwinds related to the measurement gains and losses recorded in the line 
item other income.
 
We generated $8 billion in cash from operations year
-
to
-
date and returned 
$1.9 billion to shar
e on us through net share repurchases. As we look ahead 
to the fourth quarter of 2014, let me take a minute to update you on a few 
outlook items as we model our business.
 
We do not expect the current trajectory for unit case volume growth to 
improve materi
ally for the remainder of the year. We expect structural items 
to be a one to two
-
point drag on net revenue growth, and approximate two
-
point drag on operating income growth in the fourth quarter of 2014.
 
After considering our hedge positions, current spot
 
rates, and cycling of our 
prior
-
year rates, we now expect a seven
-
point currency headwind on 
operating income during the fourth quarter of 2014, with a six
-
point impact 
on operating income for the full year 2014 We expect net interest income to 
be approxi
mately $100 million for the full year 2014.
 
We now expect approximately $2.5 billion in net share repurchases for the 
year. And we now expect our full year comparable currency neutral EPS 
growth to be below our long term target.
 
As we look ahead to 2015, w
e anticipate continued challenging 
macroeconomic conditions in most developed markets as well as some key 
emerging markets. The best way to think about 2015 is as a year of 
transition.
 
We will start implementing changes to create our new operating model in
 
the beginning of 2015, but incremental marketing investments and margin 
enhancements will pay time to fully materialize.
 
Therefore based on what we see today with our continuing need to invest in 
our business and recognizing that we are early in our plann
ing process. We 
do not expect our comparable currency neutral, financial performance in 
2015 to differ significantly from this year.
 
As we move through our planning process we look forward to providing more 
detail and a methodology to benchmark our progres
s through 2015 and 
beyond. As such we plan to host the modeling call in December to discuss 
our 2015 outlook, including further details of the impacts from our 
refranchising efforts in North America.
 
However, given the amount of questions around currency f
or next year, we 
did want to provide an initial estimate of the impact at the PBT line to better 
help you model into next year. We currently expect a mid single
-
digit 
currency headwind on profit before tax in 2015. We will come back with 
more contexts on t
he December call.
 
As Muhtar said, we are committed to taking the right actions to reinvigorate 
our top
-
line growth over time. We have a strong plan in place and we are 
aligned as a team to deliver against our objectives.
 
Operator, we are now ready for 
questions.
 
Question
-
and

Answer Session
 
Operator
 
Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our first question today is from Bryan 
Spillane from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
 
Bryan Spillane

Bank of America Merrill Lynch
 
Hi. Good morning.
 
Muhtar Kent
 
Good morning
.
 
Bryan Spillane 
-
 
Bank of America Merrill Lynch
 

wanted to focus in on is the change in target from focusing on operating 

ggest that there is 
contribution that will come from growth and equity income.
 
Can you just give us some sort of gauge in terms, how much of the growth 
you actually expect to come from equity income? How much comes from 
operating profit? Just trying to get
 
an idea of the proportions and whether or 

than that in that goal?
 
Muhtar Kent
 
Bryan, good morning again, this is Muhtar. I think the most important is that 
our EPS target remains hi
gh single digits and our target for profit before tax 
is still 6% to 8%. And beginning in 2015 revenue growth will be added as a 

 

6%
 
to 8%. And moving the target to PBT really brings net interest and 
equity income into consideration. And if you look back at the last three years 
they really has not been leverage between OI and BPT meaningfully. So it 
would not have really made a differe
nce.
 
Having said that, it does go back to what we said about broadening our 
long
-
term net revenue target to mid single
-
digit. And we think that there is 
opportunity to grow equity income as we advance our existing partnerships 
as well as explore similar mo
dels in the future. And using PBT instead of OI 
should make operations in the way agnostic in terms of evaluating 
alternatives to extract value in a certain given category, for example, what 
you mentioned also which is partnership model versus concentrate 
model. 


 
broaden way of ensuring that we can 
deliver long
-

Kathy if she wants to add anything.
 
Kathy Waller
 


that with increases in interest rates we will have interest expense versus 


t 
make the 6 to 8 BPT without a significant amount coming from operating 
income.
 
Bryan Spillane 
-
 
Bank of America Merrill Lynch
 
Okay. So, no suggestions, that there is a material change in operating 
income growth that you just trying to collect the other p
ieces below that?
 
Kathy Waller
 
No, not at all.
 
Muhtar Kent
 
No suggestions in any respect.
 
Bryan Spillane 
-
 
Bank of America Merrill Lynch
 
Okay. Thank you.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. And our next question is from Ian Shackleton from Nomura.
 
Ian Shackleton

Nomura.
 

to the savings that will be all reinvested in media. Perhaps you can give us 
some idea of how much of the $3 billion will be reinvested and also a savings 
of that will be 
through to 2019, it strikes me that U.S. production change, is 

 
Muhtar Kent
 
Hi, and this is Muhtar. Good morning. Firstly, let me just give you some 
context around the base. If you take 
--
 
firstly t

numbers out $2 billion by 2017 and $3 billion by 2019 in order to show that 
everyone sees that this is not backend loaded, its just a number that really 
will be generated and the run rate will be flowing through into our system 
and the
n we will invest some and use some for margin enhancement. We did 
say that it will take some time to achieve, 2015 is the critical year where we 
really is the most important year for us to make the changes that I 
mentioned to you in terms of a leaner, bett
er operating model and therefore 


 
that year should be seen as a year in transition.
 
The base really when you look at our company, you see about $5.5 billion in 
total in marketing about $4 billion OpEx, and really of the $3 billion about 
$1.5 
billion will come out that base of around $9.5 billion to $10 billion and 
then other $1.5 billion will be of the $3 billion will come out at about $25 
billion COGS base.
 

down the seco
nd number $1.5 billion when we refranchise with our 
aggressive refranchising program particularly for the United States between 
now and 2017. So, that number will stay that way and then the bottlers will 
get additional opportunities for COGS synergy as the
 
territories get 
refranchised on top of the $3 billon. So, I hope that gives you some flavor 
and explanation into and answers to some your questions. And Kathy, go 
ahead.
 
Kathy Waller
 
So Ian, if I could just add that on the initial $1 billion program, $400
 
million 
was in 2014 and we are on track. So that continues into 2015 with the rest 
of the productivity giving us the flexibility to achieve our target over the 
long
-
term.
 
Ian Shackleton 
-
 
Nomura.
 
And just come on 2015 guide, it obviously look quite bearis
h versus where 


around revenue growth i.e. you seem to be applying it will be more in line 
with 2014, which
 
is more like 2% not a 3% plus? Is that right?
 
Muhtar Kent
 
Yes. I think given the sort of macroeconomic volatility out there and given 
the fact that marketing investments are taking some time to flow back in 

 
see right now and we will 
come back with a more robust and more detail discussion on 2015 in our 
December call.
 
Ian Shackleton 
-
 
Nomura.
 
Okay. Thanks very much
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question is from Ali Dibadj from Bernstein.
 
Ali Dibadj 
-
 
Bernstein
 

around price mix and in North American franchise mix and the cost cutting. 
But I do want to understand a little bit better how much of the cost cutting 

o reinvest? And really why you think you 
have to reinvest?
 


whole time a lot of discussion is about blaming mo
stly short term macro 

consumer transferred health and wellness or something.
 
And in fact is it a good ROI to invest in the business in marketing versus 
taking some to the bottom
-
l
ine and to shareholders who have been rather 
disappointed recently? So any help there would be great?
 
Muhtar Kent
 

long
-
term growth trajectory in terms of our financial performance.
 
That is a 
combination of both growth more realistic and better sustainable growth on 
the top
-
line as well as margin enhancements. So as we said before, this 
additional program of productivity will yield, will generate two things, we 
believe clearly better
 
growth as well as better margin enhancement.
 
And the important thing here is that we will have a much better segmented 
geographic segmented analysis of countries where if you take the developed 
countries, we will be driving profitable growth through innov
ation and 
productivity, for example, with top countries like Spain, Korea, Great Britain, 
Japan, U.S., France and so forth.
 
And then, in terms of the developing countries they will have a different, 
slightly different role maximizing value through segmenta
tion and ensuring 
that continue to build consumer loyalty markets like Latin America, Turkey, 
Poland, Nigeria and an emerging markets like China, India, Indonesia, 
Thailand and so forth will be maximizing more skewed on the volume side 
and investing for ac
celerated growth.
 
That is why we need 
--
 
we believe we need to continue to invest. And the 


to contin
ue to generate growth, while at the same time, and we believe that 
there is a very good line of sight of how we invest and how we get return 
from that investment, very disciplined and very important transparent line of 
sight.
 

the segmentation approach and therefore 




 

w
e will generate revenue, how that revenue will flow into bottom
-
line both 
through the additional revenue growth achieved as well as through 
enhancements in terms of the margin.
 
Ali Dibadj 
-
 
Bernstein
 

f sight can you give us 
a sense this $3 billion is it half reinvested, half to the bottom
-
line, is it 
60/40. Can you give us a better sense of the split of reinvestment versus 
bringing it back to the bottom
-
line?
 
Muhtar Kent
 

ready to share that detail with your right now. 

will not all be invested and it will not all flow into the bottom line, but I think 
we see a clear balance there as we go forward.
 

role for the 
--
 


 
of how you should 
think about $1.5 billion that is coming out of the base of total marketing and 
OpEx and also the $1.5 billion that is coming out of the COGS. And 
I think 
both of them had slightly different roles in how they will be played out.
 
Ali Dibadj

Bernstein
 
Okay. Thanks very much.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question is from Dara Mohsenian from Morgan Stanley.
 
Dara Mohsenian 
-
 
Morgan Stanley
 
Good morning.
 
Muhtar I want to delve a bit more into the changes in price 

pricing focus is more of a developed market phenomenon, but maybe you 
can review for us how much of the change in focus g
oing forward is in 
developed market versus emerging market versus how you managed 
previously?
 
And then in North America has this enhanced pricing focus already played 

or should we expe
ct North America to be part of that change in focus going 
forward also?
 
Muhtar Kent
 
I think the whole company, you should think of entire company as evolving 
and changing, but as I said, I think the important thing is roles and 
responsibilities on a geogra
phic basis with complete clarity of roles. So if you 
take markets like the more developed markets of Korea and Spain and Great 
Britain and so forth, Japan and United States, Canada, more focus on the 
balance of revenue, what will drive the revenue, slightl
y skewed in favor of 
price versus volume.
 
What will happen in the developing markets more like Latin America and 
some Eastern European markets and so forth, Turkey, much more straight 
line right in the middle balance of how that revenue number is going to 
be 
generated, that revenue growth target is going to be generated. And then 
you take the lower per capita more emerging markets that I mentioned, the 

more towards volume. But that 


they are skewed.
 
Dara Mohsenian 
-
 
Morgan Stanley
 

characterize 
the pricing environment right now in North America obviously 

seen recently. So I wanted to get an update there and how sustainable that 
performance could be going forward?
 
Muhtar Kent
 
Ye


 
Sandy Douglas
 
Yes, Dara, our view of the pricing strategy in the U.S. has been very 
consistent with what we said at the beginni
ng of the year. Very focused on 
making sure that we get our price that we balanced that with the package 


-

you c
an see in the Nielsen data and the marketplace that consumer is 
responding with accelerating sales growth, actually volume was slightly 
better than we expected and clearly the volume on the premium packs that 
are the focus of our brand building agenda and 
supported by our advertising 

 

company with this discipline balance strategy is in their early stages and we 
see a rat
ional environment and we see a good competitive environment in 

about the future.
 
Muhtar Kent
 
Irial, do you want to add to that.
 
Irial Finan
 
Yes. I just remind all of us in the first 

very disciplined approach to pricing in North America and the last three 


eel very 
confident as we actually heading to the future on pricing in North America.
 
Muhtar Kent
 


 
on the same 
subject as it pertains to Europe and as it pertains to Latin America and some 
other marke
ts, Ahmet?
 
Ahmet Bozer
 
Thanks, Muhtar. As we talked about the revenue focus we are also focusing 
on balanced revenue growth in Coke International, maybe couple of 
examples I could share is in Mexico for example, where you see 2% growth 
in volumes for the q
uarter and more or less flat volumes.
 

-

also seeing mid single
-
digit revenue growth even though our volum
es are up 
only 1%. So, we are quite cognizant of balancing our revenue growth with 
approximate pricing realization and volume at the same time.
 
Muhtar Kent
 
And you want to say anything about Europe.
 
Ahmet Bozer
 
And Europe, obviously we are not 
pleased with our volume performance of 
negative 5%, but the challenging macros are bringing with it a fairly 
aggressive pricing environment in the marketplace and we are always trying 
to balance our pricing with volume, and in this quarter I would say that
 
we 
were a lot more in favor of pricing where we have realized three points of 
price mix in Europe, which resulted in a revenue decline of 2%, while our 
volumes were five.
 
Having said that, this is a journey in an ongoing balancing act, we would be 
focusin
g on balancing that a little better, so that our share performance 
continues to be strong, which it has been for the last four years and we are 
on that journey in Europe.

Thank you. Our next question 
is from Bill Schmidt from Deutsche Bank.
 
Bill Schmidt

Deutsche Bank
 
Hi, good morning.
 
Muhtar Kent
 
Good morning.
 
Bill Schmidt

Deutsche Bank
 
Can you just comment on how much you know relative to the environment 


secular and cyclical in terms of some of the consumption trends. And then 


 
what it took to pull yourselves out of it?
 
Muhtar Kent
 


everywhere around the world. Its not 
related to Western developed markets 


the currencies, when you look at interest rates, when you look at th
e growth 
rates and when you actually factor in all the different geopolitical issues 
around the world. There just is a lot of apprehension.
 
Less people traveling from because of disease, because of scares, because of 
other thing, mobility is down, and traf
fic is down and that all impacts 

newer better ways to ensure that we can meet our products, our brands, our 
3,000 products, 550 brands can meet up with consumers on different 
occa
sions, on better occasions, on newer occasion and on more innovative 
ways to get our products in front of our consumers.
 
And certainly we recognize that is a challenging environment and we operate 
in that environment, but we have a still one of the most dy
namic consumer 
goods businesses in the world, and we believe it can still over time grow at 
the rate that we have just outlined to you in terms of revenue growth.
 
Is that going to happen overnight? No. Can we get there? Absolutely yes. 
Then we have other e
lements to deal with in terms of trends. And so we 
recognize that we have to do more works of diets and lights for example, we 
continue to innovate. We continue to launch new products which had 
different sweeteners and different sweetener basis. That would
 
continue at 
an expanded 

 
in an expanded mode, more innovation, more packaging, 
newer ways for consumers to connect.
 

our I see focus in the 

 
immediate consumption focus in the mar
ket which is 
really important way to build habit and build trends and build team incidents 
and then improve our marketing and improve our commercial strategies with 
our bottlers which we keep working at.
 

g environment anywhere 



overnight, bu

generate better growth.
 
Bill Schmidt

Deutsche Bank
 
Great, thanks. And Kathy just one quick one, the share repurchase went 
from sort of range of $2.5 billion to $3 billion is a lower end of the ran
ge. Is 

hugely substantial?
 
Kathy Waller
 
No, specific read through, I would just say that given where we are right 
now, this is the guidance we thought we should provide at this time.
 
Bill Schmidt

Kathy Waller
 
We did give different outlook on currency which does impact cash.

Credit Suisse
 
Good morning. I was hoping you could provide us with some more detail 
regarding the restructuring 
of your North American manufacturing footprints 
as one of the areas of the productivity program you talked about earlier. 

be looking for and how does that tie in with your commitment 
to refranchise 
the bulk of your territories by 2017?
 
Irial Finan
 


different aspects that we will share in 
due course. As Kathy has already said 

and more efficient. We have a very substantial supply chain footprint and we 

nt and that 
means by streamlining in many different ways and simple illustrations or 
things like bottle [light
-
weighting] which is pretty well carried out across the 
world today, whether it mechanizing at different parts of our supply chain, 
whether its ou
r footprint as supply chain and so forth. So, many different 
aspect, but very clear plans behind this and high degree of confidence that 

 
Muhtar Kent
 
And on that once again, I wanted to reiterate the point t
hat I made earlier. 
This is Muhtar. That you know of the $2 billion by 2017 and the $3 billion by 
2019 incremental synergy program, that is not going down as we 
substantially refranchise our business in North America. Okay, any further 
questions.
 
Operator
 
Our next question is from Judy Hong from Goldman Sachs.
 
Judy Hong 
-
 
Goldman Sachs
 
Thank you. Good morning. I guess first question is just relating to really the 

hoping to get a little bit
 

change the operating model both more at the business unit and maybe even 
at the country level? And is it something that gets rolled out globally or does 
this have phasing of kind of how it gets rolled out?
 

time to implement these changes, but just wanted to get a little bit better 
sense of what takes longer 

 
what can be implemented more quickly and 
where we can see the benefits to some 
of the changes more quickly?
 
Muhtar Kent
 
Yes, Judy, this is Muhtar. Good morning. Yes. We are streamlining and 
simplifying our operating model for better speed, better decision making, 
and enhanced also local market focus that will help driving better grow
th, 
help us to drive better growth. And so, this work is moving forward 

 
And we expect to refocus the role for our corporate center and further scale 
our back office to support o
ur processes and also policies on a global basis to 
get more synergies there and better service to our business unit that 
operate around the world that basically makeup the Coca Cola company and 
this will enable those operations to fully focus intently on 
demand creation in 
their market.
 

-
layered organization. It is a simplified 

take place starting with the beginning of the year and more wil
l 

 


important to 
--
 
if I take just a back a minute and just to say again, this is a 
certainly a difficult operating environment and that is clear, no question 
about tha
t.
 

that environment and improve our execution. The $3 billion in synergy 
enhancements are an added layer of segmented analysis on top of the $3 
billion and metrics on a market
-
by
-
market basis is clear evidence I think of 
us taking action to control in a way what we can control.
 
And this is 

 

together for a long time and we know what it takes to win. Today, we are 
taking essen
tially additional steps to get us back on track over the longer 
term and we will do whatever we have to do to get there, to get us across to 
that bridge. We know it can be done and we know we will do it. And I think 
the synergy program will help, the new o
perating model will help, the 
enhanced execution will help, the better marketing will help and the 
improved commercial strategy will help along those lines. Is the operating 
environment tough? It is tough. But we are fortunate to be in the business 
that is
 
one of the most dynamic businesses in the world, the non
-
alcoholic 
ready
-
to
-
drink business. And so that what I would leave you with.
 
Judy Hong 
-
 
Goldman Sachs
 
Okay. And then, if I could just follow
-
up maybe Ahmet just the two markets 
were obviously the vo
lume was very challenged, where Europe and China 
which presumably had both the weather impact as well as the macro impact. 
So if you can give us a little bit of color just in terms of how much you think 
the weather did play a role? And then it sound like i
n the fourth quarter you 
really are not anticipating much improvement globally from a volume 
perspective, or is the weakness that expected in these two markets primarily 
or are other markets that you think could potentially be weaker or volatile as 
you get
 
into the fourth quarter?
 
Ahmet Bozer
 

this. But I would say there was probably not so favorable weather. You 
mentioned the macros, let me start with China. You could see from the 
nu
mbers in China that total food and beverage industry, NARTD industry is 
actually under pressure and the growth rates are coming down.
 

see a lot of traction on sparkling beverages which 
actually grew in the 
quarter, trademark Coke was up 4% in China, which shows that the strategy 
that we have shared with you all beginning of the middle of last year, of 

pleased with o

 
Very pleased with our innovations in sparkling with things like Schweppes 

share and our initiatives are working for us. When it
 
comes to Europe, I 
have shared with you all the little earlier, it is more a matter of balancing 
our price realization and volume a little bit more in the favor of volume and 
share still realizing good price mix, I would say other than that Europe 
perform
ance was mostly to do with the macros and you mentioned whether 
I will not.
 
Unidentified Analyst
 
Got it. Okay.
 
Muhtar Kent
 
Thank you.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question is from John Faucher from JPMorgan.
 
John Faucher 
-
 
JPMorgan
 
Thank you. I guess a 
couple of questions here. One on sort of the change to 
the long term algorithm and you talked about NARTD growth being more 
mid
-

question, is that going down permanently from the 6% n
umber that you 
guys had put out there before you structurally calling for lower category 
growth. And then the second question I had related to the restructuring 
program I guess two questions on this, first, is it the macros is it the lower 
structural growt

months after your last program. And then a clarification on the numbers 
which is part of the savings program announced in February related to not 
necessarily productivity but more efficient spendin

built into this new $2 billion? Thanks.
 
Muhtar Kent
 
Hey John, this is Muhtar. I think when you look at the current revenue figure 


 

you know 50 basis poin
ts difference than what was out there before earlier. 

of the cyclical long term macro economic. I think we see tremendous 
opportunity in this segment, in this consumer, very dynam
ic consumer 


 
Macros have not improved and so we have to do what we need to do in 
order to ensure that we can cross the bridg
e and get to a better both topline 

see us doing right now. This is 

 
in the past you know you would have cycles 
and macro you would have two to three year, a year or two years of do
wn 
and then coming back up. Now its constant volatility and constant actually 
more increased volatility everyday around the world, and increased 
apprehension by the consumer. So we had to do more. We have to ensure 
that we have a creative mix ability to de

see us doing.
 
John Faucher 

 
JPMorgan
 
Got it. And I guess, can I just follow 

 
and again I 

 
just a clarification on 
the sort of reallocation versus sort of where we review with incremental 
cross saves any color on tha
t?
 
Muhtar Kent
 
Kathy you want to add anything to in terms of the investments, in terms of 
the efficiency what John talked about?
 
Kathy Waller
 
Sure, Muhtar. So in the 

 
first of all going back to the first question around 
the net revenue. The two things tha
t are primarily driving the change would 
be the value growth that we see coming from Emerging market as well as 
the guess mobiles and nature of the emerging markets and then a 
recognition that our partnership models would drive value for the business 
that 
will impact that with the income, so I just wanted to add that particular 
point. And then on the productivity, I 

 


 
John Faucher 

 
JPMorgan
 
What I was asking is if I remember correctly that the February productivit
y 
program, excluded some through productivity and then some sort of 

of that also built into the incremental $2 billion from to that?
 
Muhtar Kent
 
Yes, there actually is John. In te
rms of the way, what we have done in the 


 
the origin of billion is made up of both 
OpEx as well as reallocation of marketing to ensure that marketing is more 
effective and more efficient in terms of its delivery of res
ults. And so that is 
an ongoing program that we have in terms of how we will continue to 
reallocate marketing to drive better value and better return. That is there.
 
That is ongoing, however, of course the scale of what we are doing in terms 
of OpEx flexib
ility is going to be much much bigger here and 

 
but the vast 
majority of the additional savings programs is hard savings in productivity. 
The vast majority is hard savings as opposed to reallocation. We will ensure 

 

but we will make it is actually I would say the majority; vast majority in fact 
is higher savings.

Okay. Thank you very much.

Thank you. Our next question is from Mark Swartzberg from St
ifel Nicolaus.

Thanks, good morning. Also on the subject of media and marketing spend, 

double digit increase in media in the quarter, but when we l
ook at the total 
marketing spend, how much do you think that will be up one all said and 

you are talking about how much of that is attributable to the rate of increase 
in marketing
 
spend you are intending next year?
 
Muhtar Kent
 

-

back and give you more flavor about how we are 
thinking of that in 2015 
and beyond.

Stifel Nicolaus
 
Is there anything 

 
is it reasonable to assume it goes up at a faster rate

Oka

billion, you mentioned Muhtar vast majority being OpEx are you talking 
80%, 70%, 90% can you give us some sense of that number?
 
Muhtar Kent
 
Look I said the vast majority is hard sav
ings in productivity programs. And 
that is composed as I mentioned earlier in answering another question that 
is composed of a base of about 9.5, 10 billion comprises of marketing and 
OpEx and then another base which is about 

 
driving about 1.5 billion by
 
2019 and other 1.5 billion by 2019 is driven by COGS savings, but these are 
hard savings, not in terms of just soft or reallocations.

Got it. Okay. Great, thanks Muhtar.

Thank you. Our next question is from Steve
 
Powers from UBS.

UBS
 
Great. Thanks, two questions if I could. I guess first, despite I guess some 
disappointments in some quarters, from a strategic standpoint this does 
seem like a fairly substantial change from where you were in July 
stra
tegically. Can you talk about the process that you went through 
internally to get here, do you view these changes more reactive or proactive, 
and to the extent that much of the work has really been accelerated since 
mid
-
summer how confident are you that th
is is the right program, why is 2 
billion for example the right number and not three or some other figure? 

defined timeline for refranchisement in North America.
 
Can you help us 
dimension the financial terms and the economics of that 

more this December, but do you anticipate refranchising to result in an 
economic loss or gain versus your 2010 investments and
 
how much dilution 
should we expect as we go forward to the program again just in broad brush 
strokes? Thanks.
 
Muhtar Kent
 
Yes, this is Muhtar. First, I think the base on the collective judgment of 
myself and my team we 

 
as I said to you this is an acknow
ledgment of 
continuing difficult operating environment and controlling and taking action 
to control what we can control. That will mean two things, create a flexibility 
to the synergies and also ensure that we can enhance our margins and build 
a credible a
nd sustainable revenue growth on the topline, that is the key 
here which this industry lends us to believe and clearly the history has 
shown that this industry is the most dynamic and it continues to be and 
therefore we believe that when we segment our mar
kets in the way we have 
segmented them continues to ensure that we have the right metrics in place 
and the right incentives in place that we will perform better.
 

upon implementing th
is now so that we can start the year running and we 
will give you a very clear dashboard in December where you can, with three 
or four things to follow you can judge our progress, judge our progress as to 

ut of this program. 
That to me, I think is going to be key following our progress and we will 

that you can ensure that every quarter we can have a discussion on the key 
four or f
ive elements of success on how we implement, how we implement 
the operating model, how we implement better marketing, how we 


 
As far as you
 


what we will have left is about one third and then what we do with the rest 
is latest by 2020 again finding the right home, Sa
ndy.
 
Sandy Douglas
 
Yes, sure Steve on North America refranchising, I go back to the objectives 
of the effort which is to restructure a system that has been placed for over a 
100 years to get it in better position for growth, with better focused 
customer ma
nagement and more efficient product supply and back services 
and to refranchise to the best Coca Cola bottlers in the United States under 
a new franchise agreement that is fit for purpose for growth.
 
And we are very optimistic about our ability to deliver 
that kind of growth 
profile and to do that in a way that makes our business more economic and 
makes our system more economic going forward. So as we point to the 
December discussion that Kathy is going to lead will have a number of the 
details that will he
lp you model this going forward, but our strategic mission 
has not changed and our optimism for success in doing this with our bottlers 
is as high as ever.
 
Muhtar Kent
 
So thank you, Kathy, Ahmet, Sandy, Irial and Tim despite gaining global 
value share our 
year
-
to
-
date performance is not where it needs to be. The 

quickly to streamline our operations and further align our incentives to drive 
revenue growth while simultaneously driving costs 
out of our business 
through an aggressive plan. While the short term macroeconomic 
environment remains challenging, we are confident in our ability to return 
sustainable growth as the long term dynamics of our industry remain 
promising. Our brands and our 
global system are unparallel and we are all 

company.
 
As always, we thank you for your interest, your investment in our company 
and for joining us this morning.

Now I'll turn th
e call over to Muhtar.
 
Muhtar Kent
 
Thank you, Jackson, and good morning, everyone. Let me begin by saying 
that we're pleased with our strong second quarter results, a quarter in which 
we delivered performance results ahead of our long
-
term growth targets, 
making this the fifth consecutive quarter we've either met or exceeded our 
long
-
term growth targets. We're winning in the marketplace, leveraging our 
strong brands, coupled with strong solid execution to gain volume and value 
share globally in the nonalcoh
olic ready
-
to
-
drink beverages. We're winning 
with our Global Sparkling Beverage portfolio, led by brand Coca
-
Cola, which 
grew a solid 4% in the quarter.
 
We're winning with our Global Still Beverage portfolio, which was up 7% for 
the quarter and up 9% year
-
to
-
date, and we are achieving these results 
during a time of mixed economic recovery, which is a testament to our 
strong brands and solid business fundamentals.
 
Before I review our quarterly operating results in more detail, let me take a 
moment to share s
ome further thoughts on today's mixed global economic 
landscape. The economic recovery is weak here in the United States as well 
as in Europe, Japan and across most of the developed western world. Many 
middle
-
class consumers, especially those in developed 
economies, are still 
feeling somewhat confused and fragile. At the same time, however, many 
emerging markets are doing quite well, especially those in Latin America, 
Eurasia, key countries like India, China and other fast
-
growing regions like 
Sub
-
Saharan A
frica.
 
With this as a backdrop, our focus is on maintaining a long
-
term vision of 
where the world is headed and, in turn, where The Coca
-
Cola Company 
wants to go. For us, that road map for winning is represented by our 2020 
Vision, a vision shaped together
 
with our global bottling partners and a 
vision we are confident is ushering in a new era of winning, as we continue 
along the path to 2020. We estimate that by decade's end, there will be 1 
billion new consumers entering into the middle class.
 
Additionall
y, massive urbanization will take place over the next 10 years, 
with another 800 million or so consumers moving to cities. These consumers 
are going to generate an increased demand for ready
-
to
-
drink nonalcoholic 
beverages, which is our business.
 
Yet with 
a vision, you also need a conviction and belief, followed by 
investment. To that end, we're investing for growth all around the world in 
alignment with our global bottling partners. We're investing in highly 
developed markets, such as North America, where 
we are both investing to 
support our brands via marketing as well as building new facilities, renewing 
existing facilities and upgrading our selling and execution capabilities.
 
In total, our system has made commitments to invest more than $25 billion 
over 
the next 5 years in markets all across the world. Our management's 
focus and our system
-
wide investments are paying off today, as we execute 
our 2020 Vision from a position of real strength.
 
Turning now to our total company performance. We realized strong 
worldwide volume growth of 6% for both the quarter and year
-
to
-
date, 
including the benefit of our new cross
-
licensed brands, primarily Dr. Pepper 
brands in North America. Excluding these brands, our volume grew 5% for 
the quarter and year
-
to
-
date, ahead of
 
our long
-
term growth target, with 
over 30% of this quarter's incremental growth generated in our BRIC 
markets.
 
As for our profit results, we grew comparable earnings per share by 10% 
this quarter, bringing our year
-
to
-
date comparable earnings per share 
gr
owth to 9% at the high end of our long
-
term growth target.
 
Now let's briefly review performance results across our operating groups, 
beginning first with North America, our flagship market. North America 
volume was up 4% this quarter, with organic volume e
ven versus prior 
years, cycling 2% organic growth from prior year. Importantly, North 
America gained both volume and value share in nonalcoholic ready
-
to
-
drink 
beverages this quarter, reaffirming our commitment to driving balanced 
growth.
 
Our investments i
n sparkling beverages in North America continued paying 
dividends, as we gained volume and value share in the Sparkling category 
this quarter. Coke Zero delivered double
-
digit volume growth in North 
America for the 21st consecutive quarter, while Fanta was
 
up high
-
single 
digits in the quarter, building on its year
-
long positive momentum. We're 
also expanding the footprint of our innovative Coca
-
Cola Freestyle fountain 
dispenser. We're in 50 U.S. markets today, putting us well on track to meet 
our target to 
be in 80 markets by year end.
 
As far as still beverages in North America, we delivered positive growth and 
gained share for the fifth consecutive quarter. A leading driver of this growth 
was POWERADE, which delivered 9% growth and gained both volume and 
va
lue share in the Sports Drink category this quarter. Our Energy portfolio 
saw double
-
digit volume growth in the quarter with our NOS Energy brand 
up a strong 13%. Our key portfolio delivered mid
-
single digit growth led by 
yet another quarter of double
-
digi
t volume increase for our Gold Peak brand, 
and our Simply brand delivered its 26th consecutive quarter of positive 
growth while also taking industry
-
leading pricing of 6% to 9%, offsetting 
commodity pressure.
 
And we're making excellent progress with our on
going integration at Coca
-
Cola Refreshments, which is proceeding as planned and has enabled strong 
execution of integrated marketing and commercial programs. So as a result, 
we remain confident that we have the right strategies and the right plans in 
place
 
for North America, as we continue to be excited about the outlook for 
our business in this key market.
 
Now let me turn to our Pacific Group, where we are investing for growth 
across our markets. Overall, the Pacific Group volume was up 7% in the 
quarter, 
led by double
-
digit volume growth in China, up 21%, and South 
Korea, up 16%. Importantly, we gained both volume and value share in the 
Sparkling category with trademark Coca
-
Cola, up 4% in the Pacific Group for 
the quarter. In China, trademark Coca
-
Cola gr
ew 23% this past quarter, its 
strongest growth since the second quarter of 2004. And in total, our year
-
to
-
date sales in China are now over 1 billion unit cases. Just to put this in 
context, our China business first delivered 1 billion unit cases for a ful
l year 
in 2006, which means we doubled the size of our China business in just 5 
years.
 
Looking ahead and as we have noted in previous earnings calls, we're 
introducing a wider variety of single
-
serve packages to our Sparkling 
Beverage portfolio in China. T
his is in line with our efforts to focus more on 
enhancing the consumer experience with our brand and promoting, at the 
same time, affordability. While this greater emphasis on single
-
serve 
packages may lead to some quarter
-
to
-
quarter volume fluctuation in
 
the 
near term, it's also going to drive increased transactions and build brand 
equity. As such, we're confident we have the right strategies, execution 
plans as well as capabilities in place in China today to deliver sustainable 
double
-
digit growth.
 
Japan
 
also delivered positive volume growth, up 1%, for the quarter despite 
the ongoing aftereffects of the tragic national disaster in March. This is a 
better result than we expected when we spoke to you about our Japan 
business in our last earnings call and i
s a testament to the strength as well 
as resilience of our Japanese bottling system. Having said that, we do expect 
to experience continued challenges in our Japan business during the balance 
of this year, as we cycle last year's record hot summer conditio
ns and keep 
working through what is still a difficult environment. Gary is going to provide 
a more detailed update on our business in Japan later in our call.
 
But looking beyond 2011, we have strong confidence in our business in 
Japan. This year alone, our
 
great Japanese bottling system have announced 
investments totaling over $250 million for production capacity 
improvements, logistics facilities and equipment innovations.
 
Moving now to Latin America. We continue to generate volume and profit 
growth across
 
the region, with volume up 6% for the quarter, including 4% 
growth for brand Coca
-
Cola. We were able to capture this growth through a 
relentless focus on occasion
-
based consumer segmentation, combined with 
best
-
in
-
class customer service capabilities. Thes
e strategies which have 
served us so well in Latin America and many other markets around the world 
are the same ones, actually, we're now actively implementing in North 
America.
 
Latin America's broad
-
based growth was once again led by Mexico, up 
double dig
its for the quarter for both the quarter and year
-
to
-
date. 
Importantly, brand Coca
-
Cola keeps playing a significant role in driving 
growth for us in Mexico, up 7% for the quarter and 9% year
-
to
-
date. An 
interesting data point regarding Mexico this quarter 
is that our bottling 
partner, Coca
-
Cola FEMSA, sold 125 million unit cases in the month of May 
alone, the largest monthly sales volume in their history. That this historic 
milestone occurred in the same month that we were celebrating Coca
-
Cola's 
125th anni
versary is more than just a coincidence. It's a great testament to 
the remarkable system partnership we have in place in Mexico today.
 
Brazil volume was up 1% for the quarter, cycling double
-
digit growth and 
reflecting the macroeconomic slowdown, driven by
 
the government's recent 
efforts to curb inflation. It's important to note that our business in Brazil 
continues to outperform the marketplace, gaining both volume and best 
value share in both sparkling, as well as still beverages. This provides us 
confide
nce that our strategies are working in Brazil and that we're well 
positioned to expand our share of industry growth in the years ahead. And 
our Argentina business delivered high
-
single digit quarterly and year
-
to
-
date 
growth, capturing volume and value sha
re in both sparkling and still 
beverages.
 
Turning now to Eurasia and Africa, where we are executing with excellence 
across a diverse geography. Volume grew 7% in the quarter, led by strong 
results in Turkey, Russia and India. Turkey was up 12% this 
quarter with 
brand Coca
-
Cola up 5% for the quarter and 10% year
-
to
-
date. Russia was 
up 9% this quarter and 16% year
-
to
-
date, led by brand Coca
-
Cola up 17% 
this past quarter, posting a sixth consecutive quarter of double
-
digit growth.
 
India delivered qualit
y results, growing 8% in both the quarter and year
-
to
-
date, making this the 20th consecutive quarter of positive growth for this 
key emerging market. Growth in India was balanced across our portfolio, 
with both sparkling and still beverages up 8% each.
 
Des
pite geopolitical challenges, our Middle East and North Africa business 
delivered 8% growth as we invest to strengthen our position in this region. 
We are also investing to enhance our competitive advantage across fast
-
growing countries in Sub
-
Sahara Afric
a. Our business in this region was up 
6% this quarter, and we believe the opportunity for growth there is 
significant. GDP forecasts for the next 5 years indicate that of the 10 fastest
-
growing economies in the world, 7 will be located in Sub
-
Sahara Africa
, 
making this region, in our view, the exciting S in BRICS.
 
As we move to Europe, the headline here is one of accelerated growth 
despite a challenging environment, economic environment. Volume was up 
5%, marking Europe's fourth consecutive quarter of growt
h. Importantly, 
every region of our European business delivered positive growth this past 
quarter, benefiting from warmer weather, as well as excellent in
-
market 
activation of our 125th anniversary programs. Our sparkling beverages in 
Europe were up 5% for
 
the quarter, with trademark Coca
-
Cola up 6%. And 
Coca
-
Cola Zero was up double digits for the third consecutive quarter.
 
Our still beverages were also up 5% in the quarter, driven by double
-
digit 
growth in energy beverages and high
-
single digit growth in t
eas. 
Additionally, the further expansion of the Innocent brand fueled our juice 
and juice drink growth.
 
While every region of our European business delivered volume growth this 
quarter, Germany led the way with 7%. Our German business benefited 
from the fu
rther evolution of our occasion
-
based package and price 
architecture and the successful execution of robust marketing programs 
centered on our 125th anniversary campaign. Our new marketing programs 
are also helping us recruit both lapsed consumers as well 
as a new 
generation of teens in this key European market.
 
As many of you know, our 2020 Vision outlines this strategic set of priorities 
across multiple dimensions. From time
-
to
-
time, we will take an opportunity 
in our earnings calls to highlight these pri
orities and share how we are 
advancing them. One of our priorities is to win at the point of sale by 
expanding our investments in immediate consumption. Year
-
to
-
date, we're 
seeing strong momentum against this priority with our immediate 
consumption beverag
es up 5% globally. And while many still beverage 
categories contributed to this growth, our Immediate Consumption Sparkling 
Beverages are up 4% year
-
to
-
date. Importantly, each geographic operating 
group is growing our Immediate Consumption Beverage busines
s on a year
-
to
-
date basis. As the world becomes more urbanized and as more consumers 
begin to lead on
-
the
-
go mobile lifestyles, we see great runway ahead for us 
in profitable Immediate Consumption growth.
 
In closing, we're working closely together with our
 
global bottling partners. 
And the strength of our alignment not only enables us to navigate the 
current economic and consumer landscape, it also puts us in a position of 
real strength to deliver our 2020 Vision. Despite the mixed economic 
recovery all aro
und the globe, consumers are increasingly choosing our 
brands to refresh themselves at a rate of over 1.7 billion servings every day 
and growing. Our strong revenue and profit results, combined with our 
worldwide volume and value share gains and positive p
rice mix, attest to the 
strength of our global system.
 
During this past quarter, we officially celebrated Coca
-
Cola's 125th 
anniversary. And while it is wonderfully rewarding to celebrate our past, we 
remain constructively discontent and resolutely focused
 
on our exciting 
future. With our 2020 Vision as our road map, we will continue to execute 
our strategies with more focus and passion than ever before. That is why, as 
we look ahead to 2020 and beyond, we remain confident in our ability to 
achieve our long
-
term target and to deliver sustainable, profitable growth 
and value for our shareholders. With that, I'd now like to turn the call over 
to Gary.
 
Gary Fayard
 
Thanks, Muhtar, and good morning, everyone. We are pleased with our 
performance this quarter, as w
e delivered results ahead of our long
-
term 
growth targets. And we're achieving these results during a time of mixed 
economic recovery, which is a real testament to our global system's ability 
to execute our strategic plans in alignment with our 2020 Vision
.
 
So let's review our earnings results in more detail. As Muhtar said, we 
reported comparable earnings per share of $1.17 this quarter, up 10% 
versus the prior year. This brings our year
-
to
-
date comparable earnings per 
share growth to 9%, at the high end o
f our long
-
term growth target.
 
For the quarter, comparable operating income was up 18%. This includes a 
6% benefit from currencies and higher commodity cost. This brings our 
year
-
to
-
date comparable operating income growth to 14%, including a 4% 
currency be
nefit and the commodity headwinds.
 
Our business delivered comparable net revenue growth of 47% this quarter, 
including a 6% increase in concentrate sales, a 6% currency benefit, positive 
price mix and the impact of a CCE transaction. On a year
-
to
-
date basi
s, our 
comparable net revenue growth was 44%, including a 5% increase in 
concentrate sales, a 4% currency benefit, positive price mix and the impact 
of the CCE transaction.
 
Our combined International and Bottling Investments Group price mix was a 
positive 
2% this quarter, and our second quarter pricing to retailers in North 
America was up between 1% and 2%. To be clear, this is our best estimate 
of the increased pricing our retail customers pay for our brands.
 
In our meetings with you this past quarter, som
e of you asked for additional 
detail regarding our 2011 North America retail pricing strategy. We believe 
in executing pricing within a disciplined commercial framework that 
considers rate increases, together with occasion
-
based package mix levers, 
balanci
ng overall category health with volume, value and retail pricing 
growth. So let me update you on the rest
-
of
-
year outlook with respect to our 
North America retail pricing strategy.
 
As we said in our last earnings call, we expect to capture between 3% and 
4
% incremental retail pricing in the back half of 2011, leading to a net full 
year benefit of between 2% and 3%. We can confirm that we have put into 
effect incremental pricing programs with many of our customers for the rest 
of this year that will enable u
s to deliver against this full year retail pricing 
target. As such, our 2011 North America retail pricing strategy is laser
-
focused on driving profitable growth, leveraging both rate and mix levers 
and to not just take price, but to earn retail price ahead
 
of inflation and at a 
premium to our industry.
 
Our system has done this successfully and consistently in North America, not 
just this quarter and not just this year, but on a sustainable year
-
over
-
year 
basis. And I can assure you that we will continue to 
execute our retail pricing 
strategies to deliver maximum long
-
term value, not only to our consumers 
and our customers, but especially our shareowners.
 
Turning now to our P&L. Our comparable currency
-
neutral SG&A expenses 
were up 47% in the quarter and 48% 
year
-
to
-
date. As we did last quarter, 
I'll take a moment to review our consolidated SG&A results by operating 
segment to provide you with a little more context and insight on our results.
 
First and as expected, North America's SG&A reflects an increase due
 
to our 
acquisition of CCE's North American business, including the application of 
The Coca
-
Cola Company's sales curve accounting policy to the related CCE 
North America marketing expenses, as I detailed in our last earnings call. 
We expect this increase a
nd its corresponding impact on operating expense 
leverage to remain in place until we fully cycle acquisition of CCE's North 
American business.
 
Second, our Bottling Investment Group's SG&A was up 5% on a comparable 
currency
-
neutral basis, excluding the imp
act of structural items for both the 
quarter and year
-
to
-
date. This is also to be expected as we continue to 
make strategic investments in key markets where we see strong long
-
term 
growth potential.
 
Third, our international operating segment's SG&A reflect
s increased direct 
marketing expenses, as we further invest in the health and strength of our 
brands. And finally, as expected, our currency
-
neutral corporate expenses 
are up double digits for the quarter and year
-
to
-
date due to the inclusion of 
corporate 
expenses related to CCE's North American operations and other 
investments, primarily in IT. While we consider these collective SG&A 
increases and the higher commodity costs observed this year, we expect full 
year operating expense leverage to be negative f
or North America and our 
Bottling Investment Group as anticipated, since both are finished goods 
businesses. As for our international operations, we expect our operating 
expense leverage to be even for the full year, as we strategically sustain our 
brand
-
b
uilding investments around the world.
 
And for our year
-
to
-
date cash flow from operations, this came in at $3.6 
billion or $668 million less than in the comparable period last year. Part of 
this is attributable to the inclusion of CCE's North America busine
ss in our 
results, a business which is historically a net user of cash in the first half of 
the year. In addition, this cash flow results includes a $769 million 
contribution made to our pension plans in the first quarter of this year, as 
discussed in our 
last earnings call. Net of the pension plan contributions, 
cash flow from operations were actually up 2% year
-
to
-
date.
 
Now let me take a moment to update our 2011 outlook, starting with how 
we are successfully managing the current currency and commodity 
en
vironment, as both of these items have tended to move in opposite 
directions this year, serving to partially offset each other's impact. Since our 
last earnings call in April of this year, currencies have continued to fluctuate. 
In response, we have increa
sed our coverage of most key currencies for the 
remainder of the year and now expect currencies to have a mid
-
single digit 
positive impact on operating income for the full year.
 
As for commodities, we still expect these to have an unfavorable impact of 
app
roximately $700 million on our full year results, in line with the same full 
year forecast we shared last quarter. As communicated earlier, we are 
implementing retail price increases with our customers who are also pulling 
forward cost
-
saving initiatives t
o help offset some of these commodity cost.
 
We continue to actively hedge our commodity and currency exposures. We 
also continue to reflect the impact of gains or losses resulting from mark
-
to
-
market of derivatives, which do not qualify for hedge accountin
g in the 
period that the underlying transaction takes place. As a result, in this 
quarter, we recognized a net $26 million of previously deferred gains 
primarily related to commodity hedging and have called these out in the 
schedules and notes to our GAAP/
non
-
GAAP schedule.
 
Now let me share our latest views on how we see our recent events in Japan 
influencing our full year results. As Muhtar mentioned, our second quarter 
results in Japan came in stronger than anticipated after the earthquake and 
tsunami. Ha
ving said that and consistent with what we shared in our last 
earnings call, we still expect events in Japan to dilute our full year 
comparable earnings per share by between $0.03 and $0.05, with this 
impact primarily in the third and fourth quarters.
 
Fina
lly, let me update you on our efforts across several of our ongoing 
programs starting with our company
-
wide productivity initiatives launched at 
the start of 2008. Our original plan, you may remember, target to capture 
$400 million to $500 million in annua
lized savings by the end of 2011. 
Today, I can confirm that we are on track to slightly exceed the upper end of 
this target by year end, the final year of this 4
-
year program. With regard to 
synergies related to our CCE transaction, we can also reaffirm ou
r 
commitment to capture between $140 million and $150 million of net cost 
synergies in 2011.
 
As for our share repurchase program, we limited the number of shares 
purchased this past quarter, as we considered strategic alternatives. For 
those of you who 
model our business, this will represent approximately 
$0.01 difference between our earnings per share results and your own 
model's estimates. On a year
-
to
-
date basis, our share repurchase now 
stands at $1.1 billion, although some of these repurchases have 
been offset 
by the exercise of employee stock options. At this time, we are planning to 
purchase at least 2.5 billion in shares this year and plan to accelerate our 
share repurchase efforts, as needed, to achieve this target by year end.
 
Now let me add a f
ew notes regarding several other line items. First for the 
full year, we expect net interest income, up $30 million to $40 million. This 
full year forecast implies a lower level of net interest income for the 
remaining 2 quarters of this year, driven by ou
r expectation for slightly 
higher interest rates on our debt in the downhill and the effect of other debt 
activities we're evaluating, including the conversion of some of our 
commercial paper balances to long
-
term debt. Lastly, our underlying 
effective tax
 
rate now stands at 24%.
 
In closing, we are greatly encouraged to see our business deliver yet 
another quarter of solid volume, revenue, profit and earnings results. Our 
seasoned management team and our highly capable global bottling partners 
are clearly t
aking the right actions and executing the right strategies to drive 
our 2020 Vision and advance our global momentum.
 
Operator, we're now ready for questions, please.

Two quick questions, one on Japan. To what do you attribute this Q2 
strength? And why is Q3 and Q4 still worrisome, if the dislocation's been in 
evidence since Q2? And to Muhtar, I was
 
hoping you could speak to some of 
the bottling issues. So many of your key bottlers around the world right now 
are cash
-
rich. They're looking to deploy cash for growth. Can you speak to 
how you gauge and maximize this opportunity? What do you tell these 
b
ottlers, if you really don't seem to be ready to shed the bottler investment 
group operations, if they're still hungry to invest more? Do you worry that 
you need more growth opportunities for these bottlers?
 
Muhtar Kent
 
I'll take your second question first
. Let me just say that you heard me say 
that we're looking at investing $25 billion with our bottling partners in the 
next 5 years. As I said on CNBC this morning, too, the fact that we are 
generating a good quarter now is not only a result of the good exe
cution and 
the focus on

the laser focus on the priorities and executing against those 
priorities and the strategies. It's about the investments that we made 6, 7, 8 
quarters ago and that we continue to make both in our brands, in innovation 
capabilities
, in distribution capabilities, in route
-
to
-
market, in equipment and 
in enlarging the production base. When you look at the base that we have in 
a country like China today and generating the kind of growth we are 
generating on that base, you need significa
nt infrastructure investments in a 
market just to deliver that kind of volume incrementally on top of the huge 
base. And that holds true for Africa, that holds true for Latin America, all of 
the higher growth markets. So we are in Turkey. We're investing v
ery 
heavily with our bottling partners in Asia, in Latin America, in Africa, in 
Eurasia. And I think the testament, the best litmus test again for the health 
of our business is our bottlers' appetite for additional investments with us as 
well as, of course
, appetite for additional territory. And we have both, and 
that's a very good sign in our business. But primarily, our bottling partners 
are seeing with us tremendous opportunities for continued growth. That 
growth cannot come without conviction, belief, f
ollowed by investment that 
generates 
--
 
and then well
-
executed that generates the growth that we're 
getting. So I think today, the investments that we're making in this 
--
 
that 
we made in this past quarter, while we delivered a good quarter, are going 
to p
ay off in the coming quarters. So that's the way you need to think about 
it. And then secondly, on Japan, look, I think our Japanese bottling partners 
have been very quick to come together and investing and ensuring that we 
have 
--
 

et ahead of the trends, ahead of the 
consumer demand, ahead of the customers' expectations. And that's what 
we have been doing very successfully in Japan, rationalizing SKUs, which we 
have done in order to ensure that we can navigate through the current 
re
strictions in energy and other areas that the country is going through. And 
we're playing our part just like also some innovative mechanisms to save 
more energy on our cooler base, cold drink base in Japan that we've done 
and implemented successfully and h
ave received also great words of support 
from the government, local and federal in Japan. But look, we're cycling a 
quarter, like, coming quarter of 11%, due to the very, very unusually hot 
climatic conditions that existed there in Q3 next year 
--
 
last yea
r. And so, as 
we look forward into H2, the second half of the year, we see a very 
challenging cycle, but also ongoing issues around energy, around opening 
hours for retailers and the like. But look, over time, we see all of this being 
normalized, and the g
ood news is that we are ahead of where we thought 

think, the key message about our Japanese business that you need to take 
away. And I think, as we did with the global macroeconomic c
risis, we 
haven't wasted the current crisis in Japan. We've used it to become 
stronger, to become 
--
 
to invest further and to ensure that our brands also 
are very healthy and successful. And again, the $250 million investment, 
system investment by our bott
ling partners in Japan, is another great

Muhtar, I wanted to f
ocus a little bit more on China. You mentioned a wider 
variety of single
-
serve packages rolling out. Can you talk specifically about 
what you're rolling out there that might cause some lumpiness in the 
quarterly growth? Also, if you could put some numbers 
around the 
accelerated cooler penetration that you referred to? And on the distribution 
gains, are you still growing in the Tier 1 and Tier 2 cities? Or is the majority 
of that growth and distribution coming in the lower
-
tier cities?
 
Muhtar Kent
 
I think it
's fair to say that in China, our business, the industry continue to 
evolve at a very high speed. And again, we're introducing a wider variety of 
packages choice to promote both affordability as well as enhancing the 
Chinese consumer experience with our br
ands, all really in a way to focus to 
drive increased transactions. I think that is a great 
--
 
we're looking 
increasingly at the health of the business through increased transactions and 
also profitable growth and to continue building both brand equity wit
h our 
consumers. So as 1 of the only 2 multicategory beverage players in China, 
the measure of our success will be how we grow our total business between 
now and 2020 versus our growth in any particular quarter. And clearly, I 
think with the consumer funda
mentals and our strong position in China, 
we're just getting started, I believe, in this region. And we're investing for 
the long term. And we're ahead of our investment announced of $2 billion 
over the 3
-

 
key 
strategies and initiatives are to expand our portfolio and packaging, continue 
to invest in our distribution system and to invest aggressively in Cold Drink. 
You asked about Cold Drink. This year, probably, we'll be placing more cold 
drink equipment t
han we've ever done in our history, for sure. And then, we 
are getting growth increasingly in Tier 3, but also continue to grow our 
business vertically, as well as slightly horizontal growth in Tier 1 and Tier 2. 
And important to note, also, brand Coca
-
Col
a was up 24% in the past 
quarter in China, and we're excited with the focus paying off, as well as with 
the packaging strategy paying off and our strategy of improving, enhancing 
consumer experience paying off in China.

Just first, a point of clarification from Gary. Gary, if you're telling us about 
these discussions and you're telling us that you are going to resume share 
repurchase, is it fair to say then tha
t whatever discussions you were having 
in the second quarter are no longer operative? And then the second piece 
would 
--
 
could you give us an update in terms of, it sort of falls in with some 
of Bill's comments about the single
-
serve in China, as you look 
at this 
progression to transactions over the next 12 months or so, how should we 
be modeling this out? Is it going to be something where the price mix will 
get a lot better and the volume will go down, just so we can manage 
expectations there? Or volume es
timates will go down, but then the 
profitability should get a little bit better there? So can you walk us through 
how we should think about that longer term?
 
Muhtar Kent
 
Let me take your question on China, John, and then over to Gary.
 
John Faucher

JP Mor
gan Chase & Co
 
It was actually more globally, not just the China piece. Actually probably 
more the U.S. in terms of the transactional piece and the price packaging 
architecture.
 
Muhtar Kent
 
Right. And that is fundamental to the health of our business, over
all, and our 
ability to deliver sustainable profitable growth, and think of it as a soft 
landing. This is not about taking, going down path and altitude, and creating 
indigestion and headaches for people in the plane. It's all about ensuring 
that we can fi
ne
-
tune our business, and consumer
-
led pricing is the key and 
choice is the key. And portion packs are working very well for us across 
wherever we've introduced them selectively and with surgical focus, whether 
it's in the United States, whether it's in Eu
rope, Latin America or China. And 
I think, a great, again, indicator of health of our business is growth of 
transactions. And where volume grows and transactions do not grow at the 
same rate, business needs to be fine
-
tuned. We have that philosophy and 
we 
implement that philosophy without 
--
 
with ensuring that we always have 
soft landings. And that it's a mix of happiness when you have 
--
 
when you're 
able to increase transactions as well as increase your volume and also your 
share. And that's the position w
e'd like to see ourselves in every market, 
and that's what I'd like to just leave you with. And as far as you asked about 
where do we see this in terms of China, I think the issue, the picture of 
success there again is to keep growing the volume, but also 
ensuring that 
we can generate commensurate growth in transactions, without disrupting 
the business, as we implement this strategy and this 
--
 
execute with focus. 
And over to Gary now for your other question.
 
Gary Fayard
 
John, on share 
repurchase, first, just for everyone's clarification, if you are 
engaged in anything that would be material inside information, the securities 
laws in this country would preclude you from buying your own shares. And 
we were looking at some strategic altern
atives during the quarter. And 
therefore, we thought it prudent to not be in the market during that time. I 
can confirm that as of today, there is nothing that would preclude us from 
re
-
entering the market to repurchase our shares, now that the earnings 
re
lease is out.

Gary, on commodities, could you give us a sense of how hedged you are 
looking for 2012? And if we were to assume commo
dities stay where they 
are through 2012, what kind of annual increase we might see? I assume it's 
a number less than the $700 million this year, but what kind of number 
might we see next year?
 
Gary Fayard
 
Yes, Mark, well, number one, we are putting coverag
e into place in 2012. It 
is not all in place because we would normally be entering into those 
contracts now and through the fall, as we're doing our business planning and 
all. I guess the impact, it's hard to tell you the impact today, because there's 
a lo
t of volatility and the prices aren't locked in. What I can tell you though 
is particularly on some of the commodities, let's say corn, we have very 
favorable hedge contracts in place today for 2011. And that's included in the 
calculation of the $700 milli
on. So don't expect to see anything like $700 
million next year. But we will be then cycling in certain of those 
commodities, some favorable hedge positions that we had this year. But 
with all that said, I'd say there's going to be some commodity pressure 
next 
year. It's not going to be anything like, based on what we know today, like it 
is this year. And I'm talking more U.S. now, because obviously, since all of 
these are dollar
-
based commodities on the international side, a lot of that 
then gets offset by
 
currency, the way currencies have been moving recently. 
So I'd say there's going to be some pressure next year, but nothing like 
we've seen this year.

Great, and if I could follow up on PET, specifically, wha
t is your view in 
terms of where that commodity specifically is heading?
 
Gary Fayard
 
On PET, I think, number one, you would think because it's plastic and most 
of it historically has been sourced out of petroleum, that it would be closely 
linked to the pri
ce of oil, and it's actually not. It's really 
--
 
there are 2 main 
ingredients that go into making the plastic itself. There is a real supply
-
demand relative to those 2 ingredients and there's a global shortage of one 
of those. By the way, that 
--
 
this is m
ore than you probably want to know. 
But a lot of that relates to the price of cotton, of all things, because 
--
 
and 
price of cotton, as you know, this past year has been kind of historic highs. 
What that means is that in clothing, a lot of the clothing wil
l start going 
toward polyester versus cotton. That puts the demand side on polyester 
comes from the same source as PET, and that's what's given a lot of the 

but I don't see a l
ot more upward pressure into next year at this point. I 
guess the one thing I would say as well, I think that's where it's really 
important, not only from an environmental and a consumer point of view, 
our PlantBottle, which in our PlantBottle, 30% of the 
ingredient now coming 
from renewable sources from plants versus petroleum. And as we go 
forward, I think, and looking at increasing capacity in that, we can continue 
to increase our packaging of the PlantBottle globally. That can help us not 
only environme
ntally, but also on the commodity costs side. So this is one of 
those where you can do good and do better because of both consumer and 
costs.
 
Mark Swartzberg

Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.
 
Great. And it sounds like you're saying you don't expect PET to go 
up. 

here as the cotton comes in. Do you have a view on it actually going down 
later this year? Or is it too soon to say?

BofA Merrill Lynch
 
A regional question, if I could. First thing on Europe, I'm seeing or we'
re 
seeing very strong growth there. And Muhtar, you talked about all the 
regions supporting that growth. Can you comment a little bit about Southern 
Europe and Italy, Spain, Greece, and how you might be executing there to 
drive potentially positive volumes
 
in this environment? And also confirm the 
pace of Eastern Europe, if that is, in fact, turning. And then on the 
Philippines, very tough cycles there and macro conditions. I'm wondering if 
you can also highlight how that business performs.
 
Muhtar Kent
 
Yes,
 
Christine. I think Europe, we're obviously pleased with the result, given 
the macro conditions in Europe, overall. As I said before, Europe is not as 
uniform as, say, Japan or the United States in terms of the economic 
recovery. There are regions of Europ
e that really are not doing badly at all. 
Germany is one. The exports are still booming out of Germany. The German 
economic growth is leading the rest of the countries in Europe. Great Britain 
is sort of pretty much in the middle, and then you've got the s
ort of Eastern 
Europe coming back, although not coming back very strongly. But there are 
signs of Eastern Europe, Central Europe, Hungary, Czech Republic, Slovakia, 
then also Romania and Bulgaria and former Yugoslavia, Croatia, Serbia, 
Montenegro and forme
r Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, all of those places 
coming back and we expect that to continue, Poland as well. But the real 
issue still continues to be in terms of consumer confusion and lots of missed, 
and consumers being extremely cautious in the sout
hern part, in Spain, Italy 
also, Greece, Spain, being Spain and Portugal. But we were pleased to see 
that Spain grew this past quarter, and we see the programs that we're 
putting into place with our bottlers, the investments in our brands, paying 
off. And 
we do believe that we're going to strive to continue growing in 
Europe on the back of these 4 consecutive quarters. France, of course, is a 
great performance. We've had cycling 8%, growing 8%. Germany, again, 
cycling growth and growing, and Great Britain m
ore moderate growth, and 
then Spain up in the mid
-
single digits. So we're very positive about that. 
And then Philippines, Christine, obviously a very, very challenging 
environment in the Philippines, with the aftereffects of food inflation still 
lingering 
on. There was a lot of hot money that came into the Philippines' 
economy back about 4 quarters ago, back during the election, and I think 
we're cycling that period. But the good news is that we're doing the right 
things in the Philippines, investing in our
 
brands, gaining market share in the 
Philippines in both sparkling and still beverages, and getting stronger in the 
Philippines. And therefore, when the current environment stabilizes, and we 
do believe that we're going to come out of the tunnel stronger a
nd better in 
the Philippines, where our penetration is growing in all different 
socioeconomic retail outlets, as well as driving volume and value share and 
brand health getting better for both Coca
-
Cola as well as our allied brands, 
Sprite and Fanta, but a
lso for our still beverage brands.

Credit Agricole Securities (

Just a little bit of detail, if I might, on the situ
ation in Russia, because I 
thought the acquisition of Nidan would have added about 10 points of 
volume growth. So is the base business healthy in Russia? Is the consumer 
in good shape? And then secondly, if you could look at juice in the U.S., it 
sounds li
ke volumes were very soft, because you took pricing up. And I was 
just wondering if profits were also soft, in other words, the margin pressure 
offset the pricing.
 
Gary Fayard
 
Caroline, I think as we look in 2011, some underlying trends have slowed 
somewha
t. Consumers are still cautious in Russia. But we had a very strong 
Q1 with volume up 27%, strong share gains. And then this quarter again, 
we're driving our core brands, which are much more profitable and they're a 
very healthy brand, Coke up 17%, Fanta u
p much higher than that, almost 
double, higher than 30% growth since the relaunch of Orange, with both 
natural colors as well as ingredients. And I think the juice category suffered 
the most in the economic crisis. So Multon was challenged, but we should 
s
ee improvement in Q4, going forward, as both Multon integration continues 
and the Nidan operation continues to perform above our expectations. And 
we've continued to gain market share again in the second quarter, both in 
sparkling as well as still beverage
s. And we're again cautiously pleased with 
the strength of our core brands, which are really the foundation for our 
success to become a bigger player in NARTD in Russia, going forward, than 
where we are today. And I think we need to continue to drive our c
ore 
brands in the way we're doing. And that's generating again much better also 
revenues for us in Russia, as a system with our bottling partners. Now 
concerning juices in the United States, I signaled in my script that we led 
pricing with Simply, 6% to 9%
. Certainly the commodity pricing for fruit was 
a challenge, going forward. We put that behind us, and we still generated 
growth in our Simply brand. And we believe that we have the right 
propositions in juice going forward in the United States, and that w
e will 
continue to drive profitable growth in our juice business, both at the higher 
end with Simply and Odwalla, but also at the more mid
-
range, with all the 
innovations that are taking place with Minute Maid that we're in the 
marketplace with.

Our next question comes from Judy Hong from Goldman Sachs.
 
Judy Hong

Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
 
A couple of questions from me. First, Gary, is there any way we can bridge 
the North American profit? Obviously, the CCE acquisition really makes it 
tricky. If 
I just kind of look at your Q1 performance versus Q2, it seems like 
profit, incremental profit you got in Q2 versus the revenue growth was 
actually a lot better. So I'm just wondering if there's any way we can kind of 
think about how much acquisition added
, some of the cost savings, the 
commodity versus pricing delta? If there's any way we can kind of walk 

 
Gary Fayard
 
Judy, if I could give you that, I would then have to admit to Muhtar that I 
could giv
e it to him as well. And the issue 
--
 
what you're asking for are pro 
formas, basically, so that you can actually break it apart and see it. And the 
difficulty with pro formas that 
--
 

leadership within the company, to
 
Muhtar and now to you, is that because of 
the integration, it wasn't just an acquisition, we truly integrated the 
businesses where the Juice business is now inside of CCR, the Food Service 
business is inside of CCR and the Food Service team is now selling
 
both 
fountain as well as bottle/can as well as juice products. So I can't pro forma 
and pull it all apart, to actually give you those pieces. So basically, all I can 
do is try to give you kind of the detail we've given you on the call, and then 
just ask f
or your indulgence and patience until we cycle through all of it, 2 
more quarters, and then next year, it will all look normal.
 
Judy Hong 
-
 
Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
 
If I just could then maybe think about from a timing perspective, would Q2 
have been the mo
st pronounced in terms of commodity versus the pricing 
gap?
 
Gary Fayard
 
Yes, in that in Q3, Q3 would really be probably the biggest quarter, 
additional pricing went in, in Q3. And commodities are going to 
--
 
the 
commodity increases are kind of in there alr
eady. So I think your logic is 
correct.
 
Muhtar Kent
 
But just a couple of points to add to that, Judy. Number one, I think if you 
look at the overall business where volume was up, excluding the cross
-
licensed brands, 5% comparable increases in concentrate a
nd then currency 
added to that and then price mix, 2 points of price mix across our core 
business around the world. That is something that again, in this 

The second, I think, point i
s that in the U.S. business, we talked to you 
about 1% to 2% price increase in sort of the first quarter. I think it's fair to 
say that we have taken actions in the marketplace. And we just have to now 
turn, go through it and implement it effectively in th
e second half. But we 
have taken measures for another 3% to 4% price increase generating 
probably a rate increase of, overall, for the full year of 2% to 3%. And I 
think anything on price mix will come on top of that. That's where we are in 
the U.S. busine
ss. And I think you will see us, you'll see that being reflected 
in the marketplace. I certainly, as I go into the marketplace, see that 
reflected. I was in the marketplace in the West Coast as well as on the East 
Coast this past 10 days, and I see that co
ming into play. And that is 

second half of the year, as we move into our third quarter now.
 
Judy Hong 
-
 
Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
 
Okay and if I could just follow up, Muhtar, just som
e comment about the 
premium pricing in North America versus the industry. Is the plan really 
using the packaging mix to kind of widen that premium pricing? Or is it 
really just looking at even the same packaging versus the competitors? Or 
do you think that
 
your brand equity's strong enough that you can actually 
get premium pricing?
 
Muhtar Kent
 
Well, premium pricing is all relative. It's all based on the price packaging 
channel, architecture. And I think at the end of the day, if that translates 
into a highe
r number for you or an incremental number on top of the rate 
increase that I talked about, which is on average for the full year, 3 or 4, but 
for the second half, 3 to 4, and for the full year, 2 to 3; then that is certainly 
a benefit that we would be look
ing for and we will be executing against. But 
again, all the time, all the time, I repeat, consumer
-
led pricing as opposed to 
just costs
-
led, and because it's a balance that is really critically important. 
And also, the value share gain is something that i
s right on top of the radar 
screen for us.

Okay. And, Gary, just a quick clarification on share buyback comment again. 
So when you said, as of today, there's nothing to preclude you from buying 
back stock, is it the 
earnings release that triggers you to be in the open 
market? Or was the comment really that all deals, the strategic alternatives 
that you were looking at, you're done with that discussion and that you can 
move on now?
 
Gary Fayard
 
Yes, Judy, thanks for the
 
question. There are 2 things that can keep you out 
of the market. One is if you're looking at strategic alternatives that are 
material insider information and that can be either in the U.S. or 
internationally, and then when we go into a quiet period where
 
the numbers 
actually come in for the quarter. And what I'm saying is that we are free to 
reenter the market on both counts today.

Muhtar Kent
 
Thanks, Jackson, and good m
orning, everyone. On behalf of our 140,000 
associates at The Coca
-
Cola Company, I'm pleased to share our earnings 
report for the third quarter. Once again, we delivered performance results in 
line with or ahead of our long
-
term growth targets, making this 
the sixth 
consecutive quarter we have either met or exceeded our long
-
term growth 
targets.
 
We continue to advance our global momentum from a position of real 
strength, realizing growth across every one of our 5 geographic operating 
groups. For both the qua
rter and year
-
to
-
date, we once more gained global 
volume and value share in nonalcoholic ready
-
to
-
drink beverages. Our 
Global Sparkling Beverage portfolio keeps growing, up 4% for the quarter 
and 5% year
-
to
-
date. This growth was driven by brand Coca
-
Cola, 
which 
was up 3% in both the quarter and year
-
to
-
date. And earlier this month, 
Interbrand ranked Coke
-
Cola as the world's most valuable brand for the 
12th consecutive year. Our Global Still Beverage portfolio is also performing 
well, up 9% for both the quar
ter and year
-
to
-
date. Importantly, we achieved 
these balanced quality results together with our system bottling partners 
during a time of ongoing global market volatility, which is a testament to our 
clear and focused vision, our strong brands and our soli
d execution.
 
Over the past few months, we've all seen a downturn in global consumer 
confidence. At the same time, the last few months have reinforced our belief 
in the resilience of the global consumer. In our business, we constantly track 
a number of key 
metrics. We look at total retail sales by country. We look at 
sales shifts across retail channels. We look at out of home dining and how 
many people are on the go. And what we've seen this past quarter is that 
across the world, nonalcoholic beverages conti
nue to generate increasing 
demand. The key success factor in this current challenging environment is 
for businesses small, medium or large to be able to generate sustainable 
growth. And I'm happy that we're able to continue to crack this much
-
needed algori
thm of growth. In Q3 of 2011, we generated almost 250 million 
unit cases of incremental growth, excluding cross
-
license and acquired 
brands, with nearly 50% of this growth coming from sparkling beverages. 
Just to give you a perspective, this 250 million un
it cases of organic volume 
growth translates into over $1.7 billion of retail value growth, all in 90 days. 
For the first 9 months of this year, our organic volume growth was over 820 
million unit cases, equivalent to creating another India and Russia comb
ined. 
This achievement of growth is the combined result of precise and focused 
execution by our inspired system in each quarter combined with the targeted 
investments made by our system a year or in some cases 2 years prior to 
the quarter which is being re
ported.
 
So while we all see volatility in the external environment and have every 
reason to believe that this volatility will remain through the near
-
term, the 
assumptions that guided the development of our 2020 Vision still ring true. 
As we complete the s
eventh quarter in our 2020 Vision, we see a world 
where population keeps growing at a very rapid rate, up 200 million since 
just 2008. At the same time, the world's largest cities are growing and have 
grown by almost 100 million people in the same period s
ince 2008. And the 
global middle class is also growing. In fact since 2008, almost 200 million 
people have newly entered the middle class. We said it when we began our 
2020 Vision journey and we say it again right now in 2011, our business was 
built for ti
mes like this. Our business is strong across channels and across 
consumer age groups. We're well positioned to connect with global 
consumers who have a greater disposition to shop across multiple retail 
channels in search of real value. So simply said, we 
provide consumers with 
an affordable luxury as they enjoy moments of pleasure for pennies at a 
time, billions of times every day. In February of this year during our 
presentation at CAGNY, the Consumer Analyst Group of New York 
conference, we told you that
 
when you have a consistent vision, a consistent 
belief in your brand, a consistent ethic of execution, the result is consistent 
quality performance. And while we may see an occasional bump along the 
road in a given quarter, every year since 2006 we've del
ivered volume and 
operating income growth in line with or ahead of our long
-
term growth 
targets. We said this again at CAGNY back in February, that this trend 
remains true today. All of our attributes, a well
-
aligned bottling franchise 
system, healthy bran
ds, strong financial performance and a clear 2020 
Vision have put us in a position of real strength as we push ahead towards 
2020. And that's why even during times of ongoing global market 
uncertainty, The Coca
-
Cola Company keeps delivering consistent top 
line 
and bottom line results.
 
So let's review this quarter's results. We grew worldwide volume 5% this 
quarter and 6% year
-
to
-
date, including the benefit of our new cross
-
licensed 
brands, primarily Dr. Pepper brands in North America. Excluding these 
brands
, we delivered strong volume growth of 4% for the quarter and 5% 
year
-
to
-
date ahead of our long
-
term growth target. As for our profit results, 
we grew comparable earnings per share by 12% this quarter, bringing our 
year
-
to
-
date comparable earnings per shar
e growth to 10%, also above our 
long
-
term growth targets.
 
Now let's briefly review performance results across our operating groups, 
beginning first with North America, our flagship market. Many of you on 
today's call have listened in or joined us last mont
h in Houston for our 
investor event and market tour. You heard and saw firsthand how we are 
building our capabilities to drive our performance in North America. This 
quarter's results underscored the good progress we are making on this 
journey. North Ameri
ca reported volume up 5% for the quarter and year
-
to
-
date, making this North America's sixth consecutive quarter of growth. Our 
organic volume growth in North America was up 1% in both the quarter and 
year
-
to
-
date. In this past quarter, our North America b
usiness gained total 
market volume and value share in sparkling, still and nonalcoholic 
beverages, reaffirming our commitment to drive balanced growth across our 
portfolio.
 
Our sparkling beverages in North America were down only slightly in the 
quarter wit
h brand Coca
-
Cola volume even for the quarter, and we clearly 
outperformed the rest of the industry gaining both volume and value share 
in the sparkling beverage category. And we did so while earning 3% pricing 
in sparkling beverages this quarter through t
he effective execution of our 
occasion
-
based brand, package, price and channel strategies. We are driving 
profitable growth in North America through our 1.25
-
liter package which 
expanded nationally in August and is now available in over 80% of the U.S. 
sup
ermarkets. In those markets where the 1.25
-
liter package was first 
launched in May of this year, we saw the combination of our 1.25
-
liter and 
2
-
liter package transactions increase this quarter. We're also expanding the 
availability of our immediate consump
tion offerings with a new 12.5
-
ounce 
handheld PET packaged and a more affordable 7.5
-
ounce mini
-
can 8
-
pack.
 
As for Coke Zero, it was up 12% in North America this past quarter, making 
this its 22nd consecutive quarter of double
-
digits growth. Our still beve
rages 
in North America delivered mid
-
single digit growth and gained share for the 
sixth consecutive quarter. The leading driver of this growth was POWERADE, 
which delivered 9% growth in the quarter and is now up 12% on a year
-
to
-
date basis. POWERADE once a
gain captured both volume and value share in 
the sports drink category this past quarter. And since July of 2010, 
POWERADE has added over 5 million new households, demonstrating how 
this innovative brand keeps resonating with sports drink consumers.
 
Our ke
y brands delivered mid
-
single digit growth led by yet another quarter 
of double
-
digit growth for Gold Peak Tea. Finally, as many of you heard 
during our Houston event last month, our CCR Coca
-
Cola Refreshments 
integration is proceeding as planned. We remai
n confident that we have the 
right brands, right strategies and right capabilities in place for North America 
as we continue to be excited about the long
-
term outlook for our business in 
this key market.
 
Now let me turn to our Pacific Group, where we are d
elivering growth across 
a diverse set of markets. Overall our Pacific Group volume was up 5% in the 
quarter and up 6% year
-
to
-
date. This quarter's results were led by double
-
digit growth in China, up 11%. Sparkling beverages grew mid
-
single digits in 
China
 
this past quarter led by brand Coca
-
Cola up 7%, supported by our 
strategy to introduce a wider variety of single
-
serve packages to our 
Sparkling Beverage portfolio. Last quarter we said this emphasis on single
-
serve packages would increase transactions an
d build brand equity. In fact, 
we observed 12% growth in sparkling beverage transactions in China this 
past quarter, well ahead of sparkling beverage volume growth. This is in line 
with our efforts to enhance the consumer experience with our brands, while 
better positioning our China sparkling business for long
-
term sustainable 
growth. At the same time, our Still Beverage portfolio in China keeps 
building momentum, up 24% this quarter and 19% year
-
to
-
date, led by 
Minute Maid Pulpy. We're confident that we a
re executing the right 
strategies and have the right capabilities in place in China to deliver 
sustainable double
-
digit growth over the long term.
 
Japan's third quarter results were down 3%. We always expected seeing our 
volumes soften in Japan this quarte
r as we cycled 11% growth from last 
year's record hot summer conditions, while also working through the after
-
effects of the tragic national disaster in March. And that said, Japan's volume 
results this past quarter were better than we had originally thoug
ht, 
underscoring once again the strength as well as the resilience of our 
Japanese bottling system. We remain confident in the long
-
term health of 
our business in Japan.
 
Moving now to Latin America. We continue to expand our volume and value 
share leadersh
ip across the region with volume up 7% for both the quarter 
and year
-
to
-
date. Latin America's broad
-
based growth was once again led by 
Mexico, up a strong 8% for the quarter and 10% on a year
-
to
-
date basis. 
Importantly, brand Coca
-
Cola keeps playing a sign
ificant role in driving 
growth for us in Mexico, up 6% for the quarter and 8% year
-
to
-
date. We 
gained both volume and value share in Mexico despite new pricing above the 
current rate of inflation. Our results in Mexico are a great testament to our 
team's c
apability to execute occasion
-
based brand package price and 
channel strategies that reinforce recruitment, as well as affordability with 
consumers in this key marketplace. We're also seeing further momentum in 
our Argentina business, which delivered double
-
digit quarterly and year
-
to
-
date growth while capturing volume and value share in both sparkling and 
still beverages for the 11th consecutive quarter there. Finally Brazil volume 
was up 1%, cycling 13% growth in last year's comparable period. Having 
said 
that, our growth in Brazil is ahead of the industry with our business in 
Brazil gaining share across both sparkling as well as still beverages. This 
reinforces our confidence that we have the right strategies in place in Brazil 
to build on our leadership p
osition and keep expanding our share of industry 
growth in the years ahead.
 
Brazil also offers a great example of how we partner with local communities 
during challenging economic times. We recently established a social business 
program in Brazil called Co
letivo that aims to create shared value with 
communities through our core business activities. And in partnership with 
local NGOs, we teach entrepreneurship and retailing skills to young adults 
living in low
-
income areas supporting their entry into the for
mal job market. 
Coletivo prepares students through 2 months of training to deliver 
customized business opportunities to small outlets inside their communities. 
And we're providing a positive economic impact in these areas, while also 
helping us drive solid
 
business results. And we are in the process of 
expanding this program across Brazil, for we strongly believe we have a role 
to play in helping consumers through tough economic times. And through 
this program we're creating unique value for our brands, our
 
system, as well 
as local communities.
 
Turning now to Eurasia and Africa, we are strategically investing for 
tomorrow across a diverse array of markets while gaining both volume and 
value share today. Volume in this region grew 6% in the quarter and 7% 
yea
r
-
to
-
date, led by strong results in India, Turkey, the Middle East and 
North Africa. India delivered 19% growth in the quarter, making this its 21st 
consecutive quarter of growth and bringing our year
-
to
-
date volume growth 
to double digits. This quality gr
owth was well balanced across the entire 
portfolio. Sparkling beverages in India were up 19% this quarter, led by 
brand Coca
-
Cola's strong double
-
digit growth up 17%. And still beverages in 
India were up 17% again in the quarter, benefiting from healthy gr
owth 
across our juice portfolio, including brand Maaza, up 19%. Turkey was up 
double digits in both the quarter and year
-
to
-
date, gaining volume and value 
share this quarter in both sparkling and still beverages. And Turkey is 
benefiting from our investmen
ts in cold drink equipment, which is increasing 
cold beverage availability for us in this key market.
 
Russia was down mid
-
single digits this past quarter, cycling very strong 30% 
growth from the same period last year. At the same time, our business in 
Russ
ia outperformed the rest of the industry, gaining both sparkling and still 
beverage volume and value share in the process. And as you may have 
heard, we recently announced together with our bottling partners Coca
-
Cola 
Hellenic a new Russian investment prog
ram of $3 billion over the next 5 
years starting in 2012, underscoring our commitment to invest in Russia for 
the long
-
term growth. Finally, our Middle East and North Africa business 
delivered 9% growth in the quarter, as we strengthened our position in th
is 
key region.
 
Let me now move to Europe, a part of the world that faced an increasingly 
volatile economic environment, as well as unseasonably cold weather this 
past quarter. Despite the challenges, we gained volume and value share in 
the nonalcoholic rea
dy
-
to
-
drink beverages and volume also grew slightly in 
the quarter rounding to even, making this Europe's fifth consecutive quarter 
of volume growth. And our year
-
to
-
date results in Europe are up 2%. Our 
growth in Europe continues to be led by Germany, up 
4% for the quarter 
and 5% year
-
to
-
date. Our business in Germany gained volume and value 
share in sparkling and in the total nonalcoholic ready
-
to
-
drink beverages 
segment. Our sparkling beverage growth in Germany was led by Coca
-
Cola, 
up 5% for the quarter 
as a result of our strategic focus on recruiting both 
lapsed consumers and a whole new generation of new consumers.
 
Before concluding our operating results review, I'd like to update you on our 
progress around winning at the point
-
of
-
sale by driving immedi
ate 
consumption growth. Year
-
to
-
date, we are sustaining our strong momentum 
against this priority with immediate consumption beverages up 5% globally. 
Last quarter, we shared that each of our geographic operating groups was 
growing our Immediate Consumptio
n Beverage business. Today, we can 
further confirm that 17 of our top 22 markets are also growing our 
Immediate Consumption Beverage business on a year
-
to
-
date basis. In fact, 
9 of these markets are growing immediate consumption ahead of future 
consumption
. This is quite an accomplishment in an economic environment 
which favors faster growth in at
-
home consumption. As the world's 
population and demographics keep growing and evolving, our system is 
focused on capturing more than our fair share of this highly
 
profitable 
immediate consumption growth.
 
In closing, I'd like to say that we're advancing our momentum during a time 
of mixed economic recovery. Back in 2008 and 2009 when the world's 
financial markets were unraveling, our system committed to doing 3 thin
gs. 
First, we made a commitment to invest through the crisis. We did so by 
establishing a clear and focused 2020 Vision that called for investing in 
consumer marketing and sales and distribution with the mission of becoming 
the leader in every market in ev
ery category of value to us.
 
Second, we made a commitment to focus on the marketplace and to ensure 
that we have the right packages and price points for every occasion, 
including affordable entry packs for every consumer. And thirdly, we made a 
commitment 
to never let short
-
term considerations cloud our view of the 
long
-
term value of our business. As a result of these commitments, our 
system has never been stronger. We continue to solidify our leadership 
within the nonalcoholic ready
-
to
-
drink beverage indus
try and during 2009 
and '10, the nonalcoholic ready
-
to
-
drink beverage industry grew by $35 
billion in total retail value. We're pleased to say that our Coca
-
Cola system 
represented nearly 50% of total industry growth, well above our fair share. 
So in short
, our 2020 Vision is working. Yet every one of us here at The 
Coca
-
Cola Company and Coca
-
Cola system know that we are really just 
getting started. All of us remain constructively discontent and resolutely 
focused on our exciting future; a future filled wit
h abundant opportunities. 
Our job as stewards of this great business and as caretakers of your 
investment is to ensure that we keep advancing our system's momentum. 
With our 2020 Vision as our roadmap, we are confident that we can 
sustainably achieve our l
ong
-
term growth target and enhance the value of 
your investment in The Coca
-
Cola Company.
 
With that, I'll now turn the call over to Gary.
 
Gary P. Fayard
 
Thanks, Muhtar. Good morning, everyone. We're very pleased with our 
performance this quarter. We 
once again delivered results in line with or 
ahead of our long
-
term growth targets. And we continue to achieve these 
high
-
quality results during a time of mixed economic recovery, which is a 
real testament to our global system's ability to execute our stra
tegic plans in 
alignment with our 2020 Vision.
 
So let's review our earnings results in more detail. We reported comparable 
earnings per share of $1.03 this quarter, up 12% versus prior year. That 
brings year
-
to
-
date comparable earnings per share growth to 
10%, ahead of 
our long
-
term growth target. For the quarter, comparable operating income 
was up 21%, including a 6% benefit from currencies and higher commodity 
cost. This increases our year
-
to
-
date comparable operating income growth 
to 17%, including a 5% 
currency benefit offset by commodity headwinds.
 
Our business delivered comparable net revenue growth of 45% this quarter, 
including a 5% increase in constant rate sales, a 5% currency benefit, 
positive price/mix and the impact of the CCE transaction. On a 
year
-
to
-
date 
basis, our comparable net revenue growth remains at 44%, including a 5% 
increase in concentrate sales, 5% benefit from currency, positive price/mix 
and the impact of the CCE transaction.
 
Our combined international and Bottling Investments Grou
p's price mix for 
the quarter was a positive 2%. As for North America, we discussed in our 
last earnings call our plans to implement incremental pricing programs with 
many of our customers this quarter. As a result, our pricing to retailers in 
North Americ
a was up 2% in the quarter. And as Muhtar mentioned, this 
quarter's results was driven by a 3% increase in our pricing to retailers for 
our North American sparkling beverages. As such, our 2011 North American 
pricing strategy remains on track to earn betwe
en 2% and 3% for the full 
year, leveraging both rate and mix levers to earn price at a premium to our 
industry. As we continue to grow in North America through the effective 
execution of our occasion
-
based brand package price and channel strategies, 
which 
we shared with many of you last month during our investor event and 
market tour in Houston. If you were not in Houston with us last month or 
were unable to view the live webcast of our event, we encourage you to visit 
our website where all videos and prese
ntations from Houston detailing our 
North American roadmap for growth have been posted.
 
Turning now to our P&L. Our comparable currency neutral SG&A expenses 
were up 42% in the quarter and 46% year
-
to
-
date. As explained in previous 
quarterly calls, this in
crease reflects the impact of acquiring CCE's former 
North American business, which we will cycle in the fourth quarter of this 
year. It also reflects our continued investments around the world. Year
-
to
-
date direct marketing expenses are growing slightly a
head of unit cases as 
we continue to invest in the health and strength of our brands. As we 
communicated last quarter, we expect our full year operating expense 
leverage to be negative for North America and our Bottling Investments 
Group and even for the f
ull year for our international operations as we 
continue to make strategic investments in key markets around the world.
 
Our year
-
to
-
date cash flow from operations came in at $6.8 billion. As a 
reminder, this cash flow result includes a $769 million contrib
ution made to 
our pension plans in the first quarter of this year. Net of the additional 
pension plan contributions, our cash flow from operations are up 5% year
-
to
-
date.
 
Now let me take a moment to update our 2011 outlook for commodities and 
currencies. F
irst, we've effectively leveraged retail pricing increases and the 
acceleration of cost saving initiatives to help offset this year's rising 
commodity cost. Having said that, our incremental cost estimate for 2011 
now stands at approximately $800 million, 
ahead of the $700 million we 
indicated in our previous calls. Second, since our last earnings call in July of 
this year, currencies have continued to fluctuate with the dollar 
strengthening against many key currencies. We have hedged positions in 
place for
 
most key currencies for the remainder of this year. We now expect 
currencies to adversely impact our fourth quarter operating income by low
-
 
to mid
-
single digits, while still providing a low
-
 
to mid
-
single digit positive 
impact for the full year. As we pl
anned for 2012, we are looking at our 
combined exposure across both currencies and commodities. We anticipate 
that both items will keep moving in opposite directions next year, much like 
they have this year. And while we expect this movement to help partia
lly 
offset each other's impact over the course of 2012, the timing of their 
respective impact on our results will likely vary from quarter
-
to
-
quarter. As 
for our normal practice, we'll provide a broader outlook on their expected 
impact on our 2012 full yea
r results during our next earnings call in 
February.
 
Now let me take a moment to update you on several other programs and 
line items. Our company
-
wide productivity initiatives launched at the start of 
2008 remain on track to exceed the upper end of our ori
ginal target of $400 
million to $500 million in annualized savings by the end of this year. As for 
synergies related to our CCE transaction, we still expect to deliver between 
$140 million and $150 million of net call synergies in 2011. With regards to 
our
 
share repurchase program, on a year
-
to
-
date basis, our net share 
repurchases stand at $2.2 billion. As such, we're now increasing our share 
repurchase program with a plan to purchase at least 2.5 billion to 3 billion in 
net shares this year. As for net in
terest income, our current forecast for the 
full year is at the high end of our previously communicated range of $30 
million to $40 million. This implies a slight net interest expense in the fourth 
quarter of this year. And our underlying effective tax rat
e stands at 24%.
 
Finally, we want to remind you that this is the last quarter in which we're 
cycling the acquisition of CCE's former North American business. That said, 
there were several one
-
time items that occurred in the fourth quarter of 
2010 related t
o this acquisition that will continue to impact the comparability 
of both our as
-
reported and ongoing recurring results next quarter. We refer 
you to our previous comments regarding those one
-
time items, specifically 
to our modeling call held last year on 
December 14. The transcript and 
webcast of that call can be found on our investor website and of course 
Jackson and our Investor Relations team will be happy to follow up with you 
separately if you have any further questions.
 
In closing, we're greatly enco
uraged to see our business deliver yet another 
quarter of solid volume, revenue, profit and earnings results. In the face of 
today's volatile market conditions our system is healthy and financially 
strong. We continue to generate cash, invest in our brands
, execute our 
flexible and nimble growth strategies and pay a healthy dividend. In fact, 
The Coca
-
Cola Company has a long history of distributing dividends, having 
paid them consecutively every year since 1920 and increasing dividends for 
49 consecutive ye
ars. With our seasoned management team and our highly 
capable global bottling partners, we're confident that we'll keep taking the 
right actions and executing the right strategies to build on our strengths, 
advance our global momentum and drive our 2020 Vi
sion.
 
Operator, we're now ready for questions.
 
Question
-
and
-
Answer Session
 
Operator
 
[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Bill Pecoriello from 
Consumer Edge Research.
 
William Pecoriello 
-
 
Consumer Edge Research, LLC
 
Muhtar, Coke's been 
delivering top
-
tier global CBT [ph] company 
performance this year, but can you give us your outlook? If you look at the 
balance of the year and heading into 2012, considering global macros are 
slowing in certain regions, how is Coke going to sustain this m
omentum and 
what kind of investment is required to keep this going against this slowing 
backdrop?
 
Muhtar Kent
 
Well firstly, I don't think you can say that there's a market deterioration. I 
think the whole year has been one of mixed consumer sentiment acros
s the 
world in general, Bill. But what I'd like to say is that still I believe that the 
challenging areas are going to be certainly the Western markets, primarily I 
believe the U.S. environment as well as the European environment 
--
 
Western European enviro
nment is still going to be challenging, as 
challenging as the past 9 months and into the full year, this year probably. 
And in that environment, we're delivering positive results because our 
strategies are working, because of our past investments and how w
e 
execute against our vision, strength of our brands. We're gaining market 
share and I think when you look at our broad
-
based investment programs 
that we have announced, multiyear investment programs that we have 
announced whether they're in the Pacific in
 
places like Malaysia, Philippines, 
China, Vietnam or whether they're in Eurasia and Africa, like India and 
Pakistan and Africa and the recent Russian investment that I announced 
when I was there 2 weeks ago in operating a plant in Rostov in the southern 
p
art of Russia with our Hellenic bottling partners or whether investments, 
multi
-
year investments in Mexico, Brazil, these total over $25 billion and you 
have these investments that are working for us despite the challenging 
environment, despite the confuse
d consumer and despite the fact that the 
general environment is certainly much worse than ideal. However, I think 
that there will still be areas of growth in the world that we are going to 
materially benefit from in Africa, where our system is very strong,
 
in Asia 
and Middle East and Eurasia where our system is very strong and in Latin 
America. And we will continue to re
-
architect our brand
-
priced pack channel 
offering both here and the United States as well as across the world just like 
we did in China, ju
st like we did across many other parts of the world to 
ensure that we can still crack that code for growth on a sustainable basis. 
And we believe that we can continue to deliver growth in line with our long
-
term strategies. And yes, there may be a bump alo
ng the way in a quarter 
sometimes. But over the longer period and over the medium and longer 
period we believe, despite the economic conditions in the world that are 
much less than ideal, we believe we can continue to crack that algorithm for 
growth as we 
move forward.
 
Operator
 
Our next question comes from Kaumil Gajrawala with UBS.
 
Kaumil S. Gajrawala

UBS Investment Bank, Research Division
 
Can we talk a little bit more about Europe and I guess the slowdown this 
quarter particularly versus last quarter? A
nd it looks like your comp was also 
quite a bit easier. So you mentioned weather, but could you give us more 
context on what was behind the trend there?
 
Muhtar Kent
 
Well I think we have 
--
 
volume in the quarter was slightly positive as I said 
rounding to e
ven despite very unseasonably cold and rainy summer selling 
season and also the moderating consumer confidence. But I think we 
realized nonalcoholic ready
-
to
-
drink volume and value share gains across 
the whole of Europe, France 
--
 
including France, Germany
, Great Britain. We 
also grew sparkling volume and value share and maintained still volume 
share for the overall group 
--
 
the European group. And again reported net 
revenue for the quarter and I think that was a performance that we were 
pleased with, given
 
the conditions in Europe. And over Central and Southern 
Europe, volume declined. And I think the Eastern Central European area was 
still challenging and South East Europe, particularly also in Italy and Greece. 
But I believe overall, the portfolio worked 
for us like it did in the previous 
quarters in this year, and I believe that's what's going to continue to work 
for us as we move into the fourth quarter and the final quarter of this year 
as well as into next year. Brands are stronger than ever before. We
're 
gaining market share and we have many innovations that are working for us 
in both packaging as well as in the still beverage portfolio area. And our 
marketing is working for us and next year we've got European 
championships, which is a Coca
-
Cola proper
ty as you know and we're going 
to leverage that in a very significant manner. And of course the Olympics 
and those 2 properties are going to be very strong for us.

Gary, just on commodities, the $100 million step up this year. Can you talk 
about what's driving that? And then just any color as it relates to 2012 
outlook? Is it going to be worse than what you see this year? How much a
re 
you hedged at this point?
 
Gary P. Fayard
 
Yes, Judy. Relative to the $100 million increase, it's really kind of across the 
board. A lot of PET, corn versus where we've been buying corn and although 
--
 
this is kind of, how do I answer this 
--
 
because we had some hedge 
positions and we're buying som
e more now at higher prices even though 
prices have come off a little bit. So the $100 million, by the way, was not a 
big surprise to us. Over the last couple of months, we saw it coming. And 
relative to 2012, really we'll go through all of that in Februar
y on the year
-
end call, on everything around 2012. Because I think one of the important 
things is to put everything in perspective. Number one was the volatility, I'm 
not sure I can give you a prediction on 2012 and it really mean anything. 
But the other, 
and I said a little bit about it in the prepared remarks, what 
we're seeing is not a direct correlation but a lot of correlation between 
currencies and commodities. And so every time you see a big spike in the 
strength of the dollar, you see commodities co
me off strongly and vice 
versa. So we're starting to see a natural hedge in offsets in the portfolio of 
currencies and commodities and we're looking at those together, and then 
looking at how we hedge them for the best results. So we'll go through that 
in 
February.

Okay. Just following up on that Gary and not getting into the 2012 outlook. 
But as we think about the price minus cost delta then, now that you've put 
in additional pricing in the third q
uarter, is the gap between pricing and cost 
now starting to narrow going forward? Have we sort of peaked in terms of 
that gap?
 
Gary P. Fayard
 
I think for this year, yes. But we've done a couple of things: We got very 
good pricing into the market in North A
merica and we knew kind of what the 
commodities were going to be. We've done very well with mix as well, and 
so that's helped us. And we've done very well with accelerating the capture 
of synergies as well. And then those synergies are ongoing every year a
lso. 
So we've done a good job. In fact, what I said on pricing in North America, 
we pointed out that pricing was plus 2 in North America, but plus 3 on 
Sparkling. And in fact, we're cycling 
--
 
this is a good news, bad news thing, 
so let me kind of go throu
gh it so you understand it. What we got is very 
good positive mix, particularly around packaging and you saw a lot of 
packaging initiatives in Houston. We've also got a negative mix in North 
America related to the DASANI. And this is actually good news, bu
t at first 
blush you would think well negative, negative price mix on DASANI. What it 
is really where the PlantBottle has come through, with our customers really 
identifying it with it and our consumers and DASANI being relisted in quite a 
few national ret
ailers. So it's really been a huge positive for us even though 
it put a little pressure on the price mix in the quarter. So it's a real positive.
 
Muhtar Kent
 
And Judy, just one other point on a more global basis. You heard in my 
comments about how immediat
e consumption is such a big focus of ours 
around the world and how we're gaining traction. I think that has also 
helped us realize mix to our benefit and our bottlers particularly around the 
world as also where commodities have also been a challenge in man
y parts 
of the world. So that's worked in our favor also in the first 9 months of this 
year as we have had that very major focus on immediate consumption drive.

Muhtar, when you look at the performance of Latin America beyond the 
execution model which you're replicating in many of your markets, what do 
you think moves these family 
--
 
on
-
bottlers to make these extraordinary 
efforts. In
 
other words, what insights does Latin America hold for you on 
what the ultimate architecture of North America might look like in terms of 
roles, responsibilities, partnership principles and the intangible things that 
stand behind these execution models?
 
M
uhtar Kent
 
Well, I think it's a 
--
 
I mean, certainly the philosophy of execution is 
something that is coming into our North American business rapidly. I hope 
you were able to see first hand some of that when you were in Houston. But 
just go anywhere and yo
u'll see differences. You'll see 
--
 
your eyes will pick 
up differences across the country. The philosophy, the belief in the business, 
the belief in the ability that where we can grow this business, that these per 
capitas are nowhere near to the ceiling an
d the belief that the inspiration is 
resonating, the marketing combined with execution will resonate and 
translate into a growth algorithm. It starts with that and I think there's great 
learnings not just from Latin America execution and family
-
owned bottl
ing 
business or even larger bottling businesses in Latin America, but across 
many parts of the world whether it's in European Coca
-
Cola Hellenic 
territories, whether it's in Turkey and CCI territories, whether it's in some 
other territories in South Europe
, Iberian Peninsula. There's that philosophy 
of execution that was lost to many to a great deal that extends to the United 
Stated and that's coming back. It's coming back rapidly and I think that's 
what gives us excitement about the future of our business 
here. Now in 
terms of your question related to Latin America per se and yes, we're very 
happy with our performance in Latin America both this past quarter as well 
as on a year
-
to
-
date basis. And again, it's a great portfolio of countries. 
You've seen Brazi
l slow down a little bit, naturally because we were cycling a 
very high number from prior year at 13%. But I think also at the same time, 
other countries are coming back to generate a very healthy result overall in 
our Latin American business. And I've als
o said this before and I want to 
reiterate, we're just starting with our Still Beverage business in Latin 
America. It's just the beginning of the journey and it's still at very low per 
caps and very low beginnings and there's a great future. As we continue
 
to 
maintain the momentum in our Sparkling Beverage business in Latin 
America, the Still Beverage business, that growth is just going to come on 
top of that and that's what I think what we're building rapidly in Latin 
America both in our juice and juice dr
inks business, but also in our teas and 
Leaos, and other such still beverages.

Credit Agricole Securities (

I'd like to just ask about your opinion of the growth in the North American 
market over the next several years. Do we have to throw up our hands and 
say that as a market the industry can't grow, even though you can maybe 
get some brands growi
ng within it? Or do you see hope for sparkling growth?
 
Muhtar Kent
 
Well firstly, I think if you look at what we've been able to achieve here in our 
U.S. market, it's been growing since the second quarter of 2010. And it's 
really important to underscore tha
t point that we are growing. So we have 
no reason to put our hands up, as you suggest. We totally, respectfully 
disagree that that's very far from where our mind is about the United States. 
And there's a number of reasons why we believe that. First, the 
de
mographics in North America are in our favor. They're the best 
demographics of any Western nation in the world. We're going to be adding 
between now and then of our vision term, 30 million people to the 
population of the United States. It'll have the third
 
highest teen population. 
Everyone that has bet against the United States in the past have lost and I 
respectfully believe, very much so, that we'll get it right also from a macro 
perspective here. For the diversity of our population, the entrepreneurial 
s
pirit, the amount of university graduates that we attract from all around the 
world, the best. And so we have every reason to believe that this business 
--
 
that if we can't grow, it's our fault. Simple as that. And we won't accept that. 
And therefore, we a
re growing and we will continue to grow. We never said 
they we're going to grow at rates of China or India. We said that we'll 
generate moderate growth rates in America and that we will continue to 
improve our business and generate higher revenue than our 
volume and 
generate higher income than our revenue. So volume, moderate volume, 
better than the volume revenues and better than revenue income. That's our 
model, and we believe that, that model will work.

I appreciate the enthusiasm and the belief behind that. I'm just wondering, 
are there any specific brands in sparkling that you think have much more 
potential in North America?
 
Mu
htar Kent
 
Sparkling, firstly, brand Coke was even in North America in the last quarter. 
That I think is a huge achievement from where we were. Coke Zero 
continues to have double
-
digit growth. That's a huge benefit that we have 
and a great point of leverage
. And our brands are stronger than ever before, 
metrics for our brands. And we believe that we can continue to accelerate 
both sparkling as well as still beverages. And POWERADE as you know, as 
you've heard is continuing to do very well. Our other still be
verages are 
doing very well. So we believe that 
--
 
and we have the best brand metrics 
coming out of our still and sparkling beverage portfolio as a result of not just 
the investments we've made but also as a result of the execution.

Mark Swartzberg

Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division
 
Muhtar, as you head into this current quarter, you're seeing your FX benefit 
turn to being a negative and I suspect that's before you ge
t any commodity 
benefit. So in light of that dynamic, how are you thinking about how you 
maintain support for your brands now that you're losing this FX benefit? And 
how does that affect your confidence in achieving your 6% to 8% operating 
income targets o
ver the next year or so now that 
--
 
and of course now we'll 
be looking at KO without the noise, if you will, of the CC North America 
acquisition?
 
Muhtar Kent
 
Well
 
I'll let Gary also comment on the FX, but let me just say that we 
weren't dependent on it. No, you can't depend on FX. Depending on FX to 
support your brands is like taking off in a plane with the fuel gauge on. You 
can't do that. So you've got to make ab
solutely sure that you have a 
sustainable base that you can depend on to fuel your brands. And our 
transformation program, which is ahead of schedule and the last year that 
we've generated north of $500 million of savings. We've obviously channeled 
some of
 
that into our brands to continue to fuel our brands. We have also 
--
 
are very ahead of our target of schedule in our North American integration 
and so the volatility of currency is something that changes faster than 
--
 
the 
rate of change of currencies is 
something that we haven't seen for a long 
time, and you cannot depend on that for ensuring that you have enough fuel 
for your brands. So we have other means to ensure that we have 
--
 
that we 
can continue to support our brands. And by the way, the cash posi
tion of our 
bottlers is better than ever before. And we continue to upgrade and increase 
and enhance our long
-
term investment programs that we've announced 
across the world. I was in China recently again where we announced a new 
investment program and actu
ally when you 
--
 
when we concluded the 3
-
year 
investment program, we ended up spending more than we originally 
estimated in China for the 3 years gone back, the last 3 years. And that's 
because of our bottlers' belief in the future of the business. And tha
t's 
happening across the world, so we have 
--
 
our bottlers financial and balance 
sheets are better than we've seen them for a long, long time. That fuels 
more investment in both plant equipment, machinery, cold drink and 
infrastructure and we are certainly
 
reallocating money from our P&L into 
brand building in a very successful and meaningful and sustainable way.
 
Gary P. Fayard
 
Mark, this is Gary. Just a couple of comments on currency. Number one, 
what I was telling you was really just kind of based on wher
e rates are today 
and our current hedge positions, et cetera, for the fourth quarter. I have 
probably 3 to 5 different scenarios of what could happen next year, both on 
currencies and on commodities. Number one, I would tell you that 
fundamentally, we beli
eve that 
--
 
on the fundamentals, the dollar is actually 
probably over
 
[Audio Gap]
 
value, and would give us a benefit. I'm not projecting that right now because 
of the crisis going on in Europe and if they could just get their 
communications consistent, it'
d probably help some of the volatility over 
there. But the dollar's overvalued, but it's overvalued because of fear right 
now in the financial markets. So with that said, long
-
term I think we 
probably benefit. Short
-
term, it probably hurts us a little bit.
 
But also said, I 
think we're seeing offsets across commodities as well. So we'll just have to 
kind of wait and see how it goes. But the important thing to remember, I 
think, is that we run our business across the world in local currency. Their 
local curre
ncy, their local businesses and they generate local currencies and 
run them in local currency. And we do that because we are running this 
business for the long
-
term and not what happens in an FX market today or 
tomorrow.

That's great. Muhtar, if you think about the targets, if we go back to the 
period before the purchase of CCE North America, we used to hear you 
comment we think the targets are reasonable for the coming year. What is 
your vie
w of achieving the targets in '12 or over the near
-
 
to intermediate
-
term now that we no longer have the noise of CCE North America in the 
reported results?
 
Muhtar Kent
 
Well, we've consistently met or exceeded our long
-
term growth targets, 
Mark. And I think
 
that basically, and you need to understand that we also 
strive for our 2020 Vision targets which is doubling our system revenue by 
2020 from a base of 2010. And coupled with those, as I said before 
--
 
as I 
mentioned before, we will continue to strive to e
nsure that we meet or 
exceed our long
-
term growth targets in every quarter as we operate through 
this difficult environment. And as I said also that there may be bumps, one 
or 2 bumps along the way and that's what we said also in the past. But over 
time an
d over the medium
-
 
and long
-
term, we have every reason to believe 
that we can continue to achieve our long
-
term growth targets and also meet 
our 2020 Vision targets.

Our next question comes from Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley.
 
Dara W. Mohsenia
n

Morgan Stanley, Research Division
 
Muhtar, you detailed the strong immediate consumption trends in the 
quarter. Can you review the key drivers behind that growth and also going 
forward, the level of risk that you think potentially slowing macros here ca
n 
have on immediate consumption trends?
 
Muhtar Kent
 
Well, they've had an impact. Mobility has gone down, more people are 
moving towards in
-
house entertainment. But we saw those trends and we 
invested against those to ensure that we would actually continue 
to drive 
our immediate consumption business, whether it is on the streets of Italy or 
whether it's on the streets of Shanghai or in Africa. And so what does that 
entail? That entails more cold drink equipment, targeted cold drink 
equipment. That included a
 
new architecture of packaging and pricing that 
would make it more attractive for on
-
the
-
go consumers to find packages 
that were affordable for them, and we did that in China and successfully in 
parts of Asia successfully, in many parts of Eurasia as we di
d here in 
America. And I think it's worked and you heard me just announce also that 
we'll be launching even more new on
-
the
-
go packages here in the United 
States. So this strategy of investment ahead of the curve in infrastructure, 
particularly in cold dri
nk infrastructure, coupled with the intelligent 
progressive packaging moves, have helped us in this area and will continue 
to help us. And then lay on top of that also some innovative moves like the 
expansion of Freestyle across 
--
 
and Freestyle is now in 
2 markets around 
the world as we speak, in the United States and Japan, and continuing to 
create a lot of excitement. And then also overlay on top of that other 
innovations like the PlantBottle and I LOHAS in Japan, driving results for us 
in the immediate 
consumption of convenience store channel. And so you get 
the picture, I hope.

Just wanted to ask a question on Europe. It looks as though, sort of parsing 
through the different commentary, it looks as though sparkling volume 
growth was great but non
-
carbs weaker. Do you think that's 
--
 
is there a 
greater weather impact on the non
-
ca
rbs side? Do you think that's an 
economic issue? Or in terms of maybe juices, whatever, being more 
expensive? Was it just sort of I have a big commodity bottled water 
business. Can you talk a little bit about the differentiation and growth 
between the non
-
carbs and the sparkling side in Europe?
 
Muhtar Kent
 
Well, there wasn't a big differentiation to the extent that you mentioned. But 
there was a small differentiation and I would attribute that to the very cold 
weather, particularly in 
--
 
ready
-
to
-
drink teas
 
and sports drinks do get 
impacted more so by the climatic conditions, and they were very severe 
compared to the year before. But I would look at the year
-
to
-
date and that 
in the year
-
to
-
date, there's absolutely no anomaly in that. So I wouldn't put 
too mu
ch into that.

And then a quick question to Gary. Gary, you talked about sort of terming 
out some of your debt, going a little bit longer duration. Can you talk 
--
 
as 
you talked about the interest ex
pense and interest income numbers, can you 
give us an update there and should we expect you to continue to term out 
some of this CP, et cetera?
 
Gary P. Fayard
 
John, we're still actually looking at that and have not made a decision 
whether we'll term out an
ymore of the debt or not at this point in time. 
What we're looking at on the interest income, interest expense by the way, 
is really just a translation impact of the exchange rates of how much the 
interest income translates into in dollars and that's the o
nly impact we have 
actually hedged quite a bit of, economically, in terms of actual cash itself, to 
protect the dollar amount of the cash, if you will. But it does translate into 
fewer dollars of interest income. But on the terming of our commercial 
paper,
 
we're still looking at it and we'll let you know as we go forward on 
that.
 
John A. Faucher 
-
 
JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division
 
Okay and then, I apologize. One other quick question, which is you talked 
about having translation 
--
 
I think operating in
come hedges in place for 
most important currencies. And traditionally you've had a fairly narrow 
basket on the operating income line. Has that changed or are you now 
potentially hedging in some other currencies?
 
Gary P. Fayard
 
No, we're actually hedging in some other currencies. It hasn't changed and 
let me explain that. When we're looking at like a year or 2 years out or that 
kind of thing, it's basically hedged in the hard currencies, euros, sterling, et 
cetera, because to try
 
to hedge a lot of emerging market currencies is just 
prohibitively expensive. However when you get into 3, 4, 5 months kind of 
out, you can actually then start putting hedges in place to lock in. So we do, 
on a shorter
-
term basis, actually hedge a lot of 
the other currencies as well.
 
Operator
 
And our final question today comes from Alice Longley with Buckingham 
Research.
 
Alice Beebe Longley 
-
 
Buckingham Research Group, Inc.
 
My question is a follow
-
up to currency combined with commodity trends. I 
mean, we c
an't know the magnitude or the timing of your hedging 
programs. Could you just give us some order of magnitude of the offset? In 
other words, can we assume that net of all your hedging, that commodity 
trends offset 30% of the currency hits next year or 50%
 
or 80%? And is 
there a timing lag?
 
Gary P. Fayard
 
Yes. What I can do is I'll try to give you an update on that in February when 
we do the year
-
end call. And just to put some context around that, let me 
give you an example. If you look at the GAAP, non
-
GAA
P schedules that we 
have that were released this morning with our earnings release, you'll see 
that where we take 
--
 
we have some hedges, commodity hedges, that are 
economic hedges but are not accounting hedges. And we put them in there 
and actually take t
he impact gain or loss out. If you look this quarter, there's 
actually $113 million of hedge losses, which means we've committed to buy 
some commodities, if you will, which 
--
 
at a price which on the last day of 
the quarter was more expensive than spot. As
 
of today versus 2 weeks ago, 
half of that $113 million is gone and were actually just swung back the other 
way and that's what the volatility is doing today. So I think that's why we're 
saying we'll wait February. We'll give you a good, hopefully better o
utlook. 
Because as I said in one of the previous comments, we've got probably 5 
different scenarios of what could happen on currencies and commodities 
going, and all of them pretty much going in different directions. So we'll give 
you a much better look th
en, because today I just can't do it.

Muhtar Kent
 
Thank you, Jackson, and good morning, everyone. I want to start off today 
by recognizing that many of you are attending the CAGNY conference this 
week, given the timing of our earnings call and the fact that I will also 
presenting at CAGNY 
this coming Friday, we will keep our prepared remarks 
a little bit shorter to ensure that we have adequate time for your questions 
and that we can get you back into the conference.
 
With 2013 behind us I am now looking forward to joining forces with our 
glo
bal system associates as we work to restore momentum to our business 
in 2014. 2013 was clearly marked by ongoing persistent macroeconomic 
challenges and our business was not immune to these pressures. 
Nevertheless we delivered sound financial results and w
e grew global value 
share in non
-
alcoholic ready
-
to
-
drink beverages for a 26th consecutive 
quarter.
 
Our volume 
--
 
our worldwide volume grew 1% in the fourth quarter and 2% 
for the full
-
year. We delivered full
-
year comparable currency neutral 
operating inco
me growth of 6% after excluding the impact of structural 
changes off of a comparable currency neutral ex
-
structural revenue growth 
of 3% for the full
-
year. And we delivered full
-
year comparable currency 
neutral EPS growth of 8% in line with our long
-
term g
rowth targets. This 
performance underscores our ability to generate sound financial results even 
in a challenging environment.
 
Our sparkling brands grew 1% in the full
-
year cycling 3% with brand Coca
-
Cola adding nearly a 100 million unit cases. In fact all
 
of our billion dollar 
Sparkling brands except for Diet Coke Coca
-
Cola Light grew in 2013 
contributing more than 140 million incremental cases in the full year. As of 
the end of 2013 we've gained core sparkling value share for 17 consecutive 
quarters. For 
the full year our portfolio of still beverage brands contributed 
over 300 million incremental cases or 5% growth while cycling 10% growth 
in the prior year. Importantly, we gained volume share and value share for 
the year.
 
Our tea volume grew 11% for the f
ull
-
year with solid performance across our 
entire tea portfolio. Juice and juice drinks grew 5% for the full year with 
strong performance by Minute Maid, Simply, [indiscernible] Minute Maid 
Pulpy Rani and InneSense. We are proud of our robust portfolio of 
leading 
juice and juice drink brands.
 
Sports drinks grew 2% for the full
-
year with Powerade continuing its solid 
and consistent growth performance.
 
Packaged water grew 5% for the full
-
year as we focused on growing over 
premium water brands and on expanding
 
our PlantBottle and Ecoflex 
packaging.
 
While 2013 was an unusual and challenging year, it has certainly not 
deterred us from our commitment to our 2020 vision. Many economies 
around the world remained volatile in 2013, developed markets are slowly 
startin
g to recover from this turbulent time and consumer expenditures 
remain moderated. And emerging markets faced substantial challenges as 
they dealt with fluctuating currencies and other structural issues.
 
However, we remain optimistic and excited about the f
uture of our business 
and brands in emerging markets after all per capita consumption for our 
brands remains relatively low in most emerging countries. That said, these 
emerging market conditions simply reinforce our commitment to remain 
focused on our lon
g
-
term strategies and to keep investing through these 
tough times to ensure that we continue to deliver long
-
term sustainable 
growth.
 
In Europe we saw a 1% volume decline for the year. However, we gained 
sparkling and still value share and we were pleased 
by improving volume 
performance in certain key markets. A better second half of the year helped 
our North
-
West Europe and Nordics business unit close 2013 with 1% 
volume growth while Germany continued to outperform delivering 6% 
volume growth for the quart
er and 2% growth for the year. Our successful 
share of Coke campaign last summer contributed to full
-
year trademark 
Coca
-
Cola volume growth of 1% in North
-
West Europe and Nordics and 5% 
in Germany.
 
We also launched share of Coke in our Iberia business unit
 
in the fourth 
quarter of the past year and as in other markets the campaign has 
generated tremendous excitement contributing to strong double
-
digit 
immediate consumption growth and to trademark Coca
-
Cola growth of 2% in 
the quarter.
 
Moving now to Eurasia 
and Africa, full
-
year volume grew 7% cycling 10% in 
the prior year and we grew volume and value share in non
-
alcoholic ready to 
drink beverages for the full
-
year. All our business units delivered solid full
-
year volume growth including double
-
digit volume 
growth in our Middle East 
and North Africa business units.
 
In Russia, strong Olympic and Christmas campaigns activated across the 
country view double digit growth in trademark Coca
-
Cola for the year and 
enabled us to gain core sparkling volume share while 
maintaining value 
share. Fittingly, leading up to this Olympic year our business achieved an all
-
time high market share for non
-
alcoholic ready to drink beverages. We 
recently completed a successful Olympic torch relay bringing the torch to 
thousands of Ru
ssian towns and cities and I was pleased to have an 
opportunity to host our customers and our bottling partners in Sochi last 
week where I saw our best ever activation of an Olympic asset. Our local 
team and bottlers are doing an excellent job in Sochi.
 
Ou
r Pacific Group grew 3% in the full year cycling 7% in the prior year. We 
were pleased to see improving trends across key markets including India, 
China and Japan as the year progressed.
 
For the full year our volume in Japan grew 1% with Sprite, Minute Mai
d and 
ISACA each growing by double digits. China contributed 3% volume growth 
for the full year cycling 4% in 2012 and grew 5% in the fourth quarter. We 
delivered balanced growth across sparkling and still beverages thanks to 
strong campaigns and a renewed
 
focus on execution.
 

campaigns like our Mini
-
Me Coca
-
Cola campaign which contributed to double 
digit immediate consumption growth in the fourth quarter and our popular 
Share a Coke campa
ign last summer.
 
And India cycled 16% full year growth with a 4% volume increase in 2013 
closing out the year with our 30th consecutive quarter of volume growth. It 
is remarkable to think of the business that we have built in India over the 
last two decade
s. In 2013 our system generated nearly $1.8 billion in 
revenue and we have four of the top five core sparkling brands, the number 
one juice drink brand, a commanding non
-
alcoholic ready to drink share and 
so much, so much fun tapped opportunities still ahe
ad.
 
Turning now to Latin America, we grew 1% for the full year [cycling] 5% in 
the prior year. Argentina, Mexico and Brazil all come to mind as we consider 
what worked for us and what was challenging in 2013 in Latin America. We 
were pleased with our perfo
rmance in Argentina where despite challenging 
economic conditions our brands performed well resulting in 7% volume 
growth for the full year. Sparkling was an important volume driver in 
Argentina with Coca
-

ngle 
digits. Cola
-
Cola Life met our expectations and is playing a meaningful role 
as it is not just delivering incremental volume, but also enhancing the 
positive feelings that consumers have for Coca
-
Cola.
 

Coca
-
Cola Life as it has shown great 

how we are working to be part of a solution to the obesity issue giving 
consumers a blend of sugar and natural zero calorie sweeteners.
 
Returnin
g to our business in Argentina our still brands grew double digits 
with strong performance in packaged water with the launch of the Bonaqua 
Ecoflex bottle as well as solid growth in juice and juice drinks and sports 
drinks.
 
In Mexico, volume growth was eve
n for the year with still beverage volume 
growth offset by sparkling. Despite a solid start to 2013, we had a 
challenging second half of the year mostly due to severe weather. We 
continue to see opportunity in Mexico where our strong brands, world class 
ex
ecution and an improving economy bode well for the future.
 
Our bottling partners have adjusted their pricing as a result of the newly 
implemented tax and we are closely monitoring any further adjustments as 
needed. While we expect the change to adversely i
mpact our volume in 
Mexico in the short term, it is too early to tell what the exact impact will be 
at this time.
 
I will wrap up my commentary in Latin America with an update on our 
business in Brazil where consumers have been impacted by a slowing 
economy
, rising prices and reduced disposable income. Full year volume was 
down 2% due to a disappointing 6% drop in the fourth quarter. Our local 
team working closely with our bottling partners has now launched an 
upgraded affordability strategy enhancing our [A
sian] brand price pack and 
channel architecture. We are optimistic that this strategy together with our 
World Cup program will enable us to return to growth in Brazil in 2014.
 
Turning now to North America, we remain steadfast in our commitment to 
building 
long term value in our flagship market and a commitment that calls 
for building strong brands, trading customer value and enhancing our 
system capabilities. Sandy Douglas is leading our North American business 
where we will again benefit from a strong cust
omer and strategic brand 
expertise. Adding Paul Mulligan and Irial Finan's disciplined focus on 
execution at the point of sale will enable us to refine these strategies and to 
enhance their impact. The combined experience and expertise of this 
leadership t
eam and a joint accountability for driving value will ensure that 
we are laser focused on continued improvement of our overall performance 
in this important market. We will therefore continue to assess and to 
evaluate the operating results in North America
 
as an integrated business.
 
In October of 2010, we established a four to five year timeframe to 
commence the refranchising of our bottling operations in North America. 
2014 is the fourth year and as the North America operating model evolves, it 
will not on
ly streamline our focus but if will also expedite refranchising to 
independent bottling partners. To date, we've closed on the first transaction 
of our 21st century beverage partnership model at the end of 2013 and we 
are very encouraged with the seamless 
transition of the territory.
 
Looking ahead, we are well aligned on the transition with the other four 
bottlers that we announced back in 2013. We expect to reach agreements 
with those partners shortly and for those transactions to begin closing later 
in th

partnerships whose ownership reflects the diversity of the consumers and 
customers we proudly serve in North America.
 
We expect North America to deliver consistent volume, revenue and 
trans
action growth with the balance volume and price mix that you would 
expect from an industry leader. We also firmly believe that the business will 
deliver consistent profitable growth over the long
-
term. 2013 was a 
challenging year in North America and I am 
not satisfied with our overall 
performance. Nevertheless we gained volume and value share while 
generating positive price mix of 1% across our portfolio and positive price 
mix of 2% for our sparkling brands. However, our volume was even versus 
prior year a
nd operating income fell short of our targets.
 
Sparkling beverage volume fell 2%, largely due to softer diet coke volume. 
We have implemented a multi
-
faceted approach to address category 
headwinds and the various misperceptions that fuel them. This effort 
is 
targeting both obesity and ingredient concerns and increase aggressive 
sweetener innovation, transparent consumer communications, continued 
packaging evolution and new partnerships with credible third parties around 
the world who will use meaningful fac
ts to defend and protect the sparkling 
category.
 
While we work to nurture our sparkling business back to growth, our still 
beverage business continues to perform well. Still beverages grew 5% for 
the full year as our diverse portfolio of still beverage bra
nds continues to 
outperform the competition.
 
Thanks to continuous innovation and to growing brands like Powerade, 
Simply, Gold Peak and Smartwater, the fourth quarter marks the 15th 
consecutive quarter in which our still beverage portfolio gained or 
mainta
ined volume and value share in North America.
 
As we approach the mid
-
point of our 2020 vision, we remain fully committed 
to taking the necessary bold actions to realize our vision. One such action is 
our recently announced global partnership with Green Mou
ntain Coffee 
Roasters. This partnership is a real game changing innovation in the non
-
alcoholic beverage category. Consumers are demanding more beverage 
variety, functionality and convenience. And we believe Green Mountain is the 
perfect strategic partner 
to collaborate with and to capitalize on the many 
transformative opportunities we see available in the marketplace. 
Importantly for the Coca
-

leveraging new technology to create a transformative platform for
 
consumers to enjoy our great brands through new consumption occasions 
and new channels.
 
By combining Coca
-


will capitalize o
n the many exciting opportunities in the single serve pod
-
based segment of the cold beverage industry as well as explore other future 
opportunities to collaborate on the entire [current] platform. As evidenced 
by this recent announcement, our management te
am is constantly 
identifying and constantly evaluating creative ways to formulate and fuel the 
power of partnerships that keep us at the forefront of consumer trends, 
driving the dynamic global beverage industry.
 
We are fortunate to participate in a global
 
and resilient industry fuelled by a 
robust long
-
term demographic trend. We are part of a great business system 
and unparalleled in its reach and its commitment to invest and we are the 

 
Thus there is no dou
bt that the lingering effects of the global recession in 
2009 have created a challenging environment over the last two years. In 
addition obesity and ingredient concerns have raised some questions about 
growth in developed markets. Throughout this time per
iod our Company has 
consistently delivered on our profit objectives and we will not allow ourselves 
to become distracted or to make decisions focused on short
-
term gains. 
Instead we have thoroughly evaluated what we need to do to accelerate 
sustainable gro

 
Historically we know that when we invest in our brands, commit to near 
flawless execution and control what we know we can control, we can 
accelerate our growth. With this in mind we aligned on five strate
gic 
priorities to restore our momentum and to keep us on the path to achieve 
our 2020 vision. These priorities focused on the growth drivers for our 
system, sparkling beverages, still beverages and global system execution. 
And on securing and strengthening
 
the financial assuming capital necessary 
to deliver long
-
term sustainable growth.
 
Our five strategic system priorities to restore momentum are; firstly, 
accelerate sparkling growth led by Coca
-
Cola; secondly, strategically 
expanding our profitable still p
ortfolio; third, increasing media investments 
by maximizing productivity; fourth, winning at the point of sale by unlocking 
the power of our system; and five, investing in our next generation of 
[layers].
 
Let me just spend a few minutes providing some deta
il on each of these 
system priorities. First, we will accelerate sparkling growth led by Coca
-
Cola. 
There is quite simply no other brand in the world like Coca
-

most universal beverage brand. We are fortunate to be its stewards. And 
indeed
, in many markets around the world, brand Coca
-
Cola remains 
magical but we need to work even harder to enhance the romance of the 
brand in every market around the world. Our global marketing community is 
laser focused on doing their best work while realloc
ating resources to the 
most impactful campaigns and mediums.
 
A good example of this great work is Share a Coke, which I have referenced 
several times in my remarks earlier. Since the initial launch of Share a Coke 
in Australia back in 2011, we've now execu
ted the campaign in 21 other 
markets. There is 
--
 
this is much more than the marketing campaign. In 

-
wide collaborative effort to engage consumers in a 
meaningful and a very authentic Coca
-
Cola way.
 
Markets that have launched Share a Cok
e have experienced increased 
household penetration, higher immediate consumption volume and improved 
brand love scores as a direct result of this campaign. This is the kind of 
marketing that we love to invest in and we look forward to again sharing a 
Coke 
with millions of consumers around the world this year. Same time 
we're working hard to empower our consumers and we're making progress 
against our four commitments to further contribute to healthier, happier and 
more active communities.
 
To that end we've p
laced a special emphasis on innovation efforts to 
enhance low or no calorie versions of our brand as well as on supporting 
active healthy living programs all around the world.
 
Our second priority is to strategically expand our profitable still portfolio. W
e 

and many more in the pipeline. We have shown in juices that when we 
approach an objective and a goal systematically aligning with our partners, 
planning from end
-
to
-
end, we win 
and we win big. Today, the Coca
-
Cola 

twice the size of our closest competitor. We are the stewards of $4 billion 
juice and juice drink brands and we are working diligently to raise t
hat 
number. We're bringing the same disciplined thinking to other categories 
partnering across our system and across our supply chain to establish a 
scalable formula for value creation in new categories. This effort involves re
-
examining every stage of a b

specific plans that balance organic growth, innovation and acquisition.
 
Our third system priority is to increase media investments by maximizing 
productivity. We are in a business where great marketing works. So,
 
we 
have committed to increasing our media spending behind our brands by up 
to $1 billion by 2016. We will fund this increased investment through a 
combination of supply
-
chain optimization, system standardization, diligent 
resource and cost allocation as w
ell as improved utilization of our global 
marketing network. This incremental productivity goal will further enable us 
to drive long
-
term profitable growth and momentum towards realizing our 
2020 vision. Gary will share further details about this new oppor
tunity in a 
few moments.
 
Our fourth priority is to win at the point of sale by unlocking the power of 
our global system. Working together with our marketing partners, we are 
continuously building capabilities and leveraging best practices to improve 
our ex
ecution. In the last four years alone, our system has invested over 
$50 billion to enhance our competitive position in markets all around the 
world. As you know execution in the global marketplace is about doing many 
common things uncommonly well and doing
 
them in an aligned way across 
our great system. It is about presenting our brands in the right package, in 
the right outlook, in the right channel, at the right price, cold available and 

14 the 
year of execution at the point of sale beginning with brand Coca
-
Cola.
 
Our final, but perhaps most important priority is to continue to invest in our 
pipeline of leaders. There is nothing more critical to our business than our 
people and we have to 
continue to hire the best, retain the best, train the 
best, and manage with the best. Our Company and leadership must inspire 
our people to live our values of focusing on the market, working smart, 
acting like owners and being passionate ambassadors for ou
r Company and 
for our brand.
 
As we look forward to 2014 and beyond, we remain very confident in our 
ability to drive our volume growth trajectory back in line with our long
-
term 
growth model. The overall beverage industry remains healthy generating 
both vo
lume and value growth. Our diverse portfolio of $17 billion brands 
combined with our unparalleled scale provides us with many opportunities to 
accelerate market share gains. We have identified opportunities to 
significantly enhance our productivity initiat
ives and we made important 
commitments to increase our brand investment. Consequently, we are no 
less enthusiastic about the future ahead of us and the beverage industry 
then when we embark on our 2020 vision back four years ago.
 
With that, let me the turn
 
the call over to Gary.
 
Gary Fayard
 
Thanks, Muhtar, and good morning everyone. As Muhtar shared earlier, 
2013 presented numerous challenges to our industry and to our business 
and as a result, our full year volume growth was below our 
expectations. 
However, before we put 2013 behind us I wanted to reflect on a few items 

about how our unwavering focus on long
-
term value creation for our 
shareowners and apart fro
m competing in a great industry, there were three 
specific points I emphasized.
 
First, we are focused on delivering value creating volume growth and despite 
volume growth being below our expectations in 2013 we delivered full year 
operating income and EPS 
growth in line with our long
-
term growth targets.
 
Secondly, our goal is to take volume share and although we fell short on 
volume, we again gained global value share in non
-
alcoholic ready
-
to
-
bring 
beverages into 2013.
 
Lastly, I emphasized the critical rol
e that the evolution of our franchise 
system plays in creating sustainable long
-
term growth. Our Company and 
our system made solid progress on this front throughout 2013.
 
We sold 51% of our Philippines bottling operations to Coca
-
Cola Thums Up. 
Our four bo
ttling partners in the greater Tokyo area merged to form Coca
-
Cola East Japan. Our seven bottling partners in Spain and Portugal merged 
and the integration of that bottler is underway. We merged our company 
own bottling operations in Brazil with an indepen
dent local bottler to form 
the second largest bottler in Brazil. And we also continue to advance the 

review a few key drivers of our financial performance this year.
 
Unit case sale
s and concentrate sales were in line on a consolidated basis in 
the fourth quarter and for the full year. Our comparable currency neutral 
operating income was up 6% in the quarter and for the full year after 
excluding the impact of structural items.
 
Compar
able currency neutral earnings per share grew 7% in the quarter and 
8% for the full year, and we generated $10.5 billion in cash from operations 
which was down 1% primarily due to the impact of foreign currency 
exchange rates and increase in tax payments a
nd the impact of 
deconsolidation of bottling operations in the Philippines and Brazil.
 
Now let me take the moment to update everyone on our productivity 
initiatives before I move to our outlook for 2014. First let me start by saying, 
we made significant pr
ogress on our previously announced productivity and 

we have substantially accomplished the objectives of the program and 
captured the savings associated with those objectives.
 
Sec

announced productivity and reinvestment program to drive an incremental 
$1 billion in productivity by 2016 that will be redirected primarily in to 
increased media investments.
 
Our incrementa
l productivity goal consists of two relatively equal 
components. First, expanded savings through global supply chain 
optimization data and information technology system standardization and 
resource and cost reallocation which will be reinvested in global b
rand 
building initiatives with an emphasis on increased media spending and also 
will be increasing the effectiveness of our marketing investments by 
transforming our marketing and commercial model to redeploy resources 
into more consumer facing marketing i
nvestments to accelerate growth.
 
As we look ahead to 2014, let me take a minute to update you on a few 
outlook items as you model our business. After considering our hedge 
positions, current spot rates and the cycling of prior year rates, we partly 
expect 
a currency headwind at the operating income of approximately 10 
points in the first quarter of 2014 and seven points for the full year.
 

totally covered on sterling and also have near 
term coverage in place across 
several other major currencies.
 
We anticipate that operating leverage on a currency neutral basis will be flat 
to slightly positive. We expect net interest income will contribute roughly 
equivalent of penny per share to our fu
ll year 2014 earnings per share and 
will be evenly distributed throughout the year. We expect the tax rate for 
2014 to hold steady at approximately 23%.
 

bottling divestitures durin
g the first six months of 2014 and even though 
these structural items will not have a significant impact on earnings per 
share, they will result in a one point headwind at both net revenue and 
operating income for the full year. To be clear, our 2014 outlo
ok for the 
impact of structural items does not include the potential impact of 
refranchising bottling assets in North America related to our system of the 
future work. We will continue to provide updates as we move forward 
throughout the year.
 
As for cash,
 

disciplined and consistent framework, first we reinvest in the business which 
includes making the necessary investments to strengthen our brands to 
accelerate growth. It also includes capital inves
tments which we expect to be 
in the range of $2.5 billion to $3 billion this year.
 

increased our dividend every year for more than half a century and we will 
recommend another increase in t
he dividend this year at our Board meeting 
this week.
 
Next, we evaluate opportunities to grow through acquisitions, partnerships 
and joint ventures. We do these as enablers to help accelerate growth when 
appropriate and where there is a need within our exi
sting portfolio.
 

share repurchases to be in the range of $2.5 billion to $3 billion. Although 
our 2014 outlook for net share repurchase is below 2013, I would remind 
everyone that
 
our 2013 buybacks represented a 15% increase from the prior 
year and was partially funded by cash inflows related to bottling divestitures.
 
Also given the forecasted exchange headwinds in 2014, we believe this is 

tinue to update you as we move 
forward throughout the year.
 
In terms of quarterly saving our first quarter in 2014 will have one less 
selling day and our fourth quarter will have one additional selling day. In 
addition we expect the impact of the Easter ho
liday to fully benefit the 

related to long term compensation in the first and second quarters of 2014.
 
In closing we continue to be focused on doing the right things for the healt
h 
of our business and to ensure we can deliver sustainable long term growth 
to create value for our shareowners. I believe our Company and our system 
are well positioned to capitalize on the opportunities within our great

Hi, good morning, can you guys talk about, through the outlook geography 
by geography and then maybe how the pace of growth is going to differ 
between volume and pricing given some of the big currency moves and also 
obviously the tax in Mexico
 
and I have a follow up if I could.
 
Muhtar Kent
 
Sure Bill, good morning, this is Muhtar. Let me just first just take a step 

would have come on our road to 2020. We dealt with 
commodities in 2011 

internal also execution issues caused us to underperform versus our 

--
 
by saying that.
 

ed at our people, priorities, 
marketing, selling and innovation and we have refreshed our plans, and with 
a simple but scales offset of priorities on marketing our brands, system 
execution by our franchisees and bottling partners and Company owned 
bottlers
 
and on innovation of all kinds, business models like the one that you 
--
 

packaging, the lot.
 
Our long term outlook is our performance algorithm which we have and will 
deliver going forward a
nd 2014 will be a year of steady improvement as we 
get back up to speed. But make no mistake, our leadership team is 
confident, accountable, our system will market well, we will sell well and we 
are going to achieve our 2020 vision.
 
Now let me just take yo
u through a quick tour of the world, and I will ask 
Ahmet also to comment.
 
Starting with Asia, I think China is going to sustain its growth. India, in 
terms of its macroeconomic outlook, and I think we will continue to benefit 
from that. In India I think t
here's election coming up and usually when there 

play into a little bit of added disposable incomes.
 
In South
-
East Asia certainly we've seen quite a lot of political turm
oil 
especially in Thailand. I think that will, as we go into 2014, my expectation 

up, but I think Indonesia is certainly having some macroeconomic issues 
that will probably con
tinue into 2014. And then Philippines, I think we'll see 
some slightly improved outlook in the Philippines versus 2013.
 
In Japan, I think obviously everyone is looking very closely at the new 

 
tax coming 

in Japan feel that there is some hope for a little bit of more inflation in the 
economy that will benefit also businesses like ours, although recently then 
last eco
nomic numbers from Japan were a little bit below expectations.
 

that we will continue to grow well in the years to come in the African 
continent and benefit from also improvements in 
governance across the 
whole continent.
 
And in Eurasia, there is elections coming up in Turkey. Lots of, again, 
political issues in the Middle East will continue. And Russia I think, all 
Russians can be very proud of the Olympics that are taking place. And 
I 
think that we will, as we move forward, as [our eyes are now] there in 
Russia looking at some of the great activations that we've had in our 
business. And I think Russia our business will continue to grow, in Russia 
with all the investments that we are m
aking with our bottling partners.
 
Europe is a tale of 
--
 

zones, I think the high unemployment and low growth is going to continue 

s certainly 
ahead of all the other economies in terms of the growth outlook. And I think 
Germany also is in that area. We will continue to benefit from the robustness 
of policies in those two economies and the rest of the continent is somewhat 
behind Germa
ny and England.
 
And in Latin America, again, 2014 is going to be year leading into an 
election, in early 2015. We'll have also the benefit of the World Cup, and our 
biggest [February activation] globally on the World Cup. And Southern Cone, 
Argentina, Chil
e; we should continue to see the benefit of all the programs 
we have in place and also continued inflation environment in those two 

over the reforms, both long
-
term I think that i
s a benefit to our business, to 
the economy, to the people of Mexico. And again as I said in my 
commentary, it's too early to say about the impact of the price increase 
we've had there. So I hope that that gives you a good tour of the world.
 
And then final
ly in terms of our flagship market in the United States, clearly 
the best right now as far as we can see, the best western developed 
economy in the world we think we will see slightly improved mobility in the 
United States in 2014 versus 2013. And we hope 
that will also mean a little 
bit of increased spending for consumer products as we go into 2014. And 
again we will benefit from all the robustness in our marketing program and 
our increased expenditure and quality of marketing as we move into 2014 
for our 
flagship market.
 
Ahmet, you want to add some commentary?
 
Ahmet Bozer
 
Yes. I will add few things, I guess, to really compare some of these issues 
that have existed even last year, how they are different now? For example 
emerging market currencies; when the 
first news on discontinuation of 
[paper] came out last year around May or June; there was a bit of a shock in 
emerging markets. We see that over the last seven or eight months these 

s 

control compared to when it first came up and the interest rate and things 
like that have been baked into those expectations. So, I guess the message 
there is countries and
 
our business we're finding ways to deal with that new 
reality of less liquidity coming out of United States.
 
I would just add Muhtar to your comment on Europe north south divide, that 
is very much true but we are sort of beginning to see sort of different
 
shades 
of grey in the south as well. There are some encouraging signs in Spain, sort 
of less so in Italy at this point in time although there is a new Prime Minister 

And the Easter
n Europe, it continues to struggle in terms of consumer 
confidence and economic. So north continues to do well and south is even 
showing different performance now.
 
The other point that Muhtar mentioned is political uncertainty, it's another 
common thing to
 
many of our emerging markets. They eventually could 
impact the economic realities but again so far in countries like Turkey and 

questions, let me just stop it here.
 
Muhtar Ke
nt
 

important to say in North America that we believe in the North American 
market, we believe in the demographics, we believe this is a growth market; 
we have grown in all but two quar
ters of the last 15 quarters in the United 

focused on achieving that. Sandy?
 
Sandy Douglas
 
Yes. Thanks Muhtar. We have a great business in North America and our 
focus in accelerating th
e business is on our brands, on our customers and on 

all of our U.S. bottlers. I think Irial and Paul bring a tremendous amount of 
selling and executional energy that will help 
us build on our momentum.
 
On my end, over the last six to seven weeks, Paul and I have met with our 

brand plant in detail looking at opportunities to focus and strengthen them 
and to m
ove resources to emphasize advertising and brand building on our 
largest brands. And I think with the plan in place our focus as a system Irial, 
Paul and I, and our bottlers is to improve all aspects of our execution, 

the marketplace. And we believe as a 
result of that that we will improve steadily over time and we share the 
confidence that Muhtar expressed in the long term health of North America. 

 
our 
long term future there.

And our next question is from Bryan Spillane from Bank of America.
 
Bryan Spillane

lot of moving parts with exchange rates
 
and some of the volatility in 
emerging markets. Maybe Gary could you talk a little bit about how we 
should think about currency neutral and also maybe sort of neutral of the 
effects of structural change? Are you still looking at a currency neutral sort 
of
 
on
-
algorithm year in operating profits? And also just some of the other 
major drivers behind volume that might influence that cost of goods sold 
inflation, price mix, country mix that sort of thing? I think that would be 
helpful.
 
Gary Fayard
 
Yes. Bryan thanks and let me say back and go through all of those. So, let 

rational pricing and believe we should get pricing for our brands because our 
brands are worth it and we 
would expect to have positive price mix this year 



d there 
is not a whole lot you can do about it when all the emerging market 
currencies kind of melt down as they did earlier at the end of December or 
early January.
 
But with that said, let me be very clear, ours is a growth business, is a 
business model t
hat is built on growth and we know that we cannot save our 
way to prosperity. We will have productivity but that productivity will be 
reinvested for growth and while we are reinvesting for growth in our 
marketing, we have our goals are also in addition whi

marketing we will also have a goal and is a goal up for this year up hitting 

increase our marketing but at the same time the goal is we will hit long term 
growth 
model this year.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question is from John Faucher from JPMorgan.

impact in 
hitting your long
-
term algorithm in 2014?
 

marketing, I guess how do we view, there is a sense out there in the market 
that given the headwinds for the category that adding more m
arketing could 
be sort of pushing on a string so to speak. So what is it that you are seeing 
that says these headwinds that you are facing can be offset with higher 
marketing? Thanks.
 
Gary Fayard
 
John its Gary, thanks for the question. First as Muhtar said
 
in the prepared 

planned around Mexico of what we believe is the most likely day. But we 
have a portfolio of brands that are marketed and sold across 200 countries 
and our job is to 
manage that portfolio. So unless something unforeseen 
should happen, I think the answer has to be yes, it includes what could 

going 
--
 
what we believe would happen today.

Cola way is to grow our way to 
success and we invest for growth together with our [bumping] partners and 
we have great 
--
 
the greatest 
system in the world and we have had 
tremendous amount of experience to say that a good marketing, good 
selling works for our business and it will work for our business. We have 

market
ing in both quantity and quality. This is a global increase in marketing 
and in every country that we operate in large or small, we know it works and 
when we invest in marketing, our global partners invest and feed on the 
street, in more coolers in more tr


as we restore steady momentum in through 2014 and beyond.

Thank you. Our next question is from Judy Hong from Goldman Sachs.
 
Judy

Just a few questions, first, just the North America Gary, the profitability 
decline in fourth quarter was pretty surprising. So maybe you could give us 
a little bit of color in terms of the components of the profits decline in North 
A
merica.
 
And just broadly in North America from a profitability perspective, the 

think about the next couple of years, thinking about the refranchising 
opportunities and all the pr
oductivity savings, are we at a point where we 
can actually see growth in this business from a profitability perspective in 

going on?
 
Gary Fayard
 
Judy its Gary, let me take the fir
st part of that question. On the fourth 
quarter profit 
--
 
operating profit decline, it was down 12% I think in the 
fourth quarter. And by the way I know the answer to this one specifically, 
because I asked the same question some time back, and got into my 
new 
detail on it. And 100% of that change is because of 
--
 
it's an all in OpEx or 

incentive compensation, accrual reversals in the fourth quarter of 2012 that 
did not happen in 20
13 and that cycling caused a significant change in OpEx 
swing year
-
on
-

America to that 12% operating income loss.
 

at it fo
r the full year and you will get a better picture of actual performance 
versus the fourth quarter. When you look at the full year then you will see 
--
 

particularly in sparkling around
 

specifically on.
 
Muhtar Kent
 
Just let me add to in terms of the outlook and that is that as I said we are 
confident about and excited about first our performance algorithm worldwide 
but also in terms of steady impro
vement as we get back up to speed in the 
United States. And I think that that will 
--
 
when we start restoring the 
momentum in the United States which we believe is going to happen, well 
that will also bring the results in the 
--
 
financial results that we w
ill be 

this is not a fix 
--
 

steady improvement.
 
Judy Hong

Goldman Sachs
 
And just in terms of the media investments, is there an
y color you can give 
us in terms of the breakdown by regions, by categories, is North America 
likely to get the proportionate amount in terms of the media spending 
increase in 2014?
 
Muhtar Kent
 

s we 

there will be a good distribution and we will be again also looking and 
tracking through franchise leadership, resulting also system increase and 
investments in all the key m
arkets.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question is from Dara Mohsenian from Morgan Stanley.
 
Dara Mohsenian

Morgan Stanley
 
Hi, I also wanted to touch on profit in North America. It sounds like in 2013, 
you view the profit challenges as more driven from a 
volume perspective but 
given the diet soft drink where you seem to be more secular around longer 
term health concerns, I am just wondering if going forward you may manage 
more for profitability and lean more on pricing than driving volume growth. 
Is there 
any change as you look at the algorithm between pricing and 
volume and which metric you will focus on going forward?
 
Muhtar Kent
 
Thanks, Dara. Sandy you want to take it and then [indiscernible] if you want 
to comment.
 
Sandy Douglas
 
Yes, I think the key to 
the North America growth algorithm is investing in 
our brands and our feet on the street and a key element to that is getting 
our pricing, so that we can have the revenue to be able to reinvest in 
sustainable growth. Where we had issues over the years in m
y experience in 
North America is when we did not get the price we needed, when our 
marketing execution was not what it needed to be and therefore the feet on 
the street started to get reduced and ultimately it hurt sustainable growth.
 
Our plan going forwar

on improving it, is to make sure that we get the price and that we execute 
the marketing well and feed the feet on the street which creates the virtuous 
cycle in the United States just like it does aroun
d the world. [Gary] do you 
want to add to that?
 
Unidentified Company Representative
 
I guess the only comment I would say, Muhtar already mentioned that we 
are an industry leader and industry leaders have to set the tone in terms of 
price, in terms of how t
o market their brands in any given market. And 
actually 50 days, in less than 50 days into my new involvement in North 
America, I am really excited about the future. I am excited about the 


really is to make sure that excitement translates into performance and into 

we've already started on the journey and over the next quarters, the next 
couple of years, you will 
see very positive momentum in our market in North 
America.

And then move to our post the investment in Green Mountain, I was just 
hoping to get an update on how important a role acquisitions might play in 
meeting your 2020 v
ision goals? You mentioned the focus on partnerships 
earlier in the call, I was hoping you could elaborate there and if acquisitions 
are greater priority here given some of the difficult macro
-
conditions and 
somewhat favourable environment with your health
y balance sheet and still 
lower rate here.
 
Muhtar Kent
 
Look, nothing different than before, so no change. I think we're obviously 
very excited with the new opportunities for consumption as will be brought 
to us by the partnership with Green Mountain over t
ime. I think the key is to 
feel the power of partnerships. The Coca
-
Cola Company and System is an 
incredible integration of power of partnerships in every respect and therefore 
this is yet another one. And so think about if you look at household 
consumptio
ns in particularly, Western markets, there is a tremendous 
opportunity to gain incremental consumption occasions for our brand 
through these kind of partnerships and this is what the Green Mountain 
partnership is all about.
 
When you look at how beverages a
re consumed at home and when you look 
at trends in the next 10 years, people are going to spend more time at 
home. They are going to work more from home. Home is going to be an 
even more important place for people for consumers and I think we need to 
prese
nt there with different technologies, different packaging, different ways 

these are going to be important for us over time going forward.
 
And so, our thinking has not really evolved
 
or changed in terms of bolt
-
on 
acquisitions, if we see opportunities, we will get them like InneSense like 
[Ocean] and so forth. And we will continue to seek new power of 
partnerships, to leverage new power of partnerships also going into the 
remaining pa
rt of our 2020 vision for the next six years.

Thank you. Our next question is from Ali Dibadj from Bernstein.
 
Ali Dibadj 
-
 
Sanford Bernstein
 
So I guess the frustration I am hearing from many investors and a lot of 
questions on this call, is that t

enough to change itself despite that the world around it has really changed 
and many like us we secularly, to sort of continued emphasis on the Coca
-
Cola way in history which is respectable in volumes, market 
shares, and 
even more marketing blaming short
-


continue to shrink, there is only $1 billion cost savings when some 
competitors are doing more from
 
a pro rata basis. There is limited 
movement on refranchising and help innovation so far. So I guess might the 
company ever believe that it needs to focus on new levers of shareholder 
value creation like pricing up even more lower promotions, massive cost 
cutting, big portfolio innovation change and indeed returning more cash to 

bigger bolder change that pay out to meet this truly different world and so 
what specifically should we be lo
oking for to just kind of sharing your 
confidence about the story or should we just expect kind of same status quo 
going forward?
 
Muhtar Kent
 
First, Ali I disagree with you. I think we have a great portfolio brand, we 
have a great system, the best consumer
 
product system in the world and I 
believe that our programs will work and had worked. We have significantly 

certainly that makes us even more focused and more resolute to continue on 
our r
oad to 2020. And I think that we have 
--
 
I will share at CAGNY on 

say.

Muhtar Kent
 
Thank you, Jackson, and good morning, everyone. Let me begin by saying 
that I'm pleased with our first quarter results. Despite ongoing global 
geopolitical challenges, we once again delivered consiste
nt quality growth 
across all 5 of our geographic operating groups. We are winning share in the 
marketplace. We gained volume and value share globally in our nonalcoholic 
beverages as well as in both the sparkling and still ready
-
to
-
drink beverage 
categorie
s. We are winning with our global sparkling beverage portfolio. 
Brand Coca
-
Cola grew 3% in the quarter. In addition, Fanta is our fourth 
global brand to surpass the $10 billion retail sales value threshold.
 
And we are winning with our global still beverage
 
portfolio, as Del Valle, the 
brand we acquired in 2007 recently, achieved $1 billion dollar brand status. 
Del Valle is now our company's 15th $1 billion brand and our first with roots 
in Latin America. Importantly, we are decisively executing our 2020 Vis
ion, 
together with our global bottling partners and delivering consistent, long
-
term sustainable growth.
 
Before we review this quarter's operating results, I'd like to take a moment 
to address recent events in Japan in light of last month's tragic earthqua
ke 
and tsunami. First, I'd like to acknowledge and sincerely thank our 
leadership team in Japan for their tireless efforts in helping to ensure the 
health and safety of our associates and the people of Japan during this time 
of crisis. I'd also like to exp
ress our heartfelt appreciation to all of our Japan 
bottling partners who've been at the very forefront of our system's efforts to 
assist with immediate disaster relief. Our bottling partners have been 
diligently producing, distributing beverages to affect
ed areas and restoring 
our business operations.
 
Last month, days following the earthquake and tsunami, I visited Tokyo to 
meet with our associates, customers and our bottling partners to gain first
-
hand insight into the initial rebuilding efforts. Given ou
r nearly 60
-
year 
presence in Japan and our deep connection with its people, we are 
committed to doing everything we can to help the recovery, relief and 
rebuilding of this great country. To date, we have pledged $31 million to the 
ongoing relief efforts in
cluding donations of over $7 million bottles of 
product. Through our Coca
-
Cola Japan Reconstruction Fund, we're going to 
help rebuild schools and community facilities all across the country.
 
As for our business in Japan, we can confirm that outside of the 
hardest
-
hit 
regions in North and East Japan, our system's bottling operations have been 
only minimally impacted, and all eight bottling plants in the region most 
affected by the earthquake are now back up and running. We have also 
announced plans to reduce
 
our power usage this summer in East Japan 
mostly in vending machines to ensure we are responsive to the needs of the 
community, while ensuring our machines stay on and in support of small 
businesses which rely on the vending channel.
 
With regard to this q
uarter's results in Japan, our volume was up 1%, 
gaining volume and value share in nonalcoholic ready
-
to
-
drink beverages, 
reflecting the strong momentum our Japan business built across our portfolio 
in the time prior to the earthquake and tsunami. In light
 
of recent events, 
we are actively reevaluating our Japan business plan to ensure we will 
restore and sustain our momentum and meet evolving customer and 
consumer needs.
 
As this topic is top
-
of
-
mind for many of our shareowners, Gary will review 
later in ou
r call a very early estimate of the full year impact these recent 
events may have on our business in Japan. And be assured that in the 
coming months, we will keep providing routine and ongoing updates 
regarding Japan. We appreciate your patience and unders
tanding as we 
navigate through this evolving operating environment.
 
Turning now to our total company performance results. Our volume grew 
6% for the quarter including the benefit of our new cross
-
licensed brands, 
primarily Dr. Pepper brands in North Americ
a. Excluding these brands, our 
quarterly volume grew a strong 5% ahead of our long
-
term growth target 
and fueled by organic volume growth in all 5 geographic operating groups. 
We are happy about these results and confident about our future as we 
achieve th
ese performance results despite natural disasters, political 
uncertainties and a global macroeconomic environment still in recovery and 
pressured by rising inflation and commodity prices.
 
As the global recovery and greater volatility continue, we may see s
ome 
bumps along the way as we've seen in the past. However, our strong brands 
and solid business fundamentals provide us with confidence that we will 
continue to meet and exceed our long
-
term growth targets.
 
Now let's review our performance results across 
our global markets in more 
detail beginning with North America, our flagship market. North America 
volume was up 6% this quarter with organic volume growth of 2%, 
excluding the benefit of our new cross
-
licensed brands. This marks a fourth 
consecutive quart
er of positive organic growth for North America. And 
importantly, North America once more gained volume and value share in 
nonalcoholic ready
-
to
-
drink beverages this quarter.
 
In the United States, trademark Coca
-
Cola gained share, while Diet Coke 
was named
 
the #2 sparkling beverage right behind our #1 brand, Coca
-
Cola. Coca
-
Cola Zero once again delivered double
-
digit volume growth in 
North America for the 20th consecutive quarter. Both Sprite and Fanta 
continued to grow in North America, up 3% and 5%, respe
ctively, this past 
quarter. These successes reaffirm that our system is executing the right 
strategies and taking the right actions to sustainably drive long
-
term growth 
across our entire North America sparkling beverage portfolio.
 
Turning to North America
 
still beverages. I'm pleased to report 8% growth 
for the quarter. We have now grown volume share for our still beverages for 
13 of the past 15 quarters and value share for 14 of the last 15. Our North 
America juices and juice drink business delivered posi
tive growth this 
quarter, fueled once again by our Simply brand which grew 20%. This marks 
the 17th consecutive quarter that Simply has gained both volume and value 
share in the U.S.
 
Our glacéau brands gained volume and value share this quarter growing 
12%
, with our vitaminwater trademark up high single digits and smartwater 
up double digits. POWERADE delivered impressive results, growing 21% this 
past quarter and, once again, outperforming the North America sports drink 
category.
 
Our North America tea busi
ness extended its momentum, delivering 12% 
growth for the quarter.
 
We also completed a transaction that began 3 years ago by acquiring the 
remaining interest in Honest Tea, the nation's top
-
selling organic bottled tea 
company. We are excited to fully welco
me this great and innovative brand to 
our family.
 
In total, our results in North America are a testament to how well our new 
leadership team and operating structure are working. We remain clearly 
focused on our integration efforts, which are proceeding as 
planned. At the 
same time, we're leveraging our strong marketing and sales capabilities to 
accelerate our leadership position within North America and to deliver 
profitable and sustainable growth.
 
Now let me turn to our Pacific Group, which was up 5% in th
e quarter, led 
by double
-
digit growth in both China and Korea and gaining share in both 
sparkling and still beverages. Our return to double
-
digit growth in China was 
driven by the effective execution of our Chinese New Year programs and 
sustained investmen
t in our brands across multiple categories. As a result, 
our sparkling beverages gained share and grew double digits in China this 
quarter. This growth was led by trademark Coca
-
Cola and trademark Sprite, 
with both also growing double digits. In fact, our 
sparkling beverage share in 
China is now at the highest level we've seen in over 2 years.
 
Our still beverages in China also gained share and grew double digits this 
quarter, led by Minute Maid Pulpy, which was up 27%. As discussed in our 
last earnings call
, we are introducing a wider variety of packages in China to 
promote affordability and enhance the consumer experience with our 
brands, all with the focus to drive increased transactions and to build brand 
equity. In support of this strategy, we launched t
he new single
-
serve 300 ml 
package for our sparkling beverages across parts of the country and have 
plans to introduce a 500 ml offering nationwide this summer.
 
Moving now to Latin America. Volume grew a strong 7% for the quarter 
including 5% growth for br
and Coca
-
Cola. Latin America's broad
-
based 
growth was led by Mexico, our highest global per capita market and a 
market sometimes overlooked because of its consistently solid performance. 
This quarter, Mexico grew 14% including an 11% increase for brand Coc
a
-
Cola. And we captured total nonalcoholic ready
-
to
-
drink beverage volume 
and value share in Mexico this past quarter, continuing a trend we have 
consistently seen in nearly every quarter over the last 4 years.
 
Brazil was up 2% for the quarter despite unse
asonably cold and wet 
weather. Importantly, our business in Brazil continues to outperform the 
marketplace, marking the fifth consecutive quarter that Brazil has gained 
volume and value share in nonalcoholic beverages. And our South Latin 
business, which i
ncludes Argentina and Chile, delivered high single
-
digit 
growth, capturing market share again in both sparkling and still beverages.
 
Our Eurasia and Africa business grew 8% in the quarter, led by strong 
results in Russia, Turkey and India. Russia grew 27% 
this past quarter led 
by strong sparkling beverage growth. Brand Coca
-
Cola grew 24% in Russia, 
posting its fifth consecutive quarter of double
-
digit growth.
 
Additionally, Fanta and Sprite also delivered strong double
-
digit growth in 
Russia this past 
quarter. And our business in Russia gained volume and 
value share in total nonalcoholic ready
-
to
-
drink beverages, contributing 
more than 50% of nonalcoholic ready
-
to
-
drink beverage growth in Russia 
this past quarter. Turkey delivered 17% growth this quarte
r and gained 
sparkling beverage share led by trademark Coca
-
Cola, up a strong 19%.
 
India, meanwhile, once again delivered solid results growing 9%. This now 
marks the 19th consecutive quarter of positive growth for this tea market. 
India, also, once again 
delivered balanced growth across our entire portfolio, 
with sparkling beverages up 10% and still beverages up 9% this quarter.
 
Moving now to Europe. Volume was up 1%, this region's third consecutive 
quarter of positive growth despite ongoing macroeconomic 
challenges. We 
also gained share in global nonalcoholic beverages as well as in both the 
sparkling and still beverage categories in Europe this quarter. Our sparkling 
beverages in Europe were up 1% for the quarter including trademark Coca
-
Cola also up 1%, 
and Coca
-
Cola Zero kept its strong momentum in Europe 
increasing double digits once again.
 
Our still beverages in Europe continued to grow and gain share across 
multiple categories including sports drinks, energy drinks and ready
-
to
-
drink 
tea. Germany deli
vered balanced 4% volume growth. This growth was 
balanced across our portfolio with sparkling beverages up 4% and still 
beverages up double digits, leading to total nonalcoholic ready
-
to
-
drink 
beverage volume and value share gains.
 
Finally our business in 
Northwest Europe keeps delivering solid results with 
positive growth in Great Britain, Sweden, Belgium and France. In fact, this 
marks France's 11th consecutive quarter of positive growth.
 
Now let's return to a few of the global brands' success stories ref
erenced at 
the start of today's call. Last quarter I shared how Fanta had become our 
third global brand to surpass $2 billion in annual unit case sales. Fanta is 
also our fourth global brand to surpass the $10 billion retail sales value 
threshold, joining 
Coca
-
Cola, Sprite and Diet Coca
-
Cola. Building on this 
momentum, we have extended Fanta's existing marketing efforts into a 
unified and global integrated campaign to reach consumers worldwide in 
regions representing 90% of Fanta's global sales volume. This
 
highlights 
both our commitment to marketing productivity as well as our belief in 
investing behind our global brands.
 
I mentioned earlier that Del Valle recently became our 15th $1 billion brand. 
When we partnered with Coca
-
Cola Fanta to jointly acquire t
he Jugos del 
Valle business in 2007, the Del Valle brand was available in only 3 countries 
across Latin America with annual retail sales of under $500 million. Today, 
working in partnership with our entire Mexican bottling system, we have 
expanded Del Vall
e to 34 flavors and varieties in 15 countries making Del 
Valle the first of our $1 billion brands with its roots in our Latin America 
region.
 
If we take a step back to reflect on this achievement, we can see that it is 
the latest example of how our global 
system can be so nimble and flexible as 
well as fast in achieving success. It is important to remember that our last 3 
brands to achieve $1 billion status, Simply, Minute Maid Pulpy and Del Valle 
have all followed unique paths to success. Simply represents
 
a classic case 
study, in fact, of how we organically built a new brand to complement our 
existing juice portfolio in order to take juices and juice drink category 
leadership in the United States.
 
Minute Maid Pulpy is a great example of how we've developed
 
a unique 
brand experience, tailored to meet local taste in China and then leveraged 
our scale despite the success across multiple regions. And now, Del Valle 
stands as a prime illustration of how we can partner with our system to 
quickly achieve scale and
 
address an area of opportunity in our beverage 
portfolio all across Latin America. The growth of these brands played a 
significant role in our company becoming the global leader in juices and juice 
drinks. Yet, we believe we have really just begun to tap 
our global potential 
in this key beverage category.
 
As we advance our momentum around the world, we're also committed to 
building a better tomorrow. I've mentioned the work we're doing to support 
the rebuilding efforts in Japan, as it always has been part 
of our company's 
DNA to support communities in need. For example, this year is the 10th 
anniversary of the Coca
-
Cola Africa Foundation. This foundation focuses on 
transforming lives and empowering communities across the African 
continent. We are involved i
n programs focused on improving access to 
clean water, preventative health, education and entrepreneurship training 
among others. Over the past decade, the Coca
-
Cola Africa Foundation has 
implemented more than 160 community projects in nearly 40 countries 
investing more than $100 million across Africa. Looking ahead to the next 
decade, the foundation is committed to expanding its footprint and to 
implementing a project in every country on the continent.
 
Another way we are building for a better tomorrow is b
y further advancing 
our sustainability efforts. In the past, we've talked about the advancement 
of our PlantBottle, a package that functions like a regular, fully recyclable 
plastic bottle but is made with plant
-
based materials resulting in a lighter 
footp
rint on the planet. Last month, we announced that all DASANI and 
Odwalla single
-
serve bottles in the United States would now be available in 
our PlantBottle. In fact, Odwalla's new packaging is entirely composed of 
materials derived from sugarcane, making 
our company the first to develop 
and enter the market with 100% plant
-
based, fully recyclable package.
 
And this past February at the CAGNY conference, we announced a special 
partnership with Heinz to expand the use of our PlantBottle in the United 
States. 
We are pleased to see this technology adapted by other companies, 
as we believe that innovative collaboration and an open exchange between 
companies is more important today than ever, especially as it relates to the 
environment.
 
As we build for a better to
morrow, our efforts and performance are being 
recognized. This past quarter, we've been honored to receive several 
acknowledgments. Fortune Magazine ranked as #6 in their 2011 list of the 
World's Most Admired Companies, up from #10 in 2010. DiversityBusine
ss 
magazine placed us at #4 in their list of the top 50 organizations for 
multicultural business opportunities. And we received two Edison Awards, 
including a Silver Award in the Packaging category for our PlantBottle and a 
Gold Award in the New Retail Fro
ntiers category for our Freestyle fountain 
drink dispenser.
 
While all of us at the Coca
-
Cola Company are proud of these achievements, 
we understand that they only represent a snapshot of where we are today 
rather than where we aspire to be tomorrow. It is 
our good fortune to 
steward an incredibly dynamic global commercial enterprise and a very 
special brand that will celebrate its 125th anniversary in just a couple of 
weeks on May 8. As we look towards the future, we do so against the 
backdrop of a global e
conomy that is still rebalancing. So there is no 
question that we are all experiencing a complex global geopolitical climate. 
Yet, this complexity and the challenges they raise also bring real 
opportunities and exciting growth prospects.
 
In fact, since day
 
one of our 2020 Vision's guiding principles has been that 
our system has only just begun to achieve its potential. As we look forward, 
the opportunities before us are clearly abundant, a billion people entering 
the middle class in the next decade, the cor
responding political economic 
and social rise of the emergent world and an unparalleled expansion of 
cities, personal mobility, technology and education.
 
Today, we live in a paradoxical world of remarkable promise and great 
challenges. Yet, together with o
ur bottling partners, we've been preparing 
for this world, aligning our system behind the strategies and priorities called 
in our 2020 Vision. This strong alignment has not only helped us navigate 
recent storms, it has put us in a position of real strength
. The growing 
strength of our brands and our consistent operating and financial 
performance are proof positive of how we are steadily and strategically 
advancing our global momentum. That is why, as we look ahead to 2020 and 
beyond, we are confident that o
ur system is well positioned to meet and 
exceed our long
-
term targets and to usher in a new era of winning for all of 
our shareholders. With that, I'd now like to turn the call over to Gary.
 
Gary Fayard
 
Thanks, Muhtar. Good morning, everyone.
 
As Muhtar sha
red, we're off to a good start this year, advancing our 
momentum with 6% worldwide volume growth and the delivery of another 
quarter of consistent quality growth in line with our expectations. We feel 
particularly good about these results since we delivere
d them while 
productively integrating our North America business and while navigating 
several unforeseen global events including the tragedy in Japan, the unrest 
in the Middle East and a volatile global commodity costs environment.
 
While, as expected, ther
e are many puts and takes to consider in reviewing 
our quarterly results, and I'll go through all of those, I want to affirm that 
except for Japan, we do not see any of these puts and takes changing our 
full year bottom line expectations. In fact, this qua
rter's good results are a 
testament to our global system's ability to execute our strategic plans in 
keeping with our 2020 Vision and long
-
term growth targets.
 
So let me start by reviewing our earnings results for the quarter. As outlined 
in our release, w
e reported comparable earnings per share of $0.86, up 7% 
versus the prior year and in line with our long
-
term growth targets. While 
this result came in $0.01 below consensus in many analyst models, it 
includes a $0.01 dilutive effect from the timing of mar
keting expenses as we 
are required to conform our newly acquired North American bottling business 
to the Coca
-
Cola Company's accounting policies.
 
Let me take a moment to explain what this accounting treatment means in 
plain English. As many of you know, we
 
apply something we call a sales 
curve accounting policy to our marketing expenses, which means we 
recognize marketing on a pennies
-
per
-
case basis. So, basically, the same 
pennies
-
per
-
case of marketing for the full year as we spread the marketing 
across th
e year. For example, when we sponsor and activate an event like 
the recent NCAA March Madness basketball tournament, rather than 
recognizing the entire costs of the sponsorship in the quarter, we recognize 
the costs over the full year in line with our esti
mated volume along with all 
the other marketing.
 
Once our 2011 quarterly business plans were finalized in the first quarter of 
this year, we began to apply the same accounting policy to marketing 
expenses associated with our newly acquired North American b
usiness. The 
application of this sales curve accounting policy pulled incremental 
marketing expenses into the first quarter results, diluting our comparable 
first quarter 2011 earnings per share by $0.01. As we couldn't tell you about 
this accounting adjus
tment until we finalized our quarterly business plan 
spreads, we realize out that many of you do not have this accounting 
reflected in your model. As you consider how to model this adjustment going 
forward, please note that this sales curve dilution will r
everse itself in the 
fourth quarter of this year.
 
Our first quarter results also reflect the effect of the recent tragic events in 
Japan on our business. As Muhtar mentioned earlier, we finished the quarter 
in Japan up 1%. But prior to the March 11 earthqu
ake and tsunami, our 
business was actually on track to deliver quarterly volume growth of 3% to 
4%. Although it is impossible to precisely calculate what might have 
happened, our best estimate is that recent events in Japan had a $0.01 
dilutive effect on o
ur first quarter's comparable earnings per share due to 
lost revenues primarily related to shifts in product packaging and channel 
mix.
 
Separately, we have identified a set of onetime items in Japan this quarter 
primarily related to bottler assistance and 
our $31 million Reconstruction 
Fund that totaled approximately $80 million dollars. These are duly reflected 
in our GAAP, non
-
GAAP tables and have no impact on our comparable 
results.
 
Finally, our very early estimate of how events in Japan may further infl
uence 
our full year results is that it could dilute the rest of our full year comparable 
earnings per share between $0.02 and $0.04. We expect the majority of this 
impact to fall in the third and fourth quarter. As Muhtar mentioned earlier, 
our Japan team 
is doing everything they can to restore our business in 
Japan. And going forward, I can assure you that we'll keep providing routine 
and all new on updates regarding our business in Japan.
 
We also expect that many of you have questions regarding our update
d 
currency and commodity outlook especially as both continue to move in 
today's volatile marketplace. Let me start with currencies.
 
Since our last earnings call in February, we've seen a higher benefit than 
expected from currency. Considering both our hedg
ed positions and current 
spot rates, we now believe that currencies will have a low to mid
-
single
-
digit 
positive benefit on our operating income on a full year basis. But before you 
flow this currency benefit through to our bottom line, please note that si
nce 
our last earnings call, we've also seen our total company commodity costs 
exposure for this year increase by approximately $250 million to $300 
million, primarily driven by continued rise in the price of PET. While PET is 
not a commodity that can be he
dged, we are actively pursuing and 
executing plans to mitigate and offset some of this increase, including the 
acceleration of several supply chain initiatives that would reduce our overall 
commodity exposure.
 
In addition, we are strategically 
leveraging our brand pack channel and 
pricing strategies where and when appropriate to further balance this 
exposure. For example, we recently announced our plans to raise prices on 
our refrigerated orange juice products in North America by 6% to 9% 
starti
ng in April. As a result and based on our current and best estimates, we 
expect our ongoing pricing and supply chain efforts as well as our improved 
currency benefits to have offset almost all of the $250 million to $300 million 
increase in 2011 commodity 
costs exposure over the course of this year.
 
And please note that we are continuing to actively hedge our commodity and 
currency exposures. This past quarter, we had net unrealized gains of $36 
million related to our hedging activities on commodities. Cons
istent with how 
we treated these gains in the fourth quarter of 2010, we elected to exclude 
the gains, which would have been a benefit of $0.01 per share to our 
comparable earnings results. For your reference, we have called out our net 
unrealized hedge ga
ins in the notes to our GAAP and non
-
GAAP schedule and 
will continue to do so in our future earnings reports.
 
Let me share one final note before we go in the details of our operating 
results. Now that we are integrating our North America business, it is 
op
erating as a single consolidated entity for financial reporting purposes. For 
example, pieces of our North America business, that used to operate in a 
concentrate model, are now operating as a finished goods model. In 
addition, we now have single sales tea
ms that sell of our products across 
customer accounts in a way that is no longer comparable to how our brands 
were sold prior to the Coca
-
Cola Enterprises North America transaction.
 
Integrating and changing the way we run our North America business is a 
ne
cessary step in order for us to release the synergies associated with this 
transaction. As a result, we are simply unable to separate out the results 
proportions of Coca
-
Cola Refreshments that used to be a part of CCE North 
America. This means that when re
viewing our North America and total 
company results, there will be several financial statement line items and 
calculations that will look different to you this quarter than they have in the 
past and will continue to look different through the balance of th
is year until 
we fully cycle the effects of the CCE transaction. To best help you 
understand our business and performance this year, we'll keep providing you 
with comparable currency neutral results consistent with how we've always 
communicated our results
. Having said that, we recognize that some line 
items are significantly altered due to the CCE transaction. In those cases, 
we'll supplement our financial results with additional commentary in order to 
always provide you with as complete a picture of our u
nderlying business 
performance as possible.
 
For the quarter, comparable operating income was up 10% including a 3% 
benefit from currency. Further, our business delivered comparable net 
revenue growth of 40% benefiting from a 4% increase in concentrate sale
s, 
a 2% currency benefit, positive price mix and a significant increase due to 
our recent CCE transaction.
 
This quarter's price mix calculation is an example of a calculation that looks 
different this quarter as a direct result of the CCE transaction. We 
u
nderstand that price mix is a key metric for understanding our results. We, 
therefore, estimated that our first quarter retail pricing in North America was 
positive between 1% and 2%. We can also confirm that our combined 
international and Bottling Investm
ent Group price mix was up 2% this 
quarter. So based on this, our total company price mix was positive this 
quarter in line with our full year guidance and consistent with our long
-
term 
growth targets.
 
Looking at a few other line items, where those calcula
tions where influenced 
this quarter by the CCE transaction, comparable currency neutral gross profit 
growth of 30%, comparable currency neutral cost of goods sold rise by 53% 
and comparable currency neutral SG&A expenses increased by 49%. To 
better underst
and this quarter's SG&A, it's helpful to look at our consolidated 
results in pieces.
 
First as you would expect, North America's SG&A is clearly higher due to our 
acquisition of CCE's North America business and the application of the sales 
curve accounting 
policy to our marketing expenses resulting in unfavorable 
operating expense leverage. This increase in SG&A will remain through the 
year until we fully cycle that acquisition.
 
Second, our Bottling Investment Group's SG&A was up 5% on a comparable 
currency 
neutral basis, excluding structural change such as Norway and 
Sweden. This is to be expected as we make strategic investments to further 
expand our production and sales capabilities in key growth markets in line 
with the guidance provided in our last call.
 
Third, our international operating segment's SG&A was slightly up this 
quarter due to an increase in our direct marketing expenses as we remain 
committed to investing in our brands for long
-
term growth.
 
Taking these increases in SG&A in consideration and 
considering the dilutive 
effect recent events in Japan may have had on our full year gross profit, we 
now anticipate our company's operating expense leverage to be even for the 
full year. Similarly and not surprising, our gross margins for this quarter 
wer
e also influenced by the inclusion of the CCE transaction that results as 
North America becomes a larger portion of our consolidated gross margins. 
It's important to note, however, that both our international operations and 
our Bottling Investments Group s
aw positive comparable currency neutral 
gross margin growth in the quarter after excluding structural items.
 
Finally this quarter, our cash flow from operations was $458 million. Part of 
this is attributable to the inclusion of CCE's North America business
 
in our 
results, as these operations have traditionally required increased levels of 
working capital in the first quarter. In addition, please note that this cash 
flow result is net of $769 million in contributions made to our pension plans 
as part of our 
previously announced 2011 contribution schedule. For the full 
year 2011, we plan to contribute about $800 million. So pretty much all of it 
already contributed in the quarter.
 
Now let me take a moment to update our view on a few other items related 
to our 
2011 outlook. Our productivity initiatives are well on track and will 
deliver $500 million in annual savings by the end of this year as per our 
original plan. As for synergies related to the CCE transaction, we can 
reaffirm our commitment to capture betwee
n $140 million and $150 million 
of net cost synergies in 2011. With regard to our share repurchase program, 
we've been active in the marketplace and are well on track to achieve at 
least $2 billion and $2.5 billion in share repurchases over the course of t
he 
full year.
 
As for equity income, we recently sold our ownership stake in Embonor and, 
thus, will no longer recognize equity income from Embonor results. Looking 
forward, equity income will also be affected by the proposed merger 
between the Embotellador
as Arca and Grupo Continental in Mexico. If and 
when this deal is approved and completed, our ownership in the new 
company would be reduced so that we would no longer apply the equity 
method of accounting to the resulting entity. So our best estimate there
, 
when you consider the sale of our ownership stake of Embonor as well as the 
expected change in accounting resulting from the proposed Arca
-
Continental 
merger, our company's equity income would decrease by approximately 
$0.01 on a full year basis. Finally
 
with respect to our tax rate, our underlying 
effective rate stands at 24%, in line with the full year estimate range of 
between 23.5% and 24.5% provided in our last call.
 
In closing, we are greatly encouraged to see our business deliver another 
quarter of
 
solid volume revenue and profit results. Our seasoned 
management team and our highly capable global bottling partners are 
clearly taking the right actions and executing the right strategies to advance 
our global momentum and drive our 2020 Vision. We rema
in confident that 
we'll keep winning in the marketplace, enhancing the health of our brands 
and driving long
-
term sustainable growth and value for our shareholders. 
Operator, we are now ready for questions.

from Crédit Suisse.

Can you shed some light on the drivers that sustain this momentum going 
into the second half? But I think if you could please direct a port
ion of your 
answer to the Bottler Investment Group [Bottling Investment Group] 
performance I think specifically, we'd like to hear if you can expand on 
China? How important is Pulpy to the relative mix there now as it continues 
to grow? In India, what driv
ers sustain the growth in the second half? And in 
the Philippines, you always seem to use these macro downturns or these 
economic periods of difficulty to reset the business in your favor. How do 
you modify the Philippine plan to win in this inflationary e
nvironment?
 
Muhtar Kent
 
This is Muhtar. Let me just start. I think what you saw in the first quarter 
global 
--
 
huge global geopolitical challenges, natural disasters. And I'm very 
pleased, I can say, that we have delivered consistent quality growth across 
all 5 of the geographic operating groups. That gives me confidence about 
going into the year. We're winning with our global sparkling beverage 
portfolio. Brand Coke, again, grew an impressive 3% in the quarter, in 
addition, Fanta, which is our fourth globa
l brand, passing the $10 billion 
retail value. So with growth in all 5 geographic operating groups, excluding 
our cross
-
licensed brands of 6% internationally, and if you look at 
--
 
it's 
important to look at what we're cycling each quarter. We are consisten
tly 
delivering volume growth in line with our long
-
term targets or above. And 
what you see from an international perspective is Q1 of 2010, we're cycling 
5%. So we're actually increasing the momentum. Last quarter of 2010, Q4 
was 5% international. We're, a
gain, accelerating that growth in the midst of 
huge economic, political and natural challenges. So I think that gives us 
confidence as we go into the year. And, again, when you look at our U.S. 
business delivering again the fourth consecutive quarter, we'r
e investing. As 
we do this, our brands are now getting healthier. Our share results, market 
share and value share, volume and value share results in this past quarter 
are the best we've seen in a long time. And in fact, we have a chart that 
shows by catego
ry, by region, share. Except for 1 metric on that chart, 
everything is green this past quarter, which we haven't seen it like that for a 
very long time. So again, India and China, you've referenced, I think, China 
as we 
--
 
Q1 sparkling gained volume share.
 
Q1 still gained volume and value 
share, and sparkling beverage share, as I mentioned in the call in my 
remarks, is now at the highest level we've seen in over 2 years. And we're 
making some proactive changes to our packaging architecture in China. Our 
bot
tlers are investing. When you look at the investment plan that we 
announced back in 2009, we are ahead of that with $2 billion from '09, '10 
'and '11. The 3 plants that we opened last year have all come 
--
 
are all 
contributing to being a part of the commun
ities that they serve. And that 
India, again, we took a sizable price increase in Q1 and held with it in Q1 in 
2011 and chose to maintain it in the face of aggressive discounting from 
various factions. And again, we delivered very impressive results with b
rand 
Coke growing, Sprite growing, thumbs up we're growing in a very healthy 
manner as well as our still portfolio led by Maaza growing. So, overall, that 
gives me confidence when I see our brands. And just last point in China, 
Pulpy was up, again, almost 
30%, and then you asked about the Philippines. 
I think Philippines post
-
elections have been a very challenging environment 
after the heat 
--
 
the economy was heated artificially pre
-
elections, and what 
we're doing is making sure that our business stays heal
thy. We invest in our 
brands in the Philippines. Our brand metrics are getting stronger in the 
Philippines. And Philippines in this quarter was down in volume, but we 
believe that we are doing the right things in the Philippines to win in the long 
term. An
d as far as the Bottling Investment Group is concerned, if you 
actually take out the structural elements related to Sweden, Norway and so 
forth, actually it was up 3%, just similar to the same period prior year. So 
we're happy with the healthy performance 
also of BIG. Germany, as you can 
see, is beginning to look like really a turnaround story, again, another 
quarter of healthy growth and gaining share in Germany against all the 
challenges that we have with the marketplace there in Germany as it relates 
to 
discounts or so. We are winning, again, in all channels in Germany now, 
and it's beginning to look like a very positive story. So that's what I would 
like to sort of frame up. I don't know if I missed anything, but that's how I 
frame your question, Carlos.

Our next question comes from Mark Swartzberg from Stifel, Nicolaus.
 
Mark Swartzberg 
-
 
Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.
 
I wanted to probe a little bit more. If we could ask for more visibility on wh
at 
is going on with Germany. That 4% number is a good number. Can you talk 
about 2 things, Muhtar? #1, what you think is driving that, the role of 
spending in that? And then #2 as we think about your gross margin outlook 
for Germany, you've got, potentiall
y, the benefit of some volume leverage, 
potentially, the benefit of mix. Potentially, some positives there in the GM 
side. But, of course, commodities are a challenge. So how are you thinking 
about the gross margin outlook for Germany as well at the bottli
ng level.
 
Muhtar Kent
 
I think first as you see, all restructuring that we've been involved in for the 
past 36 months in Germany is beginning to pay out as volume grows in that 
restructured and more productive infrastructure that we have both in terms 
of 
production, as well as distribution, as well as warehousing in Germany. 
And then with strong brands, when you look at brand Coke, again, in 
Germany, which was actually up 4% supported by very strong marketing, 
and then some other brands, Sprite, a very hea
lthy growth, up almost 7%, 
very good brand portfolio metrics in Germany. And, also, still beverages 
doing very well like Nestea in Germany. So, overall, I would say that gross 
margins, we don't give forward
-
looking outlook. But I'd to say that we're 
please
d with the improvements we're seeing across our margins in 
Germany, particularly as the benefits of the restructuring are beginning to 
come alive, as the volume is beginning to pick up in multiple channels in 
Germany. And then also, I'd like to stress all 
the work that is being done by 
our Bottling Investments Group under the leadership of Damian in Germany 
is also beginning to show in the immediate consumption transactions in 
Germany.
 
Gary Fayard
 
Mark, it's Gary. One other thing to recognize as well is tha
t when you 
referenced commodity costs versus Germany, remember that all of those 
--
 
most of all of those commodities are priced in dollars. And I was talking 
about in the prepared remarks, there is an inter
-
relationship to a large 
extent between commoditie
s and currency. And so in Germany, with the 
strength of the euro, is offsetting some of the costs of commodities as well. 
So you get different views on commodity costs if you look at different 
countries.
 
Muhtar Kent
 
And one last thing, Mark, please note th
at this is the highest absolute unit 
case volume sales in Germany we've seen in a decade. And the way the 
bottling business works if you look at this restructured, more productive, 
leaner system that we have in place after the hard work of the last 36 
mont
hs and as you sort of model increase in volume, that translates into 
better margins.

up there. Muhtar, the role of 
package mix in the bottling operations, you mentione
d immediate 
consumption. But how impactful, how beneficial is package mix affecting the 
bottling ops there.
 
Muhtar Kent
 
Are you talking about Germany or...

Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.
 
Germany specifically, yes.
 
Muhtar Kent
 
I think the on
ly way that we have begun to win with discounters is through a 
very decisive and very novel and innovative packaging strategy. So you've 
seen us employ a very innovative packaging strategy in order to be able to 
be represented with all our brands and also 
the discounted channels.

Gary, thanks on the detailed exp
lanation from the puts and takes on the 
quarter. A couple of other points I just wanted to clarify. With the 7% 
operating profit growth in the quarter, currency neutral, you mentioned the 
commodity hedged timing, the market spend timing, we also have the 
E
aster shift and 1 less shipping day. So trying to best understand your 
underlying operating profit growth, do you view it as high single digits when 
you account for those other puts and takes?
 
Gary Fayard
 
Yes, Bill. In fact, this is one of the difficulties
 
as you know, it's 
--
 
let's say 
--
 
1 less shipping day, the Easter shift, et cetera. You're now into estimates of 
what might it have been and those kinds of things, which is why I did not try 
to actually quantify those. But there are couple of things we kn
ow we can 
quantify. If you put the impact 
--
 
if our best estimate is that the impact of 
Japan is $0.01. The impact of the sales curve on CCR in North America is 
$0.01 and that wouldn't just reverse this Q1 in Q4. But if you just put those 
things together, 
right there, that's 2 to 3 points on OI growth, just those 2 
things. And then the hedges that we took, the commodity hedge gains, 
that's another $36 million, another $0.01. We took those out. Those will go 
back in kind of primarily third quarter
-
ish timing
. But that's another 1.5 
points of growth on OI. So that's why we feel comfortable. I mean, it's a 
dynamic world out there. But we feel comfortable with all the puts and 
takes. There's some real bad things like the tragedy in Japan. There's some 
good thing
s where we've made some decisions to change accounting 
policies, and it's a Q1, Q4 quarterly thing. It doesn't impact the year at all, 
but we just think it's the right way to go.
 
Muhtar Kent
 
And one other thing to add, Bill, also, you have to see that we a
re continuing 
to aggressively invest in our brands. And that is something, so in the quarter 
you will see 
--
 
you will have seen continued growth in direct marketing and 
marketing expenses. And again, that is something that we are very adamant 
to continue d
espite all the different challenges of commodities and other 
things that are happening around the world.

Great. And, Gary, on the Easter shift, the reason it's also more complicated 
now into the timing shift
 
but now with the accounting of CCE, the 
concentrate was booked in the Q1 last year and now shifted into Q2 this 
year. It's booked along with the bottler case sales. So that was also a 
complication, how to model the timing on that, correct?
 
Gary Fayard
 
You
're exactly right. And, in fact, Bill, I was sitting with some of my finance 
people yesterday and we were going through exactly that and going through 
what do we think the impact of the Easter shift was because we're actually 
starting to focus, as you migh
t imagine, on quarter 2. And then we got into, 
Okay, so what does this shift in July 4 do? And what days do they fall in the 
week? If it turns out July 4 is a Monday, if you look. And so that's part of as 
we're kind of looking. But you do have 
--
 
you're ac
tually right. You' have 
both impacts. You got the calendar impact. And then because of the 
acquisition, you've got the impact of when the revenue is actually recognized 
in the financial statements.

Our next question comes from John Faucher from JP Morgan.

JP Morgan Chase & Co
 
So I wanted to follow up a little bit on the North America price mix 
commentary, which you guys said, I guess in the call, you said 
1% to 2%. 
Can you talk a little bit about mix and how we should view mix now that the 
gap between full revenue cases and concentrate cases is different? I assume 
we're just going to see significantly less full revenue case mix, et cetera. And 
then as we lo
ok at the scanner data that we get, the pricing doesn't sort of 
flow with that. So can you talk a little bit about the price pack architecture 
and sort of how we should look at changes sort of package versus package 
versus different packages coming through
 
and also some of the channel 
differentials right now?
 
Muhtar Kent
 
John, I think, first what I would like to state is that in North America, 
particularly in the U.S., sparkling IC transactions, again, grew this past 
quarter. That's the second quarter in a 
row. And prior to this, you'd need to 
note that transactions had declined every quarter dating back all the way to 
2007. So that's something that, again, we're focusing on very heavily to 
continue to drive transaction. So, I think, in regards to transactio
ns overall, 
we grew IC package volume a good 2%, which would translate to overall 
transaction growth for the portfolio. So that is very positive and that 
somewhat compensates also for the price of the increases that had been 
referenced as 1% to 2% in the l
ast call. What I'd like to, also, frame for the 
remainder of the year, though, is that we will be looking at every 
opportunity, every opportunity in North America to see if we can generate a 
higher price than the overall 1% to 2% and more like, maybe, 3% t
o 4%, as 
we look into the balance of the year. And we believe that our brand strength 
will allow us to generate a higher price increase than the 1% to 2%. And, at 
the same time, we will be diligently, again, putting all our efforts to grow IC 
transactions 
in the United States. And recognizing that higher price increase 
may have some volume impact, but driving transactions will be the key in 
North America. And I don't know if Gary would like to add to your other 
question that is related to the revenue realiz
ation given that the business is 
now operating as one integrated business. One other thing I'd like to add is 
that, again, the 16
-
ounce package was up double digits again in the quarter, 
which is giving us, again, goods metrics for the future.
 
Gary Fayard
 
John, Gary. Just a couple of things on North America that I want to focus on 
and reemphasize one thing that Muhtar just said as well. When we look at it, 
we took different pricing percentages on different packages and different 
channels, obviously, as you 
would expect in North America. But the 
weighted average of all of that is in the 1% to 2% range. That's announced. 
That's in the market, and we're getting that. So we have to kind of look at 
the scanner data that you're referring to because a lot of 
--
 
rem
ember that 
Nielsen and ROI only covers about, I think, about 40% of the U.S., our U.S. 
market, that there's so much that, that's not in Nielsen and ROI. So that's 
the large part out of it. But then, as Muhtar says, we're going to look at 
additional pricing
 
this year in the U.S. as well. Now with that said, I want to 
emphasize something else he was talking about, which is on driving, on 
transactions. And we've all talked volume for years and years, but 
transactions is really about creating health for the bra
nd, wealth and really 
drives sustainable long
-
term value, we think, for the brand. And you saw us 
downsize packages in North America going to the 14
-
 
and 16
-
ounce and the 
reason to do that was to drive transactions and recruit and rerecruit users of 
our br
ands. You will see us doing the same kinds of things of downsizing in 
other countries as well. So that is going to have an impact on volume 
results, But, if you will, help drive transactions and could be an implicit kind 
of price increase as well, where yo
u downsize a package but hold the price 
and can get pricing as well. And you'll see us doing that in different markets 
around the world as we talked about it. So, all in all, I think you're seeing 
some actions that we're taking that we think will prove goo
d long term for 
the health of brands as well as build value for the company as well.

Our next question comes from Caroline Levy with CLSA.

I wonder if you could address 2 things. I mean in order to cover the 
commodity costs pressures, I'm assuming there, you mainly feel them in 
North America and in the Bottling Group. How much pricing would be 
required to fully offset that, if you did not have anything else to work with in 
terms of cost cuts? And then I'm just wondering if you could tell us a little 
bit more about how things are operating in Japan and where the earnings 
drag might be? Is it a mi
x shift? Is it that you need to give away product? Is 
it the cost of doing business? Just a little more insight into Japan.
 
Muhtar Kent
 
As far as commodity, Gary signaled some levels of commodities, the updates 
in terms of the additional commodity pressure
s that are coming into our 
business. Yes, you were right in saying and looking at the fact that, as far as 
commodities impact for our business is concerned, it's mainly North America 
and BIG. But we look at this holistically across the world from a system 
point 
of view, and there's some hedges in place. There puts and takes. So it's not 
just a simple equation, here's the number and how much price increase 
would you need. All we can signal is that as, obviously, you mentioned 
--
 
you heard me talk about 
--
 
I 
mean it's consumption, this is growing. That is 
a big benefit, when you have 
--
 
because those packages have a higher 
margin. They have a higher price. And as the mix shifts in favor of 
immediate consumption, then, obviously, we get the benefit and a windfa
ll, 
and we don't have to go out and take pricing across all categories, all 
channel. That's the way we kind of think about our business. You heard me, 
again, in my comments talk about the new packages coming on stream in 
China. You see us doing the same th
ing in the Philippines, across the whole 
world, Germany many new packages. So I think we're employing a much 
more flexible, fast, nimble brand
-
priced pack channel architecture that is 
designed to ensure that we don't have to take across
-
the
-
board pricing. 
And 
that's why this business of ours actually performs so well across the world in 
such troubling macroeconomic 
--
 
in such a troubling microeconomic 
environment. And also by the way, if there isn't going to be an inflationary 
period coming, that will benef
it us overall as a business, as a system, as a 
structure, as a category. So I think all of that bodes well for how we look at 
the future. I think the other part of the question was related to Japan. And 
I'd like to just stay in Japan, that I said that all 
the plants that are in the 
impacted area, 8 plants are back up and running. Really if you're talking 
about somewhat of a shift in channels, I think the vending channel, 
obviously, because a lot of factories were not able to operate fully in Japan. 
So there
 
is a shift in channel, there is a shift in the business. That's going to 
have some impact. And then, overall, I think supply chain is still stressed in 
Japan in terms of being able to supply the market, in terms of being able to 
empty out the warehouses, 
in terms of being able to distribute effectively. 
All of that will be part of the numbers that Gary mentioned as far as the full 
year impact in Japan is concerned. However, let me just stress this. Just 
prior to the earthquake, our business was up 4% in th
e quarter in Japan 
until the earthquake hit. So we were having very good positive momentum 
on top of a good year last year with our brands, with our portfolio, all 4 
cylinders of our Japan business firing well. And therefore, one fundamental 
of the busines
s is really the brand health. And given 
--
 
and our bottlers are 
investing again and are very eager and have done fantastic work in 
normalizing the business in Japan. So, overall, I think Gary mentioned the 
sort of scope of what may be the impact, and we'll
 
try to mitigate everything 
we can. And I think Gary just wants to add something to that.
 
Gary Fayard
 
Caroline, I would just add a couple of things and just a little more detail to 
what Muhtar has told you. All the plants are back up and running. But we've
 
got 
--
 
the bottlers have a lot of large automated warehouses, and those are 
not all back up and running. And so we still have supply chain issues in the 
country. Additionally, not only do you have channel mix issues as Muhtar 
referenced, you've got in shi
fts in product mix as well. But probably and 
most importantly, and this is where you will see a lot of the impact come 
through as well, what would normally be happening today is that the bottlers 
would be just running plants full bore, kind of building fin
ished stock 
inventory for the summer selling season. We're not able to do that. And so 
what's going to happen is beginning about third quarter, and this is why I 
was referencing the impact of really the third and fourth quarter, is that 
we're not going to 
be able to supply all the demands, as we believe, because 
we're not going to be able to manage and build up inventory stocks ahead of 
time as you normally would in a normal year. So that's 
--
 
well, we think we 
saw an impact in the first quarter that will p
robably rebound a little bit in the 
second quarter just around concentrate shipments, and then it's going to 
reverse back in the third and fourth quarter is kind of what we think is going 
to happen.

Our next question comes from Dara Mohsenian from Morgan Stanley.
 
Dara Mohsenian

Morgan Stanley
 
So I have just 1 point of clarification, Gary. The 
pricing environment 
potentially improving in North America in the balance of the year, is that 
more in the sparkling side of the portfolio or more in the still side? And I 
assume the more robust expectation is due more to less price increases as 
opposed to
 
mix, is that correct?
 
Gary Fayard
 
Well, couple of things I would say it's going to be 
--
 
it would be balanced 
and if we took you through our pricing architecture in North America. It's 
actually not 
--
 
it's actually pretty complicated. I was going to say n
ot as 
simple as you would think it would be because you, basically, got different 
pricing on different packages, on different brands by channel, and so you're 
going 
--
 
you've got different elasticities of demand by package. So you're 
going to implement dif
ferent pricing for those different SKUs at about by 
channel. But we are expecting to see, we have talked about 1% to 2% 
pricing in North America. We're now saying that we're going to probably be 
going for more pricing than that this year, and a lot of that
 
is just strictly the 
environment that we're in. So that's the way we would see it right now.
 
Dara Mohsenian

Morgan Stanley
 
That's helpful. Just taking a step back and looking in North American 
margins longer
-
term, obviously, this year they'll be hurt by
 
the bottler 
consolidation and some of the commodity inflation.
 
Gary Fayard
 
Yes.
 
Dara Mohsenian 
-
 
Morgan Stanley
 
But I was hoping you could highlight for us conceptually the longer
-
term 
opportunity you have beyond 2011 in terms of expanding your North 
Amer
ican margins given they're still below some of your other regions and 
what are the key drivers of that would be.
 
Muhtar Kent
 
The key of the drivers are going to be IC pushing really making sure that we 
win every transaction, growing transactions, growing t
he immediate 
consumption channel. There's so much work to be done, still opportunities to 
be had in the immediate consumption channel in the independent stores, in 
merchandising, in making our products much more desired and making and 
creating inspiration 
at the point of sale in those IC channel, just like what, in 
a way, you saw us do in Philadelphia, and I think CCR and their state of 
leadership has got the right organization. We've got the right investments in 
place. And then we have our brands are healt
hy. That all that translate, if we 
execute well, which we intend to do, then you will see us expanding margins 
as IC business grows and as our smaller packs take more attraction inside 
the 4 walls of our every single customer which we serve.

Muhtar Kent
 
Thank you, Jackson and good morning, everyone. Before we review this 
quarter's operating results, I would like to take a moment 
to acknowledge 
the senseless events that took place in Boston yesterday. We were deeply 
saddened by this news and our thoughts and prayers are with those affected 
by this horrible tragedy.
 
Now turning to this quarter's results. We are pleased with our firs
t quarter 
performance. The great women and men of The Coca Cola Company, Coca 
Cola system delivered solid performance results in line with our 
expectations. On a global basis, we once again gained value share. We have 
now gained global value share in nonal
coholic ready
-
to
-
drink beverages for 
23 consecutive quarters.
 
In spite of a challenging global economic times of the last few years, our 
people and our system bottling partners are executing the right strategies to 
advance us further towards our 2020 visio
n. Since the launch of our 2020 
vision at the beginning of 2010, we have increased daily servings by more 
than 225 million, we have lifted global volume and value share to the 
highest levels since 2003, and more than $48 billion have been added to the 
Coca
-
Cola Company's market capitalization.
 
Across the system, we are continuing to invest together for a better 
tomorrow. In fact, we enter 2013 and the fourth year of our journey to 2020 
from a position of real strength clearly focused and well on track to re
ach 
our goals and objectives and our global bottling system is healthier than 
ever before.
 
The strength of our brands and the promise of sustainable growth are fueling 
our bottlers' efforts to become more efficient, improve capability and further 
strengthe
n execution. We are working closely with our bottling partners 
around the world to rapidly realize opportunities to execute with precision 
and to continue winning at the point of sale.
 
We are innovating and investing in the health of our brand, in our 
capa
bilities and in new opportunities for growth across the entire non
-
alcoholic ready
-
to
-
drink beverage landscape. We are leading the industry 
dialogue around obesity and strengthening the sparkling category by 
bringing forward new packaging choices, transpar
ency in labeling and new 
sweetener solutions while also championing energy balance and promoting 
physical activity.
 
We are working across the golden triangle of government, civil society and 
business to create real value and to make a lasting positive diff
erence. And 
more importantly, we continue to generate shareowner value.
 
To that end, in the first quarter of 2013, we grew worldwide volume by 4%, 
cycling 5% from prior year and once again captured global non
-
alcoholic 
ready
-
to
-
drink beverage value share w
ith volume and value share gains in 
core sparkling category.
 
Our global sparkling portfolio grew 3%, led by brand Coca
-
Cola growth of 
3%, while Fanta grew 6% and Sprite grew 5%. Sparkling brands contributed 
nearly two
-
thirds of our global volume growth.
 
Wo
rldwide still beverage volume grew 6% in the quarter, with growth across 
most still beverage categories, including ready
-
to
-
drink tea, juices and juice 
drinks as well as packaged water. These gains enabled us to capture global 
still beverage volume and val
ue share. And, immediate consumption volume 
also grew 3%, with growth across both, sparkling and still beverage.
 
As announced during our 2012 year
-
end earnings call, we implemented a 
new organizational structure effective January 1
st
 
of this year that incl
udes 
Coca
-
Cola Americas, which began 2013 by growing volume 3% and Coca
-
Cola International, which grew volume by 5%.
 
Moving now to operating groups, I will start with North America, where we 
remain resolutely focused on driving sustainable growth. We are p
leased to 
report that North America continued to build on three successive years of 
growth with 1% volume growth in the first quarter, resulting in volume and 
value share gains. We are winning by investing in our portfolio of preferred 
brands by executing 
with excellence at the point
-
of
-
sale and by creating 
efficiencies and synergies across our manufacturing sales and distribution 
networks.
 
Although sparkling volume was down by 1% in the quarter, we achieved 3% 
sparkling price mix reflecting our focus on va
lue creation. Importantly, brand 
Coca
-
Cola grew this quarter, aided by double
-
digit growth in both, mini cans 
and in our 1.25
-
liter package, underscoring the strength of our flagship 
brand and the success of our occasion
-
based package architecture. Coca
-
Co
la also extended its favorite brand lead to over two times its closest 
competitor in North America.
 
Sparkling beverages gained volume and value share as marketing and 
execution are enabling us to win in the marketplace. Still beverage volume 
grew 6% in the
 
quarter, cycling 6% from prior year. Our portfolio of still 
beverage brands has now captured volume and value share for 21 of the 
past 23 quarters.
 
Our key brands grew strong double digits and captured volume and value 
share of the ready
-
to
-
drink tea cate
gory. Growth was driven by Hones Tea 
at the premium end of the market, the ongoing rollout of Fuze which is now 
available in 70% of total U.S. supermarkets and continued Gold Peak 
growth. As you may know, we have built Gold Peak from scratch since 
launchin
g it in 2006. The brand has grown by double digits for 24 
consecutive quarters and is rapidly on its way to becoming a $1 billion 
brand.
 
Our juice and juice drink portfolio grew 3% in the quarter gaining volume 
and value share, simply was up 9% thanks to t
he addition of new flavors 
and the growth in Simply Single
-
Serve. Our Minute Maid trademark grew 4% 
due to the expansion of Minute Maid punches as well as gains in the light 
segment of the chilled juice drink category. North America water business 
grew 5% 
led by growth of DASANI which continues to maintain a price 
premium to its primary competitors. Smart water maintained its streak 
delivering its 20th consecutive quarter of double digit growth. Now, energy 
portfolio delivered its 11th consecutive quarter o
f volume growth and gained 
volume and value share.
 
As announced earlier today, we are taking a significant step towards our 
2020 vision by commencing the implementation of a 21st century beverage 
partnership model in the United States. The franchise system
 
has always 
been the strength of the Coca Cola business globally and today we are 
accelerating the transformation of our U.S. system in ways that will establish 
a clear path to help us achieve our 2020 vision.
 
In the coming months, we will be collaborating
 
with five of our bottling 
partners to implement a plan which will include the granting of exclusive 
territory rights and the sale of distribution assets with cold drink equipment. 
In the near term, production assets will remain with Coca Cola Refreshments
 
which will facilitate future implementation of a national product supply 
system. These actions are being taken ahead of our previously stated 
timeline. The result will be further progress towards a more agile, modern, 
customer focused franchise business m
odel unique to the United States.
 
We remain confident that we have the right strategies for North America and 
we are optimistic about the outlook for this important critical market despite 
the challenging competitive environment and 
macroeconomic backdrop. As 
today's results indicate, The Coca Cola Company's brand marketing, 
commercial execution and category leadership efforts are all working 
together to enable us to sustainably win at the point of sale.
 
Turning now to Latin America. 
We are building the business from a position 
of real strength having realized solid 4% volume growth in the quarter, 
cycling 5%. Sparkling beverages in Latin America grew 2% with brand Coca
-
Cola also up 2% enabling us to gain both volume and value share. S
till 
beverages across Latin America delivered double
-
digit growth, gaining 
volume and value share thanks to growth across the portfolio including 
double digit growth for both Del Valle juices and juice drinks as well as 
POWERADE.
 
In Mexico, brand Coca
-
Cola
 
growth combined with high single
-
digit growth of 
our still brands helped drive overall volume growth of 3% in the quarter 
enabling us to capture volume and value share of nonalcoholic ready
-
to
-
drink beverages.
 
In Brazil, where volume also grew 3%, brand C
oca
-
Cola delivered 2% 
growth while Fanta grew 8% and Del Valle delivered 15% growth enabling 
us to gain volume and value share in this important market.
 
The Latin Fanta business unit, which stretches from Equador to Belize and 
encompasses the Caribbean gre
w volume by double
-
digits and trademark 
Coca
-
Cola expanded its leadership growing high single digits through 
consumer relevant propositions that include increasing availability of our 
1.25 liter returnable glass bottle and expanding immediate consumption 
P
ET. We continue to see growth opportunities across Latin America which is 
the company's largest operating group in terms of unit case volume and 
where we have gained value share in 21 of the last 23 quarters.
 
Moving now to the Pacific group. We generated 3
% overall volume growth, 
cycling 9% from prior year, led by high single digit growth in brand Coca
-
Cola. At a country level, volume in China grew by 1%, cycling strong 9% 
growth. Sparkling beverages grew high single digits while the juice and juice 
drinks 
business grew by double
-
digits following the introduction of Minute 
Maid Pulpy PET and Minute Maid Pulpy Mango.
 
This growth was partially offset by a decline in water volume as we cycled 
strong water growth. These results reflect sequential improvements an
d are 
in line with expectations we shared during our year end call. Importantly, we 
believe that we will continue to realize sequential improvements through 
2013. At the same time, we also believe that it is going to take a period of 
time for consumption t
o return to the growth levels of previous years. 
Nevertheless, we had every confidence in the long
-
term resilience of our 
China business and we remain optimistic about our long
-
term opportunities 
to generate robust growth in this region over time.
 
In Japan
, volume growth was 1%, in line with expectations, cycling 3% 
growth from prior year. Sparkling growth was up mid single
-
digit led by 
trademark Coca
-
Cola, and in particular, Coca
-
Cola Zero up double digits 
driven by the successful Zero Limit national promo
tion.
 
Ayataka green tea and LOHAS water our newest $1 billion
-
dollar brand in 
Japan continued their double
-
digit growth and contributed to solid growth in 
the important convenience store channel.
 
Turning to India, which as a reminder we are now reporting w
ithin the Pacific 
group, we delivered high single
-
digit volume growth, cycling strong double
-
digit growth from last year and we gained volume and value share in 
sparkling while also increasing our pricing. Growth was led by brand Coca
-
Cola, which grew a st
rong 30% in the quarter. Thanks to a strong, robust 
integrated marketing and communications' campaign and strong in
-
market 
execution.
 
In the first quarter alone, we added over 250,000 incremental outlets in 
India as significant increased chilled availabili
ty for our brands. Our still 
beverages in India grew mid
-
single digits, cycling strong double
-
digit growth 
while gaining both volume and value share.
 
In concluding our update of the Pacific, I would also like to recognize our 
continued strong performance i
n two exciting markets, Thailand and South 
Korea. In Thailand, we are maintain double
-
digit volume growth while 
rapidly investing in additional two factories. We are working in close 
alignment with our local bottling partners to further expand our leadersh
ip 
position in this important market.
 
In South Korea, we are generating broad
-
based growth across a diverse 
portfolio of strong brands with sparkling beverages growing high
-
single 
digits in the quarter led by brand Coca
-
Cola up 11%.
 
Turning now to the Eura
sia and Africa group, we once again delivered 
double
-
digit volume growth, growing 15% while maintaining share. Brand 
Coca
-
Cola grew double digits bolstered by our award
-
winning Crazy for Good 
campaign. Fanta, Sprite and Coke Zero, all generated double
-
digi
t growth as 
well. Our still brand delivered double
-
digit growth led by Fuze Tea and the 
acquired volume related to the Aujan partnership.
 
Russia continued to deliver strong results, outpacing the non
-
alcoholic 
ready
-
to
-
drink beverage industry with high sin
gle
-
digit volume growth. 
Growth was led by sparkling beverages, where we gained share for the 
eighth consecutive quarter as brand Coca
-
Cola grew 15%. Our still beverage 
portfolio gained volume and value share and Dobry juice continue its double
-
digit expan
sion.
 
One highlight I would like to mentioned with regard to Russia, is our effort to 
deepen the emotional connection with the consumers by leveraging the 2014 
Winter Olympic Games in Sochi. Our sponsorship of these games and the 
Torch relay will combine t
he passion of the Olympics spirit and Coca
-
Cola in 
the minds of millions of Russians as the porch will pass through thousands of 
Russians house. In fact, our activation of the porch really is already driving 
real connections to our consumers as evidenced b
y the more than 77,000 
Torch bearer nominations we have received during our latest consumer 
promotion.
 
Turning to our Central Asia business unit, also continued a strong 
performance delivering double
-
digit growth in the quarter. Prior to 
concluding my upda
te on Eurasia and Africa, I would like to note that the 
Middle East and North Africa business unit was recently awarded the 
company's Woodruff Cup. This is our most prestigious operating award 
honoring the top performance business units in our worldwide bu
siness 
system. Among other important accomplishments, the Middle East and North 
Africa business unit achieve double
-
digit volume and operating income 
growth for 2012.
 
We celebrated an important milestone with our partners at Aujan this 
quarter, as we toast
ed the billionth can of Rani juice produced since the start 
of our partnership. Rani is the leading juice brand in the Middle East and a 
terrific compliment to our existing juices in Eurasia and Africa, including 
Turkey which gained volume and value share 
for 10th consecutive quarter.
 
Turning now to Europe. The economic environment clearly remains uncertain 
across this region as persistent high unemployment, coupled with severe 
austerity measures are weighing on consumer sentiment and consumer 
spending. In 
fact, Nielson's latest global survey of consumer confidence and 
spending intentions indicate the consumer confidence fell in 20 of the 29 
European markets in the fourth quarter of last year. Nevertheless our 
volume was even in the quarter cycling 1% growth
 
from prior year which is 
a significant sequential improvement from the fourth quarter of last year. 
We grew volume and value share in nonalcoholic beverages, both sparkling 
beverages across the region including key markets like France, Germany and 
Great B
ritain.
 
There were pockets of volume growth across Europe with Germany growing 
a healthy 3%, the Nordic countries showing improvement and Great Britain 
returning to growth while gaining share due to strong integrated marketing 
campaigns and solid execution
 
in the market place. For the near future, as 
European consumers remain cautious in their spending, we will keep 
investing for the long
-
term health of our business. These results from 
around the world underscore the laser focus that our system has on our 
s
trategic priorities as we advance further towards our 2020 vision.
 
Our five core strategic priorities are as follows. First, we must continue to 
grow sustainably and provide meaningful solutions that enhance the health 
and well
-
being of the communities we 
proudly serve. Second, we will win 
with Coca
-
Cola while actively promoting the brand and the category. Third, 
we must absolutely keep winning and executing with excellence at the point
-
of
-
sale. Fourth, we need to keep maximizing the value of our global 
bev
erage portfolio. Sixth, we will encourage and inspire our system and 
associates to deliver on our mission.
 
Looking back at the first quarter of 2013, we were also honored and 
humbled to receive several recognitions. We were again ranked number four 
on Fort
une's list of Most Admired Companies and named one of the Most 
Innovative Companies in the World by FastCompany.
 
Also one of the most meaningful recognitions for the Coca
-
Cola system came 
from Catalyst, the leading nonprofit organization with a mission to 
expand 
opportunities for women in business. We were honored to accept the 2013 
Catalyst Award in recognition of our global women initiative. This important 
initiative is focused on fuelling the advancement of women as dynamic 
leaders and entrepreneurs acro
ss the organization and also in communities 
throughout the world where we serve our customers and consumers.
 
Before moving on, I want to revisit a complex societal issue that touches us 
all, obesity. Beginning last year, The Coca
-
Cola Company took new step
s to 
give consumers even more choices in packet sizes, sweeteners and 
beverages, including more low and no calories production while also 
providing clear nutritional information and by supporting fitness programs. 
Coca
-
Cola has a rich heritage of being ass
ociated with exercise, sports and 
active lifestyle.
 
Today we are using our marketing expertise and community connections to 
inform consumers about energy balance and to inspire more people to get 
moving. We firmly believe the challenges of obesity are solv
able. The Coca
-
Cola system together with industry partners, NGOs and government is 
committed to being part of the solution.
 
In closing, I would like to reiterate that our brands are stronger than ever 
before. We delivered solid performance results this qua
rter in line with our 
expectations while continuing to gain global value share. Together, with our 
global system bottling partners, we are working diligently to unlock value, to 
execute with precision and to continue gaining volume and value share. We 
are 
leading the industry dialogue about obesity by bringing forward 
solutions, adding transparency to dialog around calories and championing 
energy dollars and physical activity.
 
We are generating value for our shareowners as evidenced by the recently 
announce
d 10% increase in our annual dividend, which is our 
51
st
 
consecutive annual dividend increase. Even so, we remain constructively 
discontent as we seek to make the most of the growth opportunities we 
continue to see around the globe.
 
Please note that we are
 
working each and every day to refresh the world, 
inspire moments of happiness and optimism, create value and make a 
meaningful difference in lives of our consumers, our customers and in the 
communities that we proudly serve.
 
With that, let me now turn 
the call over to Gary.
 
Gary Fayard
 
Thanks, Muhtar, and good morning everyone. We delivered solid results this 
quarter underscoring once again that our company and global system are 
well positioned to execute our strategic plans and alignment with our 2020 
vision. Achieving such consistent performance during a time of ongoing 
macroeconomic uncertainty is a real testament to the strength of our global 
system and the investments we continue to make for long
-
term sustainable 
growth.
 
Before we get into the finan
cial details of the quarter, let me remind you 
that we closed the sale of 51% of our bottling business in the Philippines to 
Coca
-
Cola FEMSA in January of this year and therefore we no longer are 
consolidating the Philippines results.
 
We anticipate that th
is transaction along with the previously announced, 
bottling merger in Brazil will have a 3% structural impact on our full year 
2013 net revenues, likewise our full year operating results should see a 1% 
structural impact. However, there should be a corres
ponding improvement 
to equity income, to our share of the results of these operations moving 
forward. As I shared in our 2012 year
-
end call, we do not expect these 
transactions to have a material impact on our 2013 earnings results.
 
Moving now to our first
 
quarter results, our comparable earnings per share 
were $0.46, up 5% versus the prior year quarter despite currency 
headwinds of approximately 4%. Our comparable currency
-
neutral operating 
income was up 5% despite the impact of two fewer selling days and 
the 
impact of certain structural items. Currency was a 3% headwind on top on 
comparable operating income.
 
Comparable currency neutral net revenue grew 1% and grew 2% after 
adjusting for the impact of structural items. After adjusting for the effects of 
two
 
fewer selling days in the quarter, unit case sales were in line with 
concentrate sales.
 
Price mix for the quarter was even, cycling 3% in the prior year quarter, and 
remember in the second quarter, we will also be cycling 3% price mix. 
However stated in o
ur last earnings call, we expect to earn low single
-
digit 
consolidated price mix for 2013, consistent with our long
-
term growth 
model. We continue executing our occasion
-
based brand, price package and 
channel strategies with precision around the world.
 
Our
 
comparable gross margin was 61.5%. This represents a slight 
improvement compared to the prior year, primarily due to the impact of 
geographic mix, the consolidation of the Philippines bottler and the impact of 
our foreign currency hedging program. We expe
ct the improvement in our 
gross margin to moderate over the remainder of the year due to a shift in 
geographic mix.
 
With regards to operating expense leverage, we achieved three points of 
favorable operating leverage in the quarter, despite the impact of t
wo fewer 
selling days at the end of was primarily due to the deconsolidation of the 
Philippines bottler as well as the benefit from a reversal of expenses related 
to some of our long
-
term incentive plans. This was partially offset by 
sustained strategic in
vestments in our brand building activities around the 
world.
 
As we have shared before, we continue to expect operating expense 
leverage to be even to slightly positive for the full year. As you model our 
2013 operating results and our corresponding expense
 
leverage, let me also 
remind everyone that the 2013 calendar will have one less day when 
compared to 2012 and based on our quarterly closing calendar, as I said, we 
had two less days this quarter when compared to the first quarter of 2012 
and our fourth q
uarter of 2013 will have one more day when compared to 
the fourth quarter of 2012.
 
Moving now to net interest income. We came in at $14 million of income in 
this quarter, ahead of our initial forecast. We now expect net interest will be 
event to slightly p
ositive for the remainder of the year.
 
Our underlying effective tax rate is 23.5%. We expect this rate to remain 
unchanged through 2014.
 
Cash flow from operations decreased 3% primarily due to the impact of the 
two fewer selling days in the period and unfa
vorable impact from currency 
and an increase in the use of working capital in preparation for the peak 
season of our growing global business. Looking ahead to the remainder of 
the year, we expect our cash flow growth rate to be more in line with our 
earnin
gs growth rate.
 
Turning to share repurchase. Our net share repurchases during the quarter 
totaled approximately $1.1 billion. This places us well on track to achieve the 
$3 billion to $3.5 billion range for full year 2013 that we communicate during 
our las
t earnings call.
 
As for currencies, we remain fully hedged on the Euro, Yen and Sterling for 
2013 and into 2014 and we also have near term coverage in place with 
several other currencies. After considering the hedged positions and current 
spot rates, we ex
pect currencies to be a 3% headwind for the second 
quarter and a 2% headwind for the full year.
 
As you have all seen the movement of Yen in recent months, as mentioned, 
we have hedged our Yen exposure for this year and into next year but we do 
believe that
 
the weaker Yen will ultimately be beneficial for the Japanese 
economy and for our business.
 
In closing, and as Muhtar shared earlier, we are delivering on our strategic 
priorities and achieving real success. We fully expect operating income to be 
in line 
with our long
-
term growth target for the full year. Our global system 
is committed to investing together for a better tomorrow and our proven 
ability to achieve consistent quality results provides us with a confidence 
that together, as a system, we will su
ccessfully crack the code to sustainable 
growth to meet our 2020 vision goals.
 
Operator, we are now ready for questions.
 
Question
-
and
-
Answer Session
 
Operator
 
(Operator Instructions) Your first question is from John Faucher with 
JPMorgan Chase. Mr. John, yo
u can continue with your question.
 
John Faucher 
-
 
JPMorgan Chase
 
Sorry, there is a lot of static. As you look at the bottler consolidation piece, 
is Spanish or Japanese bottler consolidation the beginning of the next wave 
of let's say a bottler
-
driven cons
olidation? And how much are you pushing 
this as opposed to letting the bottlers lead where the system is going?
 
Muhtar Kent
 
Hi, John, good morning. This is Muhtar. First, I think, its important to realize 
that there is not one model for the world. There is
 
many different models for 
the world. As you can see, what's happening. This has been an exciting last 
several months with respect to the evolution, actually continuous evolution 
of our franchise system. We manage our business to create sustainable 
long
-
te
rm value and evolution of our franchise system continues to play an 
absolutely critical role in that process.
 
So what you have seen recently, the Contal merger in Japan, the Brazil 
merger of three bottling partners creating a large Brazilian led bottling 
b
usiness, the Iberian merger of seven bottling partners in Iberia, the sale of 
the Philippines, of the majority shares of the Philippines and the control to 
FEMSA, and now the U.S. the process, the journey starting in the United 
States are all part of our v
ision, our plan and to ensure that we can continue 
to deliver on the commitments we made for our vision.
 
In some cases they use, partially, our capital. In some cases whether the 
sale of, obviously, we bring capital back into the Coca
-
Cola Company, but all
 
the time ensuring that our bottling business is fully suited with the needs of 
21
st
 
century delivering what is necessary ahead of consumer expectations, 
customer expectations and so not one
-
size
-
fits
-
all.
 
And in the case of the United States, again, we 
are pleased to report today 
that we have reached agreement in principle to start this journey. All along 
since the first day we've closed the transaction of the Coca
-
Cola 
Refreshments, I have always said there will be a meaningful role to invite 
partners b
ack into the business. When we were asked about the timing, 
we've always said around the four
-
to
-
five year timeframe from the time 
we've closed 
-
 
the close of Coca
-
Cola Refreshments was you will recall back 
in the latter part of 2010, and we are well withi
n that timeline and it's a 
continuous evolution and sometimes it will necessitate for us to use our own 
capital, sometimes the mix and sometimes no capital and again not one
-
size
-
fits
-
all. The U.S. model is a very different, but it is again a model that 
in
vites partners to serve with us passionately, the communities that we 
operate in.

Great. If I could just as a follow
-
up on that, which would be as you look at 
the different options you gave for the U.S. pieces here in terms of
 
sub
-
bottler agreements, asset sales, swaps, things like that, is there some way 
to think about the financial impact as you do this? I mean, this is a small 
piece of it. How long does this timeframe take out as you sort of push these 
U.S. pieces out? Thank
s.
 
Muhtar Kent
 
Yes. I think we can't comment on the timing for the end game but all I can 
tell you is that we are intent on creating the evolution necessary for us to be 
able to serve both, our large customers and small independent customers in 
the best po
ssible way with our bottling partners.
 
Again, we have always said right from the beginning and we are consistent 
to that that the U.S. will be slightly different. We want to create the best
-
in
-
class production, optimum cost production system coast
-
to
-
coast
 
from the 
east to the west. That will be nationally managed. We also want to create a 
national, we managed a larger customer, management system that will 
essentially have the responsibility to put together of 21st century customer 
plan with our large partn
ers in the United States, or at the same time invite 
partners to come in and be part of this new evolution in the United States.
 
It will take as long as it is necessary, and that is not our focus; it's going to 
be about doing the right thing as quickly as 
possible, as efficiently as 
possible and as effectively as possible and that's what we are going to be 
doing.

Hi, good morning. A question
 
for you, Gary, just on the on the operating 
leverage in the in the first quarter and maybe more specifically the gross 
margin. If I understood it right, this quarter would have been one of the 
highest in terms of the impact from commodity inflation and we
 
also really 
had no positive benefit from price mix. And as we kind of look out going 
forward, right? We should get some benefit from price mix later in the year 
and maybe you some relief on commodity inflation. So, why would not there 
be maybe more levera
ge going through the year than we originally expected 
given the leverage you had in the first quarter?
 
Gary Fayard
 
Yes, Bryan, thanks. There are a couple of things to consider. First is, as I 
mentioned previously in the prepared remarks, that we reversed s
ome 
compensation accruals in the first quarter. So that gave you more leverage 

-
time impact, if 
you will. So its more leveraged in the quarter.
 
The other significant piece is, the currencies had an
 
impact as well and 
currencies are moderate going out. But the biggest thing will be geographic 
mix. We would expect to see geographic mix changing throughout the year 
as we go through the year. As that happens, it will have an impact on gross 
margin and o
perating leverage.
 
Bryan Spillane 
-
 
Bank of America
 
So the geographic mix would be more negative going through the back half 
of the rest of the year?
 
Gary Fayard
 

expect North A
merica, actually, in the first quarter of this year, North 
America's operating income on a recurring comparable basis was down 3% 
and it is down 3% primarily because of two fewer selling days. So if you 
adjusted for those selling days it would have been po
sitive. But I would 
expect North America to actually improve versus where they were, minus 
3%, but as they improve because it's a finished products business, it is 
going to have a negative gross margin impact and there will be reduced 
leverage.
 
Bryan Spill
ane 
-
 
Bank of America
 
Okay, so more growth from lower margin geographies going forward and 
that will affect that margin impact?
 
Gary Fayard
 
That is what I was trying to say, more in code than the prepared remarks.

Good morning. I was hoping you can update on the competitive environment 
around the world both in China and Western Europe which have been 
hotspots recently. Also, just your thoughts around how you manage the 
pricing environment in the U.S. Sparkling busin
ess in 2013 and beyond in 
light of the moderate commodity pressure and if that solid 3% sparkling 
growth we saw in Q1 can continues in the balance of the year?
 
Muhtar Kent
 

quarters a
s far as the competitive environment is concerned. China remains 
a very competitive environment. Actually the whole world, and again this is 
a competitive environment that is the mix of large international companies 
but also very much local companies in As
ia, in parts of Africa, in the Middle 
East. We also see a somewhat more rational pricing,
-
particularly, in Europe 
as well as other parts of the world, in Latin America too. So the way we see 
the environment is it will continue to be challenged from a consu
mer 
perspective.
 
Whether you are talking about Asia coming back or whether you are talking 
about consumer sentiment in Europe will continue to be volatile and mixed 
at best, and therefore pricing is going to critical and therefore also ensuring 
leverage an
d ensuring productivity that can be generated out of operations 
for us to be able to continue to invest. It's going to be critical. But we are 
intent on continuing to invest in this environment. I will let Steve Cahillane 
talk a little bit about how we man
age the pricing environment in the United 
States (inaudible) Price mix, 3%, in terms of a leverage in pricing for 
sparkling beverages in the past quarter.
 
Steve Cahillane
 
Thanks, Muhtar. We have seen a rational pricing environment in the United 
States over
 
the course of a good period of time right now. We would expect 

look for us to reinvest that in price. We have worked very hard to earn the 
price that we take in the marketplace. W

problem in the United States with our sparkling beverages. We would love to 
continue to invest behind our brands.
 
We have got a terrific summer program for the Coca
-
Cola brand. We have 
got an exciting new partnership with Tayl
or Swift around Diet Coke. We will 
invest around activating those types of programs that continue to focus on 
one of our most important objective which is to continue to support, 
development and drive our sparkling category inside the United States 
busines

Good morning, everybody. I wanted to follow up on the U.S. filing 
announcement
. Onto the production assets for the territories the five 
bottlers picked up. Do you see these bottlers eventually contributing to 
manufacturing assets into a national production company to get at the cost 
savings opportunity that you talked about in the m
anufacturing side?
 
And also, would Coke be willing to let new partners bringing outside capital 
to help finance some of the additional territory sales given the size of the 
territory that Coke still holds onto in the U.S.? Thanks.
 
Muhtar Kent
 
Hi, Bill. Thi
s is Muhtar. Good morning. I'd say to you that this is again, we 
are at the beginning of this journey. We have reached agreement in principle 
with these five U.S. bottling partners. It is very important that we did reach 
that agreement in principle and now
 
we can actually ensure that we put all 
the details into motion and we can implement effectively.
 
We have always said production in the United States is critical to our success 
in achieving a optimum cost 21st century production system nationally 
manage, c
oast
-
to
-
coast. That is going to take place. We've also said that 
managing large, 30 or so of our largest customers in the United States as 
going to be done nationally. That's also going to take place.
 
In terms of who else would be coming in, can't comment 
on that in terms of 
what will happen and what form and architecture production is going to take 
place in terms of what our current bottlers own. I can't comment on that. All 
I can tell you and I can assure you that we are intent on ensuring that we 
make th
e necessary changes in the format and architecture production to 
achieve what I just said which is a coast
-
to
-
coast nationally run production 
system that generates the efficiencies, synergies, productivity that allow us 
to continue to win in the marketplac
e. And again, there may be a future 
where our partners in the United States take certain ownership in the 
national production.
 
I wouldn't rule that out also, but it will be managed nationally from one 
point, single point.

Your next question comes from Judy Hong of Goldman Sachs.
 
Judy Hong 
-
 
Goldman Sachs
 
Thanks. Good morning. I just had a couple of questions on North America. 
First, in terms of volume performance, I think the macro data poi
nts and 
consumer data points have been a little bit choppy more recently. So maybe 
if you can give us a little bit color just in terms of category of your 
performance, immediate consumptions versus take home, and so do the 
expectation as you get out into t
he back half of the year lapping up some of 
the transitory headwinds whether it's in payroll taxes or weather related if 
you expect volumes performance to improve?
 
Then, Gary, just on the profitability in North America, I know you talked 
about this a littl
e bit, but I look at first quarter, you had 1% volumes 
growth, 2% price mix and you did say profitability was up a little bit, but 
why aren't we seeing the profitability really improve more meaningfully and 
sort of what drives the sequential acceleration i
n North America profitability 
going forward?
 
Muhtar Kent
 
Okay. Judy, I'll have Steve answer the first part of your question before 
Gary comes in and sheds some light on the question on profitability. Steve?
 
Steve Cahillane
 
Yes. Thanks, Judy. First 
quarter clearly had a lot of a noise in it. We 
expected a benefit from Easter being in the first quarter. It's never as big a 
benefit when it comes that early in the year. Easter is always better when it 
comes later in April, because of the warmer weather,
 
but obviously you 
referenced the weather. We saw some very dramatic changes.
 
Last year, we benefited from one of the hottest winters, warmest winters in 
the United States, and we cycled that with one of the coldest winters in the 
United States. So, clearl
y, that had an effect and we saw any benefit from 
Easter really being washed away, if you like, by the poor weather. There was 
clearly an effect in the payroll tax. It's a little bit of art and science trying to 
pick apart what's weather and what's payroll
 
tax.
 
We would figure about two thirds is probably weather
-
related and one
-
third 
of the slowdown is based on the economy. We are go optimistic. Guardedly 
optimistic that the consumers are coming back. That the payroll tax and the 
economy is kind of a short
-
term need to get used to the discretionary impact 
that it has had. So we remain optimistic that we have got the right programs 
in place, that the economy is on the mend and we would expect continued 
good performance as we go out the next three quarters.
 
I
n terms of question of profitability, I will turn it over to Gary.
 
Gary Fayard
 
Judy, I would say a couple of things on profitability. Its really kind of 
repeating what Steve just said. If you take the first quarter and you throw in 
lousy weather, payroll t
ax, actually the price of gasoline, what then does to 
your immediate consumption versus future consumption business is going to 
have an impact on your profitability.
 
Now, if I go back to the answer I gave to Brian earlier though, when I saw 
that geographic
 
mix that is North America, I would expect North America to 
be improving actually from the first quarter and from where we were. Then 
North America also has this two fewer days.
 
Now, I can tell you, Steve has got a number from minus 3%. I say it would 
have
 
been positive. Steve has got a number but you can calculate it several 
different ways as to what would the impact of the two days be. We would all 
agree, I think, it is positive. They would have been positive as to operating 
income line. But you put all t
hat together, the weather, by the way is as 
lousy as it has been and the impact on Steve's business has been given a lot 
of moisture to the Midwest for the drought for the corn crop.
 
So they look for commodities and we will see what happens there. Payroll 
taxes, consumers hopefully are starting to get used to it. Gasoline prices, 
looks like they are starting to trend down somewhat. So I think there is 
some reason to be cautiously optimistic. CCR continues to execute with 
excellence and continue to improve c
apability. So I think the there are lots 
of reasons to be optimistic on North America.
 
Judy Hong 
-
 
Goldman Sachs
 
Okay, but from a profitability perspective, though, the bigger delta is really 
the mix shifting towards more immediate consumption as weather 
n
ormalizes? Or is there a step up in cost savings or timing of marketing 
investments that help the profitability?
 
Gary Fayard
 
Judy, I would actually say, the biggest impact on the first quarter North 
America was two less selling days by far, and the whole c
ompany as well. 
But by far, the biggest impact was the two selling days.
 
Judy Hong 
-
 
Goldman Sachs
 
Okay.
 
Steve Cahillane
 
Judy, I can answer this part of your question. The secondary impact is 
clearly weather impacted food service and immediate consumption 
more 
than the take home channel. So we would expect as weather moderates, 
those profitable parts of our business will start to normalize as well. But as 
Gary said, two less selling days when you got the fixed cost assets that we 
have in the North American 
business is really quite significant. Those extra 
two days are golden cases that are going out and when you lose those two 
days, it obviously has a big impact.

Your next question 
comes from Caroline Levy of CLSA.
 
Caroline Levy 
-
 
CLSA
 
Good morning, Muhtar, Gary and team. I would like to just understand, 
Muhtar, your vision, again going back to the United States. You talked a little 
bit about how manufacturing is going to evolve. A l
ittle bit of understanding 
the benefits of margin the operations of food service, your noncarbs and 
your CSCs into one production facility. Just can that actually be done and are 
there synergies there?
 
Then secondly, do you feel strongly that your own peop
le have to get the 
product to market from the plant or could you use a third
-
party, such as 
assister?
 
Muhtar Kent
 
Yes, Caroline, I think first in terms of our capability in our system in the 
United States is, I would say, the best in the consumer products 
world in 
terms of how we go to market and how we can get the product from 
production facilities. So I wouldn't like to comment on how we can improve 
that. If there is a way for us to even improve and generate more 
productivity we will certainly look at it.
 
I think the most important thing though is that there is room to generate 

the United States production system after three years of having integrated 
Coca
-
Cola 
Refreshments, it is where we needed to be and we need to 
continue on that roadmap to proceed towards a modern and best
-
in
-
class 
optimum cost production system coast
-
to
-
coast.
 
That will mean obviously a lot of changes, that will mean building new 
plants, th
at will mean combining some facilities, but I would like to also 
comment in terms of hot
-
fill and aseptic versus sparkling beverage plants, 
we will look at ensuring that we have the most modern, most productive 
facilities in place.
 
I don't believe the answ
er is to combine all under one roof. I think the 
answer is to combine many that are scattered across the country both, in 
terms of still and sparkling separately into some consolidation process and I 
can't comment any further. What I can tell you is that t
here is room for cost 
to come down, there is room for efficiencies to increase and we will achieve 
all of those.
 
This is all in line with our 2020 vision. We laid out a plan, when we took over 
the business of Coca
-
Cola Enterprises, we laid out a plan when 
I took over 
as the CEO back four and a half years ago and we are executing it 
meticulously and we are doing what we have said we would do and we are 
doing it ahead of time.
 
Caroline Levy 
-
 
CLSA
 
That's excellent. I was just wondering in terms of getting she
lf space, you 
see a big opportunity in up and down the street and to get better pricing 
much as you've done in Lat
-
Am. I'm often asked how you compete with all 
the new things that come in, be it, coconut water, energy drinks. I know you 
have some, but are 
you convinced you can keep or improve shelf space for 
your carbonated soft drinks?
 
Muhtar Kent
 
Absolutely. I think, we can improve service levels. I think, we can improve 
execution inside the point of sale. I think, we can improve availability. I 
think, we
 
can improve availability of cold drink. I think, we can improve how 
we serve independent, and all of those things are going to be played out as 
we implement and execute this new strategy in the United States. And, I 
don't know, Steve, do you want to comme
nt?
 
Steve Cahillane
 
No. I agree completely and part of what we are doing with this new bottler 
arrangement focuses on that up and down the street where bottlers and CCR 
add the most value which is not only big customer sales, but up and down 
the street exe
cution and we have got also our venturing and emerging 
brands unit which you are familiar with which brings brands like Zico coconut 
water. It brought Honest Tea.
 
So, in that, those spaces that you are talking about we are very much 
innovating, we've got g
laceau fruitwater which we just launched with great 
success a couple of weeks ago. That's being executed not only in the large 
stores, but importantly in the up and down the street foodservice, on
-
premise accounts as well, so we see that as a very importan
t capability. We 
see ourselves as having a competitive advantage there when it comes to not 
just shelf space, but cold drink space and overall availability.
 
Muhtar Kent
 
Yes. And just to finally add on to that point, Caroline, the rest assured we 
are in an 
mode of evolution, rapid evolution, not just in the United Sates, 
across the whole world, and you will see us adapting, reinventing, how we 
go to market, how we serve customers and also how we communicate with 
consumers, very importantly. Our brands are at
 
an all time high in terms of 
health and we will continue again to evolve and bring out the best modes of 
communications with our consumers as well.

el Nicolaus
 
Yes. Thanks, good morning, everyone. Also a question on the U.S. 
refranchising, Muhtar or Gary, you talk about this new beverage agreement 
being ultimately what's at Play here. Could you speak a little bit to how you 
are thinking about that and
 
the role of incidence
-
based pricing in that?
 
Is it right to think that continues to have prominence in this new agreement? 
Any distinction you might draw between how stills and carbonates are 
treated as you move production more squarely to staying, if you
 
will, at least 
for a little while inside Coca
-
Cola?
 
Muhtar Kent
 
Yes, I think Mark, we can't comment on the detail. What we can say is that it 
will be a model that will align us fully with our bottling partners to do what is 
right in the marketplace and to
 
focus on what is right in the marketplace, a 
full alignment model and I think I can't just comment any further than that 
but you will see us executing better, serving the customers better with a 
better production template, as well as a customer service te
mplate.
 
Mark Swartzberg

Stifel Nicolaus
 
Is it fair to think that other markets, there is a fact pattern and experience 
set to draw in as you implement this newer form of agreement here in the 
U.S.?
 
Muhtar Kent
 
I think all of that will come into play, bes
t practices, everywhere around the 
world. I am certain that in four or five years' time, many people will come 
into the United States to see the best practices as it used to be back in the 
1980s when I used to bring new bottlers from Eastern Europe to see 
best 
practices in the United States at that time.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to The Coca
-
Cola Company's 
Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2011 Earnings Results Conference Call. Today's 
call is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at 
this time. 
[Operator Instructions] I would like to remind everyone that the 
purpose of this conference is to talk with investors and, therefore, questions 
from the media will not be addressed. Media participants should contact 
Coca
-
Cola's Media Relations Department i
f they have questions. I would now 
like to introduce Jackson Kelly, Vice President and Investor Relations Officer. 
Mr. Kelly, you may begin.
 
Jackson Kelly
 
Good morning, and thank you for being with us today. I'm joined by Muhtar 
Kent, our Chairman and Chie
f Executive Officer; and Gary Fayard, our Chief 
Financial Officer. Following prepared remarks this morning, we'll turn the call 
over for your questions.
 
Before we begin though, I'd like to remind you that this conference call may 
contain forward
-
looking st
atements, including statements concerning long
-
term earnings objective and should be considered in conjunction with 
cautionary statements contained in our earnings release and in the 
company's most recent periodic SEC report.
 
In addition, I would also like
 
to note that we have posted schedules on our 
company website at www.thecoca
-

Financial Information tab in the Investors section, which reconciles certain 
non

y our 
senior executives in our discussions this morning, and from time
-
to
-
time in 
discussing our financial performance to our results as reported under 
generally accepted accounting principles. Please look on our website for this 
information.
 
Now I will tu
rn the call over to Muhtar.
 
Muhtar Kent
 
Thank you, Jackson, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'm pleased to 
share The Coca
-
Cola Company continues to operate from a position of real 
strength. Our brands continue to get stronger. Our strategies continue to
 
be 
sound, and our execution continues to be focused and effective. All of this 
continues to drive sustainable growth and continues to bring us closer to 
achieving our 2020 Vision. One day, one week, one month and one quarter 
at a time. Thanks to the extra
ordinary determination and resolve of our 
146,000 company associates around the world, we delivered volume and 
revenue growth this quarter in every one of our 5 geographic operating 
groups. And we achieved financial results for both the quarter and the ful
l 
year in line with or ahead of our long
-
term growth targets, making this the 
seventh consecutive quarter we have either met or exceeded our long
-
term 
growth targets.
 
Our global sparkling beverage portfolio kept growing, up 2% for the quarter 
and a solid 4
% for the full year. Our global still beverage portfolio is also 
performing well, up 6% for the quarter and a strong 8% for the full year. 
And we gained global volume and value share in nonalcoholic ready
-
to
-
drink 
beverages, while also gaining global share
 
in both sparkling and still 
beverage categories. We achieved these results for both the quarter and the 
full year against the backdrop of a volatile global economic landscape. Even 
as we believe that the unease in the global markets will continue in the n
ear 
term, the breadth of our global footprint and the strength of our brands 
create a business that was built for times like these, resilient and resolute to 
grow.
 
Our solid performance in 2011 reflects the consistent investments we have 
made over time to 
strengthen the health of our brands, starting with brand 
Coca
-
Cola, the very oxygen of our business, up 3% in both the quarter and 
the full year. In fact, brand Coca
-
Cola grew by at least 24 million servings in 
24 different countries this past quarter. Our
 
brand health and brand value 
have been created over the long
-
term through strong and consistent 
investments in our business, rather than through short
-
term incremental 
actions. And this is why we remain so committed to our long
-
term brand 
investment strat
egies. Our 2011 performance results underscore how our 
company, together with our global bottling partners, is well aligned and 
positioned to lead in this difficult environment.
 
As we enter into the third year of our 2020 Vision, our roadmap for winning 
to
gether remains clear to us and our committed bottling partners. The 
assumptions that shaped our vision have not changed. Our expectations for 
strong performance have not wavered. The key to our calculus for growth 
and achieving our 2020 Vision will be to e
nsure that we keep creating 
balanced growth across both emerging and developed markets, as well as 
sparkling and still categories.
 
We successfully achieved this balance in 2011. For the full year, we 
delivered almost 1 billion unit cases of incremental org
anic volume growth, 
or the equivalent of adding another Japan to our business. And importantly, 
we delivered positive full year growth in key developed markets like North 
America, Japan and Germany, while also generating double
-
digit full year 
growth in ke
y emerging markets like India and China. And we will continue 
to make significant investments in our future, all across the world.
 
In fact, in order to achieve our 2020 Vision, we anticipate our global system 
will add about 100,000 jobs in this decade as w
e invest to support the 
tremendous opportunity we see in nonalcoholic beverages, one of the 
fastest
-
growing industries in consumer packaged goods.
 
So let's review our fourth quarter and full year results. Worldwide, we grew 
volume 3% this quarter, in line 
with our long
-
term growth target. For the full 
year, we grew worldwide volume by 5%, including the benefit of cross
-
licensed brands, primarily Dr. Pepper in North America. Excluding these 
brands, we delivered strong full year volume growth of 4%, also in l
ine with 
our long
-
term target.
 
As for our profit results, we grew comparable earnings per share by 10% for 
both the quarter and the full year, ahead of our long
-
term target. As we 
close the second year of our 2020 Vision, this also marks the second 
consecu
tive year we've delivered double
-
digit comparable earnings per share 
growth.
 
Now let's briefly review performance results across our operating groups, 
beginning first with North America where our team remains focused on 
driving profitable and sustainable g
rowth. North America volume was up 1% 
in the quarter, making this North America's seventh consecutive quarter of 
growth. And for the full year, North America's organic volume growth was 
also up 1%.
 
The North America business gained total market volume and 
value share in 
sparkling, still and nonalcoholic ready
-
to
-
drink beverages in both the quarter 
and the full year. And we delivered these strong results while in the process 
of successfully integrating the largest acquisition in our company's history. 
Our sp
arkling beverage results in North America were even for the quarter, 
with brand Coca
-
Cola volume up 1%. We achieved these results while also 
earning an increase in retail pricing of 4% in sparkling beverages through 
the effective execution of our occasion
-
based brand, package, price and 
channel strategies.
 
As for Coke Zero, it was up high
-
single digits in North America this past 
quarter and up double digits for the full year, making this the fifth 
consecutive year of double
-
digit growth. We also drove posit
ive growth for 
Fanta, which was up 3% in 2011, its second consecutive year of positive 
growth.
 
Our still beverages in North America delivered 3% growth in the quarter and 
4% growth for the full year while gaining share for the seventh consecutive 
quarter. 
POWERADE continues to be a leading driver of this solid growth, up 
11% in the quarter and 12% for the full year. And POWERADE once again 
captured both volume and value share in the sports drinks category, both for 
the quarter and for the full year. Our key
 
brands delivered double
-
digit 
growth in the quarter led by Gold Peak, which grew double digits for the 
19th consecutive quarter.
 
As we've always said, there's no other western developed market in the 
world that boasts as dynamic the demographics as those 
present in North 
America between now and 2020. Young, vibrant, diverse, educated and 
entrepreneurial. We like these attributes and have every reason to remain 
excited about the long
-
term outlook of our flagship market.
 
Turning now to our Pacific Group wher
e in 2011, our business again 
delivered consistent growth across a diverse set of markets. Overall, our 
Pacific Group volume was up 5% in both the quarter and the full year, and 
these results were led by China, up double digits in the quarter and for the 
f
ull year, making this 9 out of the last 10 years that our business in China 
has delivered double
-
digit growth.
 
Our efforts to enhance the consumer experience with our sparkling beverage 
brands keep paying dividends, with sparkling beverages up double digit
s in 
China for both the quarter and the full year. Importantly, we're seeing 
strong growth across our entire sparkling portfolio, with Coca
-
Cola, Sprite 
and Fanta all delivering double
-
digit growth in both the fourth quarter as 
well as in the full year 201
1.
 
At the same time, our still beverage portfolio brands are sustaining their 
solid momentum, also delivering double
-
digit growth for the full year. These 
results confirm that we are executing the right strategies and have the right 
capabilities in place i
n China to deliver sustainable double
-
digit growth over 
the long
-
term.
 
Japan's fourth quarter results were up 5%, resulting in slightly positive full 
year growth, rounding to even. This is a better
-
than
-
anticipated full year 
result in light of the tragic n
ational disasters that occurred last March. This 
also underscores the strength and resilience of our people and brands across 
the entire Japanese bottling system. Notably, we realized greater 
momentum across several key channels in Japan this quarter, incl
uding 
convenience stores and vending as we further increase our focus on single
-
serve beverages.
 
Moving now to Latin America where in 2011 we once again expanded our 
volume and value share leadership position. Volume in this total region was 
up 4% in the q
uarter and 6% for the full year. This strong performance was 
once again led by Mexico, up 4% for the quarter and 9% for the full year. 
Our business in Mexico gained volume and value share in both sparkling and 
still beverages for both the quarter and the f
ull year. In fact, our still 
beverage portfolio in Mexico reached nearly 1 billion unit cases in 2011, a 
short 4 years after the successful integration of Jugos Del Valle into our 
winning portfolio.
 
The rapid evolution of our brands in Mexico is a great te
stament to our 
team's ability to execute clear, occasion
-
based channel strategies across all 
beverage categories in this key market. We're also advancing our 
momentum in Argentina, which delivered double
-
digit full year growth while 
capturing volume and va
lue share in both sparkling and still beverages for 
the 12th consecutive quarter.
 
And finally, Brazil, volume was up 1% for the full year. Despite a general 
slowdown in the economy and unfavorable weather, our business in Brazil 
keeps outperforming the ind
ustry, gaining share across both sparkling and 
still beverages in both for the quarter as well as the full year.
 
Let's now turn to the Eurasia and Africa Group. In 2011, we made sound 
progress against our goal to strategically invest for tomorrow 
while gaining 
share today. Volume in this region grew 4% in the quarter and a solid 6% 
for the full year. Importantly, our growth in Eurasia and Africa was driven by 
the continued strong momentum of brand Coca
-
Cola, up 5% in the quarter 
and 7% for the full
 
year 2011.
 
Our overall performance in this key region was once again led by India, 
which delivered 20% growth for the quarter, resulting in double
-
digit growth 
for the full year. 2011 was the fifth consecutive year that India achieved 
double
-
digit growth.
 

India was well balanced across our entire portfolio. Sparkling beverages in 
India were up over 20% this quarter while brand Coca
-
Cola was up a strong 
15%. And still beverages in India were up 16% this qu
arter, benefiting from 
a healthy growth across our juice portfolio, including Maaza, up 19%.
 
Russia was down low
-
single digits in the quarter, fourth quarter, cycling last 
year's very strong 31% growth. On a full year basis, our business in Russia 
was up m
id
-
single digits. Our business in Russia is being led by the strong 
growth of brand Coca
-
Cola, which delivered double
-
digit growth in 2011. 
Brand Coca
-
Cola is now more than twice the size of our primary competitor's 
cola brand in Russia. Notably, our overa
ll business in Russia keeps 
outperforming the rest of the industry, gaining both sparkling and still 
beverage volume and value share.
 
Turning to Turkey. We gained volume and value share this quarter in both 
sparkling and still beverages. For 2011, Turkey a
gain delivered double
-
digit 
growth as it did the previous year in 2010. And despite geopolitical 
challenges in the region, our Middle East and North Africa business unit 
delivered a solid 7% in the quarter and 8% for the full year.
 
A clear example of our c
ommitment to invest in tomorrow in this exciting 
Middle East region is our recently announced agreement to acquire 
approximately half of the equity of Aujan Industries. Aujan holds the #1 
position in the still beverage business across the entire Middle Eas
t. Their 
brands hold a top 3 position in every market where they compete. This 
strong partnership with Aujan, coupled with the strength of our bottling 
partners, will make the Coca
-
Cola system a leader in the fast
-
growing still 
beverage category in the Mid
dle East.
 
Let's now turn to Europe, a region of the world that is still facing a very 
uncertain economic environment. Yet, for The Coca
-
Cola Company, it is also 
a region that serves as a testament to how well our system is positioned to 
face these serious 
economic challenges. Our business in Europe grew 1% in 
the quarter, making this Europe's sixth consecutive quarter of volume 
growth, resulting in a full year growth rate of 2%. We achieved these results 
by strategically tailoring our price and package offe
rings to meet the needs 
of each market and their varying economic conditions. Our growth in Europe 
was widespread, with positive fourth quarter and full year growth across 
several key markets in Northwest Europe and Spain. And we saw the 
continued growth o
f Innocent, supported by the successful launch of not
-
from
-
concentrate juice in Great Britain. Our growth in Europe was once 
again led by Germany, up a very strong 9% for the quarter and up 6% for 
the full year, representing our best full year growth resul
t in Germany since 
1992.
 
While some of this growth should be attributed to favorable weather and 
consumer sentiment, there's no doubt that our bottling restructuring efforts 
as well as effective marketing campaigns have played a key role in this 
improvemen
t. We're confident that our business in Germany is in a sound 
position to continue delivering long
-
term sustainable growth.
 
Looking ahead to 2012 and 2013. Despite the lingering debt crisis coupled 
with economic and political uncertainty, we are confident 
that we have the 
right brands, the right structure, the right strategies and right capabilities in 
place to continue delivering profitable growth in Europe over the longer 
term.
 
Now let's turn to an overview of how we are building our brands. As we've 
said
 
before, we always place our brands first in all that we do, across more 
than 200 countries all around the world. This is how we've built the world's 
most valuable beverage brand portfolio, with 15 $1 billion brands, more than 
any other beverage company. O
ur top 4 brands: Coca
-
Cola, Sprite, Fanta 
and Diet Coke, all once again exceeded $10 billion in global retail sales in 
2011. A key component of how we strengthen our global brand portfolio is 
through innovative consumer engagement. We continuously strive t
o engage 
with our consumers in an integrated manner across all social media 
platforms. A recent example of our efforts in this front was this past 
weekend's very successful Super Bowl campaign where we engaged fans like 
never before. Through a unique onlin
e viewing experience, fans got to chat 
with our animated polar bears and see their game reactions. And they 
watched the bears move from the digital realm of the TV as they starred in 3 
new well
-
received and highly rated TV commercials. And an estimated 
300
,000
-
plus fans joined the polar bears live, far exceeding expectations. 
And by the second quarter, the Coca
-
Cola Facebook feed was receiving 
3,400 hits per second. This is just one of the 
--
 
a string of marketing 
achievements for our company.
 
Recently, we 
were humbled by the Advertising Age naming The Coca
-
Cola 
Company as its 2011 Marketer of the Year. And it's gratifying to see our 
global marketing efforts recognized by this industry
-
leading publication as 
we strive to develop and deploy the world's most i
nnovative and effective 
marketing.
 
Let me update you now on our progress around winning at the point of sale. 
Our system continues to develop critical capabilities to better support over 
20 million customers we partner with each and every week to deliver t
hese 
servings. We measure our progress against this effort by tracking our results 
across several high
-
impact, pragmatic and locally actionable metrics. One 
metric we have referenced several times this past year is our immediate 
consumption volume growth. 
And this metric is meaningful as it drives trial, 
drives recruitment and system profitability. In 2011, our immediate 
consumption beverages were up 4% globally, driven by focused in
-
store 
activation efforts and cold drink equipment expansion. In fact, as a
 
global 
system, we've placed over 1.2 million new pieces of cold drink equipment in 
2011 and have placed over 2.2 million since 2010, the first year of our 2020 
Vision.
 
Another key metric we monitor closely is the expansion of our right 
execution daily, or
 
RED program in short. Some of you may remember RED 
as our world
-
class commercial process designed to improve execution at the 
outlet level. Today, operations representing over 1/3 of our global volume 
utilize RED. And for comparison, when we initiated our
 
2020 Vision just 3 
years ago, less than 15% of our global volume was distributed through 
operations using RED. So as we move into 2012, our RED program will 
remain an area of increasing emphasis, focus and growth for our system.
 
Before concluding our oper
ating results review, I'd like to update you on our 
productivity goals. A leading priority of our company is to design and 
implement an effective and efficient business system, with productivity as 
one of our core pillars of our 2020 Vision. As such, in 20
12, we're 
implementing a new 4
-
year productivity and reinvestment program that we 
will 
--
 
we expect will achieve between $550 million and $650 million of total 
incremental annualized savings by the end of 2015. I'm pleased and excited 
to announce this prog
ram from a position of continued growth and 
momentum towards realizing our 2020 Vision as we consistently deliver 
results in line with or ahead of our long
-
term targets. This program will 
further enable our efforts to strengthen our brands and reinvest our
 
resources to drive long
-
term profitable growth.
 
We remain relentless in our efforts to become more efficient, leaner and 
adaptive to changing market conditions, while at the same time building a 
continuous improvement in cost management culture in keeping
 
with our 
2020 Vision. Gary is going to share further details about this new 4
-
year 
program in a few moments.
 
Finally, I also want to highlight some of the important progress we're making 
in the area of sustainable packaging, water stewardship and climate 
protection. By the end of 2011, we've shipped nearly 10 billion PlantBottle 
packages, helping reduce our annual emissions of carbon dioxide, while also 
decreasing our dependency on oil
-
based resin. As noted in our latest 
Sustainability Report, we improved 
our water use efficiency for the eighth 
consecutive year, reducing the average amount of water required to produce 
each beverage serving. We estimate that we replenished 35% of the water 
used in our finished products due to some 380
-
plus community water 
pa
rtnerships in 94 countries as we work toward our goal of water neutrality 
by 2020. And we increased our production volume while reducing our 
system
-
wide global carbon emissions by 2%, putting us a step closer to our 
goal of growing our business but not our
 
carbon.
 
These are just a few examples of how we're building our business 
responsibly by making a positive difference in the communities that we 
serve 
--
 
we proudly serve. These efforts are helping us engage with 
consumers, reduce our cost of doing busines
s and improve our bottom line.
 
We are keenly aware of how uncertain the global economic landscape 
remains today. That said, as we look ahead, we see a world looking for 
hope, for optimism and for renewal. The Coca
-
Cola Company and the Coca
-
Cola system is u
niquely positioned to refresh this thirsty world. We're 
refreshing the thirst of our investors consistently by delivering high
-
quality 
returns to shareowners, while also generating steady cash flows and paying 
a steady healthy dividend. We're refreshing th
e needs of thirsty global 
consumers through our diverse brand portfolio and the world's most 
innovative and effective marketing. We're refreshing the needs of a thirsty 
system by increasing our levels of global investment along with our 
dedicated bottling 
partners. We're refreshing our operations through a 
culture of continuous improvement. And central to this is extending and 
driving productivity efforts to design and implement a more effective and 
efficient business system. And we are refreshing the needs
 
of our 
communities through global and industry sustainability leadership.
 
The nonalcoholic ready
-
to
-
drink industry grew by $35 billion in total retail 
value in 2011. We're pleased to say that our Coca
-
Cola system represented 
more than 40% of this total in
dustry growth, underscoring that our 2020 
Vision is working well. And while 2011 was another strong year of 
performance for The Coca
-
Cola Company, we believe we are just getting 
started and that our best and brightest days lie ahead.
 
We have a lot to be th
ankful for, and confident about healthy and beloved 
brand, a clear roadmap for continued growth, a well
-
aligned global bottling 
system, dedicated and passionate associates and strong financial results and 
discipline. Taking into account all of these assets
 
to our business, we remain 
resolute in our desire and confident in our ability to achieve our long
-
term 
growth targets and further enhance the value of your investment in The 
Coca
-
Cola Company.
 
With that, let me now turn the call over to Gary.
 
Gary P. Fay
ard
 
Thanks, Muhtar, and good morning, everyone. We once again delivered 
quality results this quarter and for the full year, in line with or ahead of our 
long
-
term growth targets. In fact, our full year volume and profit results 
were in line with or exceede
d our long
-
term growth targets for the sixth 
consecutive year. We continue to achieve these consistent high
-
quality 
results during a period of still mixed economic recovery, which is a real 
testament to our global system's ability to execute our strategic 
plans in 
alignment with our 2020 Vision.
 
So let's review our earnings results in more detail. We reported comparable 
earnings per share of $0.79 this quarter, up 10% versus the prior year. Our 
full year comparable earnings per share growth also was up 10%,
 
ahead of 
our long
-
term growth targets. For the quarter, comparable currency neutral 
operating income was up 14%, bringing our full year comparable currency 
neutral operating income growth to 12%, also ahead of our long
-
term 
growth target. For clarity, the
 
impact of currency on our comparable 
operating income results was a 3% headwind for the quarter and a 3% 
benefit for the full year, right in line with the quarterly and full year outlook 
range we've provided during our last earnings call in October. Our b
usiness 
delivered comparable currency neutral net revenue growth of 6% this 
quarter, in line with our long
-
term growth target, including a 5% increase in 
concentrate sales and positive price mix.
 
On a full year basis, our comparable currency neutral net re
venue growth 
came in at 29%, including a 5% increase in concentrate sales, positive price 
mix and the impact of the CCE transaction. And again, for clarity, the impact 
of currency on our comparable net revenue results was a 1% headwind for 
the quarter and 
a 3% benefit for the full year.
 
Our combined international and bottling investments group price product 
mix was a positive 3% for the quarter. And our North American price 
product mix came in at a positive 2% in the quarter, driven by a 4% 
increase in our 
pricing to retailers for our sparkling beverages in North 
America.
 
Our consolidated geographic mix was down 1%, which resulted in a 
consolidated price mix at the midpoint of our long
-
term target range of 1% 
to 2%. For 2012, we anticipate our consolidated p
rice mix results will remain 
in this target range of 1% to 2%.
 
Turning to the rest of our P&L. We expected our consolidated comparable 
gross revenues to decrease slightly in 2011, which they did due to increased 
commodity cost, as well as the impact of our
 
acquisition of CCE's North 
American bottling operations. Importantly, we expect our 2012 consolidated 
comparable gross margins will remain in line with 2011, even after taking 
into consideration further commodity cost inflation, which I'll discuss in a fe
w 
minutes.
 
Our comparable currency neutral SG&A expenses were even in the quarter 
and up 30% for the full year. As explained in prior quarterly calls, this full 
year increase reflects the impact of acquiring CCE's former North American 
business, which we d
id not fully cycle until the fourth quarter of 2011. The 
increase in SG&A also reflects our continued investments around the world. 
On this front, for the full year 2011, we grew our direct marketing expenses 
ahead of unit case growth, sustaining our commi
tment to invest in the 
health and the strength of our brands.
 
As for operating expense leverage, it came in positive this quarter for both 
North America and the Bottling Investments Group. As expected, operating 
expense leverage for our 
international operations came in slightly negative 
in the fourth quarter due to the timing of expenses. And operating expense 
leverage for international came in at even for the full year as planned.
 
For 2012, we expect to capture low
-
single digit operating
 
expense leverage 
as we keep strategically investing in brand
-
building activities around the 
world and efficiently managing our operating expenses.
 
Our net interest income came in at a positive $66 million, slightly above the 
full year forecast we provided
 
in our last earnings call. For 2012, our best 
estimate is that net interest income will come in between $20 million and 
$40 million, primarily due to lower interest rates in some international 
locations. We expect this income to be spread relatively evenl
y across the 
quarters in 2012, and we'll update you each quarter as appropriate. Finally, 
we closed 2011 with an underlying effective tax rate of 23.9% and expect 
our 2012 underlying effective tax rate to fall between 24% and 25%.
 
Moving to our cash flow f
rom operations. Year
-
to
-
date, this came in at $9.5 
billion. As a reminder, this cash flow result includes $769 million contribution 
made to our pension plans in the first quarter of 2011. Net of these 
additional pension plan contributions, we grew our net 
cash flow from 
operations a positive 7% for the full year.
 
With regards to our share repurchase program, our net share repurchases 
totaled $2.9 billion in 2011, at the high end of the $2.5 billion to $3 billion 
range communicated during our last earnings c
all. And in 2012, we again 
expect to repurchase a net share amount within the same $2.5 billion to $3 
billion range.
 
Now let me take a moment to update our outlook on several additional items 
that may help you model our business in 2012, starting with a qu
ick 
reminder about this year's calendar. Even though 2012 is a leap year, our 
first quarter of 2012 will have one less day when compared to the first 
quarter of 2011. And the fourth quarter of 2012 will have 2 more days when 
compared to the fourth quarter 
of 2011.
 
Now let me come back with our outlook on commodities. As we indicated in 
our last earnings call, our incremental commodity costs for 2011 came in at 
approximately $800 million. As a reminder, these costs were related to the 
raw material and conver
sion costs associated with sweeteners, metals, 
juices and PET plastic.
 
As we look ahead to 2012, we anticipate the underlying commodities related 
to these inputs will remain somewhat pressured, driven primarily by 
increases in the cost of juices and sweete
ners. As a result, we expect the full 
year 2012 incremental impact of commodity costs on our results to range 
between $350 million and $450 million. Having said that, we believe we 
have the right strategic plans in place to mitigate the impact of these 
inc
remental commodity costs and remain confident in our ability to achieve 
our long
-
term growth targets.
 
Turning now to currency. These have continued to fluctuate with the dollar 
strengthening, although more moderately against many key currencies. 
We're most
ly hedged for 2012 on the euro and yen, with good coverage on 
several other currencies. After considering these hedged positions, we 
currently expect currencies to have a low single
-
digit negative impact on 
operating income for the first quarter of this ye
ar and a mid
-
single digit 
negative impact for the full year. As per our normal practice, we'll update 
you both on our commodity and currency forecast on a quarterly basis as we 
go through the year.
 
Now let me update you on our productivity goals. As we clo
sed 2011, we've 
now successfully completed our 2008 to 2011 4
-
year global productivity 
program. We completed this program on plan and with actual annualized 
savings of over $500 million, exceeding our initial savings target of $400 
million to $500 million.
 
As Muhtar mentioned earlier, we're now launching a 
new 4
-
year productivity and reinvestment program. In light of this, I want to 
take a moment and walk you through the components of the new program.
 
First, a new 4
-
year global productivity initiative start
ing this year. This 
initiative will target between $350 million and $400 million in annualized 
savings focused around 4 primary areas: one, global supply chain 
optimization; two, global marketing and innovation effectiveness; three, 
OpEx leverage and opera
tional excellence; and four, data and IT systems 
standardization. We're in the initial stages of defining the one
-
time costs 
associated with capturing these savings, and we'll provide an update on 
these costs in our next earnings call.
 
Second, as we move t
hrough 2011, we accelerated our CCR integration 
efforts to support brand
-
building initiatives, reinvest in marketing and sales 
capabilities, as well as to partially offset some of last year's increasing 
commodity costs. As a result, we effectively realized
 
nearly all of the $350 
million in annualized savings in 2011, almost 3 years ahead of schedule. This 
is a testament to the great work of our CCR team and their ability to 
effectively realize and capture synergies while simultaneously delivering 
profitable
 
growth.
 
Further, we have successfully identified incremental CCR integration 
synergies in North America, primarily in the area of our North American 
product supply, which will better enable us to service our customers and 
consumers. As such, we now believ
e our CCR integration efforts will capture 
an incremental $200 million to $250 million above our original $350 million 
target. And we expect to capture these incremental annualized synergies 
starting this year in 2012 and fully realize them by the end of 2
015.
 
Correspondingly, we're also increasing our estimate of total one
-
time cost 
associated with the capture of CCR synergies from $425 million to $800 
million as we implement new initiatives to capture these higher synergies. 
Therefore, combining both our 
new global productivity initiative and our 
newly expanded CCR integration efforts represents a total incremental 
annualized savings of $550 million to $650 million. We expect to phase in 
the capture of these total incremental savings over 4 years, starting
 
in 2012 
through the end of 2015.
 
Going forward, we'll report our progress in capturing these total incremental 
savings under one joint productivity and reinvestment program.
 
As for how we intend to invest the savings generated by this new program, 
first, 
and in line with our 2020 Vision, these funds will enhance ongoing 
system
-
wide brand
-
building initiatives. And second, as these savings are 
realized, they may also help mitigate potential incremental near
-
term 
commodity costs.
 
As we look back on 2011, we a
re greatly encouraged by our business 
achieving yet another solid year of quality results. There is no better proof 
that our 2020 Vision is working than our company's continued ability to 
consistently deliver results that meet or exceed our long
-
term growt
h 
targets even while facing volatile market conditions. And as you consider 
how to model our business going forward, I want to be very clear that our 
system remains fully committed to continuing our relative historic price 
premium for our brands in the mar
ketplace. For as we have communicated 
several times in the past, we strongly believe and have consistently proven 
that the best way to drive long
-
term sustainable value is by earning price 
with our consumers in concert with a robust occasion
-
based brand pa
ckage 
and channel strategy that drives profitable sustainable growth. That is why 
we remain confident we can keep delivering results in line with our long
-
term growth targets. Our system is healthy and financially strong. We 
continue to generate cash, inve
st in our brands, execute our 2020 Vision and 
growth strategies and pay a healthy dividend. Our seasoned management 
team, over 146,000 motivated company associates and highly capable global 
bottling partners are making the right actions and executing the r
ight 
strategies to build on our strengths, to refresh a thirsty world and to drive 
our 2020 Vision.
 
Before concluding our prepared remarks, I want to remind you that I'm 
looking forward to presenting at CAGNY in Boca Raton on Wednesday, 
February 22; as wel
l as at the CAGE Conference in London on Wednesday, 
March 21. I hope to see many of you there at these great investor and 
analyst events.

[Operator Instructions] And our first qu
estion today comes from Mark 
Swartzberg with Stifel, Nicolaus.

Muhtar, I guess 2 questions on the overall growth we saw in the quarter. We 
had been seeing 5s and 4s in terms of unit volume g
rowth. We saw plus 3% 
in the quarter. I know comparisons were a factor, but can we zero in on the 
emerging markets trends you're seeing? And you highlighted the emerging 
markets, markets were per caps or below 150. You highlighted that was a 
plus 4% in the
 
quarter. It was a plus 6% for the year. So is it possible to 
generalize on what's going on in those less developed markets and some of 
the plans you have to improve on that plus 4%?
 
Muhtar Kent
 
You mentioned 2 questions. The one is on emerging markets. Is
 
there 
another one?
 
Mark Swartzberg 
-
 
Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division
 
Yes, and the second is 
--
 
I guess the 2 parts are, a, what's driving that 
slowdown from kind of a plus 6% to a plus 4%? And then b, as you think 
about trying to see that 
4% become a better number in coming quarters, 
what are some of the things you think that are going to help you do that?
 
Muhtar Kent
 
Yes. I mean, I think, first, I don't think you can draw any trend. And we're 
pleased with our volume growth of 3%, which is in line with our long
-
term 
growth targets. And I think it's important to note the following: We're cycling 
an organic volume growth 
of 5% in the prior year, and full year volume is 
4%, at organically high end of our long
-
term growth target for the year. And 
I'm really particularly pleased that all operating groups grew in the quarter. 
So a cornerstone of our vision is balanced growth a
cross all geographies and 
balanced growth across our portfolio. We achieved that both for the quarter 
and for the year. And I don't think you can draw any conclusions. And also, 
we achieved this kind of growth in the year with not only just a very volatile
 
economic environment, volatile commodity environment, but also one
-
offs 
like the issue in the Japan, the flooding in Thailand, rightsizing in a huge 
market like China where now our transactions are significantly ahead of our 
volume, which is a testament t
o the health of the business. And so yes, 
we've had some 
--
 
there has been some dislocations in some Middle East 
markets because of the volatility there, because of what's happened like 
Egypt and like other parts in North Africa. We believe that we see tha
t 
improving. There's been 
--
 
South East Europe has been under tremendous 
pressure. Again, those markets are under 150 per capita because of all the 
volatility that's going on in Europe and around Greece. But I think we 
shouldn't draw any conclusions. As we
 
look into 2012, we see healthy trends 
continuing in Latin America, healthy trends continuing in Eurasia and Africa 
-
-
 
African continent and also Middle East and Eurasia. We see healthy trends 
in most of the Pacific Rim and area, and we see healthy trends 
right here in 
North America. Right now, we see better trends in terms of the consumer 
mobility, eating out more and just less confusion of the consumer here in 
North America than we did 12 months ago. And we see that manifesting 
itself in our Foodservice b
usiness. And Europe, finally, I think, is going to be 
more volatile. And I think we will probably see first half of the year being 
more challenged in Europe than the second half of the year. That's sort of 
the way I would sum it. But I do 
--
 
in Europe, we 
have some great markets 
continuing to grow like Germany, like Scandinavia, like Northwest Europe. 
And then we still have challenging markets in the Southern Rim. Although 
again we had moderate growth in Spain also in the fourth quarter. So I 
believe that w
e will achieve our long
-
term growth targets over time in terms 
of volume, as well as also in terms of our ability to generate price mix across 
the world.
 
Mark Swartzberg 
-
 
Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division
 
That's great. And if I could follow 
up, zeroing in on some of those externals 
that you're describing, those dislocations you mentioned in regions like the 
Middle East and some of the other more recently more challenging markets, 
when you think about what's going on in some of those markets f
rom a 
broader consumer standpoint and kind of what the Coca
-
Cola Company can 
do about those things, how are your packaging initiatives changing? And 
how are you thinking about spending money at the pull level in terms of how 
you're proposing folks take an 
added interest in your products in those 
markets?
 
Muhtar Kent
 
Number one, Mark, our brands are getting stronger. We're continuing to 
invest, and you will see us continue to invest. And what happens in a quarter 
is not the result of our investment in that q
uarter or the previous quarter, 
but what are our investments 3 or 4, 5, 6 quarters ago. And we will continue 
to invest. Our brands continue to gain share. And if you look at our share 
results overall, right now, in the world, both in sparkling and in still
 
beverages, they're all
-
time high. Brand metrics for sparkling as well as still 
beverages are trending in a very healthy manner. So brand health 
investments, stronger system, better alignment, all basically works in our 
favor even in times of volatility. A
nd we're seeing that manifest itself.

Our next question comes from Bill Pecoriello with Consumer Edge Research.
 
William Pecoriello 
-
 
Consumer Edge Research, LLC
 
Question. Looking out to 2012, we're likely going to see significant stepped 
up compet
itive spending in North America, maybe in some other markets. 
Gary, you talked about sustaining a price premium in the market. Muhtar, 
you talked about the long
-
term brand
-
building strategy. So how are you 
thinking about balancing profit growth goals, agai
nst sacrificing any market 
share in the event that the stepped up spending is greater than you 
expected in any one market any one given year? To what extent do you use 
portfolio management, et cetera?
 
Muhtar Kent
 
Look, you are mostly, Bill, talking about N
orth America here, right?
 
William Pecoriello 
-
 
Consumer Edge Research, LLC
 
Yes. I mean, there could be stepped up spending in select international 
markets, but it probably would be mostly in North America. It's yet to be 
seen.
 
Muhtar Kent
 
Yes. So let me ad
dress North America first. We've achieved a pretty healthy 
price mix in the fourth quarter, 2% including a rate increase in retail pricing 
of sparkling beverages at 4% in North America. And our brand strength 
continues, with brand Coca
-
Cola up 1% in the sa
me quarter. And I believe 
--
 
I think it would be right to assume that this kind of rational pricing would 
continue in terms of rate for 2012. And that's what I would say because I 
think there is never room in business for irrationality over the long term. 
And that's how I would project. And I think we have 
--
 
we're going into this 
from a point of strength. Our brands are stronger. Our system is much 
stronger. Our metrics for customer service are much, much better, and I see 
us continuing with our momentum. 
And I think pricing actions should 
continue into 2012 in terms of rationality. And we anticipate taking 
additional pricing on key segments of the business through this year in 
accordance with our normal commercial practices. And we manage a very 
broad port
folio of our business. That's how I would reference it. In terms of 
international, I think you heard Gary talk about a 3% price mix in 
international, and I believe that, that's a testament again to the strength of 
our international business, which continue
s to be able to generate good price 
mix on top of good volume and still growing our market share. Those are the 
key metrics for international.

Our next question comes from Bonnie Herzog from Wells Fargo.
 
Bonnie Herzog 
-
 
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC
, Research Division
 
I just wanted to drill down a little bit more on 
--
 
hoping you can provide a 
little bit more color on the price mix globally, that you reported up 1% in the 
quarter considering your geography mix was negative. So I guess I'd like to 
hea
r what some of the dynamics are that drove a negative geography mix? 
And then also, I'd be curious to hear how your price mix was impacted by 
your increased effort behind your smaller packages in a few of your key 
markets like North America and China.
 
Gary
 
P. Fayard
 
Sure. Bonnie, why don't I take that one, initially anyway. If you look, where 
we actually came out was 
--
 
on consolidated price mix, it was right at 1.5% 
positive. So if you take that 3% for international including BIG, 2% for North 
America and 
then put like a negative 1% on geographic, you get right at 
--
 
it's 1.5% is where it comes out. And I would characterize it this way: that is 
a very good thing for the long
-
term. And that may sound unusual for me to 
say. But what it means is that we are co
ntinuing to invest and grow all of 
the emerging markets around the world. Most of those do have margins 
below the U.S. or Europe, for example, the more developed markets. But 
we're not milking the business. We're continuing to grow the business. At 
the sam
e time, get very healthy margins in the business, and you can see 
those coming through the bottom line. So we continue to strengthen the 
whole business globally. As long as we're doing the right thing, I think you're 
going to see a negative geographic mix 
for a very long time, because what 
you want to see is healthy growth in emerging markets. You want to see 
very good growth in India. You want to see very good growth in China, et 
cetera. And at the same time, as Muhtar said, and critically important, then 
growth actually across every geographic region in which we operate. But 
when you put all that together, you will get negative geographic growth, and 
I think that's a great thing. But in total, as long as it's coming out in our 1% 
to 2% range, in the quarte
r it came out right in the middle of that, we're 
exactly where we want to be.
 
Muhtar Kent
 
Yes, Bonnie, just to complement what Gary said, I think the key takeaways 
from how we think about our business and the health of our business overall 
is that as long 
as we can continue to achieve our volume targets, which we 
believe we can, and coupled with the kind of price mix, positive price mix 
that Gary talked about that we achieved for the year and for the quarter, I 
think 
--
 
coupled again with the investments th
at we are making, have been 
making and are continuing to make in the business, add on to that the 
productivity and reinvestment program, add on to that the increased weight 
of our total marketing, because imagine, every year in the last 3, 4 years, 
we've b
een adding more 
--
 
around 1 billion cases to our total business, that 
brings with it more marketing, more distribution, more production, all of 
that, and then the positive share gains, then we feel very confident that we 
can continue to deliver our long
-
te
rm targets, despite all the volatility in the 
world.
 
Gary P. Fayard
 
And Bonnie, let me just come back to the last part of your question. I forgot 
to 
--
 
on rightsizing in 
--
 
I'll characterize it this way. In China, what we're 
able to do is actually take the
 
entry
-
level pack from a 600 ml down to a 500 
ml size bottle at the same price. So we actually gave the consumer 
something they actually preferred at the same price, which implicitly carries 
a price increase inside of that. So from there, we actually gener
ated margin. 

consumer 
--
 
this is back to that occasion
-
based, right package, right 
channel, right time, right place, giving the consumer what they want. This is 
the way you drive profita
ble, sustainable growth and deliver margins rather 
than just taking a couple of sizes, stacking it high and selling it cheap.

Our next question comes from Bryan Spillane with Bank of America.
 
Bryan D. Spillane 
-
 
BofA Merrill Lynch, 
Research Division
 
I just wanted to touch on the balance comments that you made earlier. And 
I guess, if you look at 2011, one of the real encouraging things is that the 
share of incremental profit in 2011 versus 2010 was pretty broad
-
based. So 
most regions
 
contributed to incremental profit in 2011. If you look out to 
2012, is that broadly, looking at the world this year, that you'll see more 
incremental profit growth from more regions, and I guess that helps offset 
some of the volatility in Europe? And then
 
also, just connected to that, gross 
profit, I guess a little surprised that you're expecting gross margins to be 
flat, given the moderation in input cost. So if you could talk a little bit about 
that as well.
 
Muhtar Kent
 
This is Muhtar. Let me just start 
answering your question and then Gary can 
come in also. But I think in terms of the overall businesses concerned, we 
believe that we can definitely continue to achieve a balanced portfolio and 
balanced geographic growth. And I think it is really critical f
or us to be able 
to do that, as we've done in '09, '10 and '11. And we have reason to believe 
that we can grow across Western markets, and we can grow across, 
certainly across at a higher rate, across our emerging markets, and that 
you'll see that continui
ng. And as we continue to gain scale in the emerging 
markets, you will continue to see our margins improving in those markets as 
they have been doing in the last 3, 4 years. So I will just say that yes, 
definitely balanced across geographies, North America
, Japan, Europe. And 
then certainly, again, broad
-
based in the portfolio, both in sparkling and in 
still beverages. And still beverages growth that I mentioned in Latin 
America, for example, and the fact that it's an almost 
--
 
it's got to 1 billion 
cases i
n Mexico after 4 short years after Jugos Del Valle got integrated 
successfully into our business and now it's in many, many markets, 
flourishing in many markets across Latin America, is just another testament 
of still how much growth Latin America has stil
l to offer. And the good news 
is that again, the growth 
--
 
as we build on growth on Jugos Del Valle, it 
hasn't stopped in any way the growth of sparkling beverages that continue 
to flourish and continue to prosper in Latin America.
 
Gary P. Fayard
 
So Bryan,
 
it's Gary. Let me just add to that a couple of things. When you're 
talking about 
--
 
first on balanced growth, the other thing I'd say is as you 
think about obviously the most volatile region or economically challenged 
region this year will be Europe 
--
 
bu
t also remember that this is a year 
where there are 2 events taking place in Europe, the Olympics and the Euro 
Cup are both this year and we happen to be the sponsor of both of those. 
And so I think it's one of those things that's going to help us in that 
market 
as well. Relative to gross margins, I'd say what you should expect to see is 
you should have seen increasing margins. But what's happening is with that 
$350 million to $450 million of commodity pressure, what we're doing is we 
believe we can offset 
that and hold our margins with the pricing actions that 
we're taking in the market, as well as the productivity efforts that we're 
taking as well. So it's really those commodity pressures that, again, granted 
are half of what they were in '11, but still su
bstantial in 2012.
 
Bryan D. Spillane 
-
 
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division
 
And Gary, I guess in terms of the gross margin, the geographic mix I guess 
would also be a slight drag on that as well. Is that right?
 
Gary P. Fayard
 
It actually is. Yes, it is.
 
M
uhtar Kent
 
And Bryan, just to close it, don't underestimate the fact that what I 
mentioned about immediate consumption growth. That is a critical element 
that has higher margins, higher prices, and it improves the mix of our 
business. And that is continuin
g at a very healthy rate, particularly also in 
Western markets like North America, as well as Europe. And that is again a 
key testament to the strength of our system, which requires very disciplined 
execution in the marketplace on a day
-
to
-
day basis. And I
 
was recently in 
Western Europe in the marketplace with John Brock, our partner in CCE, and 
we saw great examples of how both the activation has already started 
around the Olympics, but also great execution in the marketplace from an 
immediate consumption 
perspective, as well as the brand, price, pack, 
occasion, channel architecture really working in our favor.
 
Operator
 
Our next question comes from Judy Hong from Goldman Sachs.
 
Judy E. Hong 
-
 
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division
 
Gary, a bit of a foll
ow
-
up to Bryan's question, but really drilling into North 
America profit number. In fourth quarter, first clean quarter in lapping CCE 
acquisition, your profit was up 25%. I think the benefit that you called out in 
Q1, the timing shift on marketing, was ab
out 7 points. So even excluding 
that, it looks like the profit was up pretty nicely in fourth quarter. So maybe 
a little bit of color as to what drove that profit improvement in Q4. And then 
as you think about 2012, you've got moderating inflation, you've 
got pricing 
that went into the marketplace, you've got cost synergies and cost savings 
coming through, why wouldn't we expect to see a pretty healthy profit 
growth in North America in 2012?
 
Gary P. Fayard
 
Okay. Thanks, Judy, very insightful question. Now l
et me see if I can give an 
insightful answer. Here's what I'd tell you. Relative to the fourth quarter 
performance on North America, you do see very healthy increase. A lot of 
that is actually what we're cycling. Because a lot of the marketing in the 
fourt
h quarter in legacy CCE, when we acquired it, there was a lot of 
marketing that was spent in the fourth quarter of 2010 that CCE had already 
planned and then we executed against in that fourth quarter. This year 
actually got spread through the year. So it 
was a timing of marketing, and 
so there are a few of those type anomalies. If you remember, if you go back 
I think I said in the third quarter call, that the fourth quarter of this year will 
be the first quarter that's actually comparable, but there are st
ill some 
unusual things in the fourth quarter of 2010 that you need to go back and 
make sure you look at. So I just 
--
 
I'd say, everyone on the call, if you're 
interested in that, go back and look at some of those things. And what you'll 
see, it'll actuall
y bring that profit increase down. It's still a nice increase and 
profitable, but it'll bring it down some in the fourth quarter of 2011. Relative 
to 2012, let me just say I hear you, and we are very enthusiastic about our 
business in North America. It is 
operating well. They were able to do one of 
the largest vertical integrations in the history of business and do it 
flawlessly, get basically 4 years of synergies in the first year, increased 
those synergies and at the same time continue to execute and take
 
share in 
the market in a very profitable way. So I feel very good about North 
America, I'm bullish on North America. And we've got a very capable team 
over there executing every day.
 
Judy E. Hong 
-
 
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division
 
Okay. Gary, j
ust a follow
-
up on currency. The mid
-
single digit impact for the 
full year 2012 sounds like the hedged position is a bit of a drag. If you just 
take the spot rates, it sort of calculates to more like a low
-
single digit rate 
for the full year. So is that th
e correct assumption? And then to the extent 
that if there is an upside to currency, is it fair to assume that, that's going to 
come more from the emerging market currencies that you don't really 
hedge?
 
Gary P. Fayard
 
Yes, Judy. Actually, the hedge positio
ns we have are in the money today. So 
on the euros particularly, we're in the money on that. So better than current 
spot. But where the drag is coming from and what you're not seeing is that 
it's really all those emerging market countries. And you'd be sur
prised at a 
lot of little countries that actually can start having, you add them all up and 
they can have a pretty large impact, which is moving you from 
--
 
I think 
you're probably seeing low
-
single digits, and I'm seeing mid
-
single digits full 
year, even 
though it's low
-
single digits first quarter. But if you look at Brazil, 
which is one of the big ones, it's been a pretty big move. Brazil strengthened 
significantly during last year then weakened significantly, and now it's 
coming back some. But it's a lot
 
of these smaller emerging market 
currencies that are giving that impact. Now with that said, if you 
--
 
let me 
just tell you, give you some idea of the volatility. The swing of currencies on 
our earnings in 2012 in the last month is over $100 million in th
e last 30 
days. And that's an improvement, by the way. Because we're seeing those 
kind of volatilities, we're seeing a lot of those emerging market currencies 
starting to come back, and they're coming back as the world is starting to 
accept a little risk w
here there was total risk aversion a month 
--
 
6 weeks 
ago. So is there some upside? I hope so, but I don't know today. Because of 
the volatility, we just don't know. But I think as we move through the year, 
we'll continue 
--
 
but the volatility is going to 
continue as well.
 
Operator
 
And our final question today comes from Caroline Levy from CLSA.
 
Caroline S. Levy 
-
 
CLSA Asia
-
Pacific Markets, Research Division
 
A couple of things. In Japan, you had excellent volume growth and yet 
margins in the Pacific region 
were awful. And that to me was 
--
 
and when I 
say awful, they were down a lot year
-
over
-
year. That to me is surprising, 
especially given you had single
-
serve growth in Japan. So if you could 
address that, that would be really helpful. And then 2 other marke
ts that 
looked surprisingly soft, Brazil went flat, which it really had been sort of 
bucking difficult economic trends. Did something change in Brazil? And then 
finally, it looks like Philippines were down fairly close to 20%. So if you could 
just address 
those 3 markets please?
 
Muhtar Kent
 
Sure, Caroline. Let me start. I think Pacific volume grew a healthy 5% in 
both Q4 and the full quarter. And yes, Japan actually 
--
 
very positive in 
Japan, and it's a testament again to the strength of our system in Japan
, to 
what we're doing in Japan, to the leadership of our business as well as our 
system in Japan. And I think that we ended up slightly positive despite all 
the dislocations in Japan. And that again basically bodes well going forward 
as to the strength of 
our business there. I think in terms of your question, 
how that relates to the Pacific, you need to look at I think the full year 
results of the Pacific. It was, from an income perspective, overall positive. 
And it's about the timing, and it's about market
ing. Expenses also. How 
they're sort of distributed over the year. In terms of Brazil, I would say that 
Brazil 
--
 
I could just summarize by saying volume was up 1% for the full 
year. General slowdown of the economy and unfavorable weather did impact 
our bu
siness, but we are outperforming the industry, gaining share across all 
categories for the quarter and the full year. And I think you should expect 
sequential improvement in Brazil as we move through 2012. As far as 
Philippines is concerned, we've had esse
ntially a difficult year as we continue 
to transform that business as it needs to be transformed into a healthy 
situation for the long term. And think about our German business, it took us 
a while to get it going again. We believe that certainly, the worst
 
has passed 
us in the Philippines and that we should have 
--
 
in terms of also the tough 
macroeconomic environment post the elections has lingered on. But we 
believe that 2012 will be a better year in the Philippines than 
--
 
2012 will be 
a better year than 
2011. And I think Gary just wants to add something.
 
Gary P. Fayard
 
Yes, Caroline, it's Gary. I just want to correct one thing. On the Philippines, I 
think you said you were looking at it, you were thinking it was down 20% or 
so. Let me just 
--
 
Philippines in the fourth quarter and full year were down 
high
-
single digits. So high
-
single digits. It was not anything close to 20%.
 
Muhtar Kent
 
Good. Thank you, Gary and Jackson. So in closing, our strong 2011

Muhtar Kent
 
Thank you, Jackson, and good morning, everyone. Our second quarter 
volume performance came in below our expecta
tions. There was a 
confluence of factors that negatively lead to unusually weak second quarter 
volume results. We continue to see further [unrest] in Europe slowing 
economic conditions across markets like Asia and Latin and social unrest in 
South East Euro
pe, Middle East and Brazil.
 
On top of this we were faced with unusually widespread wet and cold 
weather conditions across the multiple regions, including North America and 
across Northern Europe and India all of which impacted the entire industry.
 
Conseque
ntly we grew global volume 1% in the second quarter leading to 
year to date volume growth of 3%. Our comparable currency neutral 
operating income excluding structural grew 5% year to date. And both in the 
quarter and year to date we gained global volume an
d value share in non
-
alcoholic ready
-
to
-
drink beverages as well as in both sparkling and still 
beverages. These gains included volume and value share increases in 
corresponding juice, tea and water all of which underscored the real strength 
of our brands a
nd the global reach of our system.
 
While we are not happy with our second quarter volume performance, I can 
ensure you that we are intensely focused on improving those areas we can 
control to ensure better performance in the second half of the year. Lookin
g 
forward, we remain absolutely confident in our 2020 vision and in our 

 

occasionally be a bump in the
 
road and the real strength of a business is 
how you deal with that bump. In that respect together with our system 
bottling partners we continue to invest in our brand to strengthen our 
system for the future and to achieve our long term growth target. The 
fact 

our belief that we are navigating these circumstances in a way that further 
strengthens our position of leadership within this extremely vibrant and 
resilient beverage industr
y.
 
Let me now provide you with an overview of our business performance by 
operating group starting with North America. In North America, volume 
declined 1% in the quarter as a 4% decline in sparkling beverages offset 5% 
volume growth in our still beverage 
portfolio. Year
-
to
-
date volume in North 
America was even. Prior to this quarter we consistently grew our business in 
North America for 12 consecutive quarters. Unfortunately, we experienced 
an extremely wet and cold second quarter with more rain in the US 
in June 


Nevertheless we gained sparkling volume and value share both in the 
quarter and year to date reflec
ting the strength of our brand, and we have 
robust marketing plans in place for the balance of 2013.
 
Still beverages gained volume and value share in the quarter making this 
the 24
th
 
consecutive quarter that our still beverage portfolio has either 
maintain
ed or gained value share. Our growth in still beverages this quarter 
was led by strong performance across the ready to drink tea and packaged 
water categories with brands such as Gold Peak, smartwater and Dasani 
leading the way. Further, our volume and val
ue share gains in the juices and 
juice drinks category were driven by solid growth for Simply and Minute 
Maid.
 
We are confident that we are on the right track in North America and we 
continue to work diligently with our bottlers as we advance our refranchi
sing 
plan. Indeed, we saw a sequential improvement across the quarter in both 
the convenience retailer and quick service restaurant channel suggesting 
that the category trends are beginning to improve. While we do recognize 
that we still have work to do in
 
North America, we remain laser focused on 
the strategy that we have shared with you.
 
First, we are building a balanced portfolio of strong brands led by Coca
-
Cola 
and ensuring that our portfolio remains relevant to all generations of 
consumers and across 
all beverage occasions. Second, we are focused on 
translating this brand value into unsurpassed customer value by delivering 

continuously investing to build the capabilities we will
 
need to sustain and to 
repeat our success. These strategies are taking a real hold and we are 
building on them with the evolution of the United States franchise system 
announced earlier this year. We therefore believe we are well positioned to 
continue ou
tperforming the non
-
alcoholic ready to drink beverage industry 
for the balance of the year.
 
Turning now to Latin America, we grew volume 2% in the quarter and 3% 
year to date. Volume growth was a little softer in the quarter due to 
macroeconomic challenges
 
in the few major markets, specifically increase in 
consumer debt levels and higher food inflations along with concern over 
transportation fees contributed to some civil unrest and softer consumer 
spending in Brazil. In Mexico, weaker job creation and high
er inflation 
impacted disposable income resulting in reduced retail sales.
 
These macro factors led to low single digit volume growth in Mexico while 
volume results in Brazil were even. Given slower growth rate in personal 
consumption across the region, we 
estimate that year
-
to
-
date beverage 
industry growth rates are currently 1.5 to 2 percentage points lower than 
the average of the last four years in Latin America.
 
In the second quarter, we again gained volume share in Latin America in 
nonalcoholic ready
-
to
-
drink beverages including both volume share gains in 
both sparkling and still beverages.
 
Moving to brand performance, trademark Coca
-
Cola grew 1% during the 
quarter and maintained volume share within the sparkling beverages 
category. These results reflect
 
sustained marketing across the brand and the 
category. Our other sparkling brands grew volume and value share in the 
quarter as we expanded Mundet in Mexico and Fanta in Colombia while 
reigniting marketing behind Schweppes in both Brazil and Argentina.
 
Hi
gh single digit growth in still beverages led to volume share gains in the 
quarter. These results were driven by the expansion of Fuze Tea, continued 
strong performance of Del Valle portfolio and strong share gains in 
POWERADE, thanks to superior execution
 
of our programs. We expect that 
our Latin America group will return to rates of volume growth that we have 
been more accustomed to in the last few years given current dynamics.
 
Continued marketing and bottling investments along with solid execution 
plans 
for the second half of the year will also contribute to this 

the associates of Solar, our new bottling partner in Brazil. With the close of 
this transaction, Solar forms the second la
rgest operation in the Coca
-
Cola 
Brazil system serving over 70 million consumers.
 
Now, turning to Coca
-
Cola International starting with Europe. The weak 
economy continues to be a key factor affecting our performance in Europe 
especially in the southern reg
ions where unemployment remains high while 
consumer confidence and expenditures remain low.
 

goods category with several of those slowing between the first and second 
quarter. Additiona
lly, historically wet and cold conditions across Europe 
including the coldest spring for Germany in 40 years further dampens 
already weak consumer sentiment and industry trends and contributed to 
volume declining 3% in Germany in the quarter.
 
While our European volume fell 4% in the quarter and then down 2% year
-
to
-
date, we maintained the positive share momentum of the first quarter 
growing volume and value share across total nonalcoholic beverages and 
core sparkling beverages. Across the conti
nent, our team and bottling 
partners are activating a number of marketing and trade execution program. 
Among them is our new Share a Coke, summer campaign launched across 
Europe in May and early signs are very positive.
 
In fact, excitement surrounding the 
launch helps to partially offset the 
impact to weather on immediate consumption. Our current European outlook 
remains cautious for the time being given ongoing macroeconomic 
conditions. However, we believe with our commitment to our brands and 
execution, w
e should continue to gain share through the remainder of the 
year.
 
Moving on to our Eurasia and Africa group, we achieved 9% volume growth 
in the quarter, up double digits year
-
to
-
date. All business units grew in the 
quarter with our Middle East and North 
Africa business unit as well as our 
Central, East and West Africa business unit delivering double
-
digit growth.
 
For the quarter, we strengthened our competitive position as we gain 
volume and value share in nonalcoholic ready
-
to
-
drink beverages. Local 
exec
ution of our global marketing campaign along with continued highest 
pack innovation feels as good which was led by brand Coca
-
Cola up 7% in 
the quarter and 9% year
-
to
-
date.
 
Fanta and Sprite further contributed to core sparkling growth while our still 
brand
s grew double digits led by Rani, Crystal and Fuze Tea. Volume in 
Russia grew 3% with trademark Coca
-
Cola up double digits. The successful 
sparkling promotion fueled Coca
-
Cola Fanta and Sprite growth as consumers 
collected under the cap points to obtain a 
limited edition set of limited 
Winter Olympic glassware. In Spain and Portugal we are encouraged by the 
early integration efforts underway at efforts underway at Coca
-
Cola Iberian 
partners of Spain and Portugal. We now have eight bottlers in those markets 
now operating as a single entity.
 
Shifting to our Pacific group, we saw a volume growth of 2% and we 
maintained on our alcoholic ready to drink value share. As is well publicized, 

spending.
 

much of the growth in the non
-
alcoholic ready to drink beverage industry in 
the second quarter came from the value oriented water category. As a 
result, our volume performance in China rema
ins softened with even for the 
quarter cycling 7% growth from prior year. We command a leadership 
position in China in those (inaudible) and market share in sparkling as well 
as in juices and juice drink.
 
Sparkling volume grew 2% and our juices and juice d
rinks volume grew 7% 
year to date. This is driven by a solid execution of key consumer and 
commercial initiatives and continue our new product innovation. Looking 
forward, we are keenly focused on adjusting our strategies and improving 
our business in Chin
a. We recently strengthened our management team in 
that region adding to the already strong talents that we have in China and 
we are evolving our strategy, reallocating resources across our brand 
portfolio and strengthening our consumer communication. We a
nticipate a 
return to growth in our China business in the second half of the year.
 
In India, volume grew low single digits in the quarter cycling 20% growth 
last year and importantly we again improved our volume and value share of 
total non
-
alcoholic bever
ages as well as sparkling and still beverages further 
strengthening our competitive position as trademark Coca
-
Cola grew by 
double digit.
 
Our business in Japan delivered 1% volume growth while approximately 4% 
growth last year and we are seeing sequential 
improvements on share 
trends as we are moving through the year. Japan sparkling beverage volume 
grew 1% in the quarter supported by music team integrated marketing 
campaign such as the Zero Limit Campaign for Coca
-
Cola Zero up 13%.
 
Solid growth in tea and 
sport drinks of 3% and 7% respectively also 
contributed to this momentum. Our juice and coffee performance was below 
our expectation and we are keenly focused on strategies as new launches to 
improve performance in the second half of the year. I do want to
 
acknowledge and congratulate our Coca
-
Cola East Japan associates on the 
successful completion of their merger and the launch of their company on 
July 1. With this merger our system is building on a deep root and 50 year 
history of strong partnerships in J
apan. Coca
-
Cola East Japan will be well 
positioned to meet the business growth needs of our customers while also 
engaging and refreshing consumers of all ages and lifestyle.
 

cycling d
ouble digit growth from the previous year as Thailand, Indonesia 
and Vietnam all delivered strong double digit growth. Going forward we 

second half of the year.
 
On a global scale, we w
ere recently humbled by several accolades, including 

and receiving the 2013 Creative Marketer of the Year Award at the Cannes 
Lions International Festival.
 
In my 35 years of experi
ence in the Coca
-

--
 
how we participate in one of the fastest growing and most dynamic 
industries in the world. As I think about the second quarter, nothing has 
changed in our ability to continue winning in this industry. Th
ere is no 
question. There are systems commitment to superior execution with 
stronger than ever before and our business fundamentals remain firmly 
intact.
 
Our leadership team is firmly in place and I am confident in our ability to 
capitalize on the abundant
 

confident that we have the right strategy, we have the right vision and the 
right initiatives to drive long
-
term sustainable growth and value.
 
And our focus on achieving our 2020 Vision is unwavering with cur
rent 
dynamics leading us to believe that our performance will be better in the 
back half of the year. Why? Quite simply a few important reasons. First, our 
global brands are stronger than ever and we will continue to invest in them 
to capture long
-
term vol
ume and value share.
 
Second, we have an unparallel global business system focused on delivering 
on our 2020 Vision.
 
And third, we have great confidence in our plans and we will sharpen our 
focus to ensure our resources are directed to those strategic prior
ities that 
will drive our business and strengthen key markets will return to grow.
 
The nonalcoholic ready
-
to
-
drink industry is and has always 
--
 
and always will 
be a terrific, terrific business. We will continue to capitalize on our 
unprecedented global re
ach, a broad portfolio of preferred premium brands 
and superior system execution.
 
And we continue to invest alongside our global bottling partners. And we are 
well positioned to effectively manage our business for long
-
term profitable 

s economic environments and also as we look forward 
to our future.
 
With that, let me now turn the call over to Gary.
 
Gary Fayard
 
Thank you, Muhtar, and good morning, everyone. As Muhtar has shared, the 
industry clearly slowed a little due a number of facto
rs that impacted various 
markets around the world. The combination of these factors resulted in 
weaker volume performance in the second quarter than we expected. At the 
same time we recognize the need for improved performance in certain 
markets.
 
Having sai
d that, we remain absolutely focused on doing the right things for 
the long
-
term health of the business and investing for long
-
term sustainable 
growth. Increasing share during times like this further strengthens our 
position and can ultimately lead to acce
lerated growth as market conditions 
normalize. And we continue to win on this front gaining both global volume 
and value share in both total nonalcoholic ready
-
to
-
drink beverages, as well 
as volume and value share in global sparkling and still beverages.
 
S

drivers of our financial performance. Our second quarter and year
-
to
-
date 
financial performance reflects concentrate sales growth in line with unit case, 
volume growth, as well
 
as a strong increase in direct marketing expenses, as 
we sustain our commitment to invest in the health and the strength of our 
brands.
 
From an operating segment standpoint, our operating income growth this 
quarter reflected strong profit growth in Latin 
America and Eurasia, and 
Africa, as well as the continued solid financial performance of the Bottling 
Investments Group. Operating income in North America and Pacific was even 
while Europe experienced a slight decline in profit.
 
Comparable currency neutral
 
net revenue declined 1% this quarter and we 
were even year
-
to
-
date. However, excluding the impact of structural items, 
primarily the sale of the Philippines bottler, net revenues increased 2% both 
for the quarter and year
-
to
-
date.
 
We continue to earn pric
ing in the marketplace, but at a consolidated level 
the positive pricing was offset by the impact of geographic mix, resulting in 
even price mix for both the quarter and year
-
to
-
date.
 
Although geographic mix unfavorably impacted price mix at the consolidat
ed 
level, it contributed to the improvement of our gross margin in the quarter 
and year
-
to
-
date. Our comparable gross margin was 61.2%. This represents 
a slight improvement compared to the prior year primarily due to the impact 
of geographic mix, structura
l items and our foreign currency hedging 
program. As we shared in our first
-
quarter earnings call we expect our gross 
margin to moderate somewhat over the remainder of this year, primarily 
due to a shift in geographic mix.
 
Excluding the impact of 
structural items, we achieved 2 points of favorable 
operating expense leverage for both the quarter and year
-
to
-
date and we 
now expect to achieve low single
-
digit operating expense leverage for the 
full year. On comparable currency neutral operating income
, it was up 4% 
this quarter and year
-
to
-
date. Excluding the impact of structural items, 
operating income grew 5% year to date.
 
On a comparable basis, the impact of currency was a 3% headwind on this 

e positions, 
current spot rate and the cycling of our prior year rates, we expect 
currencies to be a 4% headwind on our operating income for the third 
quarter and full year. Below the line, we benefited from an increase in net 
interest income and improved 
tax rate and fewer shares outstanding due to 
our continued share repurchase program.
 
We expect net interest income in the second half of the year to be relatively 
in line with comparable net interest income year
-
to
-
date. Additionally, we 
now expect our ful
l year tax rate to be 23% and we expect to hold this rate 
through 2014.
 
Comparable earnings
-
per
-
share grew 4% in the second quarter despite 
currency headwinds of approximately 2%. Year
-
to
-
date comparable 
earnings
-
per
-
share also grew 4% despite currency hea
dwinds of 
approximately 4% as well as the impact of two fewer selling days. We 
continue to generate a strong 4 billion from cash from operations year
-
to
-
date providing a significant financial flexibility. As I have shared with you 
over the years we redeplo
y our cash flows utilizing a consistent and 
disciplined framework.
 
First is to reinvest back into the business and to strengthen our global 
system. Secondly to continue to expand our portfolio and capabilities 
through bolt
-
on acquisitions and partnerships.
 
Third, continue to return cash 
to shareholders through our dividends and we increased our dividend 10% in 
2013, our 51
st
 
consecutive year of dividend increases. And lastly, repurchase 
shares, year
-
to
-
date our net share repurchases totaled $2 billion and w
e 
continue to expect full year share repurchase to be between 3 billion and 3.5 
billion.
 
As you model our 2013 operating results, let me again remind you that the 

system will have 
a structural impact on our operating results over the 
remainder of the year. As you are aware, we closed the transaction in the 
Philippines earlier this year and the merger of our bottling partners in Brazil 
and Japan recently closed.
 
As I have shared in o
ur 2012 year
-
end call, we do not expect these 
transactions to have a material impact on our 2013 earnings results. 
However these transactions will impact various line items within our P&L. We 
anticipate that these transactions will have a 3% structural imp
act on our 
full year 2013 net revenues. Likewise our full year operating income results 
should see a 1% structural impact. However there should be a 
corresponding improvement in our equity income to account for our share of 
the results of these operations 
moving forward. Additionally, the structural 
impact from these transactions will be larger in the second half due to the 
impact of the deconsolidation of our Brazilian bottling operations beginning 
in the third quarter.
 
In closing, we delivered solid finan
cial performance for the first two quarters 
of 2013, and we expect to continue our solid financial performance during 
the second half of this year. Our company and our system are well
-
positioned to capitalize on the real opportunities for growth. We remain
 
very 
confident as we continue to win in the marketplace with volume and value 
share. We continue to deliver solid financial results. We continue to innovate 
and invest in our brands. Our global system continues to get stronger. And 
we are best positioned 
to continue factoring growth in the dynamic 
nonalcoholic ready
-
to
-
drink industry.
 
Operator, we are now ready for any questions.
 
Question
-
and
-
Answer Session
 
Operator
 
(Operator Instructions) And our first question today is from Bill Pecoriello 
from Consumer 
Edge Research.
 
Bill Pecoriello

Consumer Edge Research
 
Good morning, everybody. Muhtar, I was hoping if you could step around 
the world and dive a little bit deeper in the certain markets and regions to 
help us separate out the impact of non
-
recurring fac
tors that hit your second 
quarter versus any macro
-
related factors that can continue to pressure the 
business in the second half.
 
You had mentioned macro factors in Brazil, Mexico, Europe and China. Will 
those continue to be as big an impact in the second 
half of the second 
quarter and if not, why and then maybe you can help quantify maybe what 
you think the weather
-
related impact was in the second quarter?
 
Muhtar Kent
 
Hi Bill. Thanks. I think overall both from in Europe, United States, India and 
some other
 
parts we did have a pretty significant impact from weather, 
unusual weather, monsoons coming very early in India, as you probably all 
read, many thousands missing in flooding, worst flooding since the Tsunami 
back 10 years ago. And in Europe also, Central
 
Europe, Germany, all the 
issues around the river beds rising and flooding and very heavy wet 
conditions.
 
So we did, yeah, have impact both from a consumer sentiment, both from a 
mobility sentiment in the United States also, and both also from just pure in
 
some cases distribution issues that hindered our performance. And as you 
know, when we lose a sale that does not recur any more we lost it that day.
 
And so and also in some cases, we were cycling very unusually warm and 
favorable weather conditions from p
rior years in some cases. Like India last 
year, the monsoons actually started later that gave us a 20% growth in 
India unusual for the second quarter in India, usually the first half in India is 
always less than the second half in India because of the anom
alies of the 
weather.
 
So, yeah and then macro conditions, we all have felt it in social issues in 
Southeast Europe, the demonstrations across the Middle East and then more 
recently in Brazil. But we feel confident both in terms of looking at our plans 
in p
lace, looking at current dynamics at both Brazil will have a better second 
half. China will have a better second half, Russia will have a better second 
half and certainly better quarters than this last quarter where we grew 
volume 3% overall, Mexico as wel
l as India.
 
So while we continue to invest in our brands, our brands are stronger than 
ever before. We have taken market share, our system is stronger. Hence all 
these key markets we believe will perform better in the second half. In fact, 
as I said, we ha
ve seen this 
--
 
we always know that the second half in a 
country like India is significantly better than the first half. In any case, if you 
look back at our performance over last few years.
 

plans to 
return back to growth. So I 
--
 
we feel pretty confident that this was a 
confluence of events that happened all at the same time, the portfolio effect 
of our global business did not work in our favor in this particular case in the 
second quarter. A
nd I feel 
--
 
and my colleagues feel and our bottlers feel 
very confident.
 
I have been across many markets recently. I have traveled to China, Japan, 
Thailand, Myanmar, many other parts of Asia. I have been in the Southeast 
Europe. I have been in France and
 
all in the last sort of four
-
five weeks. And 
I feel that we will look towards definitely a better quarter volumetrically. And 
again, we can talk to you about how we feel about the financial numbers too 
later in the call. And I can ask Gary to reflect on t
hat too in terms of the 
second half. You want to 
--
 
Gary?
 
Gary Fayard
 
Sure. Well, let me continue on then, versus the volume. On the second half, 
on the P&L, I think we had a very solid first half. We would expect to have a 
solid second half of the year as
 

road, the industry had one and obviously it slowed but we continue to take 
share and we feel very confident about the second half. As we look at the 
second half financial results I think we will be very close to 
our long
-
term 
growth targets, particularly in volume and earnings per share should be 
coming back in line with what we would all have been expecting at the first 
of this year.
 
Muhtar Kent
 

not see 
this as a trend or a systemic issue and that is simply how I believe one 
should think about it. And again, I can ask Steve and Ahmet to reflect upon 
how they see the second half from their vantage point in both Americas and 
international maybe Stev
e, you can start.
 
Steve Cahillane
 
Sure, thanks Muhtar. Starting with Latin America, Muhtar said it well, we 


getting back to 
normal and we expect a better performance sequentially as we progress 
through the year in Brazil and in Mexico. In Latin center and south Latin 

lot still going 
very well that continue to go well in Latin America and Brazil 
and Mexico getting back to what we would expect to see on a normal basis.
 
In North America, Muhtar said it, we don't like to talk about the weather but 
the first half of last year saw unusually
 
good weather conditions. We had a 
warm weather, we had dry weather coming out of winter and going into 
spring. This year in North America we had some of the worst weather and 

lly 
wet and cold which obviously impacts our business. On top of that, we had 
the payroll tax effects which started at the beginning of the year which 
affects lower income households obviously much more, affects their 
disposable income, their ability to sp
end, we saw late payroll tax 
--
 
late 
payroll or tax refund coming into the marketplace. But as we look forward 
we expect the weather patterns to obviously normalize. The weather will not 
continue to be a factor in a country as big as the United States like
 

and from an economic standpoint, people are used to the payroll tax now. 


already starting to see be
tter trends in QSR, better trends in convenience 
retail, better trends across our business.
 
So we look forward to the second half of the year across the Americas much 
more favorably than the first half, Muhtar used the word anomaly, I think 
especially an a
nomaly in North America and we see ourselves coming out of 
that.
 
Ahmet Bozer
 


-
related. All our investments in the ro
ute to market, coolers and capabilities 


 
On China, there were probably impacts of 
--
 
as you hear the continuing 
slo
wdown in macro levels as well as there were some weather impacts. But 
we do expect volume to return for a number of reasons. First of all, China is 
a country with very, very low per capitas. I have been there a number of 
times in the last three, four month
s and we have been working on evolving 
our strategy with better OBPPC, more price points and more packs as well as 
improving our capability. As Muhtar mentioned, we have recently 
strengthened our management team there and I am very confident that in 
the se

maybe not at the levels of double
-
digit that you might have been seeing but 

 
Now the other anomaly in the international resu
lts was Europe. I can 
comfortably say that a very, very big part of that 4% decline was driven by 
unseasonable weather as it has already been mentioned. It shows the 
strength of our system that we were able to gain volume and value share in 
both sparkling 
and NARTD and as we see whether normalizing, we again 
look forward to coming back to our normal range of growth in Europe. The 
rest of international territories such as EAG continue to deliver the historical 
growth rate.
 
Gary Fayard
 
And Bill, this is Gary.
 
Just add one or two other quick data points as well. 
When we talk about 1% volume, I think you have to wonder, is that a weak 


 
The other thing is
 
we talk about some of these anomalies in some of these 
markets. One other things that give me some confidence as well, because 

markets and all around the world with the slowdown f
rom China, et cetera. 

consumption is less than $150 has always been a real strength of ours.
 
Well, again, even in the second quarter, if you look at those markets under 
$150 and exclude China a

you excluded those, our volume in those markets was plus 7% in the second 
quarter, so it still shows underlying strength of the market in those 
emerging markets.
 
Bill Pecoriello

Consumer Edge Research
 
G
reat. Thanks for the comprehensive answers.
 
Gary Fayard
 
Yeah.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question is from John Faucher from JPMorgan.
 
John Faucher 
-
 
JPMorgan
 
Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Gary, I just want to ask a clarification 
about the back half of 
the year. Your commentary on the financials, it 
sounds like you are saying, you are going to get to that level in the back half 
of the year not the back half of the year will get you to the long
-
term 

preted it, can you just 
sort of clarify that?
 
Gary Fayard
 

very close in the first half of the year. Year
-
to
-
date, if you look at operating 
income, I think, year
-
to
-
date, ex
-
structur
al currency neutral is plus 5% and 
our volume is plus 3%. So we are not that far away. So our view would be 
that we should be and that in fact, year
-
to
-
date earnings per share ex
-

.
 

followed us long enough. We like to be at the top end of ranges and not at 
the bottom end of ranges. Unfortunately, we are at bottom end right now, 

g with. But we feel very good about the 
second half.
 
John Faucher 
-
 
JPMorgan
 
Okay.
 
Muhtar Kent
 
John, this is Muhtar. Just one point that I can add to that is the following. 

when y
ou have a blip in your volume because of a confluence of events 
some of which are 
--
 
was not in your control. The first thing you do is go out 
and cut marketing, and I think if you look at our numbers, we have 
continued to invest aggressively in our brand 
through the second quarter, 
through the first 
--
 
in the first half and as you know every investment and 
marketing does not pay back in that quarter, it pays back in future quarters.
 
And therefore we are confident there was a share gain. We are confident 
wi
th the strength of our brands, we are confident about the metrics on our 
brands, both sparkling and stills across the world.
 

place in the second quarter that we can continue our mom
entum going into 
the second half of the year and also improve on it volumetrically, but also 
continue with our mission to achieve our 2020 Vision through the next years 
ahead.
 
John Faucher 
-
 
JPMorgan
 
Got it. Okay. Thanks. Then my actual question here 

positive price mix in the vast, I think in every region this quarter, with the 

price mix here. How do we view the regional price mix versus the geographi
c 
offset and how does this fit into your long
-


notable overhang? Thanks.
 
Gary Fayard
 
Okay. John, first, I want to compliment on your creativity with that 
first 

And the first thing I would say around pricing is, we believe strongly that we 
have premium brands and our brand should commend a premium in the 
market and they do commend a 
premium across the world. Number one, 
we're seeing pricing is rational and within the industry we think pricing is 
rational particularly in the United States.
 
But if you look at price mix and I am going to go year to date, but the 
second quarter is essenti
ally the same thing. If you look at price mix, price 
mix year
-
to
-
date is even but within that, you've got positive pricing and 

actually have positive 1% pricing. If you look at it by regio
n, year
-
to
-
date 
North America has positive pricing up 1%. Eurasia and Africa have positive 
piping up 8%, Europe has 
--
 
looks like positive pricing up 2% although I will 
tell you a lot of that is because of Innocent and our acquisition of the 
Innocent, so a
bsent Innocent, Europe is closer to flat. Latin America is 
positive 8 points of pricing year to date. Pacific is even and Bottling 
Investments group is plus 2 as well.
 

brand mix,
 

to us and where the dent comes in, if you will, is that we got negative 

many of those regions which brings us back to ev
en when you put price and 
geography together overall at the consolidated level. As I have often said, 
geographic mix would 
--
 
is always going to be probably negative because 
you're going to expect those emerging market countries to be growing faster 
than t
he developed market countries and you got better pricing in the 
developed market countries. What amplified a little bit this quarter 
particularly perfectly was the result in Europe that we talked about and 
North America being coming at even where they were
. So you put all that 

getting in the market.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question is from Judy Hong from Goldman Sachs.
 
Judy Hong 
-
 
Goldman Sachs
 
I just wanted to go back to the s
econd half expectations and clearly you 

more specifically on some of the actions that you're doing to improve the 
volume performance, particularly markets like China where there
 
is the 

just in terms of not participating in some of the fast growth segments. So 


bout your portfolio? Can you accelerate price pack 
architecture strategy more aggressively to really get the volume 

to be challenging?
 
Muhtar Kent
 
Judy, let me just take on that and I
 
will ask Ahmet Bozer to comment. But I 
think what we have said again is that it was a coming together of many 

--
 
we have 
performed overall globally at rates that are much more commensurate to 
wh
at you have been used to in the last three, four years. Despite the fact 


--
 
because of the fact that the 
portfolio works. In this time, y
ou have the issues in Latin America, in the two 
key markets Brazil and Mexico on slowing down and also consumer spending 
being impacted because of the Brazilian crunch in consumer credit that was 
taken away from the consumers. And generally the consumer sp
ending went 
away and then you also had China 
--
 
the issues in China that was 
--
 

documented across the macro numbers in China as well as the weather 
issues related to India and also other issues
 
coming together in North 
America where it went for the first time in 12 quarters from a plus to a 
negative, which we don't expect. All of these things we don't expect to 
continue at the same time. Some of these things may still continue to impact 
them. Th
erefore the portfolio will work.
 
Now related 
--
 
specific to the China. We are participating in two great 
categories in China and where the leaders which is sparkling and juices, 

our p
ortfolio and to our business in China.
 
We have also as we said retargeting all our efforts in China, refocusing all 
our efforts. Yeah, there is a different competitive landscape. We feel that 
actually that has not been the issue for us.
 
The main issue for 
us is to ensure that we can continue to distribute in 

those and also that our marketing and working which we feel definitely our 
brands are stronger. Our innovation pipeline is worki
ng in terms of what we 
are providing to the consumer, also in terms of packaging. And we feel that 
our confidence that those two categories 
--
 
playing in those two categories 
and then also innovating across some other categories like dairy is going to 
crea
te the growth and the value for us starting in the second quarter but 
also continuing.
 
And we also feel confident that the Chinese leadership, the new Chinese 

seeing that to repositi
on and transform the economy without creating a 
major bump as they transform the economy from a purely export economy 
to a more balanced economy with also consumer spending. And both deputy 
prime 
--
 
Vice Premier Yang in charge of the economy as well as the
 
new 
team, we feel confident have the plans in place to ensure that that takes 
place. So again, Ahmet, you can reflect more on that as well as any other 
markets you want to.
 
Ahmet Bozer
 
Yeah. Thanks Muhtar. Thanks Judy for the question. A couple of message
s 
here Judy, message number one is that economy may be down but the 
globe prospects in China even in the short term is there simply because of 
the very low level of capitals and strength of our system. Plan number two, 
if you look at all the competitors in
 
China, nobody really participate in all the 
categories. All the players have one or two categories that they are strong 
in. And then they drive their businesses through those categories and maybe 
expand into others.
 
Our position is the same. So our strate
gy basically, first of all, we definitely 
can do better in the categories that we already exist such as sparkling. So to 


running on 
various multi
-
serve and single serve packages for different price points in 

rolling some of them nationally. So those are already in a way in the market 
and they will 
be accelerated into the second quarter.
 

-

communicating more intensely on the intrinsics of our products as well as 
extrinsics. You might have heard about our nickname promotions that
 
the 
similar promotion to the Share a Coke promotion around the world outset 
which is getting incredibly positive reaction from the consumer. And all the 
other things of improving our route to markets et cetera, those are all under 


sparkling.
 

number one player there. We are refocusing our efforts back around Pulpy. 

 
into mango which is getting 
very strong consumer reaction. So as we consolidate our efforts behind that, 
you would see a continued increase.
 

have a pretty successful brand in Super
 
Milky Pulpy which is a value
-
added 

high single digits growth of that brand. And we are building our innovation 
pipeline for the future.
 

under lower economic environment, 

strengthening our position in China to capitalize on this market for not just 
immediate future but to very long term.
 
Muhtar Kent
 
We have Irial als
o, which oversees bottling investment group. And as you 
know, we are one of the three system players in China in terms of bottling 
maybe Irial you can comment on what you are seeing down very close to the 
ground.
 
Irial Finan
 
Yeah. Judy, good morning. And j
ust to build on something Muhtar said 
earlier which is around investment and I will tell you from a bottling 
perspective that we continue to invest heavily in the market, and particularly 
in our execution capability and route to market capability and criti
cally in 
developing the talent to be successful in the next years ahead. So when you 
[ask all] today, we vitalize marketing strategies, OBPPC, I actually feel very 
confident about the future. Yes, Yes, we may have bumps along the way but 
our business is gr
owing 
--
 
our challenge is to grow healthy long term 

the infrastructure and capability to really drive a success for the future and 
-
-
 

 
Muhtar 
Kent
 

than what it is. As Gary said earlier, we were fractionally away from 
rounding up to 2 and we could 
--
 
it would not have been hard for us to do 
something which would not be 
right for this business and take the volume up 
to 3 and selling low cheap product. That is not what we are about. We are 
about investing, we are about doing the right things for this business and we 
are about 
--
 
and I have always said, there may be bump al
ong the road, and 
at one bump along that we have grown this business consistently in line 
every year on an annual basis since 2008 on our way to our 2020 vision in 
the range and the upper range of our long
-
term growth plan despite very, 
very challenging ma
croeconomic conditions and that is going to happen in 
2013 also.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question is from Bill Schmitz from Deutsche Bank.
 
Bill Schmitz 
-
 
Deutsche Bank
 
Just two quick questions, what are the trends like recently? It seems like 

retty bullish in the back half. So as you exited June and got into 
July, it looks like some of the weather normalized. So what are you seeing 
more recently? And then kind of minutia but the big margin decline 

 
primary driver of that?
 
Muhtar Kent
 
Yeah let me just comment on what you just said. We are not 
--
 
this is not 
about managing on a day 
--
 
yet we manage this business on an hourly 

las
t two weeks. Yes, of course, we expect the weather to normalize. As you 
-
-
 
or whoever is in the Northeast now, and whoever was in the West Coast of 
the United States in the last 10 days, you know that weather 
--
 
it has 
--
 
it 
does normalize. Matter of fact,
 

happened all in a very short period of time where everything was negative in 

part of what we are saying. So I have every confidence 
that 
--
 
the 
normalized conditions as I said we will again 
--
 
2013 will be another year 
when volume will grow at the range of the long term growth model.
 
As far as the margins are concerned, I will turn it over to Gary in terms of 
the margin is concerned, w
hat you mentioned in terms of the margin 
numbers in Europe.
 
Gary Fayard
 


changed the margin. Just nothing more
 
than that.
 
Bill Schmitz 
-
 
Deutsche Bank
 
I got you. But so they should be down going forward though because of that 
--
 
because of Innocent is now fully consolidated?
 
Gary Fayard
 

 


but it gives us opposite effect on the margin.
 
Bill Schmitz 
-
 
Deutsche Bank
 


percentage has changed because of the price?
 
Gary Fayard
 
Yes, exactly right.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question is from Bryan Spillane from Bank of America.
 
Bryan Spillane 
-
 
Bank of America
 
Ga
ry, just a question for you related to share repurchases. With the stock 
the way it's performed in the second quarter, did you accelerate or do 
anything different in terms of timing of maybe pulling forward share 
repurchases? And then I mean the business r
ight now is kind of bouncing 
around the low end of your algorithm and the stock is kind of bouncing 
around in a pretty tight range here recently. So is there any consideration to 
maybe even buying back more stock than you originally planned just 
because yo

 
Gary Fayard
 

purchases in the first half of the year. As I said, if our annual target was in 
the $3 billion to 
$3.5 billion range and we actually have repurchased $2 
billion in the first half, we did exactly what you said and we accelerated in 

annual target which we originally set at $3 b
illion to $3.5 billion. And I just 

 
Bryan Spillane 
-
 
Bank of America
 
Okay. But not out of the realm of possibility that you could go higher if you 

 
Gary Fayard
 
I have learnt
 
to never say never to anything.
 
Bryan Spillane 
-
 
Bank of America
 
All right. Thank you.
 
Gary Fayard
 
Thank you.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question is from Mark Swartzberg from Stifel Nicolaus.
 
Mark Swartzberg 
-
 
Stifel Nicolaus
 
Yeah. Good morning 
everyone. Muhtar or Gary, question on the gross 

seems like one of the silver linings here is that the price pack architecture 

u to put up a 
pretty decent gross margin number and offset some of the corresponding 
earnings discipline that comes from the revenues being what they were in 
the quarter.
 

going on i
n terms of innovation, not in terms of the price, the pack but in 

problems you are facing kind of from a larger share performance absolute 
NARTD performance perspective?
 
Gary Fayard
 
Okay. Perhaps Mark, let me take the margin question and then we can come 
back to the innovation question. But this is actually 
--
 
let me get back into 
actually what I talked about price mix and margins when I was talking about 
(inaudible). The same thing a
pplies actually at a higher level for the total 

and that being offset by geographic mix.
 

in the quarter t
hat actually 
--
 
this is counter intuitive but it actually improves 
margins, okay, because North America having the finished product business 
has lower margins. So our expectation is, number one, to continue to get 

ional in pricing and we intend to say 
premium, as I said earlier.
 

in the second half of the year which will actually put pressure on margins 
which is why we said earlier that we woul
d expect gross margins to 


 
Mark Swartzberg 
-
 
Stifel Nicolaus
 
It does, yeah, but absolutely the geographic headwind is where at it i
s.
 
Gary Fayard
 
Yeah.
 
Muhtar Kent
 

at innovation only as ingredients. We look at it as packaging ingredients, 
equipment, even in terms of marketing social media, the brand price pac
k 
channel, architecture, occasion architecture. All of that is working for us and 
also in terms of our new campaign to be part of the solution around the 
world working closely with local governments, national governments, 
working with Government of Mexico,
 
working with Mayors in Chicago and 
San Antonio, other parts of the United States in different states in Atlanta.
 

working and freestyle and the next generation of what is behind 
--
 
wh

coming next after that. We are working on a host of new innovation. So also 
ingredients, continue to work with our partnerships across the world in 
different incubators around the world. The best we always believe here in 
the Coca
-
Cola Company, the be
st ideas are outside.
 
So, the plant bottle came from the outside from one of the incubators in 
India. Many new ideas are coming from different incubators in Israel or in 
China or in Japan or in Latin America. We have many 
--
 
we have substantial 
partnership
s from here with the University of Georgia to across many 
institutions around the world in Techno Parks. So, yeah, we are very active 
and we are content that we have the right pipeline and maybe I can ask 
Steve to reflect on from just a sort of North Ameri
ca and Americas 
perspective.
 
Steve Cahillane
 
Yeah. Thanks, Muhtar. From a 
--
 
starting with the Latin America perspective, 
we have got Coca
-
Cola Light which we are picking up in Argentina, which 

ng some 
terrific innovation around our I Lohas platform in juices in Latin American, as 
well as in North America, we have launched Fruitwater, brand new product 
off to a very good start. Powerade Zero drops have joined Dasani drops is a 
very exciting innov
ation. (Inaudible) active which is a fusion between sports 
drink and energy kicked off in April, again off to a very good start.
 
From a packaging perspective, we continue to innovate around our price
-

ling IT cans in our 
major packages. We have got Taylor Swift slim cans coming into the 
marketplace. We have got 19.2 ounce sparkling cans coming into the 
marketplace, again lots of excitement around the packaging innovation.
 
In terms of some marketing inno
vation, we have got Coke Zero which is 
going to be launched in college game day this fall which we are very excited 
about. We have got Cappy Free, Coke Zero coming into the marketplace. We 
feel very good about that, really building out the Coke Zero platfo
rm as an 
all
-
day brand.
 
So we have got lots in the marketplace and lots more coming into the 
marketplace, and it builds on one of Muhtar's earlier points that throughout 
this rough period of time, we have continued our marketing pressure. We 
continued our 
marketing investment. We have not cut it, we have increased 
it and it allows us to continue to innovate and bring new innovation into the 
marketplace.

That's helpful. If I could simply follow up on the subject of a stevia
-
based 
sweetener in the brand on the door so to speak, Coca
-
Cola we have seen 
what you have said recently about globally ticking down, the portion of your 
volume that is in the full cal portion of your business. Should we infer here 
that there is an increas
ed resolve to use organic sweeteners against the 
main brand here and there is some optimism globally for that potential?
 
Muhtar Kent
 

provide the right portions at the 
right time for the right consumers in the 
right environment. And we 
--
 
I think that you should read that we have an 
increased resolve to use any specific ingredient. It is all about ensuring that 
we do have viable light and low
-
calorie versions for everyon
e of our major 
brands available to the consumer, ensure that we pack label transparently, 
ensure that we have active lifestyle programs as per all our global 
commitments and ensure that we have a responsible marketing. That's our 
-
-
 
those are full commitme
nt.
 
And our business, we have said many times, is about brand. Today, we have 
$16 billion brands, they are growing. We have in the pipeline another 19 
brands that are bigger than $750 million in revenue and less than a $1 
billion. Those all are going to be
come billion dollar brands in the next 
increment of time because they are growing and we are confident that we 
will have multiple billion 
--
 
more billion dollar brands than we have today. 
And I think that is what this business is all about, adding value th
rough 

billion dollar brands to our roster in the near future.

Great. Thank you, gentlemen.

Thank you. Our next question is from Ali Dibadj 
from Bernstein.

Hi, guys. So I think the general theme of my couple of question is really we 
are all trying to figure out, which is what's going to get better from here and 
why, and not only in terms of volume but also in terms of so
me of the other 
key drivers of profitability.
 
So, if I may, my first question is around North America, and although you 
say in the press release you remain committed to rationale pricing, price mix 
is only at 1% and I guess, you think volumes would have be
en down more 
than negative 4%, if you have taken more than 1% pricing.
 
So taking 2% to 3% pricing or can we hope for that part of the business, the 
pricing in North America improving going forward? And as a follow up to that 
and a completely different per 
cap market like China, moving up to Ahmet 
point second ago. I just want to get a better sense of if evolving a strategy 
has anything to do with increased price promotion as well as it sometimes 
does with some companies?
 
Muhtar Kent

pricing strategy in North America is consumer based and it continues to be 
consumer based. We captured, if you look at Nielsen, we captured very good 
pricing across o
ur portfolio in North America. We think it was an appropriate 
amount of pricing by channel.
 
The unfortunate 4% volume decline was, as we said, had a lot more to do 
with weather and the economy, at least 60% to 70% having to do with a 
one
-
time really poor w


price increases in the marketplace and we maintained our margins and we 
maintained our price strategy going forward.
 
And we continu
e to bring new products and new packages into the 
marketplace to help our whole architecture achieve the type of pricing that 
we deserve. And we have given some examples of this in the past and a 
good one is our 1.25 liter which continues to be very succes
sful, a third of 
the 1.25 liter volume is in fact incremental volumes.
 
So it's good in of itself, but it has also allowed us, if you look at our 2 liter 
pricing over the course of the past 12, 15 months, we are out of the $0.99 
price promotion for 2 liter 
and has been for quite some time.
 
So, we are not going to, we are not going to put too much price in the 
marketplace. We take appropriate price based on what the consumer and 
what is right for the consumer and what is right for the customer, and we 
fully e
xpect that based on the price plans we have in place for the back half 
of the year, based on the innovations we have on the back half of the year 

second quarter.

Bernstein
 
Okay.
 
Gary Fayard
 

absolutely no plans for increased price promotion. In fact, the reason for 
having an evolving OBPPC is to have more sustained volumes at the right 
price point and t
he right tax for all the consumers.
 
Now, to give you an example, you might be familiar that there has been a 
lot of upsizing going on in China and we have launched our 300 ml package 
last year. Now, we will tactically respond to such upsizing to be able to
 

--
 
those are limited 
practical moves rather than a strategy to have increased price promotions. 
So, that's not really in the cards.
 
Now, to maybe build on this a little bit and also to address some of
 

can, either slim can or sleek can and small PET lounges all across the 
international territory, all across Europe, all across Eurasia
-
Africa Group and 
some of the Pacific market
s. That, I believe, is an important innovation in a 
way and also allows us to drive revenue and gross margin.
 
In addition to that, let also keep in mind that we have some very successful 
products such as Pulpy that hasn't been fully launched in all of our 
international territory. Eurasia
-
Africa Group, for example have taken that 
and they have launched it in Morocco in a very short period of time, we were 
able to achieve 20 plus percent market share with that launch.
 
We've just had a recent launch of extensi
ons of coffee into PET in Japan in 
the CVS channel recruiting female consumers. We are quite happy and 
pleased with the results of that. We have been innovating energy drinks in 
Russia and Turkey by expanding them into PET packages, re
-
sealable PET 
package
s that the consumers want. So, we continue to innovate in different 
packages, different categories across our international territory, as well as 
using successful innovation from the previous years.
 
Muhtar Kent
 
Thank you, Jackson, Irial, Steve, Ahmet 
and Gary. Our business continues to 
grow and to capture global volume and value share even in the midst of 
ongoing global economic challenges. And importantly, we do not manage our 
business for the short
-
term but rather for the medium and long
-
term. And 
as
 
I mentioned earlier, our focus on achieving our 2020 Vision is unwavering 
with current dynamics leading us to believe that our performance will be 
better in the back half of this year and beyond. As always, we thank you for 
your interest, your investment 
in our company and for joining us this 
morning.

Muhtar Kent
 
Thank you, Jackson, and good morning, everyone. We delivered sequential 
volume growth in the third quarter while capturing g
lobal non
-
alcoholic 
ready
-
to
-
drink beverage value share for the 25th consecutive quarter. We 
gained volume and value share across core sparkling, juice and juice drinks, 
sports drinks and ready
-
to
-
drink teas. Importantly, we were able to do this 
in combina
tion with a 2% increase in price mix.
 
Excluding the impact of structural items, we generated comparable currency 
neutral net revenue growth of 4% and strong operating income growth of 
8%. Our broad diversified product portfolio, the disciplined approach to
 
extracting and reinvesting savings and our global geographic reach are 
enabling us to effectively navigate a still uncertain macroeconomic 
environment. History has taught us that when we invest through difficult 
times, we emerge even stronger.
 
This quarte
r our system delivered the highest number of servings ever 
reported in the third quarter both for brand Coca
-
Cola and across our 
portfolio. In all, we delivered 181 billion servings thanks to global volume 
growth of 2% driven by 2% global growth in brand C
oca
-
Cola. This record 
number of servings speaks not only to our systems worldwide strength, but 
also to the opportunities ahead of us as we engaged with the next
-
generation of global consumers. Our global still brands also delivered solid 
results, growing 
3% and gaining global value share. These third quarter 
results bring our year
-
to
-
date volume growth to 2% cycling 5%.
 
In line with our expectations for the third quarter, we delivered sequential 
volume growth in many key markets including North America, Ch
ina, India 
and regions across Europe. That said, clearly the global economy remains 
challenged as noted by the International Monetary Fund last week, which 
trimmed this forecast for global output for the sixth time since early last 
year.
 
And as we have all
 
noted, emerging markets have become increasingly more 
volatile further exacerbating a challenging global landscape. Hence, 
disposable income and consumer spending have become challenged and 
consequently have impacted the overall growth of the non
-
alcoholi
c ready
-
to
-
drink industry.
 
Yet, despite these ongoing headwinds, our business remains healthy and we 
continue to invest in the strength of our brands. We are fully implementing 
our productivity and reinvestment plans and together with our global 
bottling p
artners we continue to advance our system. All of this leads us to 
remain confident in our ability to drive our volume growth trajectory back in 
line with our long
-
term growth model over time.
 
Looking first to our operations in North America, brand Coca
-
Co
la grew an 
impressive 2% in the quarter, leading our total beverage portfolio to 2% 
growth on top of 2% growth in the prior quarter 
--
 
in the prior year quarter. 
Year
-
to
-
date volume growth in North America is even as we cycled 2%.
 
Sparkling beverages were 
even in the quarter with sparkling price mix 
increasing 1%. Year
-
to
-
date, sparkling price mix is up 2% as we remained 
committed to a rational pricing environment.
 
We also remained focused on consistent investments in packaging 
innovation, in immediate cons
umption growth and increased teen 
recruitment, all of which are yielding positive results.
 
Specifically, packages like the 1.25 liter and mini packs 
--
 
mini can packs 
have increased our household base by more than 1.8 million in the last year. 
In addition,
 
Coca
-
Cola has generated over $19 million incremental 
immediate consumption transactions year
-
to
-
date and importantly, Coca
-
Cola remains the most preferred beverage brand amongst teens by 2 to 1 
margin.
 
Still beverage volume grew a solid 5%, with volume an
d value share gains 
across the energy, juice and juice drinks, water and tea categories. In sports 
drinks we gained volume share while maintaining value share.
 
As these results indicate, our revenue growth management strategies are 
working and enabling our
 
system to provide consumers the brand they love, 
the convenience that they crave and the value that they need, while also 
expanding our topline. We continue to outperform the industry, gaining 
volume and value share across both sparkling and still categor
ies.
 

our North America system as our North America team continues to advance 
discussions with existing and prospective partners who are eager to be part 
of this dynamic franchise sys
tem.
 
Turning now to Latin America, our volume growth was even in the third 
quarter, cycling 5% growth and coupled with a double
-
digit increase in price 
mix, due primarily to continued and disciplined focus on price and pack 
architecture enhancements, as we
ll as inflationary environments in some 
markets. Across the region we gained non
-
alcoholic ready
-
to
-
drink volume 
share, making this the 25th consecutive quarter that we maintained or 
gained volume share.
 
Similar to what we have experienced in other markets
, we are seeing a 
slowdown in economic growth in Mexico and Brazil. Falling GDP growth rates 
have led to slower growth rates in personal consumption and consequently 
in non
-
alcoholic ready
-
to
-
drink beverages.
 
As in other instances where we have witnessed e
conomic slowdowns in 
recent years, we are expanding our marketing efforts, while actively working 
with our bottling partners to invest in these markets and to offer consumers 
attractive price pack combination. Examples include the expansion of 
returnable g
lass bottle distribution and initiatives to ensure affordability tied 
to magic price points. Outside of Mexico and Brazil, we experienced solid 
performance with volume growth of 4% in the quarter.
 
Moving on now to Europe, we again witnessed diverging resul
ts with 3% 
volume growth in Northern European countries, offset by a 5% volume 
decline in countries that make up Central and South Europe for a net decline 
of 1% in our European business in the third quarter. In spite of this 
challenging environment, we ga
ined volume share in core sparkling across 
the entire continent while continuing to strengthen our competitive positions 
across the non alcoholic ready
-
to
-
drink beverage industry in our Central and 
Southern European business unit.
 
Price mix increased 8% in
 
the quarter, including the impact of the 
consolidation of Innocent. Our Share a Coke campaign was extremely well 
received. We placed over 2.5 billion customized packages into the market to 
drive team recruitment and further bolster immediate consumption.
 
Lastly, our operations in Germany continued to perform well delivering 3% 
growth in the quarter cycling 3%. This performance was fuelled by high 
single digit growth in brand Coca
-
Cola and double
-
digit Coke Zero growth. 
Sprite and Fanta also contributed to 
growth in the quarter in Europe.
 
The Eurasia and Africa group grew 4%, cycling 11% as we maintained focus 
on broadening distribution, honing our marketing efforts and strengthening 
brand loyalty in the more than 80 countries that make up our business in 
th
is dynamic region. Volume growth grew 4% led by brand Coca
-
Cola which 
grew 3% and Sprite which grew 4%. Still beverage volume grew 3% in the 
quarter. The Eurasia and Africa group maintained volume share in 
nonalcoholic ready
-
to
-
drink beverages while growin
g volume share in 
sparkling beverages and juice and juice drinks.
 
Both the Middle East and North Africa business unit and the Central East and 
West Africa business unit maintained their strong first half volume 
performance in the third quarter. On a year
-
t
o
-
date basis, the Eurasia and 
Africa group is up high single digits, cycling 10% growth and has been an 
important contributor to our year
-
to
-
date performance. Our Pacific group 
delivered 5% growth in the quarter improving sequentially from the second 
quart
er and cycling 4% from the prior year quarter. Sparkling beverages led 
with 5% growth as Brand Coca
-
Cola delivered 7% growth and Sprite grew 
5%. Still beverage volume also grew 5% in the quarter, while cycling 7% 
growth.
 
As noted, our second 
--
 
as noted du
ring our second quarter call, we 
anticipated a better second half of the year in China and I'm pleased to 
report that we were able to deliver 9% volume growth in the quarter, led by 
8% growth in sparkling beverages. Earlier this year, we began to evolve ou
r 
strategies in China to reflect the current economic and competitive 
environment and also to position ourselves for continued sustainable profit 
growth.
 
Our business in India delivered 6% growth in the quarter, cycling double 
digits. We achieved this grow
th while increasing prices across our juice 
brands to offset higher cost of goods. In addition, volume grew by strong 
double digits through September once the impact of the extended monsoon 
abated. Brand Coca
-
Cola again led the way with 22% growth in the q
uarter.
 
We are pleased with these results and with our solid volume and value share 
gains across sparkling and still beverages in India. Looking ahead, we have 
strong marketing programs planned for the fourth quarter of this year and 
into next year. I'm pa
rticularly excited about two iconic marketing programs 
that will ignite consumer passions across key markets. Specifically, the 
Olympic Torch relay recently started [ph] from Asian Olympia as it begins its 
relay journey across Russia. And the FIFA World Cu
p Trophy Tour is also 
underway with stops planned in 89 countries where passions for football run 
high.
 
Further, throughout our company's history we've always been at the 
forefront of cultural change in forming the conversation, inspiring our youth 
to act 
and bringing resources to our local communities all across the world. 
This legacy has sprained our thinking about forging effective and lasting 
partnerships, creating shared value, making a positive societal difference in 
areas that are of critical importa
nce to our business specifically water, 
woman and wellbeing.
 
Returning to our global performance, we benefited from marked sequential 
improvement in several key markets. We achieved robust and widespread 
growth of our flagship brand and we delivered solid 
financial results.
 
Our efforts to enhance the health of our system are working as evidenced by 
our broad based growth improving execution and strong cash generation. At 
the same time, we also acknowledged that we have more work to do as we 
will no doubt fa
ce headwinds as we work towards our 2020 vision.
 
Nevertheless the non
-
alcoholic ready
-
to
-
drink beverage industry is a vibrant 
and rewarding business to compete in and our business has consistently 
grown. And I can assure you that underlying forces that sha
ped our 2020 
vision just a few years ago remains very much intact today.
 
Together with our global system partners, our roadmap is enabling us to 
strategically invest both through good times and challenging times to deliver 
long
-
term sustainable performance
.

Thanks Muhtar and good morning everyone. Our third quarter results 
underscore several key points. First, the global economy is still struggling to 
recover with increasing volatility across emerging mark
ets.
 
Second, slowing economic growth clearly impacted consumer spending and 
overall non
-
alcoholic ready
-
to
-
drink industry growth in the quarter. And 
third, in spite of these macro trends, our strategies and solid execution 
enabled us to once again capture 
global value share and to deliver solid 
financial performance.
 
As Muhtar said we grew our global volume 2% in the quarter while at the 

sequential volume improvement, we remained fo
cused on further advancing 
our volume growth trajectory over time.
 
Concentrate sales were slightly below unit case volume growth in the quarter 

-
to
-
date.
 
Moving onto our financial results, each of our geographic o
perating units 
contributed to comparable currency neutral operating income growth in the 
quarter. Comparable currency neutral net revenues were even both in the 
quarter and year
-
to
-
date, excluding the impact of structural items, this 
would primarily be the
 
Philippines and Brazil bottler, net revenues increased 
4% for the quarter and 3% year
-
to
-
date. We realized a healthy 2% global 
price mix for the quarter and 1% price mix year
-
to
-
date. Importantly, year
-
to
-
date price mix was positive across each of our geo
graphies with the 
exception of the Pacific due to geographic mix.
 
Also as you know, we consolidated the Innocent brands in Europe which 
helped our price mix in the quarter but just to be clear our global price mix 
was 2% without the Innocent brands benefit
.
 
As expected, our gross margins moderated somewhat this quarter due to 
geographic mix. We expect our full
-
year gross margins to be relatively in line 
with our year
-
to
-
date comparable gross margins. Excluding the impact of 
structural items, we achieved fiv
e points of favorable operating expense 
leverage for the quarter while we continued to support our brands through 
increased marketing investments.
 
Our operating expense leverage now stands at three points year
-
to
-
date and 
we expect low single digit leverag
e for the full year. As a reminder, we are 
cycling the reversal of expenses related to one of our long
-
term incentive 
plans in the fourth quarter of last year.
 
Our comparable currency neutral operating income was up 7% this quarter 
and 5% year
-
to
-
date, exc
luding the impact of the structural items, operating 
income grew 8% in the quarter and 6% year
-
to
-
date. Therefore we now 
expect our full
-
year operating income to be generally in line with our year
-
to
-
date performance.
 
On a comparable basis, the impact of c
urrency was a 5% headwind on this 

to the 
--
 
and this is due to the weakening of many of the emerging market 
currencies. We now anticipate continued currency headwinds will have an 
u
nfavourable impact on the operating income in the 5% to 6% range in the 
fourth quarter.
 
Comparable earnings per share grew 4% in the third quarter, despite 
currency headwinds of about 5%. Year
-
to
-
date comparable earnings per 
share also grew 4%, despite hea
dwinds from currency of about 4%. We 
generated $7.7 billion in cash from operations year
-
to
-
date and have 
repurchased $2.7 billion of our shares in line with our plans to repurchase $3 
billion to $3.5 billion this year. Equity income came in lower than in 
the prior 
year quarter due to the ongoing challenging macroeconomic conditions 
around the world. We expect equity income will continue to be impacted by 
these factors.
 
Let me now provide you just with a couple of reminders as we look through 
the balance of
 
the year. Looking forward as mentioned in our second quarter 
earning call, we anticipate that bottling transactions, including the impact of 
the deconsolidation of our Brazilian bottling operations early in the third 
quarter, will have a 3% structural imp
act on our full year 2013 net revenues. 
Likewise, our full year operating income results should see a 1% negative 
structural impact.
 
In closing, we are strategically navigating through these challenging 
macroeconomic times, investing in our business to ste
adily strengthen our 
competitive position and to drive balanced growth and long term sustainable

Good morning. Muhtar, I was hoping for more granularity on emerging 
markets given the
 
Q3 slowdown, particularly in Latin America, which was in 
contrast to some improvement we saw in China and India. So can you give 
us an update on macro environment as you look around the world and also 
some of the strategies you mentioned you were implemen
ting, are you 
gaining traction at this point from a market share standpoint and should we 
expect to see volume performance in emerging markets improve as we look 
out going forward from here?
 
Muhtar Kent
 

tant to realize that there 
are different timings across the world to some of the volatility in 
macroeconomics and particularly what's interesting for us which is 
disposable incomes. So I think China has already had a slowdown and is 
beginning to recover. W

GDP, per capita and disposable income. So also important to realize that 

each other one to one. And so we do see an improvement in Sout
heast Asia, 
and parts of certainly China where things have stabilized and things 

 
people 
are beginning to normalize their sort of habits.
 

from emerging markets, market stock exch
anges in countries back into 

in Eurasia, in countries like Turkey and other countries 

 
and certain other 
countries in North Africa. So yes, those are 

 
and you can track stock 
exc
hange indexes and you can track disposable income growth or slowdown. 
They are all very related and we do see that the world is not just one city or 
one sort of element of volatility.
 
There are different pockets of volatility happening at the same time. An
d 
what we are fortunate with is a great portfolio, a wonderful portfolio where 


 
we 

China is the same, Southeast Asia,
 
ASEAN similar, Philippines also pretty 
much in that camp and then, we certainly also see that we still got some 
headwinds maybe in other parts of the world. So there are some tailwinds 
coming and some headwinds coming, and we continue to invest in our 
bra
nds.
 
And when you look at our performance, we have sequential improvement in 
many parts of the world, particularly when you look at places like India, 
places like China, ASEAN, even also developed markets such as Australia 
and also South Africa.
 
And our Af

Sub
-
Saharan Africa that are usually sort of south of 80 per capita, again 
grew in a very healthy manner this past quarter about 5% up and we expect 
Africa to continue to generate a good result
s and economies in Africa seem 
to be pretty buoyant and seem not to be too impacted. But of course, they 
are at a very slow level of their per capita development as well. I hope that 
helps.

of the strategies you are implementing, 
do you think, it is helping to drive an improvement in market growth at all or 
drive market share gains and do you feel comfortable that emerging market 
trends have bottomed in general at this point and we should se
e some 
improvement going forward or is it still too volatile to call right now?
 
Ahmet Bozer
 

we have a very, very sharp focus on, I was down in Latin America recently, 
a month
 
ago. I have visited many countries in Africa recently, as well as in 
Asia. That we have an incredibly sharp focus on brand price pack channel 
architecture, new price points, lower price points, more focus on 
affordability, more focus on returnable packs a
nd smaller packs, individual 
packs, that helped continue to keep the drinkers base growing, which is key 
and essential to when economies also start turning up and when disposable 
income start heading north.

Good morning, everybody.
 
Muhtar Kent
 
Good morning.

Consumer Edge Research
 
Muhtar, critics
 

stock price pointing to the slowing emerging market growth you were just 
talking about, declines in Diet soft drinks, some say the pricing in U.S. is 
irrational and inability to grow in big m
arkets like U.S. and Mexico? Could 
you explain why you still see solid growth ahead for the company and what 
the company is doing in terms of innovation, productivity, you mentioned 
price pack earlier to drive that growth and why the critics who declared t
he 
growth story is over are wrong? Thanks.
 
Muhtar Kent
 
Yeah. Thanks, Bill. First, philosophically, from a strategic point 
--
 
vantage 
point, the whole story of balanced growth we believe is still very intact, 
balance being growth in western markets, growth 
in emerging markets, 
balance being growth in sparkling and growth in still beverages and you see 
that happening in this past quarters as well. So we have grown in markets 
like United States, which we believe is a long
-
term growth market and when 
you think 
about it 14 of the last 
--
 
of the last 14 consecutive quarters, we 
have grown in all but one of them and now we have generated again 2% 
growth with 2% growth of brand Coca
-
Cola.
 
So we, Australia grew, many important markets in Western Europe grew, 
Germany 
grew again 3%, countries in Northwest Europe generated good 
healthy growth for us. So, and then emerging markets. Yes, there are some 
headwinds that are happening in emerging markets but we believe they are 
very temporary.
 
The whole demographic, the whole 
investment, the whole story of 1 billion 
new middle class still holds very strong in our opinion by 2020 over this last 
--
 
this past decade that we are in, this decade that we are in, a 1 billion new 
middle class, that bodes very well for our 
-
 
the industr
y we are in and we 
believe we can continue to generate very healthy good growth. We believe 
we can continue to generate very healthy price earnings 
--
 
I mean, I'm 
sorry, price mix and we believe that therefore like in this past quarter, which 
was where we 
did see a lot of headwinds, we generated 4% revenue growth 
and 8% currency neutral operating income growth. And we believe that 
there is 
--
 
we had a lot of headwinds. So as economies begin to move, I 

met as well to make 
some comments on this and if need be also ask Steve to add his 
commentary.
 
Ahmet Bozer
 
Bill, you mentioned a few items, I will just focus on a couple of them. 
Emerging markets as you would know if you look at the history that it 
goes 
through cycles. So it has a cycle of years and years of growth and every now 
and then you have economic headwinds and you managed through that. But 
the emerging growth 

 

over and we have a formula wh
ich pretty much closely shows that as 
personal consumption grows, we actually grow with it.
 
Now having said that in some of the emerging markets where there might 
be personal consumption and macro headwinds, we can still grow, like India 
because we have ve
ry low per caps and we have significant investments in 
feet on the street, infrastructure, brands. We are just really building our 
business and India showed that again this year. So that's what I would say 
about your comment of the emerging market. The gro
wth story there is far 
from over for a long time to come. And I guess, the rest were about U.S. 
pricing and decline in soft drinks. So maybe I should just pass that on to 
Steve.
 
Steve Cahillane
 
Yes. Thanks, Ahmet. First, I'd just underscore on the broader 
question what 
Muhtar said in his prepared remarks that in this quarter, we delivered the 
highest number of servings ever reported in the third quarter. So I think that 
bodes well for our growth story going forward. But with regards to North 
American pricin
g, which I heard you asked, Bill, and in particular sparkling 
price, we feel good about delivering positive price mix in the quarter of plus 
1%, in line with our strategy to consistently earn at least one to two points 
of sparkling with consumers.
 
And the 
U.S. Coke system remains committed to taking rational pricing and 

two to three points of price mix in sparkling beverages and across our total 
portfolio in both 2011 and 2012. Year
-
to
-
date we are 2% sparkling price 


-
centric pricing. And if I 
can give you an example of that 
--
 
the average price today of an eigh
t
-
ounce serving of Coca
-
Cola is $0.25, exactly $0.25. This is up over 5% 

compares very favorably to the U.S. inflation market.
 
And this tells me really three things: First, at $0.25 
we do not have an 
affordability issue. Coca
-
Cola remains a very affordable indulgence. Two, 
we've been able to earn price above inflation in the United States. And 
three, we still have plenty of room to continue to take price. But now 
addressing the third 
quarter in particular, we acknowledge we did 
strategically invest in select promotional activity in the back half of the 
summer through the Labor Day holiday. Given that we essentially didn't 
have much of a 4th of July holiday, a Memorial Day holiday, this
 
Labor Day 
acted much more like a 4th of July holiday. But these investments were tied 
to specific occasion
-
based brands and packages to help drive incremental 
household penetration which they did, attract more consumers into the 
category, which happened a
nd is very much in line with our longstanding 
North American strategy.
 
And all of these activities that we did, all of them to take price in the 
marketplace, I think, set us up very well to take more price in this quarter 
and going into 2014. So we are ver
y confident that the pricing environment 
in North America remains very rational and we will able to continue to earn 
price in the marketplace in this quarter and going forward into next year.
 
Muhtar Kent
 
Yes, just let me round up that question with one fin
al remark, Bill. And that 
is that once again, if you take our world average per capita of around 90, 
just under 90, you take the most populous nations of the world that are less 
than half of that per capita. India, China, Indonesia, way below that number, 
way below half of that number. We believe this and many other parts of the 
world as well in Africa, the youngest billion, we believe that 
--
 
we believe the 

are growing while others 
are not at the moment and our business and 
balance portfolio is built for times like these. So we see this as a time of 
opportunity.

with response to it, may be some thoughts about elasticity and then finally 
just any concern that there is spillover into other m

helpful?
 
Muhtar Kent
 
Yes. Look Bryan, firstly let me just address that by saying regressive taxes 
do not work. And wherever we have seen them being implemented, in some 
cases they have been taken away by the government after two, three 
years. 

implemented and so the consumer suffers and then its proven time and time 
after again.
 

the government of

President Pena Nieto. And we need to understand that

with health policy. In order to address the health policy properly, we have to 
come and work together with government and with c
ivil society to raise their 
awareness and to create program that will really work, that really drive 
physical activity.
 
And therefore just a regressive discriminatory tax on one part of the food

Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from John Faucher from 
JPMC. Your line is open.
 
John Faucher 
-
 
JPMC
 
Thank you very much. Muhtar and Gary, you guys talked about the price mix 
number 
improving sequentially which was good to see. So Gary I guess 
--
 
you talk a little bit about how you see this playing out over the next sort of 
12 to 24 months where you have the negative geographic mix offset by the 
sort of the positive mix on a per case 
basis is the bottler territories where 
you own the bottler gets better like North America versus the absolute level 
of pricing?
 
How should we look at those factors sort of competing against each other to 
try and map something out? And then one other housek
eeping question, 
which was your comments on operating profits for the year, could you just 
revise those and restate those just because there is some confusion about 
whether it was currency neutral or non
-
currency neutral, what have you? 
Thanks.
 
Gary P. Fay
ard
 
Okay, John. Let me see how well I can do on this and then you can come 
back and ask. But first, going to price mix and just as a reprice in general on 
price mix, generally what we see and I am going to take this in steps. 
Generally what we see is you s
ee pricing. So you see rate and mix 
--
 
positive rate and mix would be positive across almost all of the groups. You 
would then see negative 
--
 
generally you would see negative geographic mix 
and it's basically a function of higher growth in emerging market
 
countries 
than developed market countries, which would give you a negative 
geographic mix. Then on top of that and you are absolutely right, then 
where we own bottlers and they are growing and that gives you then a 
positive price mix, because they are fin
ished products versus concentrate.
 
So a couple of things. So if you go back to the second quarter, I talked 
about margins and I thought margins would moderate and because of 
geographic mix, in the follow
-
up to a question, I remember, I said because 
we expe
ct North America to actually perform better and that will actually 

lower. But it helps price mix and what you are seeing today is what price 
mix in North America was even for the quart
er. We are getting positive price 
mix from our finished product businesses going forward and not talking 
about specifically about 2014, because we're still in the midst of planning 
2014, we'll give you full review on our views on next year in the February 
call.
 
We are planning to take appropriate pricing that would 
--
 
and Steve referred 
to taking pricing in North America as well. So we are expecting to take 
pricing. So going forward what I would expect to see is that we should have 
a positive in rate going 
forward. We should have a positive in mix going 
forward. We should have a positive from finished products going forward. 
And we should have a negative from geographic mix. So, that's the kind of 

 
and if you add all that up, it should be a positive price m


-
term 
earnings growth model is positive price mix long term.
 
Now let me see if I can turn to operating income. When I was talking about 
operating income, it was definitely c
urrency
-
neutral; it was an ex
-
structural. 
So let's be very clear on both of those. Currency
-
neutral and ex
-
structural. 
So operating income was 8% currency
-
neutral, ex
-
structural for the quarter 
and 6% year
-
to
-
date currency
-
neutral, ex
-
structural. And what 
I said was 
we now expect the full year to be generally in line with the first half of the 
year. So somewhere in that ballpark and that is net of currency neutral and 
net of the structural impact, because I can tell you with the structural impact 
it would 
-
-
 
it's a point of negative structural impact and so that would take 
our year
-
to
-
date from six to five, for example. So, just to be clear ex
-
structural, currency
-
neutral.
 
John Faucher 
-
 
JPMC
 
So, and I am not trying to trick you into guidance or anything her
e. But it 
basically sounds like you are saying sort of currency neutral ex
-
structural 
mid
-
single
-
digit year
-
to
-
date. So therefore that implies to Q4 but then you 
talked about the currency impact. So as we are looking at those should 
basically offset to sor
t of get you to like slight operating profit growth for the 
quarter?
 
Muhtar Kent
 
Well, without giving guidance what we are basically saying is that the full 
year we think ex
-
structural and ex
-
currency at all to be in line pretty much 
where we are year
-
to
-
d
ate.

Our next question is from Judy Hong from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
 
Judy Hong 
-
 
Goldman Sachs
 
I had one follow
-
up question on North America and then a question about 
Europe. So in North America, there has been a lot written about the d
eclines 
that we've seen in diet sodas and see if I am not sure if you went through 
that and whether you shared some of the similar concerns that people have 
written about the decline in diets and sort of your perspective on whether 
the artificial sweetener
 
issue is impacting the category at all and kind of 
from your strategy and dealing with that situation?
 
Muhtar Kent
 
Yeah. Steve, do you want to address that?
 
Steve Cahillane
 

undersco
re that we have a very wide portfolio in North America led by brand 
Coca
-
Cola, which is twice the size of Diet Coke of brand Coca
-
Cola as you 
know grew 2% in the quarter which we are pleased with.
 
Diet Coke is like a lot of Diet products in the United Stat
es and not just 
beverages, but across the whole array of food are under a bit of pressure as 
people are questioning ingredients, ingredient safety and so forth.
 
But we believe very strongly in the future of Diet Coke, the number two 
sparkling brand in the 

We are actually seeing increased incidence in the past quarter between 19 
and 24 year olds. We think a lot of that has to do with the exciting new 
promotions with Taylor Swift, some of the new packagin
g we are bringing in 
the marketplace and increased focus on Diet Coke.
 
But there are headwinds. There are headwinds that we are facing and we 
face headwinds in a lot of different areas, in a lot of different places and this 
is just one of them. But last ye
ar it became the second best selling sparkling 
in the United States and we are continue to focus on it.
 
Coke Zero also a part of our zero
-
calorie portfolio grew mid
-
single digits in 

ar

ever more relevant with young males.
 
So we are confident that throughout our whole portfolio we are offering 
consumers exactly what they want, when they want it, how they want it, at 
the
 

headwinds around Diet Coke and we are confident that it has a bright future 
in this country.
 
Judy Hong 
-
 
Goldman Sachs
 
Okay. And then just on Europe, the improvements that we saw 
in Northwest 
Europe and Germany as well, I guess, to what do you attribute that to, 
perhaps weather getting much better in the quarter as opposed to the 
macros and consumers, and kind of what you guys are doing to really 
rejuvenate growth in those markets?
 
Muhtar Kent
 


pace in the continents of Europe, not 
--
 

everywh

sentiments in Spain, in Italy, in Greece, in Portugal in the South, in 
Southeast Europe and what used to be termed as the Balkans, Romania, 

enging environment.
 

certainly the best environment still in Germany. And so based on those, our 

mirror actually.
 

performing in Germany and growing our business. And again, the 
tremendous sequential improvement versus the first half in many countries 
of Northwest Europe, in Scandinavia and als
o Northwest European countries, 
Irial?
 
Irial Finan
 
Thanks, Muhtar. And this actually goes back to one of the earlier questions. I 

actually really good marketing, married up with continued
 
excellent 
execution and you bring all that together and you get great results.
 
And for me in Germany it gives me great confidence about the future of our 

work, where we do the rig
ht things in the business. We do get good results 
and Germany is just an example of what can happen, quite frankly, in many 
markets around the world as the economies turn and improve.
 
Muhtar Kent
 
Ahmet, do you want to comment on that?
 
Ahmet Bozer
 
Yeah. I j
ust wanted to 
--
 
hi, Judy. I just wanted to say to the others, so we 
had a very, very strong Share a Coke campaign across Europe this summer 
that worked extremely well. We are ever more closely aligned with our 
bottling partners, really driving growth.
 
And
 

between north and south. So north continues to do better and south 
continues to do worse. So our business in the north certainly is reflective of 
that.

made very sound and significant and good progress and discussions with 
some of our exi
sting partners, as well as discussions ongoing with some 
other prospective partners. So we are on target, if not, a little bit ahead and 
I think you'll hear more about it in the coming sort of period ahead of this 
and I will ask Steve just to maybe shed so
me more light on it.
 
Steve Cahillane
 
Bill, I mean the one thing I would really underscore is we absolutely have 
not hit a low. Don't take the absence of public commentary to mean that we 
are not making very good, very constructive progress. All of our 
bottling 
partners, both current and prospective, are extremely excited about this 
business in the United States about the opportunities to continue to be 
franchise partners in the United States, to grow the business in the United 
States. And we are making 
a very exciting progress and we will have more 
to report in the coming months.
 
Bill Schmitz

Deutsche Bank
 
And then just on the SG&A costs, can you just give us a little bit more color 
on what drove some pretty significant efficiencies, that's obviously g
reat? 
But was the advertising ratio flat or up and then maybe what drove some of 
the other improvements on that line item?
 
Muhtar Kent
 
Are you talking about productivity, Bill?
 
Bill Schmitz 
-
 
Deutsche Bank
 
Yes, productivity and SG&A broadly, yes.
 
Gary P. 
Fayard
 
Sure, Bill. Within the quarter, we continued to invest in marketing. So 
marketing is actually up in the quarter and up year
-
to
-
date. We had 
significant productivity savings in the quarter. We have some previously 
announced productivity programs that
 
we announced back in 2012. Those 
2012 programs will go through 2015 and really focus around productivity 
and then reinvesting those back into the business that we are focused on 
information systems, marketing, supply chain, innovation, operational 
excelle
nce, that sort of thing.
 
I can tell you 
--
 
we will give you a full update on it at the year
-
end call. So I 
can give you the full year but we are making very good progress against the 
goals. And you will see that on the February call when we go through a fu
ll 


some of the leverage that you are seeing. So 
--
 
and things like supply chain, 
if the pricing [ph] is chea
per, hard savings. So we are doing a lot around 
supply chain and actually getting a lot of hard savings and those you are 
seeing are being reflected.
 
In marketing, if you can buy media cheaper, then we just buy more media. 

 
So we are reinvesting back into marketing 
and be enable to buy more media for the same price, if you will. So we 
--
 
as 
I say we will give you a full update on all of the productivity programs in 
February at our year
-
end call. But we're making excellent pr
ogress and 

within that marketing, SG&A marketing being up for the quarter and year

Thank you. Our next question is from Ali Dibadj from Bernstein. Your line is 
open.
 
Ali Dibadj 
-
 
Sanford Bernstein
 
Just one quick thing and then a real question. So, I just want to underscore 
somethi
ng again, because it's a key conspiracy and I think what Steve said a 

sure I understand. So did you say that the past couple of months in North 
America from a price, from an inves
tment perspective were little bit more of 
a blip in that we should expect something like higher pricing that we saw in 
2011 and 2012 going forward in North America?
 
Steve Cahillane
 
Yes, thanks Ali. I think that's a fair interpretation of what I said. This 
was a 
very different summer. It's been a difficult year starting with the fiscal cliff 
and sequestration and payroll taxes and so forth and then the summer was 

engaged with our brands
 
to make sure that we are in the households, to 
make sure that teens are being recruited. And so Labor Day acted very 
much like 4th July or a Memorial Day, whereas typically it would not. It 
would be the end of summer. And Labor Day acted more like the onl
y 
summer. So it was more promotional than you would have seen. It would be 
more promotional than what we would expect going forward.
 
But those things happened from time to time. And we think that the pricing 
environment will continue to be very strong, ver
y rational and because of all 

opportunity to earn even more price going forward in the marketplace. And 
that would be absolutely our intention to do that.
 
Ali Dibadj 
-
 
Sanford Bernstein
 
O
kay. That makes perfect sense.
 
Ahmet Bozer
 



ou get to the one 

the moment.
 
Ali Dibadj 
-
 
Sanford Bernstein
 
I appreciate that. That makes a lot of sense. And then a broader question, I 

 
what do you think the company 
has to grow volumes between now and 2020 to deliver on the 2020 vision, 
given some of the recent slowdown in volumes. And I guess in that context, 
do you think as a company you have to acquire more to reach that vision?
 
Muhta
r Kent
 
I would say that first we believe that our long
-
term growth model with 
appropriate mix which we believe we can take and we can generate. It 
would definitely get us to our 2020 vision of 
--
 
from our system revenue 
point of view of doubling our busine
ss with the base of 2010. So that is sort 

--
 
achieving our goal.
 
The second piece is 
--
 
we always 
--
 

bolt
-
on acquisitions as may make sen

would say that right now we would be looking at. Bolt
-
on acquisitions and 

 
Ali Dibadj 
-
 
Sanford Bernstein
 
And in some the difference of volume versu
s price mix to reach the system 
doubling goal, has that shift 
--
 
has it shifted at all between the two?
 
Muhtar Kent
 
Sorry. Sorry. Say that again.
 
Ali Dibadj 
-
 
Sanford Bernstein
 
Well, so to double the system sales by 2020, there is perhaps an ingoing 
assumption of what would be from volume and what would be from price 
mix. Has the recent global slowdown shifted that mix at all between volume 
growth and price mix growth to reach the doubling of sales?
 
Gary P. Fayard
 

 
at our long
-
term growth that sort of 

there.
 
Ali Dibadj 
-
 
Sanford Bernstein
 
Okay.

normalized run rate because that region has been so lumpy in terms of 

growth?
 
And then my second question is looking at the buyback program, th
e stock 



with the weakness in t
he stock, and certainly Muhtar with your resounding 

on the buyback here? Thanks.

the second pa
rt of the question. Sure.

Thanks Wendy. You might remember that in our last call, we talked about 
the fact that we were evolving both our organization and our strategy in 
China. And what we see in the third quarter really encourages us that we 
had not only 9% growth in total but also 8% growth in sparkling.
 

would expect sequential improvement from the first half results in the 
second half of this year and we expect that s
equential improvement from the 
first half results to continue into 2014.
 
To your question on pricing promotion, we did not have any significant 
marked pricing promotions in the marketplace. It was basically a 
combination of a), beginning to implement parts
 
of our new strategy in the 
marketplace; b) the same share of co
-
promotion that we are scaling up 
these wonderful global assets in all parts of the world. And then our new 
team beginning to gel together connecting with our bottling system and 
really improv
ing execution. So we are encouraged by those results and we 
expect to continue to, as I said, improve sequentially from the first half 
results.

Yes, Wendy, relative to share repurchase let me just first 

 
let me just start 
with the preface t
hat don't particularly agree with you on saying our share 
repurchase has relatively underperformed for the last two years. But after 
that, couple of thoughts on share repurchase. Our view on share repurchase 
is that share repurchase is value neutral. It is
 
not something that grows 
value. It does for the short
-
term holder, so maybe you can get a buck in the 
share price but for the long
-
term holder it is not something that's value 
enhancing. It is much more like a cash sufficient dividend, which is the way 
we
 
treat it. And that our priorities for cash are number one to reinvest in the 
business, to grow the business that will include bolt
-
on acquisitions et 
cetera. Number two would be dividends, which we have increased for the 
last 51 years, 10% this year and t
hird, excess cash would be put into share 
repurchase. And just because we don't need the cash in the business, so it's 
a return of cash to shareholders. But leveraging the balance sheet to do 
something that we would view as value neutral, we don't think, i
s the right 
thing to do. So we continue to just perform exactly in line with the target 
that we set at the beginning of the year.

Thank you, Gary, Ahmet, Steve, Irial and Jackson. We delivered sound third 
quarter results within an ongoing chall
enged macroeconomic environment. 
While we saw sequentially improvement in the business, we remain 
constructively discontent and resolutely focused on further advancing our 
growth trajectory. Our 2020 vision and long
-
term strategies remain firmly 
intact. An
d together with our global bottling partners we are investing in our 
brands and our capabilities to further strengthen our system and to drive 
sustainable growth and value.
 
As always, we thank you for your interest, your investment in our company 
and for j
oining us this morning.

Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
Thank you, Tim, and good morning, eve
ryone. In late 2014, we announced a 
clear five point plan to reinvigorate our growth and increase profitability. We 
committed to transform the company to one that is focused on our core 
value creation model of building strong brands, enhancing customer 
rel
ationships, and leading our franchise system with a goal of becoming a 
leaner, higher margin, higher return and more focused company. And I'm 
pleased to say that we made significant progress against our initiatives, 
including the very important announcemen
t this morning about accelerating 
our refranchising. Importantly, our progress against these initiatives is 
leading to improving performance, even in a very challenging macro 
environment.
 
Let's start with our key announcements today. One of our five strate
gic 
initiatives has been to refocus on our core business of building brands and 
leading our system of bottling partners. As part of this, we've continued to 
advance our global refranchising initiatives. With the success of our efforts in 
Europe and North A
merica, we have the confidence to accelerate our plans.
 
In North America, we learned a significant amount from our initial territory 
transition efforts. Including the additional territories announced this 
morning, to
-
date, we have signed agreements or tran
sferred territories 
representing over 40% of U.S. bottle can volume. At the same time, the 
performance of our North America businesses continue to improve 
throughout this process, delivering the highest revenue growth in three 
years, while we executed this
 
important transformation. Based on our 
success and the knowledge we gained through the transitions, we're now 
ready to accelerate the pace.
 
Today, we announced we are committed to refranchising 100% of our 
bottling territories, including Coke cold
-
fill pr
oduction by the end of 2017. 
This is a critical step for our entire system in North America. It will not be 
easy and will require the hard work and dedicated efforts of our entire team 
and close collaboration with our bottling partners. So we have a clear 
plan in 
place, and are confident that this is essential for our future success.
 
Moving on to China, our bottling system in this dynamic country has evolved 
to the point where refranchising is the next logical step. Today, we are the 
bottler for roughly one
-
third of our dynamic China business. We have now 
entered into a non
-
binding letter of intent to refranchise our bottling 
operations to our existing partners, COFCO and Swire. These bottlers have 
been excellent partners, demonstrating their willingness and
 
capability to 
grow the China business for the long
-
term. Therefore, we believe they are 
ready to take on additional territory and look forward to strengthening our 
partnerships with them.
 
These new announcements, combined with the pending creation of Coca
-
Cola European Partners and Coca
-
Cola Beverages Africa, as well as our 
investment in our Indonesian bottler, will strengthen our global bottling 
system for the coming decades. To put it in perspective, adjusting for these 
transactions, the percent of our 2
015 volume sold through company
-
owned 
bottlers would have decreased from 18% to 3%. None of this would have 
been possible without the continuous investment and hard work of our 
Bottling Investments Group. When we are finished, our Bottling Investments 
Grou
p will be smaller, more focused, but will remain a critical strategic 
growth enabler for our company.
 
Taking a step back, I'm proud of the progress we've made over the past 18 
months and look forward to completing the next critical phase of our 
journey. Wh
en we complete these refranchising efforts by the end of 2017, 
we will look very different than we do today, as we return to a company that 
is focused on our core strength of building strong, sustainable and valuable 
brands, creating value for our customer
s and partners and continuing to 
drive system capabilities. As a result, we will become less capital intensive, 
with significantly higher margins and returns, which will enable our core 
strengths even further.
 
Another of our five strategic initiatives is t
argeting disciplined brand and 
growth investments. While much of this discussion has been about 
increasing the quantity of our marketing, we know that improving the quality 
of our marketing is just as critical for success. That is why I am particularly 
ple
ased by Coca
-
Cola's new global marketing campaign. Actually, this is not 
just a new global campaign, but a new business approach. While we've 
added a lot of choices to the trademark Coca
-
Cola portfolio over the years, 
drinks with calories, without calories
, with caffeine or without, this is our first 
campaign ever to cover all the refreshing brands within our Coca
-
Cola 
trademark portfolio.
 
As the most valuable beverage brand in the world, people continue to love 
our brand, but we recognize consumers want to
 
enjoy Coca
-
Cola in different 
ways. Regardless of which one they want, they want a Coca
-
Cola brand with 
great taste and uplifting refreshment. Our One Brand strategy transitions us 
to a single iconic brand campaign that celebrates both the product as well 
as 
the brand. Importantly, this campaign gets back to our roots, featuring the 
product at the heart of the creative, and celebrating the experience and 
simple pleasures of drinking a Coca
-
Cola, any Coca
-
Cola.
 
This campaign is also an example of how we are 
transforming the way we 
work to be faster with reduced costs. This campaign was built end
-
to
-
end 
from the start, from consumer through to shopper, digital, and music, and 
was developed to support the entire globe. This helped us reduce the 
number of agenci
es and better leverages production costs as well. This 
discipline, combined with the inspiration of our talented marketing teams, is 
what will continue to fuel our growth.
 
While trademark Coca
-
Cola is the oxygen for our company, we have the 
leading portfol
io of strong valuable brands across multiple categories. And 
this portfolio continues to grow with 20 $1 billion brands and a strong 
pipeline of growing regional brands. This year, we gained global value share 
across the core sparkling packaged water, juic
e, and juice drinks, energy 
drinks and ready
-
to
-
drink tea categories. In addition to internal innovation, 
we look externally for bolt
-
on opportunities to expand our still beverage 
portfolio and capabilities.
 
Just last week, we announced an investment in Ch
i Limited, Nigeria's leading 
value
-
added dairy and juice company. This adds to our other recent 
investments, including Monster, Suja, and fairlife, expanding our presence in 
the energy juice and value
-
added dairy categories. Last quarter, we also 
announced
 
our intention to sell our shares in conjunction with JAB Holdings' 
pending acquisition of Keurig Green Mountain. We will recover our initial 
investment when that transaction closes, while continuing to drive our 
Keurig KOLD opportunity in the marketplace.
 
In summary, we recognize we still have much work to do, but we have a 
clear plan, clear path to transform the company, becoming more focused on 
our core business of building brands and leading our system of bottling 
partners, thereby giving us even greate
r confidence to achieve our long
-
term growth targets.
 
I will now hand the call over to our Chief Operating Officer, James Quincey, 
who will provide you with a more detailed look at our operating performance 
in 2015.
 
James Quincey 
-
 
President & Chief Operat
ing Officer
 
Thank you, Muhtar. Good morning, everyone. So, as Muhtar mentioned, let 
me spend a few minutes reviewing our 2015 operational performance, 
before handing the call over to Kathy.
 
In 2015, we delivered our plan for our transition year, despite ch
allenging 
macroeconomic environments. We gained value share in NARTD, sparkling 
and still beverages, an important metric for us as we manage the business, 
especially during periods of slower economic growth and volatility. For the 
full year, organic growth
 
of revenues was 4% and, importantly, we delivered 
2% global price/mix. This was stronger price realization than we have 
generated in several years, reflecting our segmented revenue growth 
management strategies and enabled by our increased investments in m
edia.
 
Unit case volume grew 2% for the year. We're pleased with this volume 
performance, given our focus on improving price realization during a time 
when consumer spending was pressured in many markets.
 
And I'm also pleased to confirm that 
globally, we captured over $600 million 
in productivity, ahead of the target we set for ourselves at the beginning of 
the year. So structurally
-
adjusted, comparable currency neutral income 
before tax grew 6% for the year, as we benefited from the productiv
ity 
efforts and favorable commodities, although partially offset by our increased 
media investments.
 
During the year, we saw a slowing environment in China and challenges in 
several key emerging markets, including Brazil and Russia. This was offset 
by soli
d performance in North America and many of our Latin American 
markets. North America itself delivered its strongest performance in three 
years, delivering 4% organic revenue growth, with three points of price 
realization, supported by our increased marketi
ng effort and a disciplined 
approach to volume, price and mix management.
 
Consistent with this strategic focus, our driving of consumption small 
packages could be seen across North America. We grew purchase 
transactions 3%, outpacing the 1% unit case volum
e growth, as consumers 
increasingly reached for the mini cans, the smaller PET, the 8
-
ounce glass 
bottles, as well as our premium aluminum bottles, all of which drive more 
value per occasion than our traditional packages. Hopefully, many of you 
also saw an
 
example of this strategic focus on Sunday night during the 
Super Bowl, when we aired our latest commercial focusing exclusively on the 
mini can package.
 
Our performance in 2015 gives us confidence that our strategies are working 
and that our underlying pe
rformance will be within our long
-
term targets in 
2016. However, let me be clear. The global economy remains challenged and 
is not improving rapidly. We do see slightly better GDP growth rates for 
2016 as compared to 2015. But to be fair, forecasts continu
e to be revised 
downwards and there is still much uncertainty. Notable are Brazil and Russia 
continuing to deteriorate, while China's growth rate does also slow, putting 
pressure across many of the emerging and developing markets.
 
Now, while helpful to con
sumers, the lower price of oil is also causing 
volatility in the Middle East and other oil
-
driven export economies, with 
further implications for those nations. So, given the erratic nature of the 
global economy, we will continue to focus on what we can co
ntrol in order to 
deliver our plan. We will continue to build on the fundamentals of our 
strategy for long
-
term success, while delivering solid revenue growth and 
strong, underlying operating margin expansion, through the expected 
continued management of o
ur portfolio, price/mix and productivity efforts.
 
With that, I'm going to hand off to Kathy, who will give you additional details 
on North American productivity programs, and walk through the 2016 
outlook.
 
Kathy N. Waller

Chief Financial Officer & Execut
ive Vice President
 
Thank you, James, and good morning, everyone. In the interest of time this 
morning, I intend to cover just three topics: North America refranchising; 
our updated productivity targets; and our outlook for 2016.
 
Let me start with our refra
nchising efforts in North America. As we 
accelerate our refranchisings, we are returning to our core business of brand 
building, driving customer value and leading the system. At the same time, 
the refranchising causes a lot of complexity in our North Amer
ica P&L. 
Therefore, in order for management to view the underlying performance of 
our core business in North America separately, we made the decision to 
adjust our operating segments such that, starting in 2016, CCR will be 
reported within our Bottling Inv
estments Group.
 
Going forward, the vast majority of any structural impacts to our business 
will now be reported within a single operating segment. We believe this will 
also be helpful to our investors for the same reason of assessing the 
continued underlyi
ng performance of our core business. We understand that 
the accelerated refranchising, coupled with the shift in reporting segments, 
will likely result in a lot of modeling questions. So we will provide revised 
operating segment financial information refle
cting this change before the 
end of the quarter.
 
With regards to modeling, we are providing detailed structural guidance for 
2016, the majority of which is related to the North America refranchising 
efforts. The remainder of the territories will transfer b
y the end of 2017, but 
the P&L impact will depend on the timing of transfers. We will share more 
with you at the appropriate time on the expected impact in 2017.
 
As we transition territories, we are committed to eliminating the temporary 
residual costs we 
have referenced in the past as quickly as possible, and we 
anticipate the majority of these will be removed in 2017. With that said, 
there could be a portion of residual costs remaining in 2018 as we wind 
down the final support of these operations, but thi
s amount would be 
relatively small and would be eliminated by the end of 2018.
 
Our productivity program is also evolving due to the accelerated 
refranchising. Approximately half of our $3 billion productivity program was 
expected to come from supply chain 
savings. And a significant portion of 
those savings were expected to come from North America, due to the size 
and finished goods nature of the business.
 
Now that we are accelerating our refranchising, we will no longer be able to 
capture a portion of the i
dentified supply chain savings prior to divestiture. 
However, we have built a disciplined process and capabilities that have 
allowed us to exceed our goals to
-
date, and identify incremental 
opportunities within cost of goods sold, operating expenses and ma
rketing to 
replace the supply chain savings being refranchised, thus enabling us to 
maintain our $3 billion target.
 
As we've communicated to you in the past, we said we would continue to 
look at every layer of spending as we move through the productivity w
ork 
and we have done just that. Coupled with the success we've seen so far, we 
have the confidence to effectively raise our level of targeted savings across 
our remaining spend base. With the incremental savings identified in our 
core business and the fact
 
that our addressable cost base will substantially 
reduce post
-
2017, it should be even more evident that our $3 billion 
program represents a sizable opportunity. We look forward to providing 
further details at CAGNY next week.
 
Turning to outlook, despite c
hallenging macro environments in many key 
markets around the world, our focus on revenue and disciplined brand 
investments continues to improve our top
-
line growth. Also, we are seeing 
productivity flow through our P&L. While much of this was obscured by 
c
urrency and structural changes, we saw solid underlying margin expansion 
last year, even while we grew marketing expenses at a faster rate than 
gross profits. For those reasons, in 2016, we expect to be back on our long
-
term growth algorithm prior to any s
tructural changes, which are primarily 
driven by our accelerated pace of refranchising.
 
Organic revenue is expected to grow 4% to 5%, in line with our long
-
term 
target, as our marketing investments continue to pay off. Given the current 
macro environment a
nd lapping better comps in 2015, we believe this is a 
solid target.
 
We expect the commodity environment to be benign, but considering that 
we hedge our exposure to many commodities, we may not see the full 
benefit you would expect when looking at today's s
pot prices. Given the 
general weak macroeconomic environment and the associated pressure on 
top
-
line growth, we are focused on capturing more than $600 million of 
productivity in order to deliver our profit targets. We will do this even as we 
continue to i
ncrease the investments in media behind our brands and step 
up R&D investments in 2016.
 
Finally, we anticipate interest cost to increase in 2016 due to higher interest 
rates, as well as our decision to shift some of our debt from commercial 
paper to longer
-
term maturities that carry slightly higher interest rates.
 
After considering all of these factors, we expect comparable currency neutral 
income before tax, structurally
-
adjusted, to grow 6% to 8% in 2016, in line 
with our long
-
term targets, as strong oper
ating profit growth is partially 
offset by net interest expense.
 
As Muhtar mentioned earlier, there will be significant structural impacts to 
our business as we accelerate our refranchising efforts in North America, 
complete the mergers of Coca
-
Cola Europe
an Partners, and Coca
-
Cola 
Beverages Africa, and cycle a half
-
year impact from the Monster Beverage 
transaction, which closed in mid
-
2015. We currently expect both Coca
-
Cola 
European Partners and Coca
-
Cola Beverages Africa to close during the 
second quarte
r. Taken together, we expect the net impact of acquisitions 
and divestitures to be a four to five point headwind to net revenue.
 
Because of the nature of the structural changes, we also anticipate that the 
impact will be slightly higher on cost of goods so
ld and SG&A. We expect the 
benefit to equity income from Monster, Coca
-
Cola Beverages Africa and 
Coca
-
Cola European Partners to partially offset that impact at operating 
income, resulting in a three to four point negative structural impact to 
income before
 
tax. Our underlying effective tax rate is expected to remain at 
22.5% for 2016.
 
Finally, we expect approximately $2 billion to $2.5 billion in net share 
repurchases for 2016. We therefore expect comparable currency neutral EPS 
growth of 4% to 6%, inclusiv
e of the three to four point structural headwind 
to income before tax.
 
As you well know, many of the world's currencies have continued to 
depreciate versus the U.S. dollar. Since we operate in over 200 markets, we 
are not immune to this effect. In addition
, we will be cycling the Euro debt 
re
-
measurement gain we recorded in Other Income during the first two 
quarters of 2015. Based on current spot rates, hedging activity and what we 
are cycling, we expect a four point headwind to net revenue and a nine point
 
headwind to income before tax. However, the currency headwind to 
operating income will be lower as we cycle the gain I just mentioned.
 
In terms of coverage, we are fully hedged on the euro, yen and sterling for 
2016. We also have near
-
term coverage in pla
ce across several other major 
currencies.
 
Finally, we expect to spend $2.5 billion to $3 billion on CapEx, as we 
continue to maintain our facilities in advance of transitioning territories and 
production assets. By the end of 2017, our capital needs will d
ecrease 
significantly, as we refranchise healthy businesses in North America and 
China.
 
As you model the first quarter, please remember that due to our reporting 
calendar cycle, there will be one less day in the first quarter of 2016 as 
compared to 2015. B
ased on current spot rates, hedging activity and what 
we are cycling, we expect that currency will be a five point headwind on net 
revenues and a 12 point headwind on income before tax in the first quarter 
of 2016. We expect the net impact of acquisitions 
and divestitures to be a 
slight headwind on net revenue and structural items to be a two point 
headwind on income before tax.
 
In summary, our financial performance for 2015 was slightly better than our 
expectations, and we executed our five point plan 
effectively. And we are 
already working diligently to deliver our commitments for 2016. We continue 
to focus on our core capabilities of building brands, driving customer value 
and leading the system, so that when we complete our refranchising, we will 
be 
a lower risk, higher return business with even greater confidence to 
achieve our long
-
term growth targets.
 
We look forward to sharing more with you at CAGNY.

Deu
tsche Bank Securities, Inc.
 
Hey, can you just talk about why now is the right time to pull all this stuff 
forward on the refranchising front because, obviously, there's like a ton of 
macro volatility? I know there was some challenges as you kind of wanted 
to 
standardize the IT platform and then even some of the key account stuff, 
which I thought had a little bit of a longer tail. So any thoughts you have on 
that would be appreciated.
 
Ahmet Muhtar Kent 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
Yeah. Thanks, Bill.
 
Ever since I took over as CEO, I have always emphasized 
the importance of our franchise model. And one of my clear priorities was to 
accelerate growth in our biggest profit pool, the United States. And we 
bought the business of CCE, U.S. operations with t
hat goal in mind. So when 
you think about it now, we've been able to prove to ourselves that we can 
accelerate the business in North America. We've had the best year in 2015, 
and you saw the results from the quarter. And these results show that our 
strateg
ic focus on driving consumption of smaller package sizes is continuing 
to pay off. Transactions are growing. Price/mix is healthy.
 
And so we're bringing those two things together, both the goal of going 
back, returning to our core model, which we've always
 
emphasized, even the 
first time we announced the purchase of CCE's U.S. operations, we said 
there will be a role for partnerships going forward as soon as we can put 
some things right.
 
We have got the three legs of the stool in place, the customer governa
nce, 
production governance, and the IT platforms. And so we feel very confident. 
We have proven to ourselves that we can do it and we feel very confident 
that this is the time. The new model is established. Bottler performance is 
improving. We have a new s
tructure to last us the next number of decades. 
And we're putting our bottlers in the right hands. As Kathy said, the bottlers 
are very healthy and thanks to the great leadership and capability of our 
Bottling Investments Group.
 
And so, yes, we are now goi
ng to the core and this is the time. And we feel 
very confident that we can do the two things together, accelerate 
momentum and bring the franchising to a bookend that really, we feel, is 
going to be very beneficial both to our company, our shareowners, as
 
well as 
to leading to better customer service and better value creation on the bottler 
side. So it's really a win
-
win from all those perspectives, Bill.

line is now open. Ple
ase go ahead.

I was hoping you could actually give us a concrete example that gave you 
the confidence to make the decision to accelerate your refranchising plans. 
And then
, while your margin should certainly expand and your returns will 
increase, could you help frame for us the incremental dilution expected from 
the new system? And then finally, I'd like to hear what your plans are for the 
cash you'll receive from the plann
ed sale of the 39 production facilities, 
which I guess, I assume should raise a fair amount of cash, considering I 
think the earlier sales, the nine sites, had a book value of $280 million, if I'm 
not mistaken.
 
Ahmet Muhtar Kent 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executiv
e Officer
 
Sure, Bonnie. I'll say a few words and then I'll let Kathy and James 
comment, too. But I'll say that certainly, we have the proof points in the 
United States. Our Chinese business, for example, also has great 
momentum, gaining share and growing i
n that difficult environment, if you 
look at the quarter, if you look at the full year results. And the capability 
that has been put into place in all our expanding bottlers, everywhere, is 
really giving us the confidence. And also just look at the momentu
m of the 
business. Our revenue growth was a priority. We got it up to the 4% to 5% 
range. And the increased marketing is working, clearly, and now better 
marketing was even going to enhance that.
 
And at the same time, we feel that every time the territory 
has transitioned, 
it's actually continued to do well, continued to gain share, continued to drive 
momentum, continued to drive incremental transactions. And from that, any 
of the territories in the last four, five quarters that have been transitioned, 
we h
ave seen, without exception, that to be holding true. And if you look at 
all these bottlers that we're refranchising, look at the results. Look at the 
performance of our German bottler. It really has the greatest momentum in 
the continent of Europe right n
ow.
 
So all of these bottlers are going in to a system, to a structure, to an 
architecture, to a geography that will continue to do even better when you 
combine it and when you create the synergies with the combination. And so, 
we feel confident.
 
And then, 
what took a little while to get right was the governance model 
around production in the United States, the governance model around the IT 
platform, the governance model around the customer service. All of those 
are in place and working well.
 
So, I'll just 
hand over to James to add some flavor to that in more details, 
and then Kathy can comment also on your questions related to the financial 
aspect of cash.
 
James Quincey 
-
 
President & Chief Operating Officer
 
Yeah, Bonnie, let me just add one thought to what 
Muhtar has laid out there 
on we've been fixing and building. And we're finding the right partners. I 
mean, a simple way of looking at why it's working is there's just more 
people coming to the table saying, we want to be partners. Our existing 
partners wan
t more territories. And new people who aren't in the system 
want to get into the system. So they're seeing that we've fixed the business 
and we've built momentum. And so, there's a lot of heightened interest in 
being part of a growing Coke system, particul
arly in North America.
 
Kathy N. Waller 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
 
Okay. Then, Bonnie, I think the next part of your question, you asked about 
the incremental dilution and the impact of that. I can help you with the 
impact of that.
 
So for 2016, we gave you the impact. And then for 2017, we are doing 
several things, because we know you all have lots of questions about 2017. 
So we are going to provide revised operating segment financial information 
later in the quarter. And then at CA
GNY, we're going to give you a look at 
kind of what to anticipate the business will look like after everything is 
finished in 2018, because the actual dilution kind of depends really on the 
timing of these transactions.
 
Bonnie L. Herzog

Wells Fargo Secur
ities LLC
 
Okay.
 
Kathy N. Waller

Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
 
And so the best way we can give you some indication of that is really to kind 
of help you understand what our business will look like when everything is 
said and done in 2
018 and beyond, which is what we're going to try to do at 
CAGNY. So I would ask you just hold off on that, and more to come on that.
 
And then on the question about cash, so the cash will basically go into 
basically our capital structure and be part of just
 
our normal mix. And at this 
point, no board level decisions have been made, so we anticipate that these 
proceeds will be used to strengthen our balance sheet.

Hi. Good morning.
 
Ahmet Muhtar Kent

Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
Morning.
 
Dara W. Mohsenian

Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
 
So, Muhtar, you've posted a couple quarters in a row with volume growth 
back up in the 3% range, along with solid pricing, despite the difficult 
emerging markets macro environment we're seeing. So, I just wanted to get 
an update on
 
your market share performance. Obviously, you're gaining 
share, but have you seen a relative change in terms of incremental market 
share performance and what level of payback you're getting on the higher 
marketing? And as you look out to 2016, 4% to 5% or
ganic sales growth is a 
fairly tight range. So how much visibility do you think you have around that? 
Could macros pose a risk to that guidance, particularly given you're 
assuming higher GDP growth? Thanks.
 
Ahmet Muhtar Kent 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Of
ficer
 
Thanks, Dara. As I mentioned, we're pleased with our market share 
performance, value share gains across the world, and I'll let James highlight 
some details on that.
 
James Quincey 
-
 
President & Chief Operating Officer
 
Yeah. Thanks, Muhtar. So, Dara, 
let me just give you a quick run round the 
world, in terms of share. I mean, firstly, on an overall global basis, perhaps 
consistent with our strong fourth quarter, we gained a little more share in 
the fourth quarter than we had in the whole year, so a bet
ter performance at 
the tail end. And in terms of how that played out across the world, you see, 
again, in line with the volume performance, strong results in North America. 
We gained share in sparkling. We gained share in stills, and we gained share 
overal
l in the quarter and in the year, so good momentum in North America 
coming through in share.
 
In Europe, we're gaining share in sparkling and in stills. Given our different 
starting points, that's netting out to kind of being flat overall, but we got a 
stro
ng growth in Europe as we build our stills business.
 
Latin America, this is a long
-
term track record of success, so small gains 
there, building on a long history of building a great position.
 
Eurasia, despite some of the volatility in that part of the worl
d, we gained 
share in both sparkling and stills and overall, pretty strong momentum 
there, in terms of share.
 
And then in Asia Pacific, we've focused more on re
-
staging and re
-
energizing 
the sparkling business, where we're gaining share. We lost a little b
it in stills 
and overall flat. So I think wherever you look round the world, we're largely 
flat to gaining. And so, and consistent with our volume growth, which is 
broad
-
based and across the world, we're also largely winning across the 
world.
 
So in terms o
f 

 
which one do you want me to do, marketing payback? So I 
think what you're seeing is, there is results from the marketing payback. I 
mean, our organic revenue growth in 2015 was better than 2014. We're 
guiding for a good number that's ahead of 2015, in 
2016. So, we see the 
marketing payout beginning to build the momentum globally. And I think if 
you doubled
-
down on that one and look under that, North America was one 
of the first places we started with the incremental marketing and that's self
-
evidently b
uilding momentum. So, we see the underlying business results 
coming through in revenue, very much tied to where the extra media money 
is going.
 
And then in terms of macro outlook and risk to top
-
line, I think we feel that 
we got underlying structural momen
tum in the business. Now, when I said 
we're planning on the macros slightly better in 2016, and I really do mean 
slightly, and I wouldn't be surprised if that was the same growth rate in 
2015, but we think we have the right portfolio and the right optional
ity to be 
able to deliver our financial numbers in that environment.
 
Dara W. Mohsenian 
-
 
Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
 
Okay, great. And then, if I could just slip a detail question in, Kathy, I was 
hoping you could give us clarity on the impact to 2017 earnings
 
from FX, if 
spot rates stay at this level, given the hedging in 2016, and how much 
hedging you have in place for 2017 on some of the hard currencies.
 
Kathy N. Waller 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
 
Okay. So, for 2017, Dara, we are als
o fully hedged on our major currencies. 
So, obviously, the emerging market currencies are the ones where you can't 
really hedge more than a quarter or so out. So, obviously, we have done 
nothing on the emerging market currencies. But on the hard currencies
, we 
are hedged at rates slightly worse than in 2016. So there will be a slight 
impact, but I wouldn't think it would be terribly significant.
 
Dara W. Mohsenian

Thank you. Our next question is from John
 
Faucher of JPMorgan. Your line is 
now open. Please go ahead.
 
John A. Faucher 
-
 
JPMorgan Securities LLC
 
Thank you very much. Good morning, everyone. Two questions here; first 
off, it's a little tough with all the refranchising of the bottlers to get a hand
le 
in terms of what's truly going on on the gross margin. So, can you try and 
strip some of the impact out from the refranchising and give us an idea what 
the underlying gross margin is doing?
 
And then, Kathy, going back to your points on the balance sheet
, can you 
just sort of talk about what you're seeing out there that's causing you to 
maybe term
-
out some of the longer term debt? Is it just sort of the short 
market volatility, or is this something where you would expect to maybe go 
with a more conservati
ve balance sheet approach on a go
-
forward basis? 
Thanks.
 
Kathy N. Waller 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
 
Sure, John. So the gross margins in fourth quarter impacted by the six fewer 
days, and the currency and then the structural impact
. So, if you take all of 
that out, basically, we had good gross margin expansion in the fourth 
quarter and for the full year.
 
What was the second question? So, the balance sheet, basically, as we've 
got so much cash that's outside of the United 
States, we are taking a little 
bit more of a conservative approach with our balance sheet. And it was just 
more prudent to manage with the longer
-
term maturities than with short
-
term maturities. So, we still have a robust portfolio of commercial paper. So 
we're just kind of balancing that out differently.
 
John A. Faucher 
-
 
JPMorgan Securities LLC
 
Okay, and if I can ask one quick follow
-
up on that, in terms of the interest 
income line and some of the cash balances overseas, any change in that 
approach, or is this mostly going to be on the interest expense line?
 
Kathy N. Waller 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
 
Yeah. Basically, it's going to be on the interest expense line. Yeah.
 
John A. Faucher 
-
 
JPMorgan Securities LLC
 
Okay.
 
Kathy N. Waller 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
 
I think we're expecting much more interest expense, given the rate changes. 
But also, the longer
-
term maturities are also causing more interest expense.
 
John A. Faucher

JPMorgan Securi

Got it. Thanks.

Thank you. Our next question is from Brett Cooper of Consumer Edge 
Research. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
 
Brett Cooper

Consumer Edge R
esearch LLC
 
Good morning. One of your stated strategies was to improve the balance of 
price/mix and volume in your developed markets, and we've clearly seen 
that in the U.S. But I was hoping you could walk around the world and offer 
us what you're seeing i
n other developed markets, provide us with your 
prospects and confidence for improving price/mix in other developed 
markets around the world going forward. Thanks.
 
Ahmet Muhtar Kent 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
Yeah, Brett. I think, if you look at 
our overall for the whole year, and as well 
as for the quarter, our price/mix globally, you can see that that has 
improved. As was mentioned, part of the reason for that is we're beginning 
to see the results of the increased marketing play through as well 
as our 
packaging strategies and mix management. And coupled with that, the value 
share gains, which is even more pleasing, given that we're able to get 
healthy pricing in our business and in our markets around the world, but I'll 
let James comment in terms
 
of Europe and Japan and what is being seen in 
some of the other developed markets in addition to the United States, okay?
 
James Quincey 
-
 
President & Chief Operating Officer
 
Yeah, thanks, Muhtar. I think firstly, it's important to remember, starting 
with 
Europe, that our price positioning in Europe, we have, over time, 
substantially taken a lot of rate and mix in Europe, such that we are more 
premium priced compared to our competitors than we are in North America, 
so less runway in that sense. Now, having 
said that, we continue to focus on 
smaller packages, more premium offerings in terms of the brand portfolio, 
such that despite what is a pretty deflationary retail environment in a 
number of Western European markets, we're getting price/mix in Europe, 
both
 
in the quarter and for the full year. So I think going out, one should not 
expect the same sort of levels the U.S. has been able to develop, especially 
given the macro environment in Europe at the moment.
 
In terms of Japan, we're very focused on rebuildin
g our ability to get positive 
price/mix in Japan. We've recently been able to get some, again, very 
focused on leveraging both packaging options and the brand portfolio to 
reshape it to allow us to drive positive mix. Again, I don't think you will see, 
in 
Japan, the same sorts of levels as the U.S., as much as anything to do 
with the deflationary pressures in Japan. But we are starting to see chances 
of a better pricing environment in Japan.

Hey, good morning, everyone.
 
Ahmet Muhtar Kent

Morning, Bryan.
 
Kathy N. Waller

Chief Financial Officer & 
Executive Vice President
 
Morning.
 
Bryan D. Spillane 
-
 
Bank of America Merrill Lynch
 
Just wanted to get a couple of points of color on the productivity program. I 
guess, Kathy, to start, you're keeping the original $3 billion plan, but a 
portion of the COGS
 
opportunity is now going to go off with the 
refranchising, so could you just give us some sort of idea of just how big 
that is, how much you had to sort of make up in terms of keeping the $3 
billion where it is?
 
Kathy N. Waller 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer &
 
Executive Vice President
 
Certainly. So we will lose about $500 million of productivity, primarily out of 
cost of goods sold. But, again, we committed to making up that lost amount 
and we're going to make it up between cost of goods sold, operating 
expense
s, and DME.
 
Bryan D. Spillane 
-
 
Bank of America Merrill Lynch
 
Okay. And so net, this productivity plan is actually now a little bit bigger 
than it originally would have been. Is that just a function of as you're doing 
more, you're finding more savings, or 
was the refranchising kind of 
motivating you to look for more savings, just trying to get a sense if there's 
more momentum building on the productivity program itself?
 
Kathy N. Waller 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
 
Well, we always sai
d we were going to continue to look for additional 
productivity opportunities, and so we have done just that. And we've learned 
a lot about our costs as we have continued the programs, the ZBW as well 
as other cost optimization programs. So basically, we'v
e looked end
-
to
-
end 
and we saw additional opportunity and we're going to take it.
 
Bryan D. Spillane 
-
 
Bank of America Merrill Lynch
 
Okay. And then just last one, of that $500 million that essentially goes off in 
refranchising, will that actually still be r
ealized within the franchise system? 
So does the Coke system itself still see the $500 million of savings, or is that 
kind of lost because it needed to be sort of integrated with Coke to get it?
 
Kathy N. Waller 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice Pr
esident
 
No, it will be captured by the system.
 
Bryan D. Spillane 
-
 
Bank of America Merrill Lynch
 
Okay. Great. Thank you.
 
Ahmet Muhtar Kent 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
We've been hoping that they can find additional areas, Bryan, to even 
increase t
hat going forward. Part of the whole plan around the production 
governance is also to ensure that we can actually lever and pull more 
synergies out of our production system in the entire sort of template of 
North America production. So, yes, the answer is 
a definite yes.
 
Bryan D. Spillane 
-
 
Bank of America Merrill Lynch
 
Okay. So from a systems perspective, this is truly incremental savings. It's 
just a matter of where we're seeing it.

I wanted to come back to the Asia Pacific region. I have two questions. First 
is on price/mix, and then se
cond on China specifically. So price/mix in the 
quarter was down 9%, and margins were down pretty significantly. James, I 
think you talked about re
-
staging the sparkling business, and I know there's 
been some negative geographic mix, so a little bit more c
olor there would be 
helpful. And then the second piece on China, 1% volume growth, but you 
were cycling a pretty soft compare of down 1% last year. Maybe you could 
just elaborate a bit on what you're seeing in that market and your 
expectation here over the
 
next 12 months. Thanks.
 
James Quincey 
-
 
President & Chief Operating Officer
 
Sure. A, let me start with the price/mix in Asia Pacific. I think the most 
important thing to note here is because the different geographies in the Asia 
Pacific group have some qu
ite different pricing and concentrate shipments 
can be lumpy, you do get some erratic price/mix numbers on a quarterly 
basis. And that's exactly what you're seeing in the fourth quarter in Asia 
Pacific. So there were more shipments to somewhere like India 
than Japan. 
You can actually see the flip side of this in the Eurasia group, where we got 
very strong price/mix in the fourth quarter, which was the flip side. We had 
more shipments to places like South Africa than the Middle East. So this is 
all about cou
ntry mix. I think it's important for particularly those two groups, 
Asia Pacific and Eurasia, to look at some longer
-
term four quarter trend line 
on price/mix, given the very impactful country mix issue and the lumpiness 
of concentrate shipments. So that's
 
the key thing there.
 
And then in terms of China, clearly not as much as we would have liked to 
have grown in China in the first quarter; I think that the environment in 
China is pretty clearly having slowed down, but we think we had a strong 
momentum over
 
the last couple of years coming back into China. We're 
looking to do better in 2016, but we don't actually provide country
-
based 
forecasts. What I would say, however, is we're continuing to do very 
strongly in terms of share, particularly in sparkling, as
 
we've re
-
energized 
that business.
 
Kevin Grundy

Jefferies LLC
 
Very good. Thank you.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question is from Steve Powers from UBS. Your line is 
now open. Please go ahead.
 
Stephen R. Powers 
-
 
UBS Securities LLC
 
Thank you very much. S
o actually a relatively quick set of questions for each 
of you, if I could; first, Muhtar, on refranchising and the decision to retain 
hot
-
fill and juice assets, is that an indefinite plan or is that subject to further 
review? And similarly, thinking about
 
China and the rest of the world, should 
we be thinking differently about your plans in India in terms of future 
refranchising in that market as well?
 
And then, Kathy, the 4% to 5% organic growth you're calling out for next 
year, can you just give us maybe
 
a rough sense of volume versus price 
within that and how much, if any, you expect to spend incrementally on A&P 
in order to achieve what amounts to underlying acceleration?
 
And then finally, James, sorry for all the questions, we debated this a little 
whi
le back, and I'm just wondering if you've got additional thoughts in terms 
of your longer
-
term growth, how much you expect the portfolio to lean on 
stills versus sparkling, and do you think you have the right balance of 
demand building support against each
 
of that in order to achieve your long
-
term goals? Thank you.
 
Ahmet Muhtar Kent 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
Yeah, Steve, so related to juice and hot
-
fill and stills, stills continues to 
perform very well in North America for us and the template fo
r stills 
production is completely different in terms of how it is configured to cold
-
fill. 
And juice is an integrated business. So given those aspects, we intend that 
for the future to not change the structure related to both hot
-
fill as well as to 
juice a
nd our foodservice business. All will remain as integrated in that 
respect, and they're doing very well. And we feel that they add value to the 
overall structure of North America, and they're an important strategic part of 
how we move forward and continue 
to increase momentum in North 
America.
 
India, look, you saw that number. Given all these changes we're 
announcing, basically, if you brought it back to 2015, the total bottling 
assets that we would have under our management and on our balance sheet 
would a
ctually go down from 18% of the total mix globally to about 3%. So, 
yes, in India, there are opportunities in other parts of the world remaining, 
but it's a very small template based on where we are, and we'll look at 
opportunities.
 
As James said earlier, 
one of the litmus tests 

 
I've always said, one of the 
great sort of litmus tests for the health of the Coca
-
Cola business is the 
desire of investors and our franchise partners to have more territory. That's 
at an all
-
time high, and we expect that to remai
n high. And therefore, there 
may be other opportunities in the remaining geographies, but I can't 
comment on that any further right now.
 
And then I'll pass it over to James to take you through the longer
-
term 
question on portfolio stills versus sparkling, 
and then Kathy, the question on 
4%, 5% organic growth, volume versus price. So James?
 
James Quincey 
-
 
President & Chief Operating Officer
 
Sure. Look, I think our aspiration is to have both of them growing, both 
bottling and stills, and that's what we achie
ved in the fourth quarter and in 
the full year of 2015. Now, I think in a total portfolio sense, much as in the 
same way has happened over the last decade or so, we've gone from about 
10% of the portfolio being stills to roughly 25% of the portfolio being 
stills. I 
think mathematically, the stills will grow as a percent of the total portfolio.
 
And I would note, as Muhtar commented earlier, I think we need to break 
out the stills and not just look at them as one thing, but look at them in 
terms of their indi
vidual categories. And we gained share in packaged water. 
We gained share in juice and juice drinks. We gained share in energy, and 
we gained share in ready
-
to
-
drink tea. So we think we can do well in each of 
the categories that represent non
-
alcoholic rea
dy
-
to
-
drink. And in particular, 
we can still grow sparkling. And that growth of sparkling into the future is 
not just in aggregate, but I think over the long
-
term, we'll see increased 
growth of low, no and reduced calorie variants. I know that's not the ca
se 
yet in the North America, but globally in our international business, those 
drinks outgrow the regular drinks within sparkling and they're fueling our 
growth, so broad
-
based growth.
 
Kathy N. Waller 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
 
Ok
ay. Then on your question of 4% to 5% organic growth, volume versus 
price/mix, so we expect that to be balanced, volume versus the price. So as 
you know, we have the strategy where we now focused more on net 
revenues. And as we are segmenting our markets a
nd we're focused on 
price realization, so we do anticipate that strategy will continue and that will 
achieve a balance between both volume and price.
 
As advertising and promotions, in 2014, we announced this program. We 
said $800 million to $1 billion that
 
we would invest. We are still going to 
invest, continue to invest behind our brands on that program, although 
we're also going to start investing in R&D. So basically, we're still on our 
program that we announced back in 2014, so you will continue to see 
investment in marketing kind of slightly above gross profits.

Thank you. Our next question is from Ali Dibadj of Bernstein. Your line is 
now open. Please go ahead.
 
Ali Dibadj 
-
 
Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC
 
Hey, guys. So on refranchisement, obviously, good news that it's going 
faster, but I still have a few questions on this. One is I get the discussion 
about holding onto juice. I'm not quite there on hot
-
fill, so if you can 
ela
borate on that, that would be helpful.
 
Trying to get a better sense, secondarily, about when you think you will 
actually be able to grow out of the dilution. So there's clearly dilution right 
now, and then 2016, 3% to 4%, and then probably 2017, but at wha
t point 
will you be able to grow out of that dilution, given kind of better margin, 
top
-
line growth, et cetera?
 
And then kind of the core question is that you mentioned your goal was by 
buying the North America Bottling, that you would be able to accelerat
e 
momentum for sales and profitability. And I agree you've kind of done that, 
going to smaller pack sizes, increasing prices, closing some plants, 
increasing media spend, improving IT, but I guess I'm still confused why you 
had to buy one consolidated bott
ler, I guess, in North America to do a lot of 
those changes. I mean, why do you have to spend billions of dollars to push 
these changes through? Was there not a more efficient for shareholders way 
to do it? And I guess in that context, how do you give inve
stors confidence? 
Because I get this question a lot, how do you give investors confidence that 
five, 10 years down the line, you won't have to buy these bottlers back 
again in North America?
 
Ahmet Muhtar Kent 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
Well, Ali,
 
let me start with the last. First, when we announced the acquisition 
of CCE, it was, essentially, kind of a 25
-
year
-
old problem, and we said it 
would take a while to basically course correct. The level of investment was 
not where it was needed, and also t
he level of customer service was not 
where it was needed. And, essentially, we believe that having more than just 
one bottler essentially having that big a territory was a better way. Scalable 
size bottlers, right ownership values, right structure and righ
t capability, and 
that's what we have today in North America. And so, we feel very good that 
this is a model that is going to stay where it is and continue to add value. 
It's not going to require any further 

 
all of the time, there will be tweaking 
necess
ary, but not the scale that was needed when we did the transaction 
back at the end of 2010. And so, that was a core decision that was needed. 
That was a major surgery that was needed, and that's really what took 
place.
 
As far as the juice business is conce
rned, as I said before, it's an integrated 
business. It basically performs well as an integrated business, similar to 
other juice businesses that we have around the world. It's a very different 
model. It's a very different production. It's a very different
 

 
grove to table 
model, and requires a different way in terms of its distribution, especially 
when it is chilled. And that's really where a lot of the growth is and value
-
added dairy. And that's what you see, whether it's in fairlife, or that's what 
you s
ee, whether it's in juice. And it's a very distinct production model, very 
different, as well as hot
-
fill is also the same, so same with Innocent in 
Europe, the same with many parts of the world. And so, Jugos Del Valle is 
also very similar in terms of the
 
way it's produced, and that is just a needed 
aspect for success and for performance in the hot
-
fill and juice business, 
very different.
 
Now, to your other question related to dilution from franchising, maybe I'll 
pass it over to Kathy.
 
Kathy N. Waller 
-
 
C
hief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
 
Certainly. So we've given you guidance for 2016. 2017, it totally depends on 
timing. So, we plan to give you more information to help with that, with your 
modeling, between CAGNY, and what we will give you 
before the end of the 
quarter, but it's all based on timing. In 2018, you asked when we would 
grow out of this. We plan to complete the program by the end of 2017. So, 
2018, we are out of it.
 
Ahmet Muhtar Kent 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
Yeah. And
 
our long
-
term outlook, just to add, for the industry, remains very 
positive, Ali. Our system is extremely well
-
positioned to take advantage of 
this. We're going to be a much more focused company. We're going to be 
building brands, leading the system, and 
driving new growth platforms. So, 
our core business will have attractive growth going forward, in terms of 
ROIC, free cash flow and so forth. And so we're very confident and very 
excited about where the company is going, from that aspect.

So, I apologize. Maybe I wasn't clear on the dilution piece to it. I understand 
the timing of the program. I'm not looking for timing in terms of when in 
2017 something happens. I'm more looking longer
-
term, and if you're 
getting
 
rid of these businesses, you will be a better growing business, right, 
better margin, better growing business? That's the hope. That's, I think all of 
us, as we're trying to estimate longer
-
term. I'm just trying to figure out, 
because you're going to be b
etter, when do you offset the dilution? So 
you're growing faster, you've taken a hit. When are you going to offset the 
dilution? At what point in time, effectively, do you become net positive and 
then go beyond that? So, that was the question. Maybe, Kathy
, if you can 
kind of refine your answer. I'll leave it at that, if you can help there.

So in, basically, so 2018, obviously, there will be some dilution effect 
because the base hasn't bee
n totally adjusted by that time. But once we get 
the base adjusted, short of other structural impacts, which will not be North 
America refranchising obviously, but short of other structural impacts, we 
will have ""gone through that refranchising impact."" No
w, we do have some 
residual costs that will come out, as I said, throughout 2016, 2017, and 
there will be a little bit left in 2018, that certainly by mid to late 2018, even 
the residual costs will be gone. So I think once the base is reset, short of 
other
 
types of structural impacts, we will have transitioned through that.

Okay. Just one last question, sorry, on diets, it looks like volumes are down 
5%, but that's better than we've seen recently. Can you give us 
some color 
on whether you're seeing that actually kind of stabilize and perhaps a little 
bit improve, or is it because Pepsi changed formulation and you guys are 
kind of getting the benefit of it? Just some idea of whether that's getting 
better on diets wo
uld be helpful. Thank you. That's it for me.

Ali, it's James here. Look, I think in the U.S. business, we did reasonably 
well in growing Coke Zero. We're getting Coke Zero back to flat, and there's 
still 
a decline in Diet Coke. I think the bigger picture is in the 80% of our 
business which is the international business, the diets and lights and Coke 
Zeros outgrew Coke Classic, and so we're seeing broad
-
based growth 
outside the U.S. of those Coca
-
Cola varia
nts, and that's what gives us the 
belief that in the long
-
term, we will be able to turn around the business also 
in the U.S.

Yeah, just finally add on that, Ali, also with our recently
-
announced One 
Br
and approach to marketing trademark Coke, we're extending the strong 
brand equity of Coca
-
Cola across the trademark to offer consumers more 
choice and to also better promote our great
-
tasting diet and light portfolio, 
which is going to, no question, help. 
So I think that's going to also help us 
with the stability that is the target. So I'll just leave it at that.

Thank you. I would now like to turn the call back to Muhtar Kent for closing 
remarks.

Thanks, James, Kathy, and Tim. So in summary, we delivered the plan that 
we laid out at the beginning of last year. And we made significant progress 
against our five strategic initiatives that we laid out. Importantly, our 
progress agains
t these initiatives is leading to improving performance, even 
in a very challenging macro environment. And we are evolving and 
strengthening our global bottling system as we accelerate refranchising and 
return to a predominantly cost rate
-
driven model with
 
significantly higher 
margins and returns.
 
The long
-
term dynamics of our industry remain promising, and we 
absolutely believe that The Coca
-
Cola Company is best
-
positioned to capture 
that growth in non
-
alcoholic beverages and to deliver long
-
term value to 
our 
shareowners. And, as always, we thank you for your interest, your 
investment in our company, and for joining us this morning.

Thank you, Tim, and good morning, everyone. This will be my last earnings 
call as CEO of this great company.
 
First and foremost, I'd like to thank all of 
you for your support and collaboration. It's been my distinct privilege and 
pleasure to serve you and all of our shareholders as CEO for almost nine 
years now. During this time, we achieved a lot. We delivered 
$110 billion of 
share
-
owner value with continued annual dividend increases and growth in 
our share price. We embarked on the biggest re
-
franchising in bottling 
restructuring effort in our history, transforming our company to a pure and 
effective consumer a
nd brand business with approximately 50% of our 
Global Bottling business in positive motion.
 
With today's announcement, we're on track to achieve almost $5 billion in 
savings from 2008 through 2019, through productivity and reinvestment 
programs. We comple
ted a net total of around $16 billion of M&A, bringing in 
some of our strongest and fastest
-
growing brands, including smartwater, 
Santa Clara, Innocent, Jugos del Valle, Honest Tea and Fairlife, just to name 
a few. We introduced almost 1,000 new products a
nd added $9
-
billion 
brands, bringing our total to 21. We grew daily servings by nearly 0.5 billion 
from 1.5 billion at the end of 2007 to more than 1.9 billion today, and we 
achieved 39 consecutive quarters of global value
-
share gains.
 
By focusing on our T
hree W's; Women, Water and Well
-
Being, we've created 
the most progressive, sustainable and connected business cycle, 
empowering 1.7 million women in our value chain through the 5by20 
initiative to support economic empowerment of 5 million women by 2020, 
be
coming the first Fortune 500 company to announce that it is replenishing 
100% of its global water use and supporting the World Health Organization's 
guidelines of limiting sugar intake. And finally, we expanded our portfolio to 
become the largest juice com
pany in the world and strengthened our 
leadership in straw beverages.
 
Our brands, our bottling system and our various partnerships are the 
strongest they have ever been, but most importantly, and for which I'm the 
most proud, in just a few days we will be 
completing the smoothest and the 
most seamless leadership succession. The foundation of our company is as 
strong as it's been ever being. As we move to the next phase, I have every 
confidence, that our company and our system will accelerate growth under 
Ja
mes' new leadership as CEO, and I very much look forward to following 
and supporting him in every way I can.
 
As I've said before, the future is bright. We compete in a fantastic industry 
with solid growth prospects. We have the greatest brands, our strengt
h in 
bottling system is comprised of passionate partners, and we have a great 
new CEO and a fabulous leadership team.
 
It is with a great sense of pride, therefore, that I'm passing on the role of 
CEO to James in a few days, and I have great confidence in o
ur future. 
Thank you for your support and your trust and confidence over the past nine 
years.
 
So with that, I will turn the call over to James, The Coca
-
Cola Company's 
next Chief Executive Officer.
 
James Quincey

Good morning, everyone, 
and thank you, Muhtar. Thank you for your 
leadership over the last nine years and for your unwavering partnership. It is 
truly a privilege to succeed you as Chief Executive Officer, and I look forward 
to your continued support as we take the next steps to 
further capture the 
full array of opportunities before us. To do this, for these next steps we've 
laid out how our strategies and operating model will evolve and provided 
guidance as to our expectations for the first steps and through 2017.
 
So let me turn,
 
then, to the quarter firstly. Operating results were in line 
with our expectations, and we are on track to deliver against our full
-
year 
guidance. As we anticipated, organic revenue was even in the quarter with 
solid price mix offset by declining concentr
ate shipments, and it's worth 
noting the 3% decline in concentrate shipments was primarily driven by a 
few factors that will self
-
correct over the balance of the year.
 
Our first quarter had two fewer days this year, impacting growth by about 
2%, and of cou
rse, Easter shifted into the second quarter. Additionally, there 
was a time lag between our unit case sales and concentrate shipments.
 
Price mix, meanwhile, was a healthy 3% with good performance across our 
operating segments. So the way I think about it i
s we delivered even unit 
case volume growth and 3% price mix, so we're running at around a 3% 
trajectory, in line with our full
-
year organic revenue guidance. And while 
revenue growth is a key objective, we also intend to do this efficiently, and 
so the un
derlying operating margin expansion in the quarter underscores our 
commitment to value creation.
 
Now looking around the world, many of our key markets like North America, 
Europe, Mexico and Japan continue to perform well. We also saw improved 
performance i
n China, in part driven by a strong Chinese New Year 
campaign, and India, while it began the year slowly, performance improved 
with any remaining impact from the demonetization largely worked through 
by the end of the quarter. However, consumer demand chal
lenges in Brazil 
and Venezuela in particular continued to pressure our performance, 
impacting total company volume growth by over a point in the quarter.
 
Now, let's turn to the actions we're taking against the five strategic priorities 
we laid out at CAGNY
. These are those that will help us realize our goal of 
becoming a total beverage company and to deliver our long term financial 
targets. Namely, one, accelerate growth of the consumer
-
centric brand 
portfolio. Second, drive revenue growth. Third, strengthe
n the system. 
Fourth, digitize the enterprise. And fifth, unlock the power of our people.
 
So as we've made progress, let me give you a few examples. For our 
portfolio we continue to broaden and innovate with new product launches, 
reformulations of existing
 
products to reduce added sugar, and acquisitions 
in on
-
trend categories like plant
-
based beverages.
 
During the quarter, we completed the acquisition of AdeS, the leading soy
-
based beverage in Latin America and the latest addition to our growing juice, 
dai
ry and plant category cluster. This adds to a list of successful acquisitions, 
including Jugos del Valle, Santa Clara, and Tonicorp that are building a 
strong presence in this nutrition
-
focused portfolio.
 
Within our hydration cluster we continue to expand 
our premium smartwater 
brand, driving double
-
digit volume growth for this brand in Europe, and 
building off smartwater sparkling's early success in both the U.S. and the 
U.K., we will soon be launching flavored sparkling smartwater in GB.
 
In the 
sparkling soft drink category, we're working to drive top
-
line growth 
through innovation and reformulation. For example, we've seen the excellent 
results for Coca
-
Cola Zero Sugar. I told you at CAGNY, we'd be expanding 
this new and improved formula, suppor
ted by a new visual identity, to more 
markets around the world. In the quarter, we rolled this out to 11 of our top 
markets, resulting in double
-
digit volume growth for the brand. By the end 
of the second quarter, we expect to be in five more markets, with
 
the intent 
to be in most of our top markets by the end of the year.
 
We're also targeting the adult sparkling mixer categories, a key growth 
opportunity. We feel Schweppes, our premium tonic water, is relevant and 
appealing to the growing cohort of adult c
onsumers. So starting in Western 
Europe, we relaunched Schweppes in early April with the intent to roll out to 
other markets in Latin America, Africa and Asia this year.
 
In the U.S. we're leveraging our digital capabilities by using data captured 
through o
ur innovative Freestyle machines to identify new variants and 
flavors popular with consumers. As a consequence, during the quarter we 
began bottling Sprite Cherry and Sprite Cherry Zero as the first national 
launch of new beverages in response to their pop
ularity on Freestyle.
 
Finally, we're looking to add functional benefits where applicable. In Japan 
we have launched new zero sugar products fortified with fiber, like Coca
-
Cola Plus and Canada Dry Plus in the fast
-
growing segment, where 
ingredients are add
ed to beverages to address specific dietary needs.
 
So these actions, along with others, are part of growing our consumer
-
centric brand portfolio. Of course, generating revenue and profits for the 
whole portfolio, new and existing, requires having the right
 
package offering 
at the right price in the right channel, and that starts with a deep 
understanding not just of the consumer, but the shopper's needs.
 
For example, in Brazil, we are in the midst of resetting our price pack 
architecture to hit key price po
ints as consumers' purchasing power has 
decreased during the country's worst economic contraction. While we are 
still in early days, we expect by the end of the year, the actions we are 
taking will return our Brazil business to growth.
 
So having the right 
portfolio is critical, but so is having the best
-
in
-
class 
market execution to support it. To date this year, we have already achieved 
several milestones in strengthening our system across Africa, Asia, and the 
U.S. During the quarter, we reached definitive
 
agreement with ABI on its 
stake in Coca
-
Cola Beverages Africa. We are now working through the 
necessary regulatory approvals and expect to close these transactions 
around the end of the year. As previously announced, we plan to hold these 
bottling territo
ries temporarily until they can be refranchised to other 
partners.
 
Also earlier this month, we refranchised the majority of our company and 
bottling operations in China to strong local partners. And our two largest 
bottlers in Japan completed their merger.
 
Finally, in the U.S. we closed several transactions in the quarter, and on the 
1 of April, swapped our Southwest operating unit, comprised principally of 
Texas, for a 20% stake in Arca Continental beverage business.
 
At CAGNY I also talked about the need t
o create a new, leaner, more agile 
operating model to enable this growth strategy going forward, which 
included anticipating the structure of our business post
-
refranchising. And 
that to capture fully the opportunity before us, we need to become more 
categ
ory focused to outweigh resources to innovation, IT and digital.
 
So we've made some changes. We've created one new position in the center 
and elevated two others.
 
Firstly, the new Chief Growth Officer. He will have a clear leadership 
mandate for global gro
wth across category clusters with marketing, 
customer, commercial leadership and strategy all reporting into this position. 
I've asked Francisco Crespo, previously President of our Mexico business 
unit, to take on this opportunity. Under Francisco's leader
ship, our Mexico 
business has shown remarkable strength, driving growth within our existing 
portfolio, expanding into new categories like value
-
added dairy, and building 
a healthy direct to consumer route to market. He is the right person to drive 
greater 
connectivity across our business, enabling our growth in each of the 
five category clusters.
 
Innovation will be critical to our goal for a consumer
-
centric brand portfolio. 
We have a need for hundreds of new products and continued evolution of 
our beverage
s, packages, ingredients and other areas of our business. To do 
this, we are separating out R&D and making it a direct report to the CEO. 
Calling it the Chief Innovation Officer is reflective of the need for greater 
impact.
 
Additionally, as part of our wor
k to digitize the enterprise, we elevated the 
information technology function and our Chief Information Officer role which 
will now also be a direct report to the CEO.
 
Lastly, we're working through redesigning the organization to be faster and 
more agile. 
When we first laid out the new operating model in February, we 
were clear that this is about a new way of doing business. It's about creating 
an environment that can enable growth for long term. We are well on the 
way to designing the new corporate organiz
ation with a clear understanding 
of what work will stop, what work will shift to other areas and what that 
means to our people.
 
As we create a more focused, lean corporate center and broadened enabling 
services, we expect this will result in approximately 
1,200 job reductions 
beginning in the second half of 2017 and carrying into 2018. While these 
necessary changes are always very difficult, they will help us to do fewer 
things better to lead and support our operating units while upholding best
-
in
-
class cor
porate governance.
 
As a consequence of this new operating model and further productivity 
opportunities across our entire spend base, we now expect to achieve 
incremental savings of approximately $800 million. This will bring our 
current program to $3.8 bil
lion, or $4.3 billion including the $500 million of 
productivity that will transfer to our bottling partners due to the accelerated 
pace of refranchising.
 
Given the phasing of the initiatives, we expect the majority of the upside to 
accrue in 2018 and 2019
 
as we have already included an estimate of the 
savings we expect to capture in 2017 in the guidance we provided earlier 
this year.
 
To the question of how will we use this increased financial flexibility, our 
goal, and we're clear on this, is long term val
ue creation. So to the extent 
we see reinvestment opportunities to improve our current revenue run rate 
through further category expansion, we'll take a disciplined approach to 
make that happen, but we will make the final determination on reinvestment 
when
 
we move into the 2018 to 2020 business planning process, as this 
decision will also depend on economic and currency environment. But based 
on our current expectations of the opportunities, we expect to reinvest at 
least half the savings.
 
So in summary, we
 
are on track with our strategic transformation plan, and 
as to the remainder of the year, I'm confident we will achieve our full
-
year 
outlook and that the actions we are taking today will enable us to deliver 
margin expansion and higher EPS growth into 20
18 and 2019.
 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Kathy to take you through the numbers.

Thank you, James, and good morning, everyone. As James mentioned, 
organic revenue growth was even in the quarter. We also continue
d 
divesting company
-
owned bottling operations which resulted in a 12% 
decline in comparable net revenues. Price mix benefited from positive 
package mix with immediate consumption packages outpacing future 
consumption packages across all operating groups.
 
C
omparable growth margin increased 120 basis points, reflecting strong 
price mix and the margin benefit from refranchising, partially offset by 
increased commodity costs and about a 60 basis point currency impact. And 
comparable operating margins grew nearl
y 140 basis points as our 
productivity initiatives remain on track and we sold off lower margin bottling 
businesses.
 
Moving to cash flow, we generated $788 million in cash from operations, up 
30% driven by the cycling of a pension plan contribution, partia
lly offset by 
the impact of two fewer days in the quarter and our ongoing refranchising 
efforts. And we received a $1.4 billion cash inflow from the sale of certain 
North American and Chinese bottling assets.
 
For 2017, we increased our annual dividend by 6
% to $1.48 per share. Our 
net share repurchases during the quarter totaled $836 million dollar, and for 
the full
-
year, we expect to achieve the $2 billion in net repurchases as we 
communicated during our last earnings call. We expect to return 
approximatel
y $8.4 billion to shareowners in the form of dividends and net 
share repurchases for the year.
 
Turning to outlook, we continue to expect to deliver 3% organic revenue 
growth and 7% to 8% underlying profit before tax growth with momentum 
building throughout
 
the year as our plans gain traction. In addition, we 
expect our comparable growth and operating margins to expand as we 
continue to divest lower margin bottling businesses throughout the year.
 
Due to a strengthening in several currencies including the Mex
ican peso, we 
now expect a 3 point currency headwind on profit before tax which is at the 
low end of our previously provided range. However, currencies continue to 
be extremely volatile. We remain hedged on the hard currencies, so 
fluctuations and flat rat
es will not necessarily impact our P&L to the degree 
that you might expect. Therefore, we will continue to update you as we 
move through the year.
 
As a result, we are tightening the range of our full
-
year EPS guidance. We 
now expect comparable EPS to be 
down 1% to 3% this year as we return to 
a high
-
margin, capital
-
light business model.
 
As we model the second quarter, there are a couple of items to consider. 
First, we expect the net impact of acquisitions, divestitures and other 
structural items to be a 1
7 point to 18 point headwind on net revenue and a 
3 point to 4 point headwind on profit before tax. And therefore, we expect 
this to result in greater comparable growth and operating margin expansion 
than we saw in the first quarter.
 
Second, we expect that
 
currency will be a 1 point to 2 point headwind on net 
revenue and a 3 point headwind on profit before taxes.
 
In closing, we are on track and fully expect to deliver our commitment for 
2017. Operator, we are now ready for questions.

Thanks. Good morning, ev
eryone, and Muhtar, congrats. And James, 
congrats again on your new roles. I guess a quick clarification, James, and 
then a broader question just on the clarification. When you talked about the 
global macros, you sounded a bit more constructive, so I wante
d to get a 
sense because we're hearing from a lot of companies, yes, January and 
February were tough, but March seemed to have improved not just in the 
U.S. but globally. So just wanted to get a clarification there.
 
And the broader question is, as I'm out 
in the market and talking to the 
bottlers, there seems to be some concern regarding the focus outside of 
CSDs. Not that Coke doesn't need to do it, but there's just too much 
emphasis outside the CSD business where in fact the bottlers make 85% to 
90% of th
e profit from CSDs. So when you speak to them, how do you 
reconcile that dilemma? Any context around that would be helpful.
 
Ahmet Muhtar Kent

Good morning, Nik. This is Muhtar. Just let me say a few things on the global 
macros. Then I'l
l pass it over to James also to reflect on your 

 
particularly 
your second question. And I assume the second question you had was 
mainly talking to U.S. bottlers, but you can clarify that.
 
The world growth, based on the latest numbers from the IMF or taken
 
from 
any other organization, is expected to rise in 2017 versus 2016 by about 
0.5%, so going from 3.1% to about 3.5%, just under 0.5%, and further 
expect it to slightly improve in 2018 based on the latest numbers.
 
Now always what we have seen in our busin
ess is that Industrial Production 
Index, IPI, goes a little bit of ahead of disposable income growth, and that's 
what we are experiencing once again here. So yes, some countries' growth 
looks better. China for sure. India, with the impact of the currency e
xchange 
initiative still is moving out of that, as James mentioned. And as well as 
Brazil and Venezuela I think we can term as being in deep recession. And 
then geopolitical factors in the Middle East and part of North Africa probably 
means the balance of 
risks remains still tilted to the downside, if you like.
 
But there was a divergence in terms of the Consumer Confidence Index 
since 2014, and that's narrowing down between the developing world and 
the developed world, which is a positive that. That means t
he developing 
world is getting a little better from a confidence index point of view, and I 
think we're seeing that in parts of Africa, like particularly big markets in 
Nigeria. Again, our business in China also is reflecting the improved macros.
 
And then 
we still see growth in Japan, Korea, in the industrial markets, 
which is a very positive sign, again, as the emerging and developing markets 
get better. We see there's still growth coming from the developed markets 
as in Western Europe and Japan and Korea.
 
So that's sort of what I'd like to 
just say on the macros. James, go ahead and...
 
James Quincey

The Coca

Sure. Thanks, Muhtar. So, Nik, I think particularly, as your question seemed 
more U.S. oriented, in the end this is an and answer. Our obje
ctive is not to 
run from one side of the ship to the other. This is an and answer.
 
We need the company and the bottlers individually and collectively to make 
both work, and I think the U.S. is an example where we have a vibrantly 
growing revenue line for s
parkling and a vibrantly growing revenue line for 
the other categories. We're engaging the consumers. We're improving our 
execution. So I think it's about growth. It's about expanding and responding 
to consumer and customer needs, and I think we have demon
strated over 
the last number of years that we can vibrantly grow both. And that is 
absolutely our strategy going forward. And that'll be good for us, and it'll be 
good for the bottlers.

Heard it down at CAGNY and then again today that you're focused on 
becoming even more of a total beverage company, but it seems like it will be 
difficult to transform your revenue mix quickly or substantially from an 
organi
c standpoint. So A, I was just hoping for any thoughts on how quickly 
you can shift the business mix over the next few years. Maybe what your 
ultimate vision is, whether that's percent of sales mix outside of sparkling or 
mix in low sugar products versus t
oday?
 
However, you'd define it or however you think about the topic? I'll leave that 
up to you. And then second, how big a part do you think M&A will play? 
Because clearly that's a way of more rapidly shifting your portfolio? And then 
within that M&A theme
, Coke staying within beverages I think has been 
sacrosanct at the company historically. How open would you be or what are 
your thoughts on potentially acquiring outside of beverages? Thanks.
 
James Quincey 
-
 
The Coca
-
Cola Co.
 
Thanks, Dara. And I'll probabl
y go with the M&A and then the portfolio 
question. Obviously we're not going to comment on our outlook on likely 
M&A. I think we've said three things related to M&A in the past, and I would 
reunderline them.
 
One, anything we do needs to fit strategically in where we're trying to go. 
Secondly, it needs to be financially attractive, and that's not always the 
case. And third, there is some degree of opportunism, because it takes two 
to tango. You need not just a 
willing acquirer, you need a willing seller.
 
So I think whilst we have an ongoing view of what assets are out there, 
small, medium and large that are attractive to us, of course that is 
something that is not predictable in time. So whilst we imagine we wil
l 
continue to do bolt
-
on acquisitions, everything else is not 

 
you can't 
predicate your strategy necessarily on that. So we focus on driving what we 
can organically. We have taken the rest of the portfolio, outside of sparkling, 
from a single digit piece 
of our business at the turn of 

 
when 10, 15 years 
ago to over a quarter of the business.
 
Of course, we would love to increase the run rate at which we broaden our 
portfolio, and we will certainly seeking to do so. But the law of big numbers 
is also true. 
It's not going to magically change overnight. We need to build 
winning propositions with the consumers, with the customers, and build the 
physical infrastructure that economically makes that happen in a profitable 
way.
 
So yes, more acceleration outside of 
sparkling. While, and I turn to the 
answer to the previous question, it's an and (30:13), continuing to grow the 
revenue of the sparkling category, and therefore we will consecutively 
broaden out where we get to. At some point, will it be more balanced? 
Ab
solutely. Will it be broader? Absolutely. But we will look to do the right 
things at the right pace.

Stephen R. Powers

James, maybe you could just round that out by talking about just fi
rstly, the 
cost side of that organic growth push? We talk a lot about the objective, 
which I think we all agree with, but what's the cost side? Will structural 
investments and growth in new categories have to accelerate? And if so, for 
how long?
 
But my bro
ader question was actually with respect to the leadership 
appointments and really the new operating model that you've announced 
over the last few months. Can you talk more about just how the day
-
to
-
day 
work is to be impacted and improved as a result?
 
And s
pecifically, what Francisco's role as Chief Growth Officer is going to 
look like? Maybe how large his organization is going to be? How he's going 
to interface with the other Group Presidents et cetera? Because I guess at 
some level, I have always thought o
f the CEO of Coke as the Chief Growth 
Officer. So maybe just talk about why separating that function out as a 
dedicated role I think at the group president level, is set up to structurally 
improve things? Thanks.
 
James Quincey 
-
 
The Coca
-
Cola Co.
 
Sure. I'm
 
not sure that obeys the dynamic of one question at a time, but I'll 
give it a go and cover off some of those pieces.
 
On the categories and balancing, of course, as we push into new brands or 
new categories in new countries, there is an investment curve as
 
you build 
the brand. But this needs to be a managed portfolio. I mean one 

 
the fact 
that a new brand is being launched in country X doesn't mean it's not 
already developed in country Y. And therefore it's already profitable and 
generating cash. So we nee
d to manage the total portfolio effect, which is 
not just across categories, but across the life stage development of any one 
brand and category across the world, because they're not equally developed 
everywhere. So there's a portfolio management thing.
 
Of
 
course our objective, whatever the category, is to build brands and 
positions that are inherently profitable once we get to the appropriate scale. 
So we're not trying to build things that will never arrive. We're trying to 
build brands and categories whet
her it's inherent in the brand or inherent in 
the package size that can be profitable for us and the bottling system.
 
In terms of the leadership appointments and how the work will be impacted. 
I mean we've done a number of things. I mean a lot of the impac
t on the 
work is, it's the nexus of we're about to enter the post refranchising stage. 
So we're going to go from well over 100,000 employees to under 40,000 
employees by some point next year. There is just physically less stuff that 
needs to get done at th
e corporate center to support that organization.
 
Secondly, technology keeps advancing. And what is possible to anticipate 
and get done using technology and change the way work can be done is a 
lot more today than it was a number of years ago. We need to em
bed that in 
the organization.
 
And then the third thing is the ongoing effort to find new ways of doing the 
same thing with less resources, or getting more bang for the buck, because 
we can be innovative in the way we run our processes. So that goes across 
each of the corporate functions, including the enabling transactions based 
services. And there's a plan in each place.
 
Now as it relates to Francisco and that organization. I think one of the 

 
the 
two points that I base our logic to. The first one is, if 
our principal operating 
model is local and geographic because it's a franchise system. I mean you've 
got to choose one principal avenue to organize against. Anything you 
organize against will have its blind spot, and then you can mitigate against 
that. So 
one of the roles of Francisco's group is to provide the global 
perspective and the category perspective, because it's the inverse. It's a 
thing that some of the field might miss. So that's part of why the corporate 
center exists.
 
The second reason to bring
 
all the pieces together is as brands and 
experiences are created today and into the future, it's less cleanly delineated 
between a TV ad or a customer program or anything else. There's a much 
greater intersection and integration of how to engage your cons
umers and 
shoppers. And therefore bringing together in one group the classical 
marketing pieces with the customer piece, with the commercial piece and 
with the strategy, underpinned with a digital engagement, is what can allow 
us to more seamlessly operate
 
in this new environment.

G
reat. I was hoping you could talk a little bit more about Brazil. I know 
you've talked about addressing price pack architecture and trying to hit key 
price points, but it just looks like the downdraft in Latin America has 
significantly worsened this quarte
r. And I know, again, you said better by 
the end of the year, but are these kind of technical changes, longer term 
strategic changes in Brazil that you're making? And any kind of detail would 
really be helpful. Thanks.
 
James Quincey 
-
 
The Coca
-
Cola Co.
 
Sure. So I think the changes are structural and strategic. We need to reset 
the price pack architecture. We're going to use more returnables. That's an 
infrastructure and investment challenge. So we're resetting.
 
It's worth remembering that the contraction
 
in the Brazilian economy 

 
it's 
contracted more in the last few years than it contracted in the last decade of 
the 1980s, and more than it contracted in the depression in the 1920s last 
century. So Brazil has undergone a major economic contraction. So we'
re 
resetting what we're doing in Brazil around pack price architecture, how we 
go to the market and how we push that forward. So it will take some time to 
get it in place, and also, frankly, the stabilization of the Brazilian economy 
will continue to take 
time.
 
Now, the other thing impacting the Latin America numbers, it's worth 
underlining that it doesn't always hit everyone's radar screen, is Venezuela. 
And Venezuela is substantially negative in the first quarter, and I think that 
really is macroeconomic.
 
It's not about resetting our business. It's about the 
country is in the state it's in.
 
But the Brazilian thing, just to summarize 

 
the changes are strategic. 
They'll take some time. We expect that to play through this year.

Next we have Ali Diba
dj from Bernstein.
 
Ali Dibadj

Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC
 
Hey, guys. So I do have two questions. One is on the cost savings. Excellent 
that it went up. I want to better understand the drivers of change, and I also 
want to better understand the drivers
 
of the increase. But I also want to 
better understand the ""long term value creation"" that you mentioned as well 
as at this point we expect to ""reinvest at least half."" Is that of the 
incremental? Or is that of the $3.8 billion total? Or $4.3 billion total
? Is it of 
the $3.8 billion at least? Because you've cut about $2 billion so far, it sounds 
like you should be roughly on pace to that in short order at the very least, 
and almost all of that I think has been reinvested. So if you take almost $2 
billion on
 
a $3.8 billion, that's already $1.5 billion.
 
So how much of what's going to be on the come, so to speak, what's going 
forward, will be reinvested? Is that going to be at least half? Or is that of the 
total program? So very specific question on that. And t
hen second thing is 
around refranchising, and if you can talk a little bit about some of the 
potential delays that may happen in refranchising? If you see anything going 
forward? Or if that's very much on plan?
 
And importantly, if you see the benefit so fa
r of the refranchised territories 
from an improvement and performance perspective? Volumetrically, 
perhaps? But even just overall top line? We've heard on the order of one 
point as you move from company
-
owned to noncompany
-
owned, so would 
love some inkling
 
of that from your own experiences. Thanks. Sorry for the 
two.
 
James Quincey 
-
 
The Coca
-
Cola Co.
 
Sure. So starting with the additional $800 million, the driver of the change, 
the principal driver, is the reorganization of the corporate center, the 1,200 
po
sitions I talked about. That's the majority of the $800 million, or a little 
over half the $800 million. Then there's some parts in cost of goods and a 
little bit in marketing.
 
So the majority is in operating expense and in the reorganization of the 
corpor
ate organization that I just talked about. So that's what's driving it, 
and it's about the three things I've said. It's anticipating post refranchising, 
it's the impact of technology and it's the choices on what work we do and 
doing the work differently. T
hat's what's driving the extra $800 million.
 
Now, the comment around reinvesting half was related to the $800 million 
very specifically. So that's that one. Obviously, we've seen some margin 
expansion. Implicit in our guidance this year already is some dro
pping of the 
base productivity program through into margin because you'll calculate that 
the revenue currency
-
neutral structural is at the three, and whether you 
take operating income is substantially higher than that. And then obviously 
that's offset by s
ome negative financing leverage.
 
So 2014, 2015 and 2016, I think you're largely right. In 2017 you're seeing 
much more drop into operating leverage, and the comment is about the 
$800 million going forward. A little over half is reinvested.
 
As it relates to
 
refranchising, we still believe we can meet the deadline and 
get the U.S. refranchised this year. Of course, we're not going to do the 
wrong deals for the sake of hitting a date, but we think the right deals are 
possible. And we think that we're still on 
track with that plan, and as you 
say, we're seeing benefits in the refranchised territories.
 
I'm not sure I would give a specific number that can be kind of inserted over 
the top on everything else, but clearly the idea of reorienting and rebuilding 
the U.
S. system so that it's stronger, putting in place the different pieces, 
the manufacturing, the governance, the IT, the way the system works, 
support our long
-
term strategy of rational pricing and some growth for 
continued revenue growth in U.S. is underpin
ned by the success of the 
refranchisings in the U.S. And obviously we closed out on the 1 of April

Credit Suisse Securities (

Yes. Good morning, everyone. You specified the sales growth by cluster, and 
that's great to give us some more granularity of where the growth is coming 
from. If I may, could you tell us more specifically
 
what's your starting point 
by revenue, by cluster, by region? And also what are your goals by cluster? 
And what will be the incentive for the new Chief Growth Officer to achieve 
those goals?
 
James Quincey 
-
 
The Coca
-
Cola Co.
 
So firstly, Laurent, I hate to
 
disappoint you, but we're not going to be 
disclosing the starting point or breakdown the geographic groups as well by 
cluster and have all of that laid out.
 
The goals by cluster 

 
clearly, we have goals by cluster. The more they 
move from sparkling, the m
ore they move from the things we've been 
building over the last 15 years, the faster we expect the percentage growth 
rate, but in absolutes, it is worth remembering that sparkling still in absolute 
terms provides the greatest incremental amount of revenue 
to the 
corporation of any one category.
 
As I said, just let me make a detailed point that growth obviously 

 
we're 
not moving to an operating model where we're having global category P&Ls 
and running the business through global category P&Ls. The operating
 
model 
is to run the business locally, to drive local entrepreneurship and 
empowerment of the operating unit.
 
But to use the growth opportunity setup to be strategic to make sure that 
we stay connected to what's happening when you take a top down 
perspecti
ve or a categories perspective and have the rights and some 
authority on bringing those insights and those needs and those initiatives to 
the table so that when we as a corporation 

 
we're not going to try and run 
everything for the operating units, but we
 
will make a few strategic bets. 
And some of those will be driven from the cluster approach.

Thank you. Good morning. So one is just a quick follow
-
up to earlier 
question about reinvestment. The $800 million, half of that going back to 
reinvestment. How would the nature of these reinvestments differ versus 
sort of the prior reinvestmen
t that Coke has made? Whether it's different 
categories, or different activities? Just a little bit color there would be great.
 
And then on the price mix in the quarter in North America sparkling up 1%, I 
think you called out some timing issues. So can you
 
elaborate on how much 
of that was a factor? And as it relates to sort of the broader price mix 
question, if you look at the clusters outside of sparkling, can you just talk 
about how much the price mix plays a role in growing those segments' 
revenues?
 
Jam
es Quincey 
-
 
The Coca
-
Cola Co.
 
Sure. Good morning, Judy. So I think that the principal difference on the 
reinvestment of the half of the $800 million is up to now, I would say the 
majority of what we've done has gone into the sparkling category business 
ar
ound the world. I think here the clear intent is that this is more directed to 
some of the newer categories, or some of the other categories to drive 
growth there. So it is principally orientated around growth of the other 
categories. That's the headline a
nswer there.
 
Then in terms of the North American sparkling pricing. As you say, as we call 
that, that's principally timing and it's really related to the different channels. 
The price, the 

 
obviously we have a large fountain operation which we run 
directl
y in North America, and so the timing of gallon shipments, whether 
they go through the bottlers or through the fountain business, can move the 
average price mix by North America. And it's the timing around those gallons 
that has created that unusually lowe
r 1%, and that's the majority of the 
difference between what we would expect to happen on sparkling pricing and 
what actually you see in the first quarter in North America, and that should 
correct itself.

Just one question. And I guess from our perspective we get a lot of 
questions about the total beverage company model and what it looks like 
going forward, and it's difficult t
o see with a lot of the moving parts in the 
business today. But I guess from our perspective, Western Europe is really 
the one market or is one of the markets this year where you can really see it 
sort of in action.
 
So, A, James, do you agree with that? An
d, B, can you maybe talk a little bit 
more about sort of your planning with the bottlers in Western Europe this 
year? And sort of how it's 

 
this total beverage company model has really 
sort of been a difference in the planning process now versus maybe pri
or 
years?

Yes. Look, I don't think I would say this is a kind of a night and day change 
for us. Look, we've been on a journey to expand our portfolio. I think this is 
about making a commitment to press further and faster a
nd make the full 
psychological journey to. This is about a full set of categories and responding 
to the consumer, not a central portfolio with some periphery.
 
We're making good progress with the Coca
-
Cola European partners. 
Obviously there we did a lot of 
planning last year at the setup of the new 
bottler and its integration and the plans for the marketplace.
 
I think you've seen a number of actions, whether it's the rolling out of 
smartwater, the launch of Honest Tea, where we've taken some proactive 
steps 
with them in different categories. But also I would underline we've 
been very proactive with European partners on Coca
-
Cola Zero Sugar, which 
drove a lot of growth in GB in this quarter. So we've got a great new bottler 
that's been stood up. We're broadeni
ng the portfolio. We're taking action 
across more categories, and I think that's part of the future.
 
Now, would I say that's the one place to look at? No. I think if you look at 
the U.S. or Japan, to take two other examples, you see a broader portfolio, 
an
d us continuing to invest and expand across categories and even within 
categories, re
-
segmenting each category for multiple different reasons to 
drive value growth for ourselves, the bottlers and collectively as a system.

James, I wanted to come back to some of the changes you put in place, 
specifically w
ith the new Growth Officer and five category clusters. The first 
question would be, when should investors expect to see tangible benefits 
from the new structure? Understanding that the macro is very difficult and 
the company's skew towards sparkling. Or sa
id differently, would you be 
disappointed if the company couldn't return to 4% core sales growth looking 
out to next year, even if the environment doesn't change very much, 
including the macro? Or is this just more of an evolution of the strategy to 
delive
r on the company's objectives?
 
And then related to that, James, do you feel like the company has the right 
incentive structure in place internally for your leadership to balance the 
growth agenda with profit objectives? Or do you see any potential conflict
 
that may exist there? Thank you.

Morning, Kevin. I'll go in reverse order. The incentive structure is balanced 
between the top line and the bottom line today. Having said that, we're 
going to take this year to have a fund
amental relook at our total 
compensation approach. That may result in no changes whatsoever. We may 
end up going, no, there's no perfect solution, and the one we've got is the 
right one. Or we may make some tweaks. That is yet to be determined. But 
it is w
orth noting the incentives are half top line, effectively, and half bottom 
line.
 
In terms of the tangible benefits we're obviously not going to provide 
guidance for 2018 and 2019 and beyond at this stage. Having said that, 
we've been pretty clear that we w
ant to be in a long
-
term growth model in 
terms of the top line and have some leverage within that. So to the extent 
that we've guided for 3% this year, we would be disappointed if the 
opportunities in the marketplace and the macros offered us an opportunit
y 
to get back into our range, and we did not achieve it.

And our next question is from Mark Swartzberg from Stifel, Nicolaus.

One question, James. On the larger subject of cost cutting and 
whether it's 
$800 million or some added number a year from now or three years from 
now, could you just characterize how far you believe the organization has 
gone and might yet go in the area of budgeting costs? Whether it's on a ZBB 
basis or some other bas
is to help us understand how you think about the 
opportunity to do what you're doing today as a habit, so to speak, versus 
something you do day one, so to speak, as a new CEO?
 
James Quincey 
-
 
The Coca
-
Cola Co.
 
Sure. We've been steadily learning and getting
 
better at zero
-
based work 
over the last number of years. I think we've been getting better at doing less 
one
-
off events that then don't necessarily always stick. And getting much 
better at making it part of our discipline of going, how do we use the 
resou
rces available to the best means possible to get the results we're after? 
So I think that's been a steady organizational learning process that's been 
going on.
 
And the latest changes are just another iteration. The $800 million is 
another iteration of that
. Every year we look at it. At the back end of last 
year we looked at the strategy evolution coming up, imagining the post
-
refranchised world, the impact of technology. And we just considered what 
we could do and how we could do things differently, and tha
t's reflected in 
the strategy. And as part of the strategy it's reflected in the organizational 
changes we are making and the increased productivity savings.
 
We will continue to run the zero
-
based work process, and be clear that the 
efficient use of resour
ces is one of the ways to drive the top line and to 
enable long term value creation.

A couple of quick questions. Number one, James, can you clarify your 
comments about M&A? You talked about bolt
-
ons are always in play, and 
t
hen I think you didn't rule out if something larger, bigger came along, you 
would look at it. That's number one. And number two, from our retailers, 
you're hitting a lot more focus on pricing and maybe more promotion, 
private label. Are you hearing anythin
g different from the retailers about 
price rationality that we have seen in the CSD category? Just to rule out that 
that's not at risk here in North America.
 
James Quincey 
-
 
The Coca
-
Cola Co.
 
Well, on M&A we have a track record of doing bolt
-
on acquisition
s over the 
years. I think there should be a reasonable expectation that they will 
continue at some sort of similar rate. Larger opportunities I think obey the 
logic of they have to be strategic, they have to be financially viable and they 
have to be availa
ble. As and when things meet those three criteria, we will 
look harder at them and that's as much as I can say at this stage.
 
In terms of retailers in the U.S. Look, I think they are looking, they have 
their 

 
each one has their own strategies, their own p
ositions slightly 
differently, so I don't think one can look at them in an aggregate and say 
they're all trying to do the same thing. I think pricing rationalization is 
certainly our strategy. We're engaged with customers in, you know, how it 
fits their st
rategies, each one individually. And largely I would say that you 
know, we're finding how to create value together. Are there risks that for 
comparative reasons by customers or competitive reasons by our 
competitors, something happens in some quarters to k
nock that off course. 
Yes. But that risk has existed, and still exists. But we're clear on where we're 
trying to get to.

And our next question is from Mr. Brett Cooper from Consumer Edge 
Research.
 
Brett Cooper

Thanks, 
guys. Two questions. Within your clusters, can you talk about where 
you have scale or the ability to lift and shift as sub
-
category from one 
country or region to another? Where you see the most work needed? And 
then maybe as a reference for us, can you tal
k about the evolution of 
profitability in juice as you built that out to a global leadership position? 
Thanks.
 
James Quincey 
-
 
The Coca
-
Cola Co.
 
Sure. I think, look, in 

 
we talked at CAGNY, we have about a 50% share of 
the sparkling category, and of all t
he other categories we're somewhere 
between a 10% and 15% share on a global basis. But even that's a very 
average number. You know, you can go to some parts of the world and we 
are clear market leaders, at the same sort of share levels that we have in 
spar
kling, and other parts of the world, we are not present.
 
So there's not a short answer, except to say that we have 

 
we are going 
through, and have gone through, and always update the process of looking 
at where are the next stages of growth both bottom up
, each country going, 
look, I think I need to go to grow out this category or that category. And top 
down, both a global view and the category view saying look, if we want to 
progress, actually, we think we need to push out smartwater into more 
countries o
r tea, for example, Honest Tea into more countries and that's the 
intersection of the global growth perspective and the country perspective.
 
And then evolution of profitability in juice. Probably depends whether we 
built the business through bolt
-
on 
acquisitions or whether we did it from 
scratch. Either way, the evolution is as you'd expect, as we build a good 
either leadership position or a close number two, we tend to come into a 
much more attractive profitability status which is why if we have smal
l 
positions in categories, we've either got to get up or have a clear path to 
leadership or a some number two, or not over invest because being sub 
scale is not a part of profitability.

Thank you, operator. Thank you, Kathy, Tim, and thank you Muhtar for your 
leadership over the pa
st nine years for the solid foundation created under 
your watch. I look forward to continuing our partnership as you remain 
Chairman of the board. We've already been on a transformational journey 
under Muhtar's leadership over the last few years as we comp
letely reshape 
our bottling system. Jump started growth in our flagship North American 
markets. Increased productivity and launched hundreds of new brands and 
products.
 
Even so, we know there is more we can and must do. We led a clear path to 
transform the
 
company to be bigger than our past, to be a company that is 
bigger than just the Coca
-
Cola brand, to be a total beverage company that is 
well
-
positioned across a wide range of beverage categories, and we are 
successfully beginning to execute that plan. As
 
always, we thank you for 
your interest, your investment in our company and for joining us this 
morning.

Thanks, T

results today, we are pleased to report another quarter of strong 
performance capping off a successful year in 2019. We delivered on our 
financial commitments for the year even in the face of str
onger than 
expected currency headwinds.
 
We see the right strategy taking hold, supported by the right partners 

started. This is what gives us confidence in our 2020 outlook and we are 
op
timistic about the long
-
term opportunities in front of us.
 
As we got to 2019, our business performed well. We gained value share 
globally in addition to gaining share in each of our geographic segments 
achieving our largest share gain in almost a decade wi
th 34 of our top 40 
markets gaining share.
 
Organic revenue grew 6%, two points ahead of our initial forecast and at the 
top end of our long
-
term growth model. Top line growth was driven by 
strength across all the operating segments.
 
Comparable currency neu
tral operating income grew 13% versus our initial 
goal of 10% to 11% through accelerated top line growth and delivering on 
our productivity targets. Comparable EPS grew 1% at the top end of our 
guidance despite a higher than expected eight
-
point currency h
eadwind.
 
Finally, we delivered $10.5 billion in cash from operations, up 37% for prior 
year and well ahead of our initial guidance. Our 2019 performance was the 
result of a broad
-
based success across the majority of our markets.
 
Globally, we achieved high
-
single digit organic revenue growth within our 
developing and emerging markets along with mid
-
single digit organic 
revenue growth in our developed markets. So let me walk you around the 
world a little and touch on some of the strategic actions that we have
 
been 
taking.
 
In North America, we delivered a solid performance in 2019 and we are well 
positioned with a strong marketing and innovation pipeline heading into 
2020. Organic revenue grew 3% for the year, and while we continue to gain 
overall value share t
oo, trademark Coca
-
Cola drove our performance with 
4% retail value growth.
 
Volumes in trademark Coke were positive for the second consecutive year 
even as we continue to execute on our smaller pack initiatives. Across our 
refranchise North American bottlin
g system, there is improved execution and 
continued conviction about the long
-
term growth opportunities for our 
business.
 
Over the past few years, the system has invested nearly three quarters of 
the $1 billion to support our innovation and revenue growth 
management 
agenda. This includes expanding availability of our popular mini cans which 
again grew in the double digits for the year.
 
Turning to Latin America. Here we achieved 13% organic revenue growth 
while navigating a tough macro environment by focusin
g on the 
fundamentals. These included expanding cooler placements, acceleration of 
single
-
serve packs and increasing availability of returnable packaging in 
under
-
indexed markets.
 

seve
n years growing more than twice the rate of consumer spending. Our 
results were driven by high
-
single digit growth of single
-
serve packages, due 
in part to a more than 20% increase in cooler placements by our volume 
partners.
 
This aligned focus and investm
ent is a testament to the long
-
term 
opportunities our system sees in the large and important market. The 
resilience of our Brazilian business helped deliver solid results in Latin 
America despite markets such as Argentina where the economic situation 
conti
nued to deteriorate during the year.
 
In EMEA, organic revenue growth of 5% was balanced between solid 
industry growth and strong share gains. Growth was driven by strong results 
across developed, developing and emerging markets, while innovations with 
Coca
-

the trademark.
 
Our innovation with iconic brands also went beyond trademark Coca
-
Cola. 
Schweppes grew double digits during the year, boosted by our new 
adult/mixer offerings. Fuze Tea
 
continued to perform well across the group, 
now fully lapping its 37 market rollout in January of 2018.
 
We have strong plans in place for the brand heading into 2020 focused on 
new winter flavors and no sugar antioxidant
-
infused offerings. These results 
l

supported both by sparkling and non
-
sparkling gains.
 
Turning to Asia. A concerted effort to recruit new consumers and drive 
horizontal expansion helped deliver 5% organic revenue growth 
for the year. 
Across Asia we added 1.4 million new customer outlets, led by our two 
largest markets in the region; China and India.
 
Our success in China is not just solely based on increased distribution. In 
order to help expand the consumer base, we've be
en adapting to the new 
digital
-
first consumer landscape.
 
For example, we launched an integrated Coke and meal campaign with a 
heavy focus on online food aggregators. This helped us recruit more than 20 
million new consumers boosting our share of 
online meal ordering to over 
60%. Actions like these led us to be named the fastest growing FMCG brand 
in Asia by Kantar.
 

face challenges. In Japan, for example, the system moved quickl
y to rebuild 
production capacity following natural disasters in 2018 and stepped up 
execution performance in order to support our innovation pipeline.
 

growth management and improved 
execution, all supported by integrated 
brand building forms the foundation to deliver strong results today and in 
the years ahead.
 
Although we have much room to improve, I'm pleased with the progress 
we've made across these areas during the year. On innova

across the total portfolio.

Turning to the juice, dairy and plant

products for kids and young adults. NUTRIBOOST started as an internal 
innovation in Vietnam and continues to expand across the region, including 
its latest launch in Australia. We look to conti

pipeline in 2020.
 
And just touching on North America, our innovation plans includes the 
launch of a half sparkling water in March with a distinctive edge in the 
sparkling water space as two flavor offerings contain caffeine

We're strengthening our competitive advantage by making better, more 
informed decisions and making them faster, translating data into insights 
and insights into actions. Importantly, these insights equip our customers 
with 
a new view on how to create value in the beverage category, one not 
dependent on lowering prices to drive foot traffic.
 
For example, working with one of our European bottling partners we added 
an incremental 100,000 transactions per week for one of our lar
gest 
customers through insights driven by our RGM capabilities. This kind of 
collaboration helped to drive results, leveraging the power of our consumer 
insights to support growth for us, our bottling partners and our customers.
 
It's another example of how
 
we create shared value for all who touch the

capabilities and see this as a source of growth for a long time to come. In 
the end, ultimately though, it comes down to execution a
s you can have a 
fantastic brand, a compelling consumer proposition but it must be available 
at the right place at the right time.
 
And execution continues to be based on the fundamentals. For example, in 
the Philippines, through the placement of more than 
10,000 coolers and a 23 
point increase in order fulfillment rates, we achieved double
-
digit volume 
growth for the year along with our highest availability coverage and market 
share in seven years.
 

M&A serves as 
an enabler to our strategy rather than a strategy in of itself. During 2019, 
we acquired Costa coffee which provides us a platform to create a world

Coca
-
Cola Sweden announced it would be the first market in the world to 
trans
ition to 100% rPET, 100% recycled PET, for all plastic bottles made in 
the country, a fully circular economy.
 
In 2019, in Western Europe, we used nearly 30% recycled plastic across our 
total portfolio of PET bottles and are accelerating fast in line with s
upply. By 
the end of the year, we project to reach 40% recycled plastics in our bottles 
in Western Europe targeting 50% by 2023 and working to increase the 
recycled content steadily thereafter.
 
Within our flagship U.S. market, we teamed with partners and l
arge 
competitors to launch Every Bottle Back program, which is designed to 
improve sorting, processing and collection in areas with the biggest 
infrastructure gaps. This will help increase the amount of recycled plastic 
available to be remade into beverage
 
bottles.
 
Speaking more broadly, we are preparing our system for the future with a 
flexible packaging portfolio. We are investing in innovation to design

Looking at the bigger pi
cture, our success comes down to our ability to craft 
the beverage brands that people love and refresh them in body and spirit. 
We strive to do this in ways that create a more sustainable business and a 
better shared future that makes a difference in peopl


better shared future. And I look forward to sharing more with you at 
upcoming CAGNY.

Thank you, James
, and thank you to everybody for joining us this morning. 
As James mentioned, 2019 was another solid year. We delivered on our 
financial commitments while continuing to invest for growth in the years 
ahead.
 
Our press release covered our fourth quarter resu
lts in detail. Big picture, we 
saw another quarter of solid results with 7% top line growth translating into 
double
-
digit operating income growth.
 
When you factor in timing of shipments and the extra day in the quarter, the 
top line is closer to a 6% net o
f these factors and in line with our full year 

making on our priorities as well as on our 2020 guidance.
 
On the top line, we continue to see a strong response from the 
strategic 

-
to
-
high end of our long
-
term growth algorithm with contribution from both 
volume and price mix.
 
Delivering quality top line growth is translating into underlying margin 
exp
ansion and profit growth. For 2019, we achieved underlying operating 
margin expansion of 150 basis points driven by top line acceleration and 
leveraging our cost base through productivity initiatives.
 
We expanded margins even as we accelerate reinvestments
 
in the business 
helping us to drive double
-
digit profit growth on a currency neutral basis. 
Comparable operating margin compressed by approximately 100 basis 
points as underlying expansion was more than offset by a combined 
approximate 250 basis point hea
dwind from currency and acquisitions.
 
Free cash flow has been a particular area of focus this past year, enabling us 
to deliver $8.4 billion during the year, up 38% from the prior year and well 
ahead of our plan. We achieved this through accelerating our u
nderlying 
performance, capturing working capital initiatives, a reduction in productivity 
and reinvestment costs and more disciplined use of our capital spend.
 
Our progress on cash is a good example of when the organization was clear 
on the opportunity and
 

results can sometimes exceed even our own expectations.
 

the plans we have in place, we expect to achieve results well within our 
l
ong
-
term growth targets for revenue, profit and earnings per share for 
2020.
 
Importantly, we expect to deliver meaningful U.S. dollar EPS growth. 
Specifically, we expect organic revenue growth of approximately 5% and 
comparable currency neutral operating i
ncome growth of approximately 8%.
 
Key drivers of our operational outlook center around our continued focus on 
innovation, revenue growth management and improved execution, all 
supported by a comprehensive approach to brand building.
 
James highlighted a few
 
aspects of the innovation pipeline and we continue 
to get sharper on how to better connect our revenue growth plan with 
initiatives into an integrated execution strategy in the marketplace that 
delivers on both the top and the bottom line.
 
From a macro pe
rspective, although volatility remains in certain spots 
around the world, we do expect consumer spending to remain healthy for 
2020 and expect the emerging and developing world to outpace developed 
markets similar to 2019.
 
In terms of currency based on the
 
latest rates, our hedged positions and our 
forecasted business mix, we anticipate a zero to one point headwind at 
revenue and a two to three point headwind at operating income. These 
headwinds are inclusive of cycling any hedging gains in 2019, which as 
n
oted in the past were minimum.
 
Considering these factors, we expect comparable earnings per share of 
approximately $2.25 for 2020, a 7% increase from the prior year. We also 
expect to generate approximately $8 billion of free cash flow for 2020 
through $10
 
billion in cash from operations and $2 billion in capital 
investments.
 
Cash generation will be driven by continued strong underlying performance, 
capturing further working capital benefits, further reduction in productivity 
and reinvestment costs and even
 
more disciplined use of capital spend.
 
We remain consistent on our disciplined capital allocation program which 

continue to reinvest the cash generated to support our gro

also continue to return cash to shareholders by growing the dividend. And 
after investing for growth and delivering on our dividend commitments, we 
intend to use the excess cash to repurchase shares over time.
 
My last point to cover is ti
ming considerations for our 2020 outlook, as we 
expect the majority of growth to occur in the back half of the year. The two 
biggest factors are; first, we have one less day in the first quarter and two 
additional days in the fourth quarter. And second, we
 
will be cycling the 
impact from our European bottlers increasing their safety stocks in advance 
of a potentially disruptive Brexit earlier in 2019.
 
This was a benefit to revenue growth in the first quarter of 2019 and then 
was subsequently reversed in the
 
fourth quarter. The cycling effect will 
create a natural headwind for the first quarter of 2020 and a headwind in the 
fourth quarter.
 
So in summary, we are pleased with our 2019 results and confident in our 
ability to deliver on our commitments for 2020. 

direction we're heading as a system and well equipped to execute on the 
strategies to get us there.

Hi. Good morning, guys.

Good morning.
 
John Murphy
 
Good morning.
 
Dara Mohsenian
 
Just wanted to touch on the organic sales growth guidance for 2020. You 
obviously posted a strong 6% result in 2019, but your guidance does imply a 
bit of a slowdown in 2020. So just wanted to hear if anything is giving you 
specific concern there driving that slowdown, maybe an update on emerging 

eing there or is that guidance more that you 
typically start the year assuming some things will go wrong and with a bit of 
a conservative bend similar to 2019? Thanks.
 
James Quincey
 

ch
ange in our underlying business momentum. As we consider the global 

really focused on what we can control and what we can drive and really 
putting together a program around the bra
nd building, the innovation, the 


result in 2020. There were a few puts and takes in 2019 that perhaps favor 
the result a little. The contribution from BIG which obviously is a little more 
disproportionately contributing on the revenue versus the profit line. So we 

same levers we know how to 
pull. And when you compare it backwards to 
kind of a two
-
year run rate or make a small adjustment for BIG, I think 


ecomes 


about 2020.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Powers with Deutsche 
Bank. Your lin
e is now open.
 
Steve Powers
 
Great. Thanks. Maybe just sticking with the top line, 2019 was a great year 
on organic growth as you just described but particularly in terms of 
price/mix realization. I guess the question is, is there a way to parse out 
how muc
h of the five points of price mix you realized in '19 was driven by 
initiatives that you would see as real and repeatable versus things that 
might be considered more one
-
time step
-
ups or pricing simply as a 
byproduct of outsize inflation in certain emergin
g markets? And I guess 
more importantly as you think about the composition of growth in 2020, do 
you expect a similar price/mix versus volume composition or is it to be more 
balanced as we look forward?
 
James Quincey
 
Thanks, Steve. Look, lots of moving pie
ces as one looks at the aggregate 
price/mix ratio. Obviously 2019 was a little heavier around price/mix. I think 


volume and price over time as you get up into the 5% to 6% growth; 6 last 


going to focus on what drives t
he core business. The way I think about 
pricing is that pricing has to be earned, it has to be earned with the 
consumer, it has to be earned with the customer because they want their 

tion, 

see that as a long runway of opportunity on RGM on the pricing and the 
packaging opportunities and of course executing it. And just final thought is 
in 2019, the price/mix is
 
a little over weighted by what happened with BIG 

be looking going forward for a balance between price/mix and volume.

Ali Dibadj
 
Hi, guys.
 
James Quincey
 
Hi, Ali.
 
Ali Dibadj
 
I think that despite just the first two questions you got, it feels like investors 
seem to may be moved on a little bit from questioning too much at least 
your 

right. But we are certainly kind of keep looking for your top line to show 
leverage on your EPS line and that seems to be a little bit more elusive. I 
want your perspective on that. 


companies that would be much higher than that in the FMCG world. And I 
love your perspective on why that is for you guys in particular whet
her that 
can change, and in particular why not get more leverage out of being more 
decisive on your share buyback at this point especially, John, to your point 
given how free cash flow is improving. Why not do something more now?
 
James Quincey
 
Well, firstl
y, I think our long
-
term growth model is pretty clear. And the 
revenue guidance for 2020 is in the middle of the range and the operating 

at this point in time a mild currency head
wind which then gives us the 7 on 
EPS. So I think the key is to keep looking at the underlying performance of 


 
of 
leverage for having coming out of refranchising having focused on 
productivity, having used innovation to give us leverage between revenue 
and operating income. We see ourselves entering a more steady phase 
where there is continued leverage from revenu
e to operating income, in this 

productivity and partly being driven by innovation and revenue growth 
management. So I think those should be the stable outlook going forward 
having c
ome off a very strong period of getting operating leverage. Do you 
want to say anything about earnings, John?
 
John Murphy
 

look at it in the context of two areas. One is our overall
 
capital allocation 
priorities. And then secondly, the cash we have available at a given point in 

pretty consistent that priority number one is to invest in the business; 
number two
, to grow the dividend; number three, to look at opportunistic 
M&A. And then number four is to look at share repurchase. That has to be in 
the context of cash we have available. And while our free cash flow progress 
in 2019 was terrific, I think when you t
ake a step back and look at the cash 


making as we go through 2020 and into 2021.

Lauren Lieberman
 
Great. Thanks. Good morning. I just had two questions. First on, I just 
wanted to talk a little bit about cash because the cash conversion was a 
pretty dramatic cha
nge, I think 96% by my math, and I know working 
capital benefits probably helped a little bit with that, but the guidance is still 
really strong for next year. So if you can just talk a little bit about how 

ce on that front and speak 
a bit to sustainability? And then, James, you gave a lot of color on plastic 
and I just have been thinking a lot about on the consumer awareness and 
preference changes and how quickly that seems to be building momentum, 
particula
rly in the U.S. So if you could just offer a perspective on how as a 
system you can sort of balance dealing with that, the consumer interest but

speaking the only surprise was that they made progress as fast as they have

sustainability going forward, I see continued opportunities to improve the

And we will have lower sort of transformati
on costs in the productivity arena

There is recycling of a special dividend from 2019 and some transition tax

James Quincey
 

of Ali. On the plastics bit, Lauren, clearly consumer awareness is going on 
plastics in particular and packaging or consumer waste in general. For sure, 

haps even further ahead places in Europe. So 

emergence of a more profound investigation of what does it really mean. 

losophical 
question of plastic good or plastic bad whereas actually when you get into it, 
the first thing to realize is there are different types of plastics and some 
plastics have high value and are easily made part of the circular economy. 
Some have a ve


structured move towards, okay, what can we really do about it? And what 
happens is two objectives come together when stand bac
k from plastic. And 
actually it then applies to plastic, aluminum, glass, cardboard, whatever 

do we have zero waste and how in doing that do we have the lowest possible 
carbon footpri

back into the equation here. I think the plastics space started more on the 
waste side, but the two things are going to come together and the objectives 
are going to end up being how do we design 
a system that deliver the 
brands and beverages that people want with zero waste and a lower carbon 
footprint. And when you go down that road and you get into plastics, for 
example as a material, what you find is high
-
value plastics in which PET 
bottles are
 
the preeminent high
-
value plastic. If you can get them back, 


circular economy of getting the bottles back a
nd making them back into 
plastic bottles, a fully circular economy in Sweden with our bottles and those 
recycled PET bottles have a lower carbon footprint than just one
-
way plastic 
bottles but also have a lower carbon footprint than cans or glass at least 
on 

lower carbon footprint, which is where I believe the conversation is going to 
move towards, then achieving a circular economy on PET is actually the best 
way to achieve that object
ive. Now there are as I said other types of plastic 
and we as a system have gone through the process of 

 
the bottle has lots 


 
are 
much harder to recycle or have low value. So, for ex
ample, our Western 
European bottler is just going through a process of investing under the 
European single
-
use plastic directive to removal of that plastic on the supply 
chain and putting in cardboard. It cost a little bit more, but it can be 
accommodated 

how do we eliminate low
-
value, super hard to recycle plastics? And then the 


 
other people are doing it 
too 

 

ere is some new technologies, 
enhanced recycling. We came out with an innovation last year. We call it the 


able to turn that back into food
-
grade PET. So I see the circular economy on 
clean PET bottles being the lowest carbon footprint and zero waste and 

types of plastics will kind of comp
lete the circular economy play and the 
system moving out of hard to recycle glasses. Now all of that if we do it 
collectively with peer manufacturers in beverages and other FMCG and 
retailers and put in place with governments the lowest cost collection of 
systems possible, this can all be accommodated within the business system 
going forward. And therefore we can continue to use a range of packaging 
vehicles for the consumer not forgetting that we are also one of the largest 
enterprises that have package
-
le
ss dispensing between our fountain 
business, our Freestyle business, our Costa Express business, we provide a 
wide platform of bottle or can

continuing to innovate with DASANI PureFill. So we will run a dual track 
sy
stem and make sure we can offer the consumer the beverages they want 
and achieve a future where we have zero waste and a lower carbon 
footprint.

Robert
 
Ottenstein
 
Great. Thank you very much and congratulations on a strong quarter 
capping an excellent year. James, when you came onboard, you talked 
about changing the culture, trying to drive more agility, speed, 

rong results. But I was wondering 

doing, kind of the sustainability of that, perhaps have you adapted the 
compensation system? And then maybe also touch on the changes that you 
di

back; maybe a little bit around that decision and how that works into your 
overall objectives? Thank you.
 
James Quincey
 
Sure. Let me start with the culture piece and then come to the CMO
 
piece. 
Absolutely what we said on the culture and simply put around really 

about the Coke culture and the Coke system culture to get us more growth 

any large system, particularly a large 
successful system is predestined in a way to the effects of gravity to suck 
focus inwards the bigger and bigger it gets and the more successful it gets. 
And so it has to be pushed against the drive and external view w
hat is the 
consumer doing, what do they really want, how are we going to help our 
customers grow the business? Without that, things will go wrong. And so 

along with the organizat
ional strategy around empowerment and 

lose sight of the fact that cash got included in the compensation in the last 
couple of years and we have done somewhat better in 2019 on cash
. So it is 
about an organizational strategy, the various components working together 
to drive the end results which is about the growth mindset leads to a focus 
on growth which leads to better results. And as we think about that, 
switching over to the CMO 
question, we put in place the growth office with 
the purpose of providing more structure. We had spent a number of years 
expanding the portfolio into different categories with different brands we had 
not been disciplined enough about working out which ones
 
were truly brands 
that offer the consumer compelling proposition and which were just bulking 
up. And we had to come in and be more disciplined. So the work that the 
growth office did with Francisco driving it to create the leader, challenger, 
explorer and
 

not working and how do we administer structure to the portfolio in a more 
strategic way was a critical piece of getting more organized over the last 
couple of years. And now the next phase whic

back to more of a Chief Market Officer structure is having put that strategic 
logic in place, we have to continue to excel on one of the four fundamental 
levers of the business. We talk about brand building, innovation, RGM and 
execution, having a sharper focus on the hard core of marketing is critical. 
Now we have a clear structure on how we want to approach the portfolio.

because of lack of access to cans?

iven our 
current plans. Obviously we have a global procurement team that works on 
buying aluminum and can capacity for us and we believe we have good 

there that if plastics come u

shoot up. Our cans are doing well. Certainly, we are going to continue with 
our strategy of driving the mini cans which has been a strong piece of the

but how has the launch gone g
o far? And what does the incremental shelf 
space come from 

 
I mean where is 

 
coming from the energy cooler? And 
what have you learned about shelf placement in the other parts of the world 

 
me, can 
you please break down the 17% price/mix in LatAm into list price, Argentina 
benefit and better mix of single serve that you called out in Brazil and 
Mexico and how should we think about the region embedded in your 5% 
guidance globally? Thank you.
 
James Quincey
 

whole call. Argentina I think accounted for about three points of extra 
inflationary pricing within the Latin America number. So that would give you 
something in the k
ind of low teens for Latin America for the full year if you 


kind of single serve in Brazil and the other pie
ces. So I think if you believe 
that Argentina inflation is going to come down, then taking 

 
seeing Latin 


Am

international markets. And one of the things we learnt as we went into North 
America market is we wanted to move the flavor profile of the product closer 
to Coke, less citrusy, more Coke 


the round
-
one marketplaces. Certainly in terms of shelf space and execution 

ace from the 
energy category from brands that are competitive to those carried by the 
Coke system, by which I mean I also include monitoring that among the 

space. So the strategy is 



conclusions yet in the U.S. marketplace, but it certainly s
eems to have 
generated a lot of interest.

Carlos Laboy
 
Good morning, everyone. On price/mix, can you comment on the roll of 
bottler digital platform advances for driving things like directive initiatives by 
point of 
sale? Where do you see the system advancing these digital 
capabilities further as you look out to 2020, 2021, and how important do you 
think these are as you look ahead?
 
James Quincey
 
Sure. The ability to drive RGM absolutely can be made more powerful and 
to 
some extent will have a greater reliance on our ability to capture, use 
analytics to generate the insights for the further round, not just the overall 
aggregate price packaging but ability to work with customers kind of one
-
on
-
one in a segmented way to 
drive results. So no question that the increasing 
availability and generalability, if I can just invent that word, of data is going 
to create a competitive advantage for the Coke system for the bottlers to be 
able to drive revenue growth management and eng
age with customers on 
how to drive it. And then ultimately at some point that will bring in AI and all 
sorts of other tools, but I see that as all under version 4.0, 5.0, 6.0 of 
driving RGM and then RGM is a competitive advantage for the Coke bottlers 
and 
the Coke system overall.

Not a lot of news

at the overall innovation pipeline. It links back to what James referred to 
earlier. It is one of the key drivers of bot
h sustainable top line growth and 

to for the future. I think with the shift from being volume centric to value

So earlier in the call you said the organization is clear on the opportunity

investment community? Do you believe that the incentive structure at The

ets, maybe something more specific at the business unit level? And then

portion 
of the expansion due to the reset of the cost base driven by the

think we talked about this at the Scotiabank conference in 2019, and similar 
to the cash flow conversatio


the overall growth agenda as well. We are very clear on how they relate to 
the different businesses that we have; the core busi
ness, our Global

of the overall compensation model and we expect to continue to make

Thank you, Tim. Good morning, everyone. We were encourag
ed with our 
performance this quarter, and we can report that we are on track to deliver 
our full year plan. Today, I'd like to talk to you about the performance in the 
quarter and then drill down a little bit into the actions that we're taking to 
expand ou
r portfolio and drive top line growth and, finally, update you a 
little bit on the refranchising process.
 
In the quarter, we gained global value share and grew organic revenue 4%. 
This was driven by North America, Europe, Mexico and China. We also 
benefite
d from improvements in certain large emerging markets like India. 
Our strategic focus on small baskets and packs continued in the quarter, 
resulting in strong 3% price/mix and transactions outpacing volume by two 
points. Finally, our ongoing productivity i
nitiatives helped drive strong 
underlying operating margin expansion in both the quarter and year to date.
 
Turning to our operations around the world. We are pleased with our 
continued good performance in North America, and we have full confidence 
in our s
ustainable growth strategy. As we announced on Monday, Sandy 
Douglas will retire as President of Coca
-
Cola North America after a 
remarkable three
-
decade career with the company. He'll be succeeded by 
Jim Dinkins, who currently serves as Head of the Minute 
Maid business unit 
and Chief Retail Sales Officer for Coca
-
Cola North America.
 
Sandy's done an outstanding job leading our flagship market through a 
period of enormous system change and has set it up for success in the 
coming years. We thank him for his le
adership and wish him well in his 
retirement. Jim, who is a highly experienced and respected leader within the 
Coca
-
Cola system, will assume the leadership of our North American 
segment as of January 1, 2018. We look forward to introducing him to many 
of y
ou at our upcoming Investor Day on November 16.
 
Turning to Mexico, our volume did decline a point in the quarter, negatively 
impacted by some cooler weather and natural disasters, and higher rainfall 
as well as slightly softer consumer environment. And in 
our Europe, Middle 
East and Africa group, solid marketing and innovation, coupled with 
improved execution, continued to drive mid
-
single
-
digit organic revenue 
growth.
 
In our emerging markets, China saw another quarter of improving 
performance, with volume 
up 2% due to strong marketing campaigns across 
sparkling soft drinks, juice and premium water. At the same time, the 
business has made a strategic decision to de
-
emphasize low
-
margin water, 
which follows the strategy we are executing with success elsewhere
. Whilst 
this resulted in a 3
-
point impact to China's volume growth in the quarter, it 
did not impact our profitability.
 
Also, during the quarter, India returned to growth, with volume up 6%, 
driven by solid performance across the portfolio. Our business s
uccessfully 
moved past the recent difficulties related to demonetization and the 
implementation of a Goods and Service Tax during the first half of the year.
 
With that said, we are still facing difficult conditions in certain markets, 
notably in Latin Amer
ica. Venezuela and Brazil were a 1
-
point drag on our 
overall global volume. However, there are some indications of light at the 
end of the tunnel in Brazil where we've seen the first signs of recovery in 
GDP for the country. However, consumption of consume
r goods appears to 
be lagging behind durable goods and services, so it may take further time 
for recovery to translate into faster FMCG growth.
 
So, we're continuing to build out our returnable packaging infrastructure and 
adjust our price/pack architecture
, which has resulted in sequential 
improvement in volume trends as we have progressed through the year. 
Since launching our affordability plan, we've seen good results from entry 
packs, which grew double
-
digits in the quarter.
 
Now while we see various oppo
rtunities and challenges in each of our 
markets, one thing is consistent across all of our businesses: the consumer 
landscape is changing. We see an increasing number of small and fast 
competitors; consumers' desires are evolving, whether they're seeking l
ow 
or no sugar options, drinks with functional benefits or simply more variety.
 
In order to thrive in this kind of environment, we need to be more 
entrepreneurial and agile, to take intelligent risks, and build a broader 
consumer
-
centric portfolio. As we a
ccelerate our way forward to becoming a 
total beverage company, new categories and premium segments will play 
key roles in our growth. We are growing our portfolio in multiple ways whilst 
leveraging the strength of our core brands as its foundation.
 
First,
 
we're identifying and incubating high
-
growth brands. For example, in 
the U.S., we acquired the rights to Topo Chico, a premium sparkling mineral 
water from Mexico that has earned a strong following in Texas and beyond. 
Our Venturing & Emerging Brands unit
 
will serve as an incubator for Topo 
Chico and will guide the development of the brand's distribution footprint. 
Within VEB, this approach has been highly successful for other investments, 
like Honest Tea, maintaining the essence of the brand and the 
entre
preneurial culture of the company while supporting its rapid growth 
phase within the power of the Coca
-
Cola system.
 
Second, we're building stronger capability to nurture and expand small 
brands internationally. We've learned a lot from the VEB model in the
 
U.S., 
and we're leveraging those lessons to develop similar structures and 
processes in other markets. For example, in Central and Eastern Europe, we 
recently launched a unit in partnership with our bottling partner, Coca
-
Cola 
Hellenic.
 
We will seek emerg
ing brands and potential partnerships, but we will start 
by testing premium brands in high
-
value outlets and channels through a 
separate and dedicated sales force. Many of these, like smartwater, ZICO, 
Appletiser, will be lifted and shifted from other plac
es. Products will follow 
the incubate grow and scale path, with a goal to expand fast and discontinue 
quickly if necessary.
 
Third, we're looking at opportunities in growing premium segments such as 
adult craft beverages. As you know, more consumers, most n
otably adults, 
are seeking unique and distinct products with sophisticated flavors, quality 
ingredients, and smaller
-
scale craft production.
 
Mixers are seeing a resurgence in many parts of the world as part of this 
trend. So earlier this year, in Spain, we
 
introduced a line of premium mixers 
in glass bottles called Royal Bliss for sale only in the on
-
premise channel. In 
Great Britain, we just relaunched the storied Schweppes brand to offer 
mixers designed to pair even better with premium spirits, including 
a new 
range of premium mixers called Schweppes 1783.
 
We're also building on a solid foundation in sophisticated flavors through 
brands like Blue Sky, Barrilitos Aguas Frescas in the U.S., and Appletiser and 
BOBO (09:27) in Europe. And we plan to leverage t
hese in the appropriate 
channels where these premium products can excel.
 
Now while innovating and growing small brands in new categories is critical, 
it is only part of the equation. That's why we're continuing to invest in our 
core 
billion
-
dollar brands to drive relevance. We increased our media 
investments behind our sparkling brands before moving aggressively into 
non
-
sparkling categories, and we will continue to innovate within these core 
brands as well, for in the end, a healthy 
core will fuel our expansion as a 
total beverage company.
 
So for example, we launched Coca
-
Cola Zero Sugar in the United Kingdom 
last year. And with the combination of a great
-
tasting reformulated product, 
better marketing, new packaging, and improved exec
ution, this product has 
been in the market for more than a year, and we continue to see double
-
digit growth in the UK.
 
And we started to roll out Coke Zero Sugar to other markets around the 
world, including the U.S., which leveraged the UK marketing and ex
ecution 
playbook to launch in the third quarter. We've seen positive results, 
including a meaningful acceleration in Coke Zero's trends in the U.S. since 
launch, and year
-
to
-
date global volume and revenue for the brand is 
growing double digits.
 
We're apply
ing the same concept to refresh our important Fanta brand. We 
relaunched Fanta globally this year, reaching most of our major markets by 
the end of the second quarter. We did this with a four
-
pillar playbook. That 
was a new look and a new integrated market
ing campaign, a new recipe that 
tastes great and reduces added sugar, a new spiral bottle that differentiates 
Fanta on the shelf, and improved execution and more media investment. 
Thanks to this work, we've seen a return to volume growth and an 
acceleratio
n in revenue growth for Fanta.
 
Now obviously, not everything is going to work. That is why an agile testing 
and learning approach is essential. For example, in Costa Rica, we launched 
Fanta sweetened only with juice and with no added sugar. And we learned 
that consumers saw the new formula really as an incremental brand rather 
than an improvement to the existing brand. So we had to bring back the 
original formula and are retooling the market for this new approach.
 
The lesson is ultimately a single approach 
across all markets will not work. 
We need to tailor our approach based on consumer mindset and tastes in 
each market. Further, our model needs to be flexible, so if a brand 
introduction isn't successful, we can adapt and change strategies quickly. 
And we h
ave empowered our local leaders to make these key brand 
decisions.
 
Lastly, moving on to our system, as we approach the end of 2017, we're 
nearing the completion of the refranchising process. In the U.S., our 
refranchising will be complete when the Tri
-
Stat
e Operating Unit and the 
West Operating Unit transactions close, which we expect to be in the coming 
weeks. This will leave Canada to be refranchised, and our expectation is to 
transition to a partner in 2018. Also in early October, we closed on a 
transact
ion that makes our company the majority owner of Coca
-
Cola 
Beverages Africa. As we've previously disclosed, we're in discussions to 
refranchise this territory, and also expect this to happen in 2018.
 
Before I hand the call over to Kathy, I'll end by saying
 
this was a solid 
quarter and that we're committed to delivering against our full
-
year targets. 
We will continue to execute our plan with innovation and marketing by 
focusing on the consumer and building a culture that embraces change, 
focuses on growth, a
nd is entrepreneurial in spirit.
 
Thank you and, Kathy, I'll hand over to you for the key financial results.
 
Kathy N. Waller 
-
 
The Coca
-
Cola Co.
 
Thank you, James, and good morning, everyone. I'll start by highlighting a 
few key items we've reported today be
fore moving on to talk about 
guidance.
 
We delivered solid financial results in line with our expectations, with strong 
organic revenue growth and operating expense leverage driving double
-
digit 
growth in underlying profit before tax.
 
As James mentioned, we
 
continue to refranchise our company
-
owned 
bottling operations, which resulted in a 15% decline in comparable net 
revenues. However, adjusting for those divestitures, we grew organic 
revenue 4% in the quarter, with positive performance across all operating
 
segments.
 
Comparable gross margin increased over 150 basis points, reflecting the 
benefit from refranchising our bottling businesses and strong price/mix, 
partially offset by increased commodity costs and a slight currency impact. 
Comparable operating mar
gin grew over 400 basis points, driven by the 
divestitures and continued productivity, including the ongoing removal of 
stranded costs in Coca
-
Cola Refreshments.
 
Moving to cash flow, we generated $4.7 billion in free cash flow year to date 
and have returne
d that excess cash to our shareowners. Year to date, we've 
returned $3.2 billion in the form of dividends, reflecting a 6% increase in our 
dividend this year and $1.7 billion in net share repurchases.
 
Now turning to outlook, we continue to expect comparabl
e EPS to be flat to 
down 2% this year as we complete the bottler refranchising process and 
return to a higher
-
margin, capital
-
light business model. We continue to 
expect to deliver 3% organic revenue growth and 7% to 8% growth in 
underlying profit before t
ax.
 
We now expect currency to be a 1
-
point headwind on profit before tax for 
the full year. The improvement in the currency outlook is offset by an 
increase in the full
-
year structural outlook. The higher structural headwind is 
due to the transition of our
 
interest in Coca
-
Cola Beverages Africa, which we 
will account for as a discontinued operation, as we intend to divest the 
operations in 2018. As such, we will no longer derive equity income from our 
previous minority stake in CCBA.
 
In addition, the larges
t driver of the structural impact in Q4 is from the one
-
time impact from eliminating intercompany profit from our concentrate 
sales. In addition, because CCBA will be accounted for as a discontinued 
operation, we will exclude CCBA's net income from our com
parable earnings.
 
So in summarizing the above, for the full year, we expect a $0.02 lower 
currency headwind to offset a $0.02 higher structural headwind, so our full
-
year comparable guidance remains the same. In terms of phasing, the 
improved currency outl
ook with a $0.01 benefit to the third quarter, and we 
expect it to benefit the fourth quarter by roughly a $0.01. However, we 
expect the $0.02 increase structural headwind to impact the fourth quarter.
 
As you model the fourth quarter, there are few other i
tems to consider. First, 
our calendar fourth quarter will benefit from one extra day versus the prior
-
year period, which equates to roughly one additional point of topline growth 
for the quarter. Second, the hurricanes that occurred in North America 
during
 
the third quarter caused disruption to our supply chain, leading to an 
estimated $50 million increase in costs, the majority of which will impact the 
fourth quarter.
 
Third, we expect the net impact of acquisitions, divestitures and other 
structural items 
to be a 27
-
point headwind on net revenue and an 11
-
 
to 12
-
point headwind on profit before tax. And finally, we expect currency to shift 
to a zero
-
 
to 1
-
point tailwind on net revenue and a 4 to 5
-
point tailwind on 
profit before tax as we cycle significant v
olatility in the U.S. dollar from the 
fourth quarter of last year.
 
Now, looking beyond the fourth quarter, we will provide more 
comprehensive 2018 guidance on our fourth quarter call in February. 
However, we are reaffirming the outlook on certain items pro
vided at the 
beginning of this year. We continue to expect structural items to be a 1
-
 
to 
2
-
point headwind on profit before tax. Remember, we have a rolling hedging 
program on hard currencies, so the currency benefit we expect in the fourth 
quarter should 
not be taken out of context and extrapolated into a similar 
benefit for 2018. As such, we still expect currency in 2018 to be a low 
single
-
digit headwind on profit before tax. And finally, we continue to expect 
that our effective tax rate will increase to 
26% in 2018.
 
As you recall, we are holding an Investor Day on November 16. During that 
time, we'll focus on our longer
-
term opportunities and how we'll get there.

My question was really around North American pricing long term. Obviously 
there's been a lot of 
concern in general over the pricing environment in the 
U.S., not just in beverages but across the CPG industry with brick and 
mortar retailer struggles and theoretically pushback as they look for lower 
pricing and differentiate themselves or just a margin 
grab versus CPG 
suppliers. So, I was hoping in that context, you could give us a review on if 
Coke's increased focus on pricing in the U.S. over the last few years, is that 
pressured at all longer term by these retailer dynamics? How do you manage 
through 
that? What are you hearing from your customers? And also, just 
given the new leadership in North America as well as the bottler refranchise, 
I mean, how does that play into that pricing focus longer term? And how do 
those changes impact that? Thanks.
 
James
 
Quincey 
-
 
The Coca
-
Cola Co.
 
Yeah, sure, Dara. Look, a few thoughts. Firstly, I think the most important 
thing we focus on as a starting point is making sure we are bringing the 
innovation, the marketing and the execution to bear for each customer such 
as 
the beverage category grows faster than their overall business. And that 
is the basis on which you get better in
-
store placements, execution, and the 
pricing conversation becomes more manageable because in the end, you're 
creating disproportionate value fo
r the customer. So, that's the first 
objective.
 
The second point I would make is we have different 

 
to some people, we 
are a very multi
-
channel business. Yes, we have large presence in the 
grocery channel, but we have multiple other environments where we 
sell our 
beverages. And therefore, part of it is being in lots of different places that 
helps manage the pack/price architecture dynamics and creates value for all 
our customers in the different channels.
 
And I would, perhaps, leave a last third thought on
 
the marketplace, which 
is, yeah, some of the extra pressure from private labels or the stratification 
of retailers on strategy and pricing is somewhat of an emerging dynamic in 
U.S., but it has been present in other parts of the world and we have found 
wa
ys to work with each of our customers to make it work for them and for 
us. So, we are believers in our ability to create value for ourselves by 
creating value with the customers even in this ongoing changing 
environment.
 
And I'll leave you with the last th
ought, which is, there's no one better 
positioned to understand this in the context of North America than Jim 
Dinkins because he's ran the national sales company for the U.S. system for 
a large number of years. He's worked as 

 
leading accounts in lots of 
other 
channels, too. So he understands this dynamic very clearly, and he has been 
at the forefront of leading a team to build value with our customers in 
collaboration with our bottling system.

James, what might be some of the green shoots of performance list that 
you're seeing in t
he North American territories that were first refranchised?
 
James Quincey 
-
 
The Coca
-
Cola Co.
 
Well, I think, the first and most important green shoot is to look at the 
performance once you get past the 12
-
month mark, by which I mean that 
it's as much like 
having any new thing, management attention and focus 
gets heavily directed to new things. And so, of course, you would expect 
better performance initially on refranchising, and we have got that in the 
vast majority of territories. But I think the most inte
resting thing is that 
after 12 months, when it's cycling and people have got the real hard work of 
building for the long term, we're still seeing the vast majority of the 
refranchised territories performing ahead of where they were before.
 
So they've been 
able to build on the great re
-
foundation work that CCR in 
conjunction with the North American team did. And the sorts of places we're 
seeing that performance coming from is not just doing better with existing 
customers which is true, but also in finding ne
w customer outlets expanding 
the universe of the customer outlets and performing better in the small 
formats which in a way is partly the theory of the case of why refranchise to 
local partners.

James, a quick question on Coke Zero Sugar. When you think about the 
launch in the 
markets that you have and also the early data points from the 
U.S., how much interaction is there with Coke Classic and if you could just 
give us some context on kind of overlapping cannibalization rates?
 
James Quincey 
-
 
The Coca
-
Cola Co.
 
Yeah, I mean, I'm
 
not going to get into the mathematical specificity, but I 
think look the headline is that as Coke Zero Sugar is coming to 
marketplaces. And particularly interesting, those ones where it's been there 
for more than 12 months, a bit like my comment on refran
chising, we're 
seeing continued acceleration of Coke Zero Sugar. It's lifting the whole 
franchise.
 
Yes, it is cannibalizing at times either Coke Light or sometimes Coke 
Original. But in the net, there is additional volume and additional consumers 
coming ba
ck into the franchise. I think it's unrealistic to expect 
cannibalization to be zero. But obviously the key is that to be a net positive. 
So, we are pleased with how it's playing out. It's slightly different in different 
countries depending on the mix of t
he Coke franchise in those countries, but 
it's a net positive and we are encouraged.

I wanted to get an update on the progress from a productivity perspective. 
So the $3.8 billion that you mentioned last time, where are we on 
reinvestmen
t phase versus dropping to the bottom line phase? And 
essentially, coming to brass tacks, how much in billions of dollars should we 
expect to drop to the bottom line?
 
And if you want to be generous and answer a second question, lower priority 
question, can
 
you talk about the Topo Chico brand positioning versus 
LaCroix for example in the marketplace? Thanks. Please choose the first one 
if you're going to choose one.
 
Kathy N. Waller 
-
 
The Coca

Cola Co.
 
Okay, so I will take the first one and James can decide i
f he plans to be 
generous or not. So first of all, we separate those two programs, Ali, from 
the $3 billion program, the original program that we announced earlier and 
then the $800 million program that we added on. On the $3 billion program, 
I would say w
e are on target. The productivity is clearly coming from three 
different places, cost of goods, DME, and OpEx. And we're on target to do 
around $400 million this year. And we had always said about half of that 
would be reinvested to drive growth.
 
Of the $8
00 million program, that is associated with our Lean Enterprise 
activities. Those activities really just got started last quarter, so this year. So 
they really 

 
and we've said that you'll see the benefits of those in 2018 and 
2019, and they'll be split be
tween those two years. And again, about half of 
that will go to reinvestment and half will hit the bottom line. So we are on 
target with both programs, and the Lean Enterprise program has started off 
well so far. And we will plan to update you as we contin
ue to go along.

My question is about e
-
commerce. Your commentary in the last earnings laid 
down the size of the opportunity of e
-
commerce and the way they were 
investi
ng ahead of the curve in people and big data, saying that they had a 
larger market share in e
-
commerce than elsewhere. Could you please tell us 
how you are doing after that channel, your objectives, and how you plan to 
get there?
 
James Quincey 
-
 
The Coca
-
C
ola Co.
 
Sure. Firstly, we over
-
index in terms of share, generally speaking, online. I 
think the second thing I would say is e
-
commerce is not one thing. It's a 
spectrum. And in part, what I mean by that is there are pure
-
play e
-
commerce players. There are 
bricks
-
and
-
mortars who have e
-
commerce. 
And you can say that the omnichannel, there are aggregators. Remember, 
we're not just grocery. We work with a lot of restaurants, and there are all 
sorts of restaurant aggregator platforms, and restaurants or some QS
R 
chains have their own platforms as well. So there's a wide spectrum of 
different versions of how consumers are interacting with customers that is 
digitally enabled.
 
As I said, we very generally over
-
index. Our objective is to work with each 
customer, hel
ping them drive value for the beverage category with their 
consumers. And generally speaking, we do better when that happens. And 
so you can see progress in the traditional grocery idea of e
-
commerce, 
whether omnichannel or pure
-
play. You can see progress 
on restaurant or 
quick service platforms. So there's a lot of growth, a lot of activity.
 
But in the simplest sense, it comes back to the central idea. If we can work 
with them to help the beverage business grow faster than their overall 
business and be a k
ey participant, it creates a lot of value for them. And 
therefore, we have a lot of engagement with many of these companies on 
how can we help create value for them within the context of their strategy.

Hi. I have a question about Latin America. And, James, if you could just 
maybe give us a little bit of an update on it's been a drag to organic sales 
growth and unit case volume, or I guess you'd say it's been a drag on 
unit 
case volume. A lot of that is Brazil, Venezuela, I guess the Central America 
business unit as well. Can you give us a description of, A), how far away are 
we from maybe the environment bottoming? Second, maybe just some of 
the actions that Coke has ta
ken to adjust to the environment? I'm just trying 
to get a sense for how far away we are from being at maybe a clean base 
where you can start to grow again.
 
James Quincey 
-
 
The Coca
-
Cola Co.
 
I think let me take them in pieces. Each one is a slightly differ
ent story, 
although the headline is, I'm hoping to see the light at the end of the tunnel 
by the end of the year.
 
What does that mean? In Brazil, we've talked about the actions we've been 
taking around price/package architecture, around returnables, invest
ing in 
new infrastructure, not over
-
promoting to try and protect the volume but to 
try and reestablish our price/pack architecture that's going to work for the 
medium term.
 
Brazil as a country is struggling or has struggled. There are some signs, as I 
comm
ented on the script, of light at the end of the tunnel. FMCG is lagging 
durables a bit in that. Am I completely happy in Brazil? No, I wouldn't say 
so. I think there's more that we can do that's within our control. But I am 
still somewhat hopeful that that
 
will all play out by the end of the year and 
things will start bottoming out in the fourth quarter. It has been sequentially 
improving as we've gone through the year. I think with more focus and more 
effort, we can see this play through, and so it will bo
ttom out by the end of 
the year. We'll see, but I think the signs are encouraging.
 
Venezuela is really a very tough human situation. It's almost a tragedy. And 
I think that the simple reality is the fourth quarter of significant declines in 
Venezuela will 
be the fourth quarter this year, at which point it will have 
shrunk to a size that it won't be able to impact our overall numbers to the 
same extent in 2018. I would love to think it's going to get better. I'm not 
hopeful in the short term. But I would say
 
it's going to stop impacting our 
numbers heavily once we get into 2018, and then Colombia similarly to 
Brazil.
 
So I think the sum of all that is what I said at the beginning, we've been 
through a very tough year. We've been taking action. We are happy wit
h 
some of the things we've done. We've got more work to do in places. But 
the floor should be set by the end of the year.

James, can you give us your perspective around your performance in some 
of the non
-
sparkling 
category clusters? You look at the quarter I think the 
growth actually softened across all of your segments there. Why do you 
think we aren't really seeing stronger growth, setting aside what you're 
doing in China? And then I think you talked about maybe i
ncreasing 
investment behind some of your bigger brands. So maybe you can elaborate 
on your strategy and the investment, whether that will be funded by shifting 
investments from sparkling to these brands or the total portfolio really 
looking to further incr
ease investments.
 
James Quincey 
-
 
The Coca
-
Cola Co.
 
I think there are a few questions in there, Judy. Look, I think, as we 
disaggregate the categories, obviously, the categories intersect with the 
geographies. And so the story is not neither claimed by geo
graphy, nor by 
category. But let me try and add a little texture to what we see going on. I 
think sparkling beverage growth got a little bit better volumetrically in the 
quarter. And I think that that shows a slightly improving trend.
 
So I think firstly, t
he sparkling has got volumetrically better. It's back to 
slightly across the zero line, whereas it was negative at the beginning of the 
year, and that's coming with better revenue growth. So our focus on Coke 
Zero Sugar, the re
-
launch of Fanta, Sprite in s
ome places, smaller packages, 
working with customers is getting a better volume trend sequentially and 
good pricing. So, I think there's good progress there.
 
In terms of juices, what we're really seeing there is doing a lot better on the 
top end, things li
ke chilled juices, plant
-
based drinks, fairlife, the premium 
dairy going strongly, would love to have more capacity to grow even faster. 
You're seeing some growth in the juice drinks end of spectrum, where 
there's some volume has come out, it's more in the
 
nectars. I think that's 
part of people converting up and converting down. So, I think there's 
continued trend there.
 
In terms of teas, good growth there, volume growth, price growth. We're 
pleased with our performance in teas. We're going to continue to i
nvest in 
tea. Coffee, lots of up in coffee. In the U.S., we've launched our own brands. 
We've launched some brands in partnerships with some other players. All of 
those have gone successfully well. We've got new innovations coming. We 
had a bit of a bump i
n coffee in Japan in the quarter. Not so pleased about 
that, but we have the plans in place to do better.
 
The one where we have done less well and it was a choiceful decision is on 
water. In some parts of the world where we have been too heavily into very 
low
-
margin, large bulk water, we have pulled back deliberately in the 
quarter and that has affected some of our water growth rate numbers.

Just want to ask a bit about, in North America, st
icking with the conversation 
around price/mix, so it just jumped out to me that sparkling price/mix is up 
3% but total for North America was 2%. So what was the drag there? Was it 
price? Was it mix? Was it category performance? And then, in particular, if 
the answer, since I get one question, was it something in water in particular 
with smartwater? Are there plans in place for re
-
accelerating that business? 
Thanks.
 
James Quincey 
-
 
The Coca
-
Cola Co.
 
So, yeah. I mean, we're going to re
-
accelerate smartwater. 
Look, I think the 
key in terms of North America is to see a bit of a trend on the price/mix. 
You'll remember from last quarter, for example, that we talked about a point 
of the revenue growth was extra inventory in our fountain business ahead of 
the summer
. Obviously, that's been boxed out in the third quarter.
 
So said in simple terms, I think the easiest way to understand North America 
and look through inventory and look through natural disasters is as I look to 
summer as a period, let's add the second qua
rter and the third quarter 
together and look at what we got. And there, I think, you can see revenue is 
3% to 4%, price/mix is on average 3% which is in line with the year
-
to
-
date 
trend and is in line with what we did in previous years more or less.
 
So I t
hink when you just look past some of the blips what you see is an 
ongoing successful track record of driving the North American strategy, 
reinvigorating the portfolio, a focus on revenue, a focus on smaller 
packages, a focus ultimately that drives price/mi
x ahead of volume, with 
transactions ahead of volume. And I think that's what you saw once you 
ignore the blips in the third quarter. And so, we're committed to our 
strategy, and we continue to drive it.

So James, just sticking with 
the topic of North America. But my question 
relates to your expectations with respect to competitive activity. And, I 
guess, I ask you in the context that your key competitor had probably one of 
the most difficult quarters they've had in a long time in Nor
th America 
beverages and they have discussed ramping investment in key categories to 
address some of these market share losses, which will include carbonated 
soft drinks and sports drinks. So, you've talked a lot about your strategy, 
which has been helpful
. Can you talk about your expectations with respect to 
competitive environment in the near to intermediate term and your ability to 
flex up spending to respond, if necessary, within your guidance? Thank you.
 
James Quincey 
-
 
The Coca
-
Cola Co.
 
Look, I think 
the North American market is certainly one of the most 
competitive markets around the world. It's not just one large competitor we 
face. There are multiple competitors large, medium and small. There's a lot 
of activity, a lot of innovation, a lot of jockey
ing. In the end, we will continue 
to focus on our strategy.
 
We have a clear strategy about driving the portfolio inspired by the 
consumer, working with customers to create value for the beverage 
category, our underlying category because that includes all p
eople, brands 
and products. We work with the customers to create value for the beverage 
category, which will drive, ultimately, growth.
 
And I think that has shown that we have been able to gain share over the 
long
-
term, on a steady basis, as we have deploy
ed this strategy, supported, 
of course, by the increased and improved bottler execution investment 
through the refranchising. It's a long
-
term game plan. I've commented on 
previous quarterly calls.
 
Will there occasionally be quarters where customers take c
ertain decisions 
that cause disruptions to that or competitors do? Of course, that may 
happen, and we will respond. But we believe in our strategy. We think it's 
the right long
-
term play and we will always look to get back to it even if we 
respond to short
-
term actions.

Thank you. James, if you can expand on the comment about better 
execution of the refranchised bottlers i
n North America. So how was the 
performance gap of the refranchised territories against BIG in terms of 
volumes and pricing? And as it relates to better execution at the trade or 
would you say the flat fizzy volumes against negative before has been 
mostly 
driven by innovation by Coke Zero Sugar, smaller packs? So 
basically, I wanted to ask you if the 2% is coming 

 
performance that you 
had is coming from better execution or just better mix?
 
James Quincey 
-
 
The Coca
-
Cola Co.
 
I think the top part of the answe
r is if all the pieces worked together. It's 
about having the right portfolio for the consumers, the right marketing, the 
right innovation and the right execution. There's no question that when you 
bring all those things together, that's when you get the b
est possible result. 
In terms of what better execution from the refranchised bottlers, I think that 
they have been able to build on the foundation that was created by the CCR 
team. That was we pushed more devolution of accountability, of 
empowerment, down 
into the organization of this national bottling company. 
We were refounded some of the manufacturing supply chain and execution 
of processes. I think the local bottlers have been able to take that, bringing 
their passion, their entrepreneurialism, their lo
cal knowledge and turned that 
into an even better result.
 
As I mentioned earlier, that's typified by things like more outlets, typified by 
things like working better with the smaller format, yet also, at the same 
time, being able to increase the degree of 
execution and service to some of 
the larger customers. So it's been an ability to work across the board. There 
wasn't a silver bullet. It was in fact getting a little bit better across the 
spectrum, from the largest customers to the smallest customers, in 
support 
of our portfolio marketing and innovation plan.

A question on reinvestment. And when the company started the program of 
savings and reinvestment, emerging markets were turning negative or in

opportunity for growth. And therefore, as the emerging markets begin to 
bounce back, I'm not sure they're all going to bounce back to the same 
degree as they were pre
-
crisis. But we absolutely will be investing to drive 
our market position.
 
Now I would jus
t underline that other than some situations very specifically, 
we don't tend to try and pull back very aggressively when markets turn 
down. We generally speaking adopt the strategy when there's a downturn, 
particularly in some of the emerging markets, it's
 
better to invest through it 
to gain competitive position so that you are positioned even better for the 
upturn. So it's not the case that we pulled the cord on loss of markets.
 
Having said that, as I said at the beginning, we will up the investment as we 
start to see the acceleration, and you can see that we've talked about things 
we started to do in India, things we started to do in China. As we see the 
momentum starting to come back, we're investing behind those.
 
Will it be across the portfolio? Yes. It 
won't be shotgun. It needs to be 
focused on helping us achieve category leadership positions or near
-
leadership positions or driving new interesting consumer innovation in 
conjunction with the execution of our bottling partners. We're not trying to 
do more
 
mediocre stuff. We're trying to generate good strong consumer 
brands, whether they be large or they be niche, but that they be profitable 
and they be successful.

Thanks, good morning, James and Kathy. My one question, James, is 
refranchising
-
related and how much runway you think you face for sustained 
improvement in price/mix in Western Europe, where you're a little
 
more into 
the exercise of refranchising, and also China and Africa where refranchising 
has begun or will soon begin, simply the price/mix opportunity in front of 
you in those markets?
 
James Quincey

I think in Western Europe, we've had 
a very good start to the creation of 
CCEP [Coca
-
Cola European Partners]. Yes, it was a little bouncy in the third 
quarter with some localized poor weather that offset the better weather that 
was in Q2. If you look past those blips, I think you see momentum
 
in 
Western Europe coming back in and good growth.
 
I've talked previously about expectations on price/mix, where in Western 
Europe I think we can have, in comparison perhaps to the U.S., a little more 
volume growth and therefore a little more balance betwe
en volume and 
price in Europe. As we go forward, the U.S. is more assertively looking for a 
package price architecture mix led part of the equation. So I think that the 
sustained idea for Western Europe is a balance.
 
In terms of China and Africa, there's a
 
slightly different situation in Africa. 
Clearly, there's more opportunity for expansion of the portfolio 
volumetrically, although of course there will be a price/mix element. And 
China is again a place where we're looking to rebuild the volume momentum 
wi
th a moderate degree of price/mix.

James, can you just talk a little bit more about Mexico? I think you alluded 
both to the weather
, and then you did a little bit of a slowdown in the 
category. Any way to quantify what the hurricanes or anything had impact 
on the quarter, and then if there's any lingering impact, and then just 
touching on the slowdown you said for the quarter?
 
James Q
uincey

The Coca
-
Cola Co.
 
Clearly, the natural disasters in the whole Caribbean basin, whether we're 
talking Florida, Texas, Puerto Rico, or Mexico with the earthquakes, all 
occurred in the same quarter, so there's clearly an impact.
 
I'm not going to atta
ch a number to it because I'm not really a big fan of 
putting it all into the one
-
off temporary basket, but clearly there was an 
impact. The weather was a bit more miserable in the third quarter, and there 
was a bit of softening of consumer sentiment throu
gh the third quarter in 
Mexico. I don't think these are new enduring trends, certainly not the 
natural disasters hopefully not, nor is the consumer one. I think that will 
slowly reverse over the balance of the year. We'll see. So I don't think 
there's a bi
g issue in Mexico.
 
Of course, it's one of those places too where we're looking to work on our 
price and package architecture and the full portfolio that we've developed as 
a system over the last few decades there to really be able to continue to 
drive reve
nue and I think it was a strong revenue quarter for the system in 
Mexico and I think that will continue.

James, talking ab
out the leadership change in CCR can you talk about what 
would Jim Dinkins key priorities would be? And then as this leadership 
transition happens here, do you see that as an opportunity to maybe 
reorient the organization to develop new muscles as you tran
sition the 
portfolio?
 
James Quincey 
-
 
The Coca
-
Cola Co.
 
Look, I think the leadership change in North America, I mean, leaders don't 
last forever and this is another one of those changes. There's a new chapter 
about to begin in North America.
 
We've had a gr
eat run over a few years. We've successfully carried out a 
humongous refranchising task and I think Sandy made a decision this time 
for a new leader. And I think Jim is the right person. He's got full portfolio 
experience, he got marketing experience, he k
nows the customers across 
the whole spectrum and he has the right capabilities as a leader to take us 
to the next stage of growth.
 
What does that need to be? Clearly, it needs to be about continuing to 
execute the strategy we got in place. But like all str
ategies, they need to 
evolve in the same way that company's global strategy evolves for the 
circumstances we face so will the North America one. It's not just the fact 
that the leader changes that you need to continue to evolve and build new 
capabilities. 
We knew that before. We had some things under development. 
Of course, we'll learn new things and we'll identify new ideas.
 
So I think it's about the continued journey of the North American business. 
It's a great team. It's a great system. They've got their
 
mojo back. They 
know they need to do more things to execute and complete the mission in 
the short
-
term and to evolve and build new capabilities for the long
-
term.

Great. Thank you very much. James, in the beginning, you talked about 
increasing desire of consumers for variety that helped driving innovation and 
many new brands, new competitors. I think that's mostly a comment a
bout 
the U.S., but I'm wondering if you could take that comment and those 
trends and talk about how that is playing out in the rest of the world and 
whether that is something that if you've seen it sort of first in the U.S., you 
can kind of get ahead of it
 
and take advantage of, perhaps learnings in the 
U.S. to perhaps capture more of those opportunities in other countries. 
Thank you.
 
James Quincey

The Coca

Cola Co.
 
Yeah. Look, I think it's not just the U.S. trend. You can look at Japan where, 
arguably, b
everage diversity is even greater than the U.S. But I think the 
central point is the following. If you look back over time and you look at 
what is the behavior of teens and young adults of each generation as it 
comes through, there's one key fact. Each gen
eration consumes and, 
importantly, buys more commercial beverages than the previous one.
 
The second important fact is they do so across a greater variety of drinks. 
It's not that they buy more commercial beverages and drink ever
-
increasing 
amounts of the s
ame thing. They go for diversity. Therefore, you can see 
around the world that those places which have the highest amounts of 
disposable income, each generation is coming along and looking for that 
diversity. That's true in the U.S. It's true in Japan. It'
s true in other 
developed markets and other wealthy parts of even emerging markets.
 
And so the learnings that are available are actually not just one directional, 
they are actually from many different places across the world. We've got to 
find ways to take
 
the learnings from the U.S., from other parts, Japan, from 
Europe, from Australia and finding the best of the best and allowing 
ourselves to fuel the diversity of the portfolio, yet understanding that, in the 
end, what grows are the global brands.
 
I mean,
 
the world, over the last number of years has been typified, at least 
in beverages, by outsized growth by global brands and the entry of lots of 
new smaller brands. The bit in the middle was tougher. So you have to keep 
fueling the machine by having innova
tion and testing the frontier of variety, 
yet, over time graduating those to large
-
scale consumer franchises, not 
necessarily single flavor franchises but consumer franchises.

Okay. Sorry, I'll try again. So just related to CCBA, you're saying that you're 
now expecting completion in 2018. I'm pretty 
sure that this time last year, 
you were expecting it in the second half of 2017. I'm just wondering what on 
earth is taking so long, mindful that, for example, (56:00) dropped out of 
that process, I think, as long ago as March. Are we left concluding that 
the 
business that is up for sale is not in a state where anybody wants to buy it?
 
James Quincey 
-
 
The Coca
-
Cola Co.
 
No, that's the wrong conclusion, Andrew. The simple answer is that the 
regulatory process in South Africa is not time
-
regulated and the fact
 
is we 
got regulatory clearance in the last month or so, and that then led us to 
closing. And now we will proceed to work with our prospective partners that 
are interested and have substantive interest. And when we say 2018 that's 
because it includes regul
atory and closing approval. So that's the simple 
answer.
 
So I think that's it. That's time, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for joining 
in. To conclude, I think we delivered a solid quarter. We're on track to close 
out a successful year. And as always, we 
thank you for your interest, your 
investment in our company and for joining us. And again, we look forward to 
sharing with you more during our Investor Day on November 16. Thank you.

Thanks, Tim, and good morning, 
everyone. As we pass the midpoint of the 
year, I'm pleased to say that we are where we expected to be and remain on 
track to deliver our full year guidance. Importantly, we continue to 
accelerate the transformation of our business into a total beverage com
pany 
by driving against the strategic priorities we laid out at CAGNY: mainly, 
expanding our portfolio with new products, marketing platforms and a 
consistent strategy to offer our customers the best consumer
-
centric 
beverage portfolio; second, driving rev
enue growth through enhanced 
revenue growth management strategies and a strengthened system; third, 
digitizing our enterprise; and fourth and very importantly, unlocking the 
power of our people as we instill a growth culture and establish a new, 
leaner ope
rating model.
 
With this as the backdrop, I'd like to talk about our performance in the 
quarter and then drill down into actions that we are taking to drive top line 
growth and finally update you on refranchising and our new operating 
model. So firstly, sta
rting with the quarter, ultimately amidst a weak 
consumer retail environment in emerging markets, particularly Latin 
America, and some softness in North America, our actions are enabling us to 
win in the market. Globally, we gained value share in total non
-
alcoholic 
beverages and in most of our category clusters.
 
As expected, organic revenue grew 3% in the quarter. Not only did we see a 
strong performance in rapidly expanding areas of our business, such as 
Innocent in Europe, but our revenue growth was also
 
largely driven by 
innovation in sparkling soft drinks where we have continued to roll out Coca
-
Cola Zero Sugar around the world. Price mix continues to benefit from a 
focus on smaller pack sizes. Globally, our immediate consumption packs 
which are typical
ly sold at a higher retail price per ounce grew unit case 
volume 3% in the quarter. Taken together with the effective management of 
our portfolio and cost structure, solid pricing enabled us to deliver another 
quarter of strong underlying operating margin 
expansion.
 
Now turning to look around the world, many of our developed markets, 
particularly North America and Europe, continued to perform well. In North 
America, improving performance in our refranchised territories with a 
disciplined approach to volume,
 
price and mix management and some 
favorable timing of shipments in our foodservice business led to an organic 
revenue growth of 5%. In our Europe, Middle East and Africa group, solid 
marketing and innovation along with improved alignment with our bottling
 
partners resulted in strong 6% organic revenue growth.
 
Importantly, though, some of our larger markets like China and Nigeria are 
also accelerating top line revenue growth this year as we accelerate the 
revenue management strategies. However, as I noted e
arlier, there are still 
regions around the world experiencing political instability and some 
challenging economic conditions. Most of Latin America, including Brazil, 
Argentina and Venezuela, remain difficult operating environments for 
consumer products co
mpanies. Additionally, while we believe India has 
taken the right steps towards modernizing its monetary and tax system, new 
policies have resulted in near term uncertainty for retailers and consumers 
that impacted the beverage industry in the first half.
 
In all of these instances, we are responding quickly to the volatile external 
environment and building strategies that will allow us to deliver value to our 
customers by responding to these new challenges faster than the 
competition.
 
Now, let me turn and t
ake a deeper look at some specific actions we're 
taking to drive revenue growth. These efforts are the result of a keen focus 
on innovation, small pack sizes and more robust segmentation strategies. 
For example, in China, we launched new innovative version
s of Minute Maid 
Pulpy brand to serve the premium consumer segment at retail prices above 
the original version. In Europe, innocent, our premium juice and smoothie 
brand, continued to outperform with double
-
digit revenue growth as a result 
of expanded dist
ribution and product innovations, such as pack 
improvements and the launch of new, higher
-
value
-
added smoothies.
 
Within our sparkling soft drinks, revenue growth was driven by our no
-
sugar 
options, where we are perfecting recipes, expanding availability an
d 
supporting enhanced execution with the right level of marketing support. 
Specifically, we continue to see excellent results from Coca
-
Cola Zero Sugar. 
This product has demonstrated strong consumer appeal in Europe, Mexico 
and other markets, resulting in 
double digit global volume growth for the 
brand year
-
to
-
date. So, we will continue to roll this new and improved 
product out across key markets, including the U.S., supported by substantial 
marketing and media support. And with its even more Coke
-
like tast
e, we 
expect it to continue to be a growing and important part of our portfolio.
 
You all know that small packs are an important part of our business. They 
enable us to provide price mix
-
accretive offerings at affordable consumer 
price points as well as hig
h
-
value products in developed markets like the 
U.S. This year's success of the small pack initiatives in China, South Africa 
and Central and Eastern Europe is helping to deliver growth in these 
markets.
 
Finally, we are looking to grow through more robust s
egmentation of our 
existing portfolio. In West Africa, for example, we are tailing (8:01) our 
package offerings and trade incentives for rural and urban markets even 
further and, as a result, we are delivering stronger top line results.
 
Now, to support all
 
of these initiatives, we have been taking significant 
action to strengthen our system. In May, we held our annual Global System 
Meeting, and the level of engagement among our bottling partners was very 
high. They are encouraged by the innovation we are br
inging to the market 
and are committed to support our investments with enhanced focus on local 
execution. And over the past year, we started to see tangible results, 
starting, let's say, in North America. We've seen continued strong 
performance from our bo
ttlers as we complete refranchising and are 
confident in the actions we have taken to complete the changes this year 
while also improving execution in the marketplace.
 
For example, we are seeing improved execution from Coca
-
Cola UNITED and 
Coca
-
Cola Bevera
ges Florida across the state of Florida. In territories it 
acquired, UNITED is increasing outlet penetration in eat and drink channels 
whilst also improving same
-
store sales with local convenience stores and 
workplaces. These are the types of account where
 
at the local touch from 
our network of independent bottlers provides a significant strategic 
advantage and is one of the reasons why our overall performance in North 
America has consistently outshined our performance in measured channels.
 
And I'm pleased 
to say that we are getting close to finishing our planned 
refranchising activities. With the latest letters of intent to divest both West 
and the Tri
-
State Metro Operating Units, we now have 100% of the U.S. 
territories of Coca
-
Cola Refreshments under agre
ement or letter of intent.
 
Turning to Europe, we are already seeing better results than we have seen 
in several years from this important profit center as our new pan
-
regional 
bottler, Coca
-
Cola European Partners, leverages best practices from its three 
pr
edecessors and we work together to bring new products to the market at a 
faster pace.
 
Turning to Asia, Coca
-
Cola Bottlers Japan completed its first quarter as an 
integrated company, and earlier this month, we completed refranchising of 
all our company
-
owne
d bottling operations in China with the sale of the 
Shanghai bottler.
 
Finally, turning to Africa, we reached agreement with the South African 
government on conditions addressing public interest considerations in 
connection with our planned acquisition of A
BI's stake in Coca
-
Cola 
Beverages Africa. Over the coming months, we will continue to work with the 
various regulatory approval processes and expect to close these transactions 
around the end of the year. As a reminder, we plan to account for these 
bottlin
g territories as discontinued operations until they can be refranchised 
to other partners.
 
As I laid out earlier this year, we are also embracing a new operating model 
and changing our culture to smart risks and be more growth orientated. As 
we expand our 
portfolio, we are taking a test and learn mentality which 
means some things will work right off the bat, some will need tweaking and 
that's all okay. For instance, we launched Honest Tea in Europe earlier this 
year and learned that the brand resonates bett
er with consumers in certain 
channels, so we've immediately begun to evolve the packaging format and 
go
-
to
-
market channel strategy. We are seeing what consumers want and 
making adjustments immediately. At the end of the day, speed and agility 
are critical 
in this rapidly changing consumer landscape.
 
Now turning to our Lean center initiatives, we are on track. Much of the 
organizational design work we outlined earlier this year is now complete and 
we are rapidly implementing our new corporate structure to su
pport faster 
growth. While these large
-
scale changes are never easy, our associates 
understand the need for our company to adapt and I am very encouraged by 
how well the organization is embracing the transformation. Our system has 
proven that it is taking 
the right actions to be successful in the market and 
going forward, we will remain relentless in becoming a more efficient, 
leaner, more agile while continuing to expand our portfolio, therefore 
building a strong position for future growth.
 
Looking at the 
back half of the year, we will continue to face many of the 
macro headwinds we have seen year
-
to
-
date and over the past few years. 
However, we are building on a solid marketing calendar, an innovation 
pipeline, and strong execution. And I am confident we w
ill achieve our full
-
year outlook.
 
So with that, I will turn the call over to Kathy to take you through our 
numbers.

Thank you, and good morning, everyone. We delivered good financial results 
in line with our 
expectations with price mix and operating expense leverage 
driving 6% growth in underlying profit before tax. As James mentioned, we 
continue to refranchise our company
-
owned bottling operations which, 
together with a slight currency headwind, resulted in 
a 16% decline in 
comparable net revenues. However, adjusting for the impact of currency and 
those divestitures, our revenue management initiatives led to 3% organic 
revenue growth in the quarter with strong performance in North America, 
Europe and Mexico.
 
Comparable gross margin increased over 200 basis points, reflecting the 
benefit from refranchising lower margin bottling businesses and strong price 
mix, partially offset by increased commodity costs and about a 40
-
basis
-
point currency impact. Comparable o
perating margin grew over 375 basis 
points, driven by the divestitures, the timing of SG&A expenses, and 
continued productivity.
 
Moving to cash flow, we generated $2.6 billion in free cash flow year
-
to
-
date 
and have returned to our shareowners $1.6 billion
 
in the form of dividends, 
reflecting a 6% increase in our annual dividend and $1.3 billion in net share 
purchases.
 
Turning to our comparable outlook, for the full year, we expect to deliver 3% 
organic revenue growth and 7% to 8% growth in underlying profi
t before 
tax. In addition, we expect divestitures of company
-
owned bottlers to result 
in a five
-
 
to six
-
point structural headwind to profit before tax. However, due 
to the strengthening of several currencies, we now expect a currency 
headwind to profit bef
ore tax of two points, slightly better than our previous 
guidance of a three
-
point headwind. This will result in approximately a $0.02 
benefit to full
-
year EPS. So, we now expect comparable EPS to be flat to 
down 2% this year as we complete the bottler ref
ranchising process and 
return to a higher margin capital
-
light business model.
 
As we model the third quarter, there are a few items to consider. First, we 
expect the net impact of acquisitions, divestitures and other structural items 
to be a 19
-
 
to 20
-
poin
t headwind on net revenue and a nine
-
 
to ten
-
point 
headwind on profit before tax. Therefore, we also expect this to result in 
greater comparable growth in operating margin expansions than we saw in 
the first half. Second, we expect that currency will be a 
one
-
 
to two
-
point 
headwind on net revenues and a two
-
 
to three
-
point headwind on profit 
before tax. And then finally, as a reminder, our calendar fourth quarter will 
benefit from one extra day versus the prior
-
year period.
 
So in summary, our performance du
ring the first half of the year was in line 
with our expectations. And given that many markets remain volatile, we're 
maintaining our currency neutral estimate. However, with a slightly better 
currency environment in the back half of the year, we now expec
t full year 
comparable EPS to come in $0.02 higher than our previous guidance.

I guess, my question is related to the flexibility to spend more. I guess, as 
we're kind of watching the year evolve and watching the performance, it 
seems like you're having good traction with a lot of the reve
nue initiatives, 
packaging product. So James, could you just talk to us about maybe sort of 
the flexibility you have within your plans to maybe increase some of the 
marketing investment, or some of that investment to drive revenue growth, 
given that it see
ms like you've got pretty good response to kind of what 
you're doing now?

Good morning. Yes. Yeah, I think we've said that we're going to manage the 
year, and we're going to try and put into that balance the obvious buildi
ng of 
the business over the long term. We have stated that we'd like to get out of 
the trend of declining EPS, which we've seen in the last few years, and that 
we are going to invest where it makes sense.
 
So, we are constantly looking at where that places 
our momentum and 
should we invest more, and we have done so. And we have increased our 
plans in the downhill in a couple of places where we see really good 
momentum and the good reasons to invest for better results. But the world 
remains volatile, and ther
e are places where the environment is better 
suited to affordability, to returnables, to adjustments and where markets are 
just frankly under a lot of macro pressure. Extra investment is not going to 
drive us very far. So, we will continue to manage it wit
h flexibility. We know 
that going forward, we'll have some of the money we're going to generate 
out of Lean Enterprise, to look across the portfolio, but we're going to decide 
that on an ongoing basis.

Hi. I guess my one question is just around your organic revenue growth 
guidance f
or the full year, and just kind of how you're thinking about the 
puts and takes around it in the back half. So obviously, you're doing 3% 
year
-
to
-
date. The full year guidance implies a continuation of the similar 
growth rate. I think a lot of your peers ar
e actually guiding to acceleration in 
the back half. And there may be some unique timing situations for you guys, 
but just kind of the puts and takes as you think about the back half from an 
organic sales growth perspective? Thanks.
 
James Quincey 
-
 
The Coc
a
-
Cola Co.
 
Yeah. Sure. Good morning, Judy. I think a couple of things. On an as
-
reported basis, you will indeed see an acceleration in the back half, 
principally because we have an extra day in the fourth quarter and we had 
the less days in the first quart
er. So, I think as you look at the reported 
numbers, there will be some acceleration.
 
Now, underlying that and seen in its most simple sense of taking unit cases 
and price mix, as you say, we did roughly 3% in the first quarter and 
roughly 3% this quarter.
 
We're guiding to 3% for the rest of the year 
because, frankly, the world has not changed. We're doing a lot of the right 
things in the places that are going well, and frankly, some of the ones that 
need to be fixed. But we don't see the world is improving
 
rapidly, and 
therefore we're not banking on that happening and so we're more focused 
on doing what we know needs to be done and having a moderate view of 
how that's going to play out in the rest of the year. And I think the 
expectation for the downhill sh
ould be more of the same of what we've had 
so far this year, hopefully with some of those macro situations improving as 
we get towards the end.

James, one of the things we've heard with regards to U.S. refranchising is 
that as they've taken over the territories, that are actually performing 
maybe better than Coke was when they were doing it. And you've seen an 
acceleration 
in some markets. They've been a little more aggressive. So, I 
guess, this is really one question. Is that the case? Why is that happening? 
And do you expect that to be a tailwind for the business in the U.S. over the 
foreseeable future?
 
James Quincey 
-
 
The
 
Coca
-
Cola Co.
 
Yes. I think the headline answer is yes, it's happening. And I think it was 
part of the design and the strategy. To be fair to the team running CCR, they 
have been improving the operations of Coca
-
Cola Refreshments over the 
years and have be
en getting increasingly better results over time and doing 
a lot of the things that set the platform for better local operations and better 
coordinated national operations.
 
But there's no question that as the bottlers have taken over these new 
territories,
 
they have been very energetic in trying to improve them. They 
have made good progress particularly in some of the non
-
directly measured 
channels, the up and down the street, the smaller stores where they build on 
their local expertise. So, I think, it is 
in aggregate a tail
-
wind. It was part of 
the strategy that it should be that way, and I think, it's a compliment to the 
local bottlers that they are driving that forward.

Wanted to talk a little bit more about the margin expansion that we saw, so 
375 basis points on a n
on
-
GAAP basis. Can you quantify the disaggregation 
that you lay out in words? So quantify how much is coming from bottling 
divestitures, how much from expense management, how much from timing 
of expenses, which I assume that means is coming back at some po
int. So 
really want to disaggregate that and quantify that. And think about how we 
should think about the sustainability of each of those going forward to really 
draw the path on operating margin expansion going forward. Thanks.
 
Kathy N. Waller 
-
 
The Coca
-
Cola Co.
 
So morning, Ali. So the operating margin expansion, the 375 basis points, I 
mean, clearly we see that operating margins are expanding, when you see 
that we're at 6% in (22:40) profit before tax and on organic revenues of 
3%. The upside is driven b
y that price mix and so you know exactly where 
the price mix came from in terms of a lot of it being driven by North America 
and EMEA in this quarter. And then the timing of SG&A expenses. Yes, part 
of that is 

 
yeah, it will moderate over the balance of t
he year. But that 
wasn't really the bulk of what was driving that. It's more about the 
productivity and cost management that we have in the year. So we have 
more plans over the next couple of years for additional 

 
for the rest of the 
productivity and that
 
will continue to drive operating margin expansion.
 
Plus just the refranchising itself has driven a lot of that 375 basis points. As 
we have gotten out of the capital
-
intensive businesses, the more people
-
intensive businesses, that specifically drove that 
375 basis points. So we had 
guided to the fact that our operating margins were going to go up after the 
refranchising. We plan to be in that range and continue to look for obviously 
other opportunities to increase operating margins as we go forward. So 
bas
ically think about it as the refranchising driving most of that, good price 
mix and the cost management and the other productivity that we will 
continue to get over the next couple of years.

I was just hoping to get an update on your Gold Peak and Dunkin' Donuts

expand these brands globally at some point. And then curious to hear how

new coffee brands will all be incremental. Thanks.

an early start on the coffee. The basis of our kind 
of ready
-
to

business and strong global position is actually Asia. So we have some strong 
brands there. So I don't think you should see it as there's going to be one

drink tea across the world. 
We're
 
going to see some strong growth coming out of Asia in Asian teas. 
Yes, we're launching Honest Tea in Europe as the joint venture with Nestle 
winds down teas in the European space at the end of the year. So you will 
see us use some of our brands more broad

everywhere.

ave its own

all work, great. If two work, then we'll take one out. Maybe we'll bring one 
more in. But we'll continue to pay attention to what the consumer wants and

Great. Thank you. James, I wanted to build on the test and learn comments
 
that you made upfront and the quest for speed and agility. There's some 
great examples that you've highlighted today in terms of portfolio progress, 
especially in Europe with smartwater and innocent and Zero Sugar and 
Honest. But what I'm trying to unders
tand is, can you talk more about the 
specific, any specific steps or tools or incentives that you're putting in place 
to facilitate that speed and agility? Because in the end, I'm just trying to get 
a better feel for what that looks like in terms of day
-
to
-
day changes and how 
you push for speed, and, at the same time, efficiently manage risk and 
portfolio complexity as you accelerate into new SKUs and additional category 
country combinations. Thanks.
 
James Quincey 
-
 
The Coca
-
Cola Co.
 
Sure. I mean, I'll give
 
you a couple of ideas. But I think the net of the 
answer is it's more of a cultural process than a process
-
process. Having said 
that, we're clear on when we're talking about test and learn or experiment, 
that people need to understand the scale and the po
tential impact of the 
experiments they're undertaking. In other words, we are starting to use 
some frameworks to classify how people are going after things.
 
So said in simple terms, if the test you're undertaking is not life threatening, 
do lots of them, l
earn quickly, and move on. I mean, if the experiment is 
potentially creates a material risk if it goes wrong, then let's look at it more 
closely. So we're starting to push through some ways of looking at the 
portfolio in the market so that they can categor
ize what sort of strategy and 
what sort of scale of experiment are they undertaking, whether it's a launch 
of a product or a new marketing program, et cetera, et cetera. And so the 
risk can be managed appropriately. And it's all about what's the potential 
downside to the corporation. And that, if it's not big, or said differently, if it's 
very small, then it's okay to let them go.
 
But as I said at the beginning of the answer, it's mainly a cultural mindset. 
It's the essential idea that the world is undergoi
ng some important structural 
changes, multiple ones at the same time. And that is causing disruptions on 
many fronts, and we have to continue to do what we've done for 130
-
plus 
years, which is stay relevant for the consumer and help our customers grow 
thei
r businesses. And that's cultural. So we need people to really be focused 
on where do we stand really, to be curious about what's going on in the 
world, to kind of not look at things through rose
-
tinted glasses and come to 
quick conclusions and move on.
 
Wh
y? Not because we fancy it and it's a nice thing to have. It's because 
that's what's needed in the marketplace. And I think the employees 
understand that. I think that's why the Lean Enterprise is resonating, and I 
think that's why it will get pushed throu
gh. And we'll back that up with some 
tools and processes to help people. We're making much more embedded into 
the organization the use of real agile processes and agile teams because 
that's the way that we're going to get to answers quicker.

Good morning, James, Kathy and the team. We have seen continued

And you 
highlighted also that water, enhanced water and sports drinks were down

May. There was a particularly poor period there. I don't like throwing the
 
weather under the bus, but that's the Q2. I think in the longer
-
term trend, 
well, I think water will continue to grow, particularly enhanced water, 
premium waters, I think, you see a lot of activity by ourselves, by 
competitors in that space. So I think t
hat is going to come back and will 
continue to be a source of growth for the industry. And we will participate 
very competitively. And it will be a source of growth for us. So I think it's a

Hey. I think you will have surprised many with your 5% organic growth in 
the U.S., especially after the soft quarter from your major 
competitor and 
still potentially with some disruption from transferring to bottlers. So how 
should we think about the price
-
mix going forward? Is 4% the new norm in 
the U.S., and by extension in developed countries? And if you can give some 
colors about wh
at's coming from price, what's coming from mix, that would 
be helpful. Thank you.
 
James Quincey 
-
 
The Coca
-
Cola Co.
 
Sure. Clearly, I'm not going to say that 4% is the projectable price
-
mix for 
the U.S. I think that's the top
-
end of what would happen. I thi
nk, it's 
important as you look at the U.S. result, I mean, clearly it was a good 
quarter and we're pleased that it comes on top of multiple years of the U.S. 
business performing at the top
-
end of large consumer products companies.
 
A couple of points that a
re very important to note. Firstly, we benefited in 
the second quarter from a little bit of extra gallons in the food service 
business that was kind of inventory call that a point. So, it was really more 
of a full percent.
 
Now we're getting a lot of that i
n the non
-
measured channels. We're getting 
it through the small packs. It's about a balance between mix and rate. We've 
got transaction packs growing mid
-
single digits in the quarter, high
-
single 
digits year
-
to
-
date in sparkling. So it really is a bit of a
 
sweet spot between 
rate and mix.
 
As I said, it won't stay up at that high level because of the effects of the 
extra food service gallons. But they are executing strategy, and I think, it's 
playing out very nicely.

I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about Japan. It wasn't called out 
much in the release, and Asia, at least for me, was a bit softer than I had 
modeled. So can you just t
ell us anything about what's it doing in Japan 
overall trends across the bigger categories? Thanks.
 
James Quincey 
-
 
The Coca
-
Cola Co.
 
Yeah, let me start with Asia and then work towards Japan, Lauren. I think, 
there was some softness in Asia. We would have 
liked to see Asia come in 
better. I would call out obviously the slight disruption in India from the 
general sales tax obviously affected us in the back
-
end of the quarter. As I 
said in the opening remarks, we think that's good for the country, but it did 
obviously make some impact in the second quarter. And we're seeing 
softness across some of the ASEAN countries. Each has their own reasons, 
but the ASEAN region has been soft.
 
China bounced back a little bit. Japan had a solid quarter. It wasn't knocking 
o
ut of the park like it has on some of the previous ones. There were some 
kind of cycling things in there. But we've had some good launches with some 
local products in Japan, Coca
-
Cola FOSHU, I need more time than I have 
now to explain it, but a pretty soli
d result. So, year
-
to
-
date, Japan is going 
reasonably well.
 
Obviously we've got the new bottler coming into being, which sort of affects 
the inventories that we sell into them, which kind of makes it look like 
they're not doing as well as they should. But 
I think Japan is going to 
continue to do well. China bounced back. So coming back to the beginning, 
it's really about India and ASEAN.

So, James, question on the company's abili
ty and then timing around 
accelerating top
-
line growth of the company. So to you and your team's 
credit, there's been universally positive response from the investment 
community around the changes that you've implemented. But organic sales 
are now trending
 
around 3% and you're gaining market share, which is 
great, but the implication is that the NARTD category is broadly growing 
sub
-
3%.
 
So the question is, how quickly can you deliver on that trajectory of about 
4%, which is where I think you sort of peg ove
rall NARTD growth, at least 
something reasonable longer
-
term? How much can you drive with strategic 
changes and share gains? How much of this is maybe just cycling Brazil, 
which is a big market for the company? How much do you need an overall 
improvement i
n the macro to sort of take this growth rate from 3% to 4%, 
and over what time period do you think is sort of reasonable for investors? 
Thank you.
 
James Quincey 
-
 
The Coca
-
Cola Co.
 
Yeah. Thanks, Kevin. Look, I think a couple of factors. Just mechanically, 
if 
Brazil and Venezuela had been flat in the quarter, we'd have grown 1 point 
faster. So you could say, okay, well, by next year, Venezuela will have 
declined so much it won't matter, and Brazil I think there's some belief that 
it will get better as we com
e out of the year.
 
So if you want it on a mechanical basis, yes, mathematically, if everything 
else stays roughly the same, then we'll get there next year as Brazil and 
Venezuela stabilize. Now, other countries could fall off the wagon, and so 
that's alway
s an uncertainty.
 
Having said that, our underlying core revenue growth, organic growth, in the 
second quarter was actually 4%. So, if you strip out the bottling operations 
that we know we're going to sell, we talked about the core growing 4% last 
year. It 
grew 4% in this quarter. So I think in there is the seeds of that 
number as we go into 2018. We're not making a projection on 2018 yet, but 
I think on the line are the bread crumbs towards that conclusion.

Good morning. From the outside, it seems bottler alignment's better than it's 
been in many times in the past. Just curious how dependent that is on you 
guys delivering better products to the market, whether that's organic, lift 
and shift M&A or delivering better marketing, investing more in the markets? 
And then, how long do you think the grace period is for you guys to deliver 
something better to the bot
tlers before that alignment begins to break 
down? Thanks.
 
James Quincey 
-
 
The Coca
-
Cola Co.
 
Look, I think clearly the company's role is to provide some leadership to the 
system and obviously the marketing of the brands, the marketing and 
innovation to crea
te the business in the countries that they operate in. So to 
the extent the company doesn't do that, it's always going to be a problem on 
alignment.
 
Similarly, if the bottler's not taking advantage of when there are all those 
things and investing in execut
ion, investing in the capabilities that develop 
the marketplace, to expand the number of outlets, to build a stronger base 
of cold drink equipment and the sales capability to help the customers 
develop their businesses, then there will be alignment problem
s.
 
So net

So I just wanted to talk about Coke Zero No Sugar. How sustainable do you 
think the growth is of that brand in Europe? And I'd love to hear more about 
your motivation to bring this to the U.S. Is it really designed to combat 
sugar taxes th
at we're seeing in a few of the markets? And how big do you 
think it can be? Are you going to phase out sort of Coke Zero over time? And 
is it meant to really target sort of the Coke Zero customer, the Coke Classic 
customer or more of a Diet Coke customer?
 
Thank you.
 
James Quincey 
-
 
The Coca
-
Cola Co.
 
Sure. I mean, I think, firstly, it's gone really well. Global volume growth for 
Coke Zero Sugar has stepped up over the last few years from mid
-
single 
digits to high
-
single digits, and now it's running in the t
eens. So it's done 
well in Western Europe, and that's really good. But actually, the global 
growth continues to accelerate, and we think it has a long way to go.
 
And in terms of bringing it to the U.S., of course, we're bringing it to the 
U.S. because we t
hink it will do better and help the U.S. business grow. And 
you asked the question about, are we phasing out Coke Zero? It is a re
-
invention of Coke Zero, and it is a slight repositioning and, yes, it is about 
helping the zero
-
calorie part of the portfolio
 
grow, which is linked to playing 
a role in tackling obesity.
 
And by that I mean, it's part of what we call the one
-
brand strategy. So 
Coke Zero Sugar, of course, is an improved version of the Coke Zero Sugar 
formula but it comes in more of a red visual id
entity, more of a red can, with 
more of a red label, and will actually help people stay in the Coca
-
Cola 
franchise. And whether they want the original with sugar or they want a 
Coke Zero Sugar without any, and it's less switching between brands, which 
will
 
ultimately help us keep and attract more consumers.

In order to realize the new strategic priorities, can you expand on the actual 
behaviors that are necessary for the next generation of leadership to 
succeed and how these might be different from the past? How do 
you 
provoke these behaviors, especially speed?

Yeah. Good question, Carlos. Look, I think the first thing is it's going to be 
clear to the associates why we want change rather than just asking for it. 
And so part of the ta
sk is helping everyone understand the business 
necessity of the need for change. As I mentioned earlier, the world is 
undergoing a lot of structural change and what it's driving towards is a place 
where the speed at which consumers, customers and the rate 
at which 
insights can be generated from data to give competitive advantage is 
changing such that the cycle of speed, experimentation, and learning will 
create higher business volume.
 
And firstly, you have to land the idea that you've got an ultimate compet
itive 
and business value underpinning rather than I prefer X versus Y.
 
How do you drive it forward? Well clearly, in order to get that done, you do 
need some technical skills. We'll need more consumer digital engagement
-
type skills, more e
-
commerce type sk
ills, more artificial intelligence type 
skills, and more collaboration type skills.
 
In terms of the behaviors, in order to take advantage of that competitive 
cycle, you need greater transparency. So we need to push behaviors where 
the information is made a
vailable, more broadly, more transparently, more 
quickly. We need to keep encouraging a candor of looking at where we really 
are, opportunities and issues, no rose
-
tinted glasses because then you get to 
the insight quicker. That has got to go along with a 
greater curiosity. We've 
got to 

 
one of the dangers being 130
-
plus years successful is you think 
you've got the answer to some things whereas we really need to have lots of 
curiosity about how things could be different, could be better, and how we 
respond
 
to the way things are changing and then, of course, there needs to 
be some courage to try new things.
 
I talked earlier about that's got to be managed with risk appetite. All 
experiments are not born equal and there will be lots of tolerance for doing it 
i
n a sensible way and then commitment to making things better. And I think 
all of that can be created. Of course, the tone needs to be set from the top. 
We need to put in place the training and the programs and if people 
understand why, I think you get a mu
ch more empowered autonomous 
organization that is capable of creating a better future.

Thank you. Our next question is from Pablo Zuanic of SIG. Pablo, your line is 
open.

Good morning, everyone. When
 
I think of refranchising being completed by 
the end of the year in the U.S., you're going to end up with a very, very 
fragmented bottling system which is the opposite of what you have in other 
parts of the world and in turn has been for consolidation (44:
09). So why 
does that make sense? Isn't that a problem or should we assume that five 
years from now, that system will look a lot more consolidated? And related 
to that, the fountain business remains in the hands of Coke. I think it's 
about 35% of volumes. 
It doesn't make sense for you to over time to 
gradually convert the fountain business into RTDs, or is that just impossible 
to do? Thanks.

Yeah. Let me talk about the question around the bottling system and 
refranchising. 
Firstly, yes, there are some legacy small bottlers, but 
principally the U.S. bottling system by the end of this year will be a relatively 
small number of bottlers distributed in a very logical geographic distribution 
across the country, which has moved awa
y from the great mosaic of the 
past of the patchwork quilt. I think what we will have is people who are 
really strong locally in their marketplaces where they know what to do and 
the U.S. is not one place, there are lots of local differences, but the 
impor
tant element of the strategy in the U.S. is the putting in place of the 
structures and mechanisms so the system can act as one; act as one with 
customers; act as one from a production system; act as one in terms of IT; 
act as one in terms of really working
 
out what's the strategy. So, it will be a 
strong combination of local knowledge and the ability to act across the 
system. It's in place. I think they've done a great job over the last several 
years in bringing it to life and delivering top
-
class results i
n the U.S. 
environment and I think that's going to continue to be the system of the 
future.

Thank you. That will be the final question. And now, I would like to turn the 
call back to Mr. James Quincey for closing remarks.

At this time, I'd like to welcome everyone to The Coca
-
Cola Company's Third 
Quarter Earnings Results Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. If 
you have any objections, please disconnect at this time. [Operator 
Instructions].
 
I would like to remind everyone that the purpose of this conference is to talk 
with investors and, therefore, questions from the media will not be 
addressed. Media participants should contact Coca
-
Cola's Media Relations 
Department if they ha
ve any questions.
 
I would now like to introduce Mr. Tim Leveridge, Vice President and Investor 
Relations Officer. Mr. Leveridge, you may now begin.
 
Timothy Leveridge
 
Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. I'm here with James 
Quincey, our Chairma
n and Chief Executive Officer; and John Murphy, our 
Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I'd like to inform you that we posted 
schedules under the Financial Reports and Information tab in the Investor 
section of our company website at www.coca
-
colacom
pany.com. These 
schedules reconcile certain non
-
GAAP financial measures, which may be 
referred to by our senior executives during this morning's discussion to our 
results as reported under generally accepted accounting principles.
 
We'd also like to note th
at you can find additional materials in the Investor 
section of our company's website that provide an analysis of our margin 
structure. In addition, this conference call may contain forward
-
looking 
statements, including statements concerning long
-
term earn
ings objectives 
and should be considered in conjunction with cautionary statements 
contained in our earnings release and in the company's most recent periodic 
SEC report.
 
Following prepared remarks this morning, we will turn the call over for your 
question
s. [Operator Instructions].
 
Now let me turn the call over to James.
 
James Quincey

term growth potential. For our 
company, the power of aligned and engaged system is driving solid top line 
growth across all our operating segments. We see that innovation, revenue 
growth management and improving execution ,all supported by great
er 
brand building, are helping us sustain momentum across our business.
 
Our associates within the organization and across the system are responding 
to the cultural changes we are driving. So through the 3 quarters of the 
year, we've gained global value sha
re with a balanced contribution from both 
developed and emerging markets, we're sustaining that solid top line 
performance with growth across all the operating segments and we're on 
track to deliver our EPS commitments, as momentum in the business have 
hel
ped offset increased currency headwinds. And as John will talk about, free 
cash flow is up strongly year
-
to
-
date, which is also encouraging.
 
Looking around the world. As I said, all our operating segments delivered 
solid organic growth. In EMEA, we've seen
 
sustained revenue growth of 7% 
year
-
to
-
date. Importantly, we're seeing contributions to growth come as 
much from developed markets as the emerging markets. This is partly due 
to our revenue growth management efforts over the last few years. And it's 
prett
y encouraging, as we continue to roll out these revenue growth 
management initiatives, to developed markets in other areas of the world.
 
In Asia Pacific, we've grown organic revenue 4% year
-
to
-
date. We're gaining 
horizontal distribution and recruiting new 
consumers in emerging markets, 
like Southeast Asia, India and China, leading to strong volume growth. In 
Japan, while we still have work to do, we're seeing sequential quarterly 
improvement in both volume and revenue. The system continues to rebuild 
manufa
cturing capacity, and we're adapting the fast
-
changing consumer 
environment and evolving our operating models to drive efficiencies and 
effectiveness.
 
Turning to Latin America. Again, we're driving positive momentum, despite a 
more challenging economic env
ironment, and they're up 9% organic growth 
year
-
to
-
date. Brazil has sustained strong performance even as the macro 
has slowed a little in the third quarter. This has been driven by improved 
execution and consistent investment behind cold drink equipments. 
Our 
approach has enabled the business to grow twice the rate of consumer 
spending in the third quarter. Our business in Mexico has actively adjusted 
to the 
--
 
to a more challenging economic environment, shifting the portfolio 
towards affordability with a p
ush on returnable packaging. This has led to 
improvement in trends as we've moved through the year. In Argentina, 
though, a worsening economic situation and higher inflation has affected 
consumer spending, impacting our business and our industry. However, 
by 
following our playbook of carefully balancing price increases, while also 
focusing on maintaining our consumer base, we have gained value share 
year
-
to
-
date.
 
Finally, turning to North America. We saw a strong marketplace performance 
driven by innovation
 
in our sparkling portfolio and improving performance in 
stills. We also continue to gain share. And so far, revenue growth 
--
 
organic 
revenue growth is up 2% year
-
to
-
date. This growth was largely driven by 
continued strong consumer demand for No Sugar ver
sions of some of our 
best known sparkling soft drink brands as well as for smaller packages with 
less sugar per serving. Of course, we always have the opportunity to get 
better. For example, our performance in the water category has not been as 
strong as w
e'd like. We're working on further plans to address this in the 
marketplace in the near future.
 
Taking a step back and looking across all our markets. We are driving a 
platform for sustained performance through a disciplined portfolio growth 
approach, an a
ligned and engaged system and collaboration with our 
stakeholders. Within our portfolio, we focused on operationalizing further our 
leader, challenger and explorer framework to build quality leadership 
positions in more brands in more markets.
 
While consum
er behavior is rapidly evolving, we continue to find new ways 
to connect with consumers through our leader brands. For example, we see 
continued strong performance in our sparkling portfolio led by trademark 
Coca
-
Cola, with 3% volume growth and 6% retail v
alue growth, so far this 
year. Our brand and formula has been around for more than 130 years, and 
we continually work to make Coke relevant to recruit new generations of 
consumers.
 
In addition to great marketing campaigns, consumer
-
centric innovation has 
b
een a key factor, especially over the last few years. This includes smaller 
packaging, such as mini cans, which are growing at a rate of more than 15% 
year
-
to
-
date in the U.S. It includes lower and no calorie variants that help 
consumers moderate their sug
ar intake. For example, Coke Zero Sugar is 
growing globally 14% volume year
-
to
-
date. And most recently, it's included 
new launchers such as Coke Energy and Coke Plus Coffee, which is designed 
for consumers looking for a little extra upliftment. We've launc
hed Coke 
Energy in more than 25 markets, and we're adjusting as we learn to how 
consumers are responding. As you know, we have plans to bring Coke 
Energy to the U.S. in 2020. Overall, we're seeing more consumers drink 
products from our flagship trademark g
lobally.
 
Within challenger and explorer brands, innovation and sustained investment 
levels are helping drive performance across key geographies. In Asia, our 
Authentic Tea House brand is well ahead of the plan in China and across 
Southeast Asia. At the beg
inning of last year, we launched Fuze Tea in 
Europe. Now entering its second year, we've seen positive momentum in 
both revenue growth and share gains driven by marketing investments, 
innovation and added distribution. Fuze Tea has gained 3 points of value
 
share across Western Europe, showing the importance of sustained 
investment to build challenger brands into leaders. Chi, West Africa's leading 
value
-
added dairy and juice brand, continues to perform well in the 
marketplace and expanded footprint across t
he region. The disciplined 
approach we are taking is yielding results. Consumers have responded, as 
shown by our sustained momentum. More broadly, we will continue to invest 
behind our brands.
 
Of course, strategy and marketing are only one part of the equa
tion. Daily 
execution in the marketplace is also a critical component. Globally, our 
bottling partners are aligned and energized. They're committed to building 
scale and investing for the future. We're working with them to collectively 
raise the bar on con
sistent execution. Key levers of growth include driving 
new pack price architectures, increasing the availability of immediate 
consumption packages, expanding chilled space with more cold drink 
equipment and growing our customer base. In India, for example
, 
immediate consumption transactions have grown double digit year
-
to
-
date, 
fueled by adding more than 650,000 new customer outlets during the year 
and placing more than 25 additional coolers in the market. These initiatives 
are allowing us to grow at doubl
e the rate of personal consumption 
expenditure. Globally, this kind of action has helped lead to volume growth 
in immediate consumption packages of 4% year
-
to
-
date.
 
Fundamentally, our business is driven by the ability to operate a more 
sustainable enterpri
se that makes a difference for all our stakeholders. And 
let me highlight one critical issue, we, of course, see across the world, which 
is package waste. We first shared our World Without Waste goals in 2018, 
and we provided updates from time to time. But
 
I'd also like to share a 
recent example of initiatives around the world. In the U.S., we're working on 
a number of packaging plans with DASANI, including removing the 
equivalent of at least 1 billion virgin PET plastic bottles from the supply chain 
over t
he next 5 years. DASANI will introduce a lineup of recyclable, reusable 
and package
-
free options, including aluminum packages and expansion of 
PureFill water dispensers, which leverage our Coca
-
Cola Freestyle 
technology.
 
In Great Britain, our system has sw
itched Sprite bottles from green to clear 
plastic to make it easier to recycle into new bottles. And in 2020, we will 
double the recycled plastic in all of our bottles in Great Britain to at least 
50%.
 
In Australia, by the end of the year, all single
-
serve
 
PET bottles will be made 
from 100% recycled plastic. Finally, we and our partners just unveiled the 
first sample bottle made with recovered and recycled marine plastics. This 
shows the future potential for ocean debris to be recycled, packaging for 
foods 
and drinks.
 
Of course, none of this will be possible without the people throughout our 
company and our system that take an expansive approach to imagining 
what's possible. This is what gives me confidence this company and system 
is building a better shared
 
future.
 
So in summary, we're driving a platform for sustained performance through 
disciplined portfolio growth, an aligned and engaged system and are working 
with our stakeholders. For the first 9 months of the year, we delivered 
strong underlying growth 
ahead of our initial guidance. This gives us 
confidence in our ability to achieve our full year EPS target and drive 
shareholder value.
 
And now I'm going to turn the call over to John.
 
John Murphy
 
Thank you, James, and thanks to all of you for 
joining us today. I'd like to 
start with a quick update on a few key areas of focus I've mentioned 
previously that are critical to the company, driving sustainable top line 
growth, expanding margins across our business segments and improving 
cash flow.
 
As 
I look at our progress in 2019, our top line continues to respond to the 
actions James has just spoken to, both to drive innovation, revenue growth 
management and improved execution, and all supported by a 
comprehensive range of brand building initiatives 
across the world. Organic 
revenue is up 6% year
-
to
-
date, and we've reached the ninth consecutive 
quarter of being within our long
-
term target. Our healthy top line and 
effective cost management are translating into solid underlying operating 
margin expansi
on across all 3 areas of the business: our geographic 
segments, Global Ventures and Bottling Investments. And we're doing this 
while continuing to invest in our brands. We've made steady progress in 
improving our free cash flow position, which is up 41% ye
ar
-
to
-
date. We're 
achieving this through solid underlying performance, acting on working 
capital initiatives, in addition to tapering off our productivity and 
restructuring costs.
 
Our progress has enabled us to grow in line with our earnings per share 
expe
ctations, despite an 8 point currency headwind, setting us up to meet 
our guidance for the year. We are pleased that the business is responding to 
the actions we've been taking. But as always, we aim to do better. We will 
continue to make the right investm
ents in the business to sustain this 
momentum into the future.
 
Turning to our financial performance for the quarter. We delivered solid 5% 
organic revenue growth with contributions across all operating segments. As 
expected, revenue growth was driven by st
rong price/mix due to our 
revenue growth management initiatives in the marketplace, along with some 
items we are cycling from the prior year.
 
The biggest driver of these items was cycling increased inventory levels in 
our Brazilian Bottler's from last year
. This put more than 2 points of pressure 
on concentrate sales in the quarter, and this was partially offset by a 
corresponding price/mix benefit as our Brazilian business revenue per case is 
lower than the company average. We are also cycling the timing o
f certain 
deductions in the third quarter of last year, which was a slight benefit to 
price/mix in the quarter. However, no impact on the year
-
to
-
date 
performance. So adjusting for these items, I would look at this quarter's 5% 
organic revenue growth as be
ing on an apples
-
to
-
apples basis, 1% volume 
and 4% price/mix.
 
Underlying growth margin expanded about 120 basis points during the 
quarter with contribution across our geographic segments, Global Ventures 
and Bottling Investments. Operating margin was rough
ly even on an 
underlying basis, negatively impacted by cycling the timing of expenses and 
concentrate shipments in the prior year, in addition to the timing of certain 
items in the current year, including investments in marketing. This 
translated to 5% gro
wth in comparable currency neutral operating income, 
which was more than offset by a stronger
-
than
-
anticipated 7% currency 
headwind. Comparably, EPS declined 2% in the quarter, impacted by a 6 
point currency headwind.
 
Turning to our outlook for the remaind
er of the year. With the momentum 
we see in the business, we're now guiding to organic revenue growth of at 
least 5%. This is translating into stronger underlying profit growth and an 
increase in our free cash flow guidance to at least $6.5 billion. Our 
un
derlying performance allows us to maintain our full year comparable EPS 
guidance, even in the face of increasing currency headwinds compared to 
previous expectations.
 
Staying on currency for a moment. On the second quarter call, we provided 
an initial revi
ew 
--
 
view of 2020, namely that based on rates at that time, 
we expected a benign outlook. Since then, the dollar has strengthened, 
which has impacted our outlook for the 
--
 
for next year. Based on those 
recent movements, there will be an approximate 1 to 
2 point currency 
headwind of revenue. And given the natural multiplier effect due to business 
mix, a 2 to 3 point headwind at operating income for full year 2020. This is 
almost entirely from movement in market rates as our hedging gains and 
losses in 2019
 
are minimal so far.
 
With respect to our hedging program, we are nearly 100% hedged for the 
G10 currencies in 2020, but we have minimal hedges today for our non
-
G10 
currencies. It goes without saying that several geopolitical factors can have 
an impact on 
our currency outlook between now and when we provide our 
full 2020 guidance in February.
 
Coming back to 2019. In quarter 4, there are a couple of things you should 
consider. First, we have an additional day in the fourth quarter, which adds 
about 1 point o
f revenue growth. Second, we expect an estimated 2 point 
headwind to top line growth, biggest factor being the reduction in inventory 
levels by our European bottlers. You may recall that in the first quarter, 
price/mix and concentrate shipments benefited f
rom those bottlers 
increasing their safety stocks in advance of a potentially disruptive Brexit. 
We currently expect this to fully reverse in quarter 4, but, of course, it's 
subject to the pending Brexit outcome. The net of these 2 will result in a 1 
point
 
headwind to top line growth for the quarter.
 
So in summary, we are pleased with the momentum we have in the 
business. We continue to invest for sustainable growth in the future, and we 
remain very focused on raising the performance bar everywhere to captu
re 
the opportunity available to us.
 
Operator, we are now ready for questions.
 
Question
-
and
-
Answer Session
 
Operator
 
[Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Steve Powers with 
Deutsche Bank.
 
Stephen Powers
 
I almost hate to start on currency bec
ause there's so much talk about 
elsewhere, but it is a topic that's dominated conversation the last few 
months, especially. So John, looking ahead, I think the currency outlook for 
2020 is less severe than a lot of investors feared. But I guess, the questi
on 
is what levers do you feel you have to offset such FX impacts in terms of 
managing to dollar
-
based EPS and cash flow. My read is that in the past, the 
company leaned more on financial levers and hedging to try to work through 
FX headwinds, whereas now y
ou think you can lean a little bit more on 
operating levers, like productivity and realized price/mix. But is that right? I 
just love a little bit more color if possible as to how you're thinking about it 
and, more importantly, how we should all think abou
t your flexibility, 
especially to the extent that FX volatility and, I hope this isn't the case, but 
if it continues to get worse.
 
John Murphy
 
Thanks, Steve. Just a few comments. First of all, you're correct in that the 
outlook, as we go into 2020, it's an
 
easier picture to paint given what I just 
described in the call. Secondly, I think it's important to emphasize that our 
overall growth algorithm continues to start with an objective to win locally in 
all of our markets around the world and to take the app
ropriate actions to be 
able to do that on a sustained basis. I think, at the moment, we are also 
doing, I think, a much more integrated job in determining with our local 
operating leaders the degree to which we can also manage the various 
headwinds and lev
erage, the tailwinds that we have on an ongoing basis and 
particularly with respect to currency.
 
As we think about next year, there's a lot of puts and takes still in the 
equation on both the operating and the nonoperating line, which we'll 
obviously provi
de more detailed guidance when we get to February. But I 
think the overall point I'd make is that with respect to managing this space 
as we go forward, it's important to keep in mind our primary focus is to 
deliver on that algorithm I just talked about, bu
t we're doing it, I think, in a 
much more connected fashion around the world and taking advantage where 
it's possible of levers that allow us to mitigate some of the 
--
 
some of those 
headwinds.
 
Operator
 
Our next question comes from Lauren Lieberman with Ba
rclays.
 
Lauren Lieberman
 
I just want to ask a little bit about cash flow. So in particular, on CapEx, I 
think you took down the CapEx budget this quarter, but my recollection is 
you actually raised it last quarter. So John, I know you've talked sort of a 
c
onscious effort to reassess balance sheet overall and then obviously cash 
flow, so wondering if you could talk a little bit about kind of the change in 
CapEx and how you're thinking about that going forward.
 
John Murphy
 
Sure. Thanks, Lauren. Yes, let me st
art just to emphasize year
-
to
-
date, the 
strong cash flow is driven by underlying growth. We're cycling some taxes 
that we paid in the prior year. We're getting the benefit from the 
--
 
from 
working capital and from the 
--
 
a lowering of our onetime restructu
ring 
payments. In the fourth quarter, we expect to see the 
--
 
our capital 
expenditures finish the year in line with our previous guidance, actually just 
a little bit lower. I think we started at $2.4 billion. We're down to $2.2 
billion. And the timing of a
 
number of the projects we have is actually 
scheduled for the fourth quarter. So there's really no major change in our 
expectation for this year and going to next year with respect to CapEx. But 
as I've discussed in some previous conversations, the improve
ment in 
overall free cash flow remains a top priority for us, and we expect to 
continue to work on the initiatives that I've just outlined as we go forward.
 
Operator
 
And our next question comes from Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley.
 
Dara 
Mohsenian
 
John, I also wanted to keep on the cash flow topic. Operating cash flow 
guidance also moved up for the full year this quarter. So what's driving that? 
And as you think about the improved free cash flow outlook, you've now 
raised underlying free c
ash flow a couple of quarters in a row ex the 
structural items. So is that more timing
-
related and you're getting traction 
on some of the initiatives you put into place given your focus on this area? 
Or is it more you're discovering greater efficiencies wi
th that focus and that 
means that the confidence around improving free cash flow conversion is 
actually moving up as you look beyond this year?
 
John Murphy
 
Yes. Thanks, Dara. First of all, I think the primary driver for this year is the 
underlying performa
nce of the business. And so we're seeing an uptick in 
overall 
--
 
the overall delivery from operations. Yes, we have a plan 
underway, which is delivering on working capital. We're not 
--
 
I don't see 
--
 
I don't have any new news to talk about the working cap
ital arena, but we 
just continue to plug away at the opportunities that we know are out there.
 
And with respect to CapEx, as I just mentioned in my 
--
 
in the previous 
question, we see, for this year or next year, the range to be in the 
--
 
in that 
$2.2 bill
ion, $2.4 billion taking into account of the fact that we have taken 
back into the full South Africa and the Philippines in the last 12 to 18 
months. So going forward, I expect to see the continued health of the 
business in the primary driver. And we will 
continue to advance on the 
working capital plan, as I've previously discussed. And also as we go into 
next year, we will see a further tapering off of the onetime restructuring and 
productivity cost that we've incurred as part of the productivity program 
o
ver the last three years.
 
Operator
 
And our next question comes from Bryan Spillane with Bank of America.
 
Bryan Spillane
 
I wanted to ask about unit volume this quarter was 
--
 
and year
-
to
-
date has 
been pretty good, but in the press release and also in prepar
ed remarks, you 
talked a bit about just the focus on immediate consumption, cooler 
placements, right, which also just kind of smaller pack types, right? So it's 
--
 
so if you 
--
 
could you just give us a sense of just where transactions are 
trending relative
 
to unit case volumes and just some color on that to get a 
better perspective and just whether the lift is even bigger or better than 
what we see in unit cases?
 
James Quincey
 
Sure. I mean absolutely, it's being driven by a strategic focus on immediate 
cons
umption packages and smaller packages, in particular. Lots of different 
shapes and sizes, no pun intended. Example, the U.S., the mini cans 
growing at 15%, so some clear strategic focus on driving immediate 
consumption and smaller packages. Transactions ha
ve been running ahead 
of average unit cases for a number of quarters there. It's running about 4% 
compared to about 2% on volume. So clearly, this is encouraging and 
something that we're after. And so it's heartening to see that the 
transactions coming in 
perhaps to simply put a point ahead all of unit cases.
 
Operator
 
And our next question comes from Ali Dibadj with Bernstein.
 
Ali Dibadj
 
So I only have one question, but let me try to have questions, but both are 
just clarification questions. One, given that
 
you're establishing the free cash 
flow improvement as perhaps the next leg of the Coke story, can you talk 
more about when we should think about that cash being used to buy back 
more stock than just the dilution because you curtailed that obviously a 
whil
e ago? And then secondly, you talked again a little bit about this in the 
prepared remarks, so it's a half question. The gap between the 0 basis 
points improvement on operating margin 
--
 
underlying operating margin 
versus 120 basis points on underlying gro
ss margin. Can you just elaborate 
a little bit more about what you're doing there from an investment 
perspective?
 
James Quincey
 
Maybe I'll start with the first half of the two questions. Free cash flow, look, 
we've been pretty clear as we've gone around, w
hich is we have a dividend 
coverage, which is not where we wanted to be. We set ourselves a target of 
expanding that, but also made a clear point that it would clearly be our 
intent to see the dividend continue to grow. So we would like to see EPS 
track fo
r multiple periods ahead of the dividend growth and obviously have 
the cash flow grow faster than the earnings. From where we are now, that 
--
 
we need some runway to get to a more comfortable point. So of course, 
when we come to our guidance for 2020 next 
year, we'll be clear on what 
we're doing, but I don't think we are likely to have a programmatic increase 
until there's substantially more flexibility.
 
Operator
 
Our next question comes from Nik Modi with RBC.
 
Sunil Modi
 
James, maybe you could just talk abo
ut and give us an update on cost and 
really trying to understand what the longer
-
term vision is with that particular 
part of the business. And then if I can slip another one in, and apologies for 
doing this, but you've talked in the past about kind of the 
balance sheet and 
kind of realign to the prior question. So just where are we in that process in 
terms of thinking about some of the equity investments you have and 
potentially having some cash to realign the balance sheet, so you can kind of 
fix the cash 
flow situation?
 
James Quincey
 
Yes. Sure. I mean cost, we've talked a little bit about it in the last call. The 
integration 
--
 
or the separation from Whitbread and the integration in the 
Coke system has gone well ahead of schedule. We bought the associates 
over. The business is also up. That's been accomplished successfully. It will 
be fair to say that in the short term, the U.K. business has been impacted by 
the consumer sentiment driven by Brexit in the U.K., which has affected 
everyone, the entire busines
s outlook in the U.K. But I think, over the long 
term, we're actually more encouraged about the opportunities to drive the 
various platforms.
 
And we certainly see a lot of interest, and we're setting up the partnerships 
with the bottlers and working with c
ustomers on how we can bring a 
package of coffee platforms to support that growth, whether it be the Costa 
Express machine, which is 
--
 
continues to have a lot of extra placements 
coming through this year. And we see a lot more as we go into the future, al
l 
providing Proud to Serve or beans and machines as a service to customers 
and, then at some point, ready to drink, which is not going to likely be the 
first entry point. We'd like to see the brand exist before doing ready
-
to
-
drink. But we launched it in t
he U.K. and early days, but sales are ahead of 
expectations. It's doing very well in the context of the coffee strategy. So we 
see some good validation of the strategic idea of using the different 
platforms with our system to drive coffee as a solution for
 
customers around 
the world.
 
Operator
 
And our next question comes from Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan.
 
Andrea Teixeira
 
I was just trying to see what are your plans for Coke Energy in terms of ACV 
in the U.S. and how broadly you would think it can be positio
ned in terms of 
the shelf for the energy shelf? And if I can squeeze a Latin American 
question, I would appreciate it, but I'll defer to you.
 
James Quincey
 
Thanks, Andrea. So Coke Energy, obviously, we've launched it in sort of 20
-
plus countries 
around the world so far in 2019. And I think we've got some 
excellent learnings. It's resonated 
--
 
some things have resonated in some 
places. We've got some learnings on things we need to improve. We've been 
able to build that into the 
--
 
a sort of 2.0 ver
sion that we'll be rolling out in 
the U.S. I think the U.S. marketplace, in order to really drive towards a 
strategy that brings new consumers into the energy category, we're moving 
the flavor profile closer to Coke. Plans 
--
 
we'll save some of the bells a
nd 
whistles of the plans for a later date, so that a very clear approach in the 
U.S. to drive additional growth for the energy category by taking the product 
closer in flavor to Coca
-
Cola Classic. And then in the rest of the world where 
we have launched it
 
in some of those markets, we'll be building on the 
learnings to date and evolving next year. And we see an opportunity to play 
a role for Coke Energy in the energy category and within the Coke franchise 
to bring some new consumers and some new relevance t
o the trademark.
 
Operator
 
And our next question comes from Kaumil Gajrawala with Crédit Suisse.
 
Kaumil Gajrawala
 
You think about talking 
--
 
you mentioned affordable packaging in Mexico and 
that aligns with what we're hearing from a bunch of other CPG compa
nies, 
including Diageo, which is normally high
-
end spirits. Is there something 
perhaps more secular permanent that you're seeing in some of these 
markets that leads you to focus more on affordability rather than just an 
economic cycle?
 
James Quincey
 
I thin
k it's largely the economic cycle, especially in the case of Latin 
America. I mean there's no doubt that there's been a difference in the last 
10 years than the previous 10 years where, prior to financial crisis, there 
was more creation in the middle groun
d. And over the last 10 years, there's 
been a section of society in 
--
 
all around the world that have felt under 
pressure, the lower income end. And more of the wealth has been generated 
at the top 
--
 
while income has been generated at the top. So you've s
een, in 
the last 10 years, in general, across many industries a bifurcation growth in 
both the top end of the luxury end and growth in the value end. And so yes, 
there is a piece here, in general, of a spreading out of the pricing spectrum 
in categories ba
sed on that trend. But I think, in the case of Latin America 
and Mexico that we've talked about, this is very much the kind of the 
pressure that some of these economies have been under lately and a 
doubling down on affordability. And the reason we've been 
out there is 
because we have an infrastructure that's very much a set up to be able to 
serve the needs of those with less income.

Robert Ottenstein
 
James, I was wondering if you cou
ld talk a little bit about trademark Coke in 
the U.S. It's doing quite nicely. And what I'm interested in learning is in 
terms of what's going on with the business, is it primarily share gains from 
your competitors? Or are you recruiting new customers to t
he brand? I'm 
particularly interested in how the brand is doing with consumers, let's say, 
under the age of 30 or 20, whatever number you want to take and to what 
extent you're able to continue to keep the brand very vibrant with the 
younger consumers.
 
Jam
es Quincey
 
Sure. I mean I think, firstly, clearly, part of this is a revitalization of the 
sparkling business. It's clear that the strategy of making Coke the brand 
relevant with marketing, with innovation, of getting it in formats that are 
more on target 
for consumers, whether that be the Zero Sugar or the 
smaller packages is part of getting growth to be in the sparkling soft drinks 
category. And I think you can see that and as a demonstration of what is 
going on with Coke. So I mean in a way, it's a formu
la that's always been 
true and is true around the world. You need innovation, you need marketing, 
you need relevance, you need packaging, you need execution and you need 
to be able to engage. And I think what you're starting to see is, yes, some 
reconsider
ation of the category by whatever age you want to take it down 
to, let's call it loosely, the millennials of the sparkling category. Has it flip
-
flopped overnight? No, it hasn't, but I think you're starting to see that if you 
bring relevantly marketed inno
vation for the right occasion to people, then 
they will engage.

William Chappell
 
Just want to follow back up on Brexit kind of near term and longer term. 
Didn't fully understand, for fourth
 
quarter, is it 
--
 
if Brexit goes through, 
you'll have to destock and if it doesn't, you won't? Or is it automatically, the 
destock is expected to happen? And then do you expect, again, if Brexit goes 
through, for a pickup in sales? I mean do you expect a 
better environment 
as we move into 2020?
 
James Quincey
 
Well, I mean, if it mercifully all comes to an end, then yes, I do think our 
sentiment will improve, maybe not overnight, but over time and, hopefully, 
going into 2020. I think it's not as mechanistic 
of if they pass the vote, the 
stock drops out and if they don't pass the vote, the stock doesn't drop out. 
We'll need to see what happens tomorrow. I mean call us on Monday. We'll 
see what happens tomorrow with the super vote. But we would clearly like 
to 
err to seeing inventories normalize. So our preferred path would be to see 
normalization of the inventory by the end of the year. Clearly, we need to 
see what form the agreement does or doesn't take in the coming days. But 
as you should take it from us tha
t our preferred outcome is unwinding of 
that extra inventory, but it's no 
--
 
there's no guarantee because we need to 
manage through it.

Our next question comes from Laurent Grandet with Guggenheim.
 
Laurent Grandet
 
Just to put off actually Coke Ene
rgy. I mean you announced the launch of 
Coke Energy in the U.S. from January 1 with 4 SKUs in total, 2 more than in 
Europe and at a price point where it's just in the middle between Red Bull 
and Monster and not any more aligned with Red Bull. So I'd like t
o 
understand what are the learnings you get from the launch you already did 
this year that triggered those changes. And what do you expect, I mean, for 
Coke Energy in the U.S.?
 
James Quincey
 
Sure. I mean I think the two most obvious learnings, one I mentio
ned that 
I'll just repeat, which is to bring the formula of Coke Energy closer to Coke 
Classic. The energy category in the U.S. is much more developed than many 
of the other markets. And therefore, we are clearly taking an approach of 
trying to bring new c
onsumers into the category rather than competing for 
the current ones. And we believe that based on our experiences in the 
launch markets and our research in the U.S. that doing so with a formula 
closer to Coke will be more effective.
 
On the pricing, clear
ly, the structure of the pricing and the relative weights 
of competitors at price points in the U.S. is different to Europe. And 
therefore, we've chosen to go in that 
--
 
in a slightly different direction or 
slightly more balanced starting point with a broa
der portfolio of SKUs. 
Obviously, we're looking for shelf visibility by having the full packages of the 
4 variants. And that's kind of part of what, of course, is a learning from Coke 
Energy, but actually that's true in many other categories, that you need
 
to 
have some standout especially if the shelf has a lot of SKUs in it already. I 
mean if you go to some of the markets where we launched around the world 
and the energy category is underdeveloped, 1 or 2 SKUs is enough to make 
an impact. But if you're in 
a more developed part of the world and there's 
more competitive offering, then you need a bit more presence. And I think 
that's what's driving that. And we'll launch in the U.S. And no doubt, we'll 
learn and we'll continue to evolve and focus on driving th
is as part of driving 
the Coke Trademark and the revitalization of the Coke Trademark, which has 
been very pleasing for all of us.

[Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from Amit Sharma with 
BMO Capital Markets.
 
Amit Sharma
 
James, it 
looks like the message, at least on the consumption point of view, 
is still fairly upbeat even as the macros continue to get a little bit tougher. 
And you've talked about that a little bit from a profitability point of view in 
L.A. But can you elaborate th
at a little bit historical connection between 
consumption and GDP? Is that changing a little bit? Or is the playbook 
different for Coke than it has been in the past recessions?
 
James Quincey
 
Sure. I mean, firstly, yes, on a long
-
term basis, our business is
 
correlated 
with GDP growth. So in the long run, that matters. Secondly, as I 
commented in the last quarter, there are some storm clouds in the sky. It 
--
 
have raining in a few places, but it's not 
--
 
there's not a total problem here. 
And I think the appro
ach we're taking is to not overinvest our time looking in 
the news as to whether that is or isn't a global recession, but to focus on 
what we can do and to recognize that a lot of work has revitalized our top 
line. And our emerging bottom line has been up 
in the actions we've taken. 
And as we look around the world, whilst we can certainly find places where 
we do things really well, we are not a 10 out of 10 on any of the strategic 
initiatives all over the world. So we have a lot more we can do over our 
mark
eting and portfolio management, on innovation, on revenue growth 
management, on investment in the media consumption and calls and on 
execution. And so the way we look at it is, look, you could waste your time 
looking at the forecast, but actually, if we st
ick to our needing and execute 
against that strategy, we can drive the growth we need.

Our next question comes from Caroline Levy with Macquarie.
 
Caroline Levy
 
And congratulations on a great growth on brand Coke.
 
James Quincey
 
Thank you.
 
Caroline Levy
 
I just want to touch on Global Ventures and Bottling Investments, which are 
businesses that should see faster top line growth than the rest of the 
business, I think. And the Global Ventures margin looks like running around 
11% to 12% and bott
ling around 3%. So are these sort of unusually low 
levels because of all the recent changes in both divisions, the creation of one 
and the change in the other? And do you see those trending upwards 
beginning in 2020? Or is that longer term? And maybe you c
an just help us 
size out what a more normalized margin might look like on those businesses.
 
James Quincey
 
So let me start with that one. Yes. So firstly, should Global Ventures and BIG 
be going faster than the average? Yes. Clearly, part of the idea of the
 
Global 
Ventures is we've invested in categories that we are treating slightly 
differently in order to drive much better growth. So one, yes, they should be 
growing faster.
 
Two, when looking at Global Ventures, and we might try and kind of explain 
more whe
n we get to the February guidance, it's got a mix of some very 
different businesses, whether that be the Dogadan tea business or Innocent 
or the Monster partnership or Costa. So I don't think you can talk about a 
normalized margin for Global Ventures becau
se it encompasses a set of 
different businesses. But what we certainly should see is faster growth on 
the top and the bottom line.
 
And in the case of BIG, clearly, we had a lot of ins and outs on that group. 
But I think if you like, philosophically, histor
ically, we have, perhaps in using 
the expression hospital ward for some of our bottlers, invited the idea that 
they should be 
--
 
or that they're going to be underperforming. And I don't 
think that's how we want to look at that going forward. We think they 
should 
be making margin returns and growth rates that are equivalent to what the 
best of our bottlers do in like markets. I mean the margin structures in 
emerging markets and developed ones are not the same, but we should 
certainly be aspiring and heading 
towards performance that is above 
average for a like
-
for
-
like market.

Question on price/mix. You spend a lot of time on these calls discussing the 
various initiatives around revenue growth management. And while unit case 
results are quite good, the price/mix contribution is 6%, certainly materially 
higher than The Street had modeled and what we should expect going 
forward. So a few questions related to that, James. I mean, one, had 
price/mix come in relative to your own ex
pectations in the quarter? Two, 
how much did Argentina contributed in the quarter? And then three, how 
should we be thinking about this in the fourth quarter and into next year?
 
James Quincey
 
Sure. So clearly, price/mix is atypically higher. It is 
--
 
there
's a little bit of 
Argentina in that. But actually, there's a quite a bit about cycling some of 
the inventory that was in Brazil from last year. So I think it's much more 
sensibly thought of as a 4% rather than a 6%. Still a excellent number for 
the quarte
r. And I think if you look back over what's been happening in '18 
and '19, you're seeing more of a 3%. Obviously, it was a number we 
expected to come in. And so I think the revenue growth management 
initiatives, which have been rolled out and still have so
me good runway 
ahead of them, along with the brand building and innovation, which earns us 
the right to be able to put the right pricing into the marketplace, is what 
makes us think we can take that forward.

Our next question comes from Bonnie Her
zog with Wells Fargo.
 
Bonnie Herzog
 
I actually wanted to ask on margins. You've really done a good job of 
telegraphing some of the pressures you're facing from a margin perspective 
this year. But that said, just hoping you could give us a sense as to how w
e 
should expect margins to trend over the next years once the effects of FX 
and M&A start to subside. I think it would be helpful to hear some of the key 
levers you have that you can pull to ultimately drive margin expansion and 
really just touch on what g
ives you the confidence that the business can 
grow margins on an underlying basis.
 
John Murphy
 
Thanks, Bonnie. Let me take that. First of all, as I said, when we look at the 
total company, we're really looking at margins across the 3 business 
segments that
 
we have, our geographic core businesses, Global Ventures 
and the Bottling Investments Group. Within each of those businesses, we 
--
 
we've got pretty clear line of sight on the levers that we have at our 
disposal. Starting with the top line 
--
 
if I take fo
r example in our 
--
 
in the 
core business, starting on our top line, innovation and increasing focus on 
premiumizing the innovation agenda, continuing to take advantage of the 
revenue growth management works that's 
--
 
that we 
--
 
that's been in its 
current i
teration and expanding that around the world are examples of ways 
in which we can drive at the 
--
 
certainty at the gross margin line. Cost 
management across each of these three groups, there's a different bucket of 
cost in each and there's ongoing 
--
 
we se
e ongoing opportunity to operate 
more efficiently and more effectively. And specifically within the marketing 
arena, we have a large $5 billion, $6 billion base. We continue to mind new 
ways of driving greater output from that investment base.
 
So overall, 
we 
--
 
we're confident that margin expansion, as is implicit in our 
long
-
term growth model, is manageable. Our performance year
-
to
-
date 
--
 
underlying performance year
-
to
-
date would 
--
 
gives me confidence that, that 
can continue. And as we work towards the F
ebruary call and talk more about 
2020, we'll be in a position to give you a little more texture on some of the 
specific areas of opportunity in the coming 12 months.

And our next question comes from Vivien Azer with Cowen and Company.
 
Vivien Azer
 
I was hoping to dig in a little bit more on the mini can business in the U.S., 
which is clearly doing exceptionally well. So a couple of questions on that. 
Number one, can you just remind what it represents as a percentage of 
sales for the Coca
-
Cola franch
ise? Number two, do you have any targets 
over the next kind of 1, 2, 3 years in terms of continued 
--
 
continuing to 
drive that mix shift? And number three, are there any CapEx considerations 
around future growth of mini cans or small format more broadly?
 
J
ames Quincey
 
Sure. I mean we don't break out the percentage of the total business that 
mini cans is representing. But certainly, we are focused on driving that. 
Along with a series of other immediate consumption packages and smaller 
format packages, I thin
k the mini cans being the most emblematic one, it 
grew 15% this quarter. So we're very pleased with this opportunity. We 
don't kind of, as a target to pursue, I said, well, it should be this percent of 
sales because, ultimately, if you're going to be consu
mer
-
centric, you will 
end up with the percentage that the consumers want to buy rather than 
what you want to sell. And so I think, philosophically, we focus most on 
making our brands or our packages or whatever bundle we're selling drive 
on the relevancy f
or the consumer. And if that's 
--
 
if we've got it right it, it 
will go up. And if we haven't, we have to go back to the drawing board. It is 
worth noting that mini cans do require some CapEx. And so, yes, the more 
successful they are, the more we'll have t
o adjust some of the 
manufacturing footprint to do it, but that's a good problem to have.

Ahmet Muhtar Kent

Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
Thank you, Tim, and good morning, everyone. 12 months ago, we 
announced a five
-
point strategic plan to reignite our performance. Since 
then
, our company has undergone substantial change while navigating a 
slowing global macroeconomic environment. Before handing the call over to 
James Quincey, our recently announced President and Chief Operating 
Officer, to review our third quarter performance
 
results, let me recap the 
decisive actions we've taken over the past year, as well as highlight why we 
believe The Coca
-
Cola Company is well positioned to continue winning in the 
vibrant non
-
alcoholic beverage industry.
 
First, we said we would drive reven
ue and profit growth with clear portfolio 
roles across our markets. We have and will continue to do so. We segmented 
our markets to develop long
-
term revenue growth strategies based on clear 
volume, price investment and profit expectations, which were buil
t into our 
2015 plans and strategies going forward. Importantly, we revised our annual 
incentive metrics to include revenue growth, and tied them directly to these 
clear portfolio roles in order to drive the right behavior in each market.
 
Second, we said w
e would target disciplined brand and growth investments. 
Last year, we significantly increased our media investments, and we're doing 
so again this year. Also, under the leadership of Marcos de Quinto, who was 
named Chief Marketing Officer at the beginning
 
of this year, we've improved 
the quality of our advertising while rewiring our marketing organization 
around consumer clusters to drive speed, efficiency and effectiveness, and 
we're seeing results, with year
-
to
-
date value share performance accelerating 
a
cross several markets.
 
In addition, the incremental marketing is helping to accelerate revenue 
growth in some of our key markets, including North America. We also made 
investments in new growth platforms. We closed a transaction with Monster 
Beverage Corpo
ration to compete more effectively in the global energy 
category, and just recently, our brands launched on the Keurig KOLD system 
in the home dispensing platform. In China, we have announced plans to 
expand into plant
-
based protein drinks through the acqu
isition of the 
beverage business of China Green Culiangwang Beverages Holdings that 
recently received regulatory approval. And in the United States, we invested 
in and signed a distribution agreement with Suja, a high growth organic 
cold
-
pressed juice comp
any. All these are long
-
term investments that we 
believe will allow us to add profitable new transactions in the non
-
alcoholic 
beverage industry.
 
Third, we said we would drive efficiency through more aggressive 
productivity. Our current $3 billion producti
vity program touches every part 
of our business and organization, from our operating model to cost of goods 
sold to marketing expenses. We're driving these savings through a 
disciplined process that involves our entire leadership team and associates. 
And u
ltimately, it's about building a culture that is focused on getting better 
every single day and challenging every dollar we spend. We're on track 
against our overall goals, and importantly, have implemented a broad set of 
changes in 2015 that will help us 
continue progress into 2016 and beyond. 
These include the implementation of zero
-
based work across our entire 
company as well as our corporate center and operating units, a disciplined 
program management approach to drive cost of goods sold savings in 
ever
ything from our formulas to our packaging to our day
-
to
-
day operations 
in our plans.
 
Fourth, we said we would streamline and simplify our organization. To date, 
we've standardized key processes, linked our business units with our 
corporate center and elimi
nated group functional roles in order to speed up 
decision making and enhance focus at the local level to drive growth. Our 
previously announced head count reductions are substantially completed, 
and we are operating within our new structure. Importantly, 
we are ahead in 
terms of scope and timing.
 
Finally, we said we would refocus on our core business model of building the 
world's greatest beverage brands and leading an unmatched global system. 
And over the past year, we've made substantial progress in evol
ving and 
strengthening our bottling landscape. Starting in North America, so far, we 
have transferred or signed agreements for territories covering over 30% of 
U.S. bottle can volume. And just recently, we announced the creation of the 
National Product Sup
ply System in order to align on a clear path forward for 
our 21st century manufacturing footprint in the United States. In Europe, we 
announced the creation of Coca
-
Cola European partners, which will 
transform the Western European bottling landscape. And l
ooking outside the 
developed world, we've made critical changes to our bottling system in key 
emerging markets. At the end of last year, we entered into an agreement to 
re
-
architect our African bottling system with the creation of Coca
-
Cola 
Beverages Afric
a, which will have the scale, resources and efficiencies to 
fund the investment required to capture the strong long
-
term growth 
potential in Africa. Also, during the first quarter of this year, we invested in 
our Indonesian bottler to help our system captu
re the long
-
term opportunity 
in this attractive and large emerging market.
 
In short, our company has undergone a significant amount of streamlining 
and change these past 12 months. And while we are encouraged by our 
progress, we know we need to do more, wh
ich leads me to our most recent 
change. As we continue to increase our focus on improving global execution, 
we recently appointed James Quincey to the position of President and Chief 
Operating Officer. James has a deep knowledge of the global system and 
so
lid existing relationships with both bottlers and customers all around the 
world. He's uniquely qualified to accelerate the company's five strategic 
initiatives for growth in the months and years ahead.
 
I will now hand the call over to James, who will walk
 
you through our 
quarterly performance.
 
James Quincey 
-
 
President & Chief Operating Officer
 
Thank you, Muhtar. Good morning, everyone.
 
Let me start on this first earnings call by saying that it's a tremendous honor 
for me to serve as the President and Chie
f Operating Officer of The Coca
-
Cola Company. In my 19 years with the company, I've seen our business 
evolve and grow, while remaining strategically focused on doing the right 
things to drive long
-
term sustainable growth. As Muhtar referenced, we are 
resol
utely focused on executing against the five strategic initiatives laid out 
last year. And a significant part of my role will be ensuring that we deliver.
 
Now, during the quarter, we made two important announcements that 
provide clarity on the future of our
 
distribution and bottling structures in the 
United States and in Europe. First, in our flagship market, we announced the 
creation of the National Product Supply System, or NPSS, to strengthen and 
streamline U.S. production as part of our effort to refranc
hise bottling 
territories in North America. Our approach embodies the best of both worlds 
by encompassing a national production system that generates efficiencies 
and scale for our system in combination with regional production that 
leverages the expertise
 
and local knowledge of our longstanding bottling 
partners, Coca
-
Cola Consolidated, Coca
-
Cola United and Swire Coca
-
Cola 
USA. These bottlers will continue to own and operate their own plants and, 
where applicable, acquire additional production assets from 
the company
-
owned Coca
-
Cola Refreshments. This will provide a clear profit incentive to 
make the local operations as efficient as possible.
 
However, to ensure the benefits of scale remain, the NPSS will have a 
governing board with the power to implement me
asures to ensure the 
production assets owned by NPSS bottlers are optimally deployed to produce 
the lowest cost, benefiting the entire system. This board will focus on 
making decisions on infrastructure planning, innovation planning, and 
optimal sourcing a
t the national level. The board will be comprised of 
representatives from Coca
-
Cola North America, Coca
-
Cola Refreshments and 
the three independent bottlers, which, together, currently represent 
approximately 95% of the U.S. produced volume. We believe thi
s structure 
allows us to leverage our significant system scale with a unique competitive 
advantage of being able to act locally with speed. Together, with our focus 
on driving revenue, this will result in system margin expansion over the 
coming years.
 
So i
n addition to system
-
wide benefits, this approach has the additional 
benefit for The Coca
-
Cola Company in that it accelerates our return to an 
asset
-
light model, which will result in higher operating margins, lower capital 
spending and invested capital, an
d improved return on invested capital for 
our company as we transition these production assets.
 
We also continue to make progress on the refranchising of the U.S. 
distribution territories. Just this morning, we announced that we signed non
-
binding Letters 
of Intent on additional distribution territories in seven states. 
As Muhtar referenced, this will bring the total amount of volume in territories 
transitioned to date, all covered by agreements, to over 30% of U.S. bottle 
can volume.
 
Also during the quarte
r, we announced the merger of our company
-
owned 
German bottling operations with Coca
-
Cola Iberian Partners and Coca
-
Cola 
Enterprises into a new company named Coca
-
Cola European Partners. This 
will transform our Western European bottling landscape and creat
e the 
world's largest independent Coca
-
Cola bottler, based on revenue. The 
creation of a larger unified bottling partner in Western Europe represents an 
important step in our global systems evolution, as we continue to adapt our 
business model to innovate,
 
invest, and grow along with the changing 
demands of the marketplace. This merger enhances alignment within the 
Coca
-
Cola system, enabling us to more effectively compete and drive growth 
across developed European markets. Importantly, the new company will 
position to deliver world
-
class execution and customer service by leveraging 
the best practices of each party to drive sustainable growth in multiple 
categories.
 
Now, turning to the performance in this quarter, well, the global economic 
environment remains
 
challenging. As the slowdown in the Chinese economy 
and the lower oil prices are putting pressure on many commodity
-
dependent 
economies such as Australia, Brazil, and Russia, while volatility rippling 
through the Middle East causes further economic uncert
ainty. Despite these 
macroeconomic challenges, our five
-
point plan and our focus on execution 
and reinvestment drove improved results, with both unit case volume and 
price/mix growing 3% each in the quarter, as outlined in our quarterly 
performance scoreca
rd on slide 11. Organic revenues grew 3%, driven by 
the previously
-
mentioned strong price/mix and slight growth in concentrate 
shipments.
 
Our top line performance was broad based, with five of the six operating 
segments delivering organic revenue growth. North America continued its 
disciplined approach to volume, price, and mix management, and I'm 
encouraged by the solid progress we've seen 
in this market over the past 
two years. In Europe, we drove top
-
line growth through strong commercial 
and marketing activities whilst also benefiting from some good weather in 
much of the region. We are seeing green shoots in Europe, and our business 
in Ce
ntral and Southern Europe delivered a particularly strong quarter due to 
investments in media, changes in our price/pack architecture, and favorable 
weather. In Latin America, we delivered double
-
digit organic revenue growth 
despite worsening conditions in
 
Brazil. Our Mexico business unit helped to 
balance the weakness in Brazil by accelerating unit case volume growth to 
4% in the quarter, with growth across all the major categories. In Eurasia 
and Africa, deteriorating conditions in Russia and volatility i
n the Middle East 
partially offset the solid performance in the Africa businesses.
 
Turning finally to the Asia
-
Pacific group, China and India both grew unit case 
volume mid
-
single digits in the quarter. In India, this marks a return to 
growth for our busin
ess after a tough second quarter, with our volume 
growth trends improving in each month. In China, our consistent strategy 
and focus on execution led to continued value and volume share gains in 
non
-
alcoholic ready
-
to
-
drink beverages. Notably, trademark Co
ca
-
Cola 
reached its highest year
-
to
-
date share levels since 2011. In Japan, volume 
did decline, driven by poor weather in the quarter as well as a move to focus 
on price realization by reducing discounting on certain low
-
value multi
-
serve 
packs. While this
 
may have short
-
term consequences in volume and share, it 
is more important to improve our pricing in the marketplace.
 
Finally, our Bottling Investments group delivered 3% organic revenue 
growth, led by operations in Germany, India, and Vietnam. As a resul
t, we 
once again gained global value share in non
-
alcoholic ready
-
to
-
drink 
beverages in the quarter, with gains in both sparkling and still beverages 
worldwide.
 
In summary, our third quarter performance marks another positive step 
towards achieving our goa
l of accelerating top line growth, with the company 
delivering both solid pricing and unit case volume growth. We are confident 
in our strategies and execution, and remain on track to deliver against 
expectations for this year.
 
I will now hand over to Kath
y, who will provide you a more detailed look at 
our financial performance, as well as our outlook on our business for the rest 
of 2015.
 
Kathy N. Waller 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
 
Thank you, James, and good morning, everyone.
 
Organ
ic revenue growth was driven by three points of positive price/mix. 
Consolidated price/mix in the quarter was driven by positive pricing and 
product mix initiatives across many of our key markets, and benefited from 
positive geographic mix due to the stron
g volume growth in our Bottling 
Investments group. After adjusting for the additional days in the first 
quarter, year
-
to
-
date concentrate shipments were slightly behind unit cases, 
primarily due to the timing of shipments in the prior year in our Asia
-
Paci
fic 
and Eurasia and Africa groups. For the full year, we continue to expect 
concentrate shipments to be generally in line with unit cases.
 
Our comparable currency neutral growth margin expanded on a consolidated 
basis, due to positive pricing, productivity
 
savings, and a slightly lower 
commodity cost partially offset by structural changes. Positive comparable 
currency neutral operating leverage was driven primarily by cycling the 
timing of marketing expenses (19:00), the impact of which we expect to 
reverse
 
in the fourth quarter, as well as by a continued focus on controlling 
our operating costs.
 
For the quarter, comparable currency neutral operating income grew 8%. 
Below the operating line, net interest income was lower versus prior year, 
resulting in 7% gr
owth in comparable currency neutral income before tax, 
which included a one point structural headwind. Our third quarter 
comparable EPS was $0.51, which included a 12
-
point currency headwind. 
On a comparable currency neutral basis, our EPS grew 8% in the q
uarter. 
Items impacting comparability in the quarter were primarily related to non
-
cash charges related to the announced refranchising of territories in North 
America. During the first nine months of the year, we generated $6.7 billion 
in free cash flow, u
p 6%, primarily due to the efficient management of 
working capital and the impact of six additional days, partially offset by an 
unfavorable impact from currency exchange rates, the impact from 
refranchising territories in North America and the brand trans
fer agreement 
with Monster Beverage Corporation. Our focus on improving working capital 
contributed an incremental $600 million of cash flow for the first nine 
months of 2015 versus the prior year. We returned $5.6 billion to 
shareowners in the form of div
idends and net share repurchases during the 
first nine months.
 
Turning to outlook, we are broadly in line with our expectations for the first 
nine months of the year. With one quarter remaining, we expect our full year 
comparable currency neutral EPS to gr
ow 5%, in line with our previous 
expectations. However, due to the strength of the U.S. dollar, we now 
expect the currency impact to be slightly more unfavorable. After 
considering our hedge positions, current spot rates and the cycling of our 
prior year r
ates, we now expect an approximate seven
-
point currency 
headwind on net revenue, 11
-
point headwind on operating income, and an 
eight
-
point headwind on income before tax for the full year 2015. Therefore, 
we expect our comparable EPS to decline 3% for the y
ear. Our full year 
outlook implies that our fourth quarter comparable currency neutral EPS will 
decline mid
-
 
to high
-
single digits. There are a couple of points to consider 
when modeling the fourth quarter.
 
As we communicated at the beginning of the year, 
our fourth quarter will 
have six fewer selling days this year. Due to the timing of expenses last 
year, combined with the increase in media investments this year, we expect 
DME to increase substantially in the fourth quarter. We expect structural 
items to 
be a slight headwind on net revenue, and a two
-
point headwind on 
both gross profit and income before tax. We currently estimate currency will 
be a six
-
point headwind on net revenues, a 12
-
point headwind on operating 
income, and a 10
-
point headwind on incom
e before tax in the fourth quarter 
as we cycle more favorable rates from the prior year. As a reminder, these 
impacts are based on current spot rates, and given the volatile currency 
environment, these amounts are subject to change.
 
In summary, as you hear
d from Muhtar and James, our financial 
performance is consistent with what we discussed early in the year, and we 
continue to execute as we outlined. Operator, we are now ready for 
questions.

So, Muhtar, it's been a year sin
ce you announced the plans to focus on 
greater pricing in developed markets as well as boost marketing spend 
starting in 2015. And I was hoping you could just take a step back and give 
us a more detailed review of your progress on those fronts. How much to
p
-
line growth is responding to those efforts relative to your expectations, both 
in terms of the market share payback from the higher marketing as well as 
the demand elasticity from higher pricing? And then just in terms of the 
quarter, on an adjusted basi
s ex the concentrate lag, it looks like underlying 
revenue results are returning to your long
-
term goals with 3% unit case 
result and 3% price/mix. So, at this point, do you feel comfortable you can 
generally meet those long
-
term top line growth goals goin
g forward, ex any 
timing issues, or with emerging markets macros still decelerating and 
perhaps easy comps from this quarter, it's a bit too early to call for that? 
Thanks.
 
Ahmet Muhtar Kent 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
Yeah, Dara, thanks for the q
uestion. What I would say in general overall is 
yes, we're pleased with the quarter and the progress we're making but lots 
of more work to do. This is a transition year. When we talked to you about 
12 months ago, we outlined to you that with the changes we
're going to 
make that our goal is to get to mid
-
single digit currency neutral revenue 
growth for the comparable revenue growth for the company overall. And I 
think if you look at our progress to date for the first three quarters of the 
year, we're at sort
 
of the bottom end of that range, the mid
-
single digit, if 
you look at where we are in revenue in terms of currency neutral 
comparable, and what we have posted in this past quarter, in the third 
quarter, you would see us if you take those numbers that you 
mentioned in 
terms of volume growth of 3% and price/mix of 3%, at the top end of that 
range.
 
So in essence, we're pleased with the progress that we 

 
what all the five
-
point strategy and executing it diligently over the last nine months and even 
starting at the end of last year has brought us to where we are. And so we 
feel that we've always said 
that marketing has a lag, the incremental 
marketing, there's a lag in terms of when we input it and the results that 
we're getting, but we see that the plan is working. And we certainly see that 
we're taking a very strategic approach in terms of marketing 
spend versus 
optimal levels. Consistent quality investment in media continues to be one of 
the strongest drivers of our business, enabling us to generate those 

 
that 
revenue. We look at each market. How many weeks of consumer 
engagement there is, the goal
 
over time is to apply the right pressure in the 
right way to each of our brands and each of the segments that you 
mentioned, which is developed, developing and emerging. And the system 
alignment in our bottling system is matching our alignments with 
inves
tments 

 
I'm sorry, with capabilities, execution, output development, 
cooler placement, et cetera. So we're pleased with what we see there.
 
And of course, all of this being said, we have a volatile macroeconomic 
environment, which obviously is not getting 
any better anytime soon. We 
realize that. The global growth for 2015 is projected to be below last year, 
and even having said that, the disposable income are even lagging the 
growth rates that are projected. So, yeah. But, in general, that's how I 
would fr
ame your question and both James and I and Kathy believe that the 
incremental and better marketing is certainly giving us the results in terms 
of the top line currency neutral comparable top line growth.

I actually want to talk a little bit more about the National Product Supply 
System that James detailed. And I guess specifically, maybe Muhtar or 
James, could you talk more about the governance process there and the 
make
up of the managing board? As I understand it, there are five voting 
members, CCR, Coke North America and then the three bottlers 
Consolidated, United and Swire. And I guess I'm curious as to how you 
ensure that tough decisions get made in that structure an
d implemented in 
that structure. Do you need unanimous consents? Is it majority rules? And if 
there isn't unanimous consent or support for a given measure, what gives 
the NPSG the power to enforce successful implementation? Thanks.
 
Ahmet Muhtar Kent 
-
 
Chai
rman & Chief Executive Officer
 
Thanks, Steve. What we said, again, at the beginning of this journey back 
three years, four years ago, is that we said that we have an intention to 
create a system in the United States that can benefit from the local 
empowerm
ent in each of the communities and the markets that have built 
our business so successful over the last 130 years. The franchise system, 
the alignment that brings, the value and trust between us and our bottling 
partners. But at the same time, create the m
echanisms, so to speak, the 
processes, flexible processes in the marketplace whether it be information 
systems, whether it be the customer management system so that we can 
speak with one voice to customers coast
-
to
-
coast in the United States, and 
the Natio
nal Product Supply System. All of those negotiations with our 
expanding bottlers took some time to achieve. They're all achieved. That's 
why we're progressing rapidly with our refranchising program, which is 
working very well because when we have those pro
cesses in place, we can 
refranchise with confidence and speed and have the business continue to 
generate the results and the growth that we are seeing in revenue, 
particularly in the United States of America. And the United States non
-
alcoholic beverage bu
siness is healthy. It is growing in revenues and dollars 
and cents, and that's the really important element that I want to leave with 
you. But, just to add more color and flavor to the National Product Supply 
System question that you had in terms of the go
vernance model, I'll ask 
James to comment further and give you more insights. James?
 
James Quincey 
-
 
President & Chief Operating Officer
 
Yeah I think, just specifically on governance, it's not going to be around 
unanimity. It's going to be based on the dri
ving of the business case. 
Everyone's committed to doing what is economically the most rational 
answer for the system. Again, this is when it comes to the national issues. 
It's not necessarily the management of each local plant, which will remain 
the job o
f each of the participating bottlers, or CCNA.
 
Ahmet Muhtar Kent 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
Steve, does that address your question?
 
Stephen R. Powers 
-
 
UBS Securities LLC
 
Yes, sorry, I was on mute. No, thank you. That does help. But I guess, 
Jame
s, just to follow up. If there is friction on a given issue, right, if there's 
debate about what is in the best sort of economic interest of the system, 
what's the tiebreaker? How does the majority view get pushed through?
 
James Quincey 
-
 
President & Chief
 
Operating Officer
 
We're not laying out the precise mechanic, but I can tell you that there's not 
going to be a full consensus required for every decision. It's going to be a 
large majority, and if they support the economic case, then that's what's 
going t
o move forward. So, we're not creating a system that can become 
blocked. We're creating a system that's going to (31:48) focus on the best 
economics of the system in North America, and there are mechanisms for 
that to go forward.
 
Stephen R. Powers

Thank you. The next question is from Judy Hong of 
Goldman Sachs. Your 
line is open. You may proceed.
 
Judy E. Hong 
-
 
Goldman Sachs & Co.
 
Thank you. Good morning. I guess I was hoping to get a little bit more color 
in your performance in Europe this quarter. So, 4% volume growth, certainly 
an improvement th
ere. You called out some of the factors, the green shoots 
in Europe. You've got the favorable weather conditions, as well as the 
marketing spending step
-
up. So, number one, can you just talk about a little 
bit more behind, what really drove the volume impr
ovement? How 
sustainable those improvements are in terms of volume. And then, if you 
think about price/mix performance in Europe, kind of flattish performance in 
a more developed market. So, how should we think about that number? How 
much was that geograph
ic mix, and are you seeing actual price realization in 
some of the markets, understanding that, obviously, it's a tough deflationary 
market there.
 
Ahmet Muhtar Kent 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
Yeah Judy, thanks. This is Muhtar. Good morning. Unit 
cases, as you said, 
did grow 4% in the quarter in Europe. They were cycling a minus 5% from 
prior year, and sparkling was up, as well as stills growing faster than 
sparkling in Western Europe. And then our concentrate sales did trail also 
the unit cases in
 
Western Europe, as it did for the whole company. And we 
were pleased with the results. And certainly, again, some early results from 
the marketing, but more to come, and I'll ask James to add more color to 
that. James?
 
James Quincey 
-
 
President & Chief Op
erating Officer
 
Yeah, thanks, Muhtar. As Muhtar referenced, we were cycling a pretty poor 
quarter from last year. So, I think it was a favorable comparison, and we 
had strong results from very favorable weather in the Southern and the 
Central part of Europ
e. So I wouldn't read too much into the one quarter. I 
think if you look at the longer term trends, you can see that we're getting 
some volume growth in the year
-
to
-
date, where the price/mix is bouncing 
around flat. I think it's important to recognize two 
things as it comes to 
price/mix in the case of Europe. One is the general deflationary nature of the 
European market. Retail pricing is 0% to 1% at best, in general. And then 
secondly, it's worth remembering that the starting point of pricing in Europe 
is,
 
in comparison to the U.S., higher. So the opportunity is to drive price/mix 
on a sustained long
-
term basis. In a sense, we've already captured some of 
that in Europe, and we will be chasing that in the U.S. So I don't think we'll 
see the same sort of pric
e/mix over time in Europe, given our starting point.

Thank you. The next question is from Bryan Spillane of Bank of America. Sir, 
your line is open. Please proceed.

Good morning.
 
Bryan D. Spillane

Bank of America Merrill Lync
h
 
Kathy, just a question for you. And just thinking about some of the, I guess, 
the macro drivers of the P&L as we move into the fourth quarter and maybe 
beyond, into 2016. Other income this quarter was an expense. Is that at all 
related to the euro bond g
ain that you had in the first half, and how we think 
about lapping that next year? FX, the negative effect on operating income, is 
greater in the fourth quarter than it was in the third quarter. So should we 
think about FX carrying into 2016?
 
And then, in 
terms of structural change, I guess with Germany now 
essentially being contributed to the partnership, or the new entity in Europe, 
that will be a structural change for next year, but just anything we should be 
thinking about in terms of changes in the str
uctural change component of 
modeling, I guess, going into the fourth quarter, and maybe into next year, 
would be helpful. Thanks.
 
Kathy N. Waller 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
 
Sure. Thank you, Bryan. So for foreign exchange for next 
year, remember, 
we had said that for our hard currencies, we are hedged and so our real 
exposure is around our emerging currencies. Now, that being said, we do 
have to cycle that euro debt bond offering, which impacted the first quarter 
and second quarter 
of this year and for the full year, it was about three 
points benefit to us. So we do have to cycle that next year on top of just a 
change in the rates and probably a more difficult currency environment 
going forward. So, we will give more color on currenc
y in February when we 
give our full year results for 2016 (sic) [2015] (36:52), but our issue is 
really going to be around the emerging markets where we've 

 
it's not cost 
effective to hedge more than about a quarter at a time.
 
And then in terms of the str
uctural impact, yes, Germany will be a structural 
impact next year. Obviously, we continue with the North America 
refranchising, so that will still have a significant impact in North America, 
and there may be some slight impacts from whenever the Africa tr
ansaction 
closes, but the majority of it will be the Germany transaction and the North 
America refranchising.
 
Bryan D. Spillane 
-
 
Bank of America Merrill Lynch
 
Okay. Thank you. And just with the Africa JV, do we still expect that that will 
close before the
 
end of the year, or is there any update on timing there?
 
Ahmet Muhtar Kent 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
Yeah. Bryan, this is Muhtar. What I would say is that it's in the regulatory 
approval process, and that's all I would say right now, and 
then we expect it 
to close some time over the next three months to four months. That's what I 
would say.
 
Bryan D. Spillane

Our next question is from Ali Dibadj of Bernstein. Your line is open. 
You may 
proceed.
 
Ali Dibadj 
-
 
Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC
 
Hey, guys. Just a few things. One is I was hoping you could set people just 
more at ease around the closure of the gap in unit case volume to 
concentrate sales. I'm getting a lot of questions the
re. And if that 

 
look, if 
you're real comfortable with that and if that's the case that that closes for all 
the regions in the world, it certainly does look like there's an inflection point 
on top line. But are we now comfortable enough to also start talk
ing a little 
bit about, perhaps, a crossover point or an inflection point in the productivity 
savings being higher than reinvestment rate as well so margins can also look 
like they're expanding? It looks like you had flat operating margins here, 
including 
the FX effects there. But that's better than it's been in a little while 
as well. So can we clarify, and give us a sense on the margin inflection 
potential as well?
 
Kathy N. Waller 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
 
Sure. So the unit case
s to concentrate shipment, they're really impacted by 
Asia
-
Pacific and Latin America. And if you look at Latin America on a year
-
to
-
date basis, they're absolutely in line, and with Asia
-
Pacific on a year
-
to
-
date 
basis we expect them to be generally in line
. So there's really no story there 
in terms of that gap.
 
When you 

 
and moving on to productivity, so productivity initiatives, yeah, 
obviously, we are seeing some benefit from productivity. In our margins, 
there is an impact in our margins from basically 
the structural changes. So, 
if you were to exclude structural changes, gross margins and operating 
margins would be higher and you would see margin expansion. And when 
you look at the third quarter, when you look at the leverage 

 
so we are 
getting some pr
oductivity, but we also have an impact from timing of the 
DME from 

 
basically from prior year that's impacting that timing from this 
year. That, by the way, turns around in the fourth quarter. So I think there 
are a lot of puts and takes going on around p
roductivity. You are seeing 
some productivity coming through. We are continuing to reinvest behind our 
brands, though, but our margin expansion is masked right now by currency 
and structural, so if you pull those two things out, you'd see very good 
margin 
expansion.
 
Ahmet Muhtar Kent 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
And I would just add one point, Ali. I think what we saw in this past quarter 
in terms of operating margin expansion on a currency neutral comparable 
basis of about 100 basis points, we were
 
pleased with that expansion. Now, 
the key is to do everything we can to continue and ensure that we execute 
fully on the five strategic points going forward so that we can continue to 
improve our trajectory.
 
Ali Dibadj 
-
 
Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC
 
Oka
y, okay. That's helpful. Just from a structural perspective, as you 
mentioned it, one of the big changes obviously in the marketplace is the 
ABI
-
SAB deal, which is agreed upon, I guess. Can you talk a little bit about 
any of the deal implications to you st
ructurally in that context? For instance, 
would you let them produce both for you and the blue system? Is that 
something you can shed a little bit of light on as now it's an agreed upon 
deal, it sounds like?
 
Ahmet Muhtar Kent

Yeah, Ali, we will not comment on any specific matters related to our 
customers, bottlers or any M&A matters, so I'll just leave it at that.

Our next question is from John Fau
cher of JPMorgan. Sir, your line is open. 
Please proceed.
 
John A. Faucher 
-
 
JPMorgan Securities LLC
 
Yes, thanks. Want to go back as sort of a little bit of a follow
-
up to Steve's 
question. If I look at slide 10 in the handouts, if I look at North America, 
you 
guys are fragmenting that sort of last piece to market, that last piece of the 
route
-
to
-
market, and then also to some extent the manufacturing piece. Yet 
you're telling us, on the flip side, as we look at Europe, as you create this 
sort of wall that go
es across Europe of all one big bottler, the consolidation 
is something that seems to be the right thing for Europe. So, can you talk a 
little bit about why fragmenting North America yet consolidating Europe at 
the same time, those are both the right strat
egies when they 

 
I don't want 
to say they're diametrically opposed, but at least they appear to be 
somewhat in conflict with each other. Thank you.
 
Ahmet Muhtar Kent 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
John, this is Muhtar. Actually, they're not in confl
ict at all. They're basically 
very complementary to our strategy, which is to ensure that we have the 
local touch, and we have also the scale, and we have the processes to meet 
customer demands and customer partnerships. And in the United States, 
we've act
ually not 

 
you mentioned the word fragmented. We have a 
national customer management system. We have a national production 
system. We have a national information system that is basically all with their 
own governance models, and they're very fluid and ver
y flexible to suit the 
needs of the business today.
 
And then at the same time, every piece of the United States that has those 
elements really have enough size for scale. And then we have the much 
smaller, the smaller distributor bottling system that also 
the smaller guys 
are doing a great job in growing the business for us. And then in Europe, 
basically what we have is, the customer landscape in Europe is much, much 
more concentrated in Western Europe where just a handful of customers 
account for a very la
rge portion of the total future consumption, the retail 
business in Europe. And therefore, when you look at what we have created 
in Western Europe, it basically suits our future needs in terms of working 
proactively with our customer partners, and also it 
gives the scale and also it 
give the local touch in each of the markets. So, from that perspective, just 
like what we have done in Japan, just like what we have done in South 
Africa, and large markets I'm talking about, it basically very much aligns to 
our
 
strategy in how you think about what we're doing in the marketplace.
 
John A. Faucher 
-
 
JPMorgan Securities LLC
 
Okay. And if I can just ask a follow
-
up. I guess you talked about local touch 
with the smaller local bottlers in the U.S., and then you also tal
ked about 
local touch in Europe. And I guess, again, just to play devil's advocate here, 
aren't you moving away from the local 

 
I realize you're going to try and 
keep some of the local pieces through the new bottling entity, but it seems 
to me that's movi
ng less local.
 
Ahmet Muhtar Kent 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
Where? In Europe? (45:20)
 
John A. Faucher 
-
 
JPMorgan Securities LLC
 
So I guess it sounds like you're trying to have it both ways, and I guess I'm 
just not following why one is so 
dramatically better than the other. Is it just 
simply sort of the smaller account piece on the U.S. side that creates the 
difference here?
 
Ahmet Muhtar Kent 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
Well, the customer base in the United States and Western Europ
e is very, 
very different in terms of how it's structured. And so, we follow the 
customer, the needs of the customer, what matters. We follow the scale. We 
follow the necessity for speed. And we feel that the model that is being 
created in Western Europe w
ill serve us very well for the next decade and 
beyond, and the same thing goes for the United States. It is proving that it 
is serving us very well in terms of getting us the scale, in terms of getting us 
the costs in production and cost of goods sold. But
 
at the same time, 
retaining the local touch and retaining the local element that is really 
important in our business. Both of those are valid for Europe, and for 
Western Europe and for Japan and for South Africa, and for the United 
States, or wherever els
e you're seeing us create a better bottling system.

Muhtar, I wanted to circle back on the comment that you made about t
he 
health of the U.S. LRB category. I mean, clearly, that's apparent on the still 
side of the business. But as I look at the syndicated data for carbonated 
beverages in the United States, it does look like the category is softening a 
bit, and I think your 
revenues were down three out of the last four months. 
So, I was hoping you could comment on the evolution of the U.S. CSD side, 
and the demand elasticities and how they're evolving, please. Thank you.
 
Ahmet Muhtar Kent 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
Well, I think, based on what we are seeing is, we're able to generate 
revenue growth, both in the sparkling category, very much so, as well as in 
the still side. And therefore, that's what my comment referred to. This is not 
just one quarter. This is multi
ple quarters. And at the same time, inside that 
LRB category that is showing very good resilience in terms of both price 
elasticity, price discipline, approach with customers, generating value for our 
customers, both on the sparkling side as well as in lar
ge and small 
customers in the still side, we are also seeing that we gain 

 
and this is the 
22nd consecutive quarter of us gaining value share in the marketplace in 
North America. And then the mix is really working for us, in terms of 
generating the market
ing, where the North American market is the first 
market where we've started employing incremental marketing, better 
marketing, is generating also positive results for us in terms of the revenue 
growth, purely from sparkling as well as from the still side 
of the business. 
And, James, do you want to add any color to that?
 
James Quincey 
-
 
President & Chief Operating Officer
 
Yeah. I mean, if you take a look at how we're driving the sparkling business, 
you can look at the transaction packages, which represent a
bout 15% of the 
volume, and they're growing still again this quarter into double digits. So, 
we're very pleased with the marketing and the OBPC approach is driving 
positive revenue growth for sparkling on a consistent basis.

Good morning. Thank you very much. I was wondering if I could ask you 
about the recent vot
e in Mexico. It looks like there's a proposal to reduce the 
tax on soda by about half on products with five grams of sugar or less per 
100 milliliters. So, first, I was just wondering what you thought about the 
prospects of that, if you could give us any c
larity on what percentage of your 
portfolio that would cover?
 
And then, if we just think about it from a high level, and maybe, James, you 
could give us some color in a number of these markets. If we look at the 
Mexican soda tax as a template for the rest 
of the world, does this suggest 
any tempering of how some of the regulatory authorities are looking at the 
category, broadly speaking? Thank you.

So, of course, we need to wait and see whether the 
recent vote produces the 
act of (50:01) law by the end of the process. It's only gone through one of 
the stages. So, we'll see where that ends up. Obviously, we are in favor of 
reductions in discriminatory taxes. I think, as we look out on how that has 
imp
acted the world and how that's being viewed, and it will be used as a 
case study around the world, the data we have so far is the impact of the 
tax was to bring down about six calories from the Mexican diet by the end of 
the process. So, we're conscious th
at obesity is a crisis. We know we need to 
play a role. We don't think that this is the silver bullet that anyone was 
looking for, and we think that much more work needs to be done if indeed a 
solution is to be brought to bear on the whole obesity crisis, 
of which over
-
consumption of anything, including soft drinks, would be a contributor and a 
part of the problem. So, we'll see where this tax ends up. Clearly, taxing 
diets and lights doesn't seem to be the right way forward, and therefore, if 
this measure 
goes through, I think it would be positive.

Thanks. Just a quick question on Asia. Perhaps you can provide a little bit of 
context. It looks like that business may not be performing as well as you 
would like, broadly speaking. Is this a portfolio issue? I mean, can you just 
talk a
 
little bit about what's going on across that region, so we can just think 
about that as we go into 2016?

Yeah, Nik, I'll just say very, very broadly, at a high level. We're pleased with 
our performanc
e in China. Obviously, a lot of noise around China these days, 
but we have 

 
as mentioned earlier in the script, we have an all
-
time high 
share for brand Coke in China. And we're growing in China, and we're 
gaining share in China, and we're investing in Ch
ina and the same goes for 
India, two of the very large markets in Asia, certainly pleased with the 
results there. We had some weather
-
related issues in the quarter before, but 
we're coming back, and the business is really coming back and performing 
much be
tter in India. And so, overall, I think 

 
and then in Japan, we're 
seeing some green shoots in terms of disposable incomes. We're very early 
still in terms 

 
to call it any color, but overall, I'd say 

 
and then, obviously 
back in south 

 
Australasia, the 
economy was very much related to 
commodities and it has suffered, and we're seeing the macro spillover from 
that. But I would say overall, up from this past quarter. We're happy with 
the results in the big economies, and then realizing 

 
recognizing that w
e 
have got more work to do. And that's how I would leave it.

Thank you James, Kathy and Tim. So in summary, our company has 
undergone a substantial amount of change over the past 10 months to 12 
months, and our third quarter results demonstrate continued progress 
against our five strategic initiatives. The l
ong
-
term dynamics of our industry 
remain promising, and we absolutely believe that The Coca
-
Cola Company 
and the Coca
-
Cola system is best positioned to capture that growth in non
-
alcoholic beverages, and to deliver long
-
term value to our shareowners. As 
al
ways, we thank you for your interest, your investment in our company and 
for joining us this morning.

Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
Thank you, Tim, and good morning, everyone. While many markets around 
the world face macroeconomic challenges, our focus on improving our 
execution enabled us to deliver
 
improved top line results. Net revenues grew 
4% on an organic basis, driven by positive price/mix and 3% growth in 
concentrate shipments, as outlined on our second quarter performance 
scorecard on slide four.
 
Our top line performance was broad
-
based, with
 
each operating segments 
delivering positive organic revenue growth, demonstrating the strength of 
our global brand portfolio and the robust distribution capabilities of our 
bottling partners.
 
As a result, we once again gained global value share in non
-
alc
oholic ready
-
to
-
drink beverages in the quarter, with gains in both sparkling and still 
beverages. This represents the 32nd quarter in a row that we've gained 
NARTD value share, an important metric for us, particularly in a tough 
macroeconomic environment. 
Notably, the levels of our volume and value 
share gains are accelerating versus the second quarter of last year.
 
Unit case volume grew 2% in the quarter, cycling 3% in the prior
-
year. 
We've seen an improvement with all operating groups growing despite a 
sh
ift in Easter holiday sales from the second quarter last year into the first 
quarter this year, as well as challenges in key emerging markets, most 
notably Brazil, Russia and India.
 
During the quarter, we continued our strong focus on controlling operating
 
expenses. Even with a double
-
digit increase in our media spend, we were 
able to deliver a 50 basis point improvement in our operating margin on a 
comparable currency
-
neutral basis and grow our comparable currency
-
neutral operating income and PBT by 6% and
 
3% respectively in the 
quarter.
 
Finally, we generated record cash from operations and grew free cash flow 
16% on a year
-
to
-
date basis, due in part to the six extra days in the first 
quarter, but also due to effective working capital initiatives, something
 
Kathy 
will talk about later in the call.
 
Last year, we took decisive action to reinvigorate our growth and increase 
profitability. Halfway through our transition year, we're pleased with the 
progress we're making, but recognize that we still have much to 
do. We're 
acting with speed, with urgency against each of our five strategic initiatives.
 
First and foremost, our enhanced focus on revenue growth across market is 
delivering value share gains ahead of volume share gains on a consolidated 
basis, as well as
 
in our International and North America businesses.
 
Our North America business delivered a very strong quarter, with 5% growth 
in organic revenues and 8% in comparable income before tax. This 
performance reflects increased marketing, a disciplined approach
 
to 
managing volume, price and mix as well as the shift of July 4 holiday sales 
and our Share a Coke campaign into the second quarter this year versus the 
third quarter last year.
 
Importantly, in North America we delivered revenue growth in our sparkling 
p
ortfolio in the quarter due to further expansion of our pricing strategy, 
resulting in 4% sparkling price/mix. Our disciplined price/pack strategy has 
seen wide adoption across all retail channels as we emphasize smaller 
proprietary packages, while also ra
ising prices on traditional packages, 
including 12
-
ounce cans and two
-
liter bottles. While sparkling unit case 
volume grew 1%, transactions increased 2% due to strong growth in the 
smaller packages, which are on trend with consumer preferences, such as 
our
 
mini cans, which grew volume double
-
digits during the quarter.
 
The second action to reinvigorate growth is to increase our media 
investments globally to fully fund our brands across our markets around the 
world, while enhancing the quality of our advertis
ing at the same time. In 
the markets where we are investing more with better quality, we're seeing 
better performance. Let me just give you an example of how marketing, 
along with solid execution by our bottling partners, is driving top line growth 
across 
our emerging, developing and developed markets.
 
Starting with our emerging markets, despite a soft macro environment in 
China, we grew brand Coca
-
Cola volume double
-
digits. A record 20 million 
consumers participated in China's Coca
-
Cola Break consumer prom
otion, 
which along with the third edition of the Share a Coke campaign, fueled our 
growth.
 
Turning to our developing markets; in Argentina, we gained both volume 
and value share and importantly gained value share ahead of volume share 
for the second quarte
r in a row, due in part to integrated marketing 
campaigns around Copa América, the main International football tournament 
for national teams in South America.
 
Finally, both the quantity and quality of marketing in North America helped 
us realize four point
s of sparkling price/mix, resulting in solid revenue 
performance. The trends we're seeing in these markets, as well as initial 
results in other markets, gives us continued confidence that our stepped
-
up 
investments are working. Further, we still have signi
ficant opportunity in 
many other markets where we began increasing media investments towards 
the end of 2014. Given the typical 12
-
month to 24
-
month time period for 
these investments to deliver their full return, it will be 2016 before we see 
real results 
in some of these other regions.
 
Turning to productivity; we remain focused on fueling our reinvestment 
through embedding productivity into our DNA. We're on track across all 
spend areas to hit key milestones this year and deliver $3 billion in 
annualized s
avings by 2019. One area, which we are seeing momentum is 
supply chain related savings, which benefited our gross margin in the 
quarter. Year
-
to
-
date, we've consolidated three distribution centers and 
closed one plant in North America, as well as began the
 
process of installing 
in
-
line blow molding equipment.
 
Further, we recently kicked off the next phase of our zero
-
based work, which 
consists of a launch in our international markets and a second year of this 
work in corporate, as well as North America. Zer
o
-
based work is a 
mechanism that helps our leaders make very tough choices to free up 
resources that can be redeployed and reinvested to fund growth. As we go 
through this process, we're working to ensure that the priorities we are 
funding to drive growth 
in our business units are also seamlessly prioritized 
across our entire system.
 
The implementation of our new operating model is on track, and we have 
made significant headway on the previously announced head count 
reductions. This now includes 
Europe, where we began implementing 
changes this quarter following the appropriate consultations. As we begin 
operating within our new structure, we are actively engaging in connecting 
our global organization and implementing our standard processes.
 
Finall
y, focusing on our core business model, we continue to make progress 
on our North America refranchising efforts. During the quarter, we 
transitioned territories representing over 5% of the U.S. bottle/can volume. 
Additionally, we announced the signing of n
ew Letters of Intent for 
territories covering close to another 10% of the U.S. bottle/can volume.
 
In aggregate, territories transitioned to
-
date and those covered by definitive 
agreements or Letters of Intent represent approximately 25% of the total 
U.S. b
ottle/can volume. We're getting better; we're getting faster, which is 
why we are confident we're going to achieve our previously
-
stated goal to 
have approximately two
-
thirds of U.S. bottle/can volume distributed by our 
independent bottlers by the end of 2
017.
 
Our bottling partners are critical to our success. We held our annual global 
system meeting in May this year; and I can tell you that the level of 
engagement among our bottling partners was very high. They are 
encouraged by our plans, and have committ
ed to support our investments 
with further enhanced focus on local market execution.
 
To conclude, I would like to address the macro environment, given the 
challenges many CPG companies are encountering today and the fact that 
approximately 75% of our opera
ting income is generated overseas.
 
The global economic recovery remains uneven. Given the continued 
slowdown of the Chinese economy, the prospective U.S. tightening cycle, as 
the U.S. prepares to increase interest rates, and the ongoing uncertainty 
surroun
ding Greece and its place in the Eurozone. Additionally, many 
emerging markets, large and small, remain challenged, as evidenced by our 
low single
-
digit volume declines in both Brazil and Russia this quarter.
 
While we have the right strategic plans in plac
e to navigate through the 
volatile operating environment, we're not fully immune. With that said, as 
we pass the midpoint of 2015, we're broadly where we expected to be.
 
I remain encouraged by our progress to
-
date, but also acknowledge that 
there's still m
uch work ahead of us. We're confident in our strategies and 
execution, and remain on track to deliver against our full
-
year comparable 
currency
-
neutral growth expectations.
 
I'll now hand the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Kathy Waller, who 
will 
provide you with a more detailed look at our financial performance, as 
well as update on our outlook for 2015.
 
Kathy N. Waller

Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
 
Thank you, Muhtar, and good morning, everyone. The second quarter came 
in br
oadly as we expected. Organic revenue growth was driven by 3% 
growth in concentrate shipment and one point of positive price/mix. 
Consolidated price/mix in the quarter was driven by positive pricing and 
product mix initiatives across many of our markets, p
artially offset by 
negative geographic mix, consistent with the outlook we provided last 
quarter.
 
Concentrate shipments outpaced unit cases in the quarter, primarily due to 
the timing of shipments in our Asia Pacific group. After adjusting for the 
addition
al days in the first quarter, year
-
to
-
date concentrate shipments were 
generally in line with unit cases on a consolidated basis.
 
Our comparable gross margin declined on a consolidated basis as positive 
pricing, productivity savings, and a slightly lower co
mmodity cost were offset 
by currency headwinds and structural changes. Positive comparable 
currency
-
neutral operating leverage was driven primarily by the impact of 
structural items which unfavorably impacted gross margin, but was roughly 
neutral at operat
ing income and income before taxes. For the quarter, 
comparable currency
-
neutral operating income grew 6%, including a mid 
single
-
digit increase in DME.
 
Below the operating line; on a comparable currency
-
neutral basis, net 
interest income, equity income, a
nd other income were lower, resulting in 
3% growth in comparable currency
-
neutral income before tax. Consistent 
with the outlook we provided on the last call, on a comparable basis, other 
income benefited from foreign exchange gains associated with the eur
o
-
denominated debt issued during the first quarter.
 
Our second quarter comparable EPS was $0.63, which included a six point 
currency headwind. On a comparable currency
-
neutral basis, our EPS grew 
4% in the quarter. Items impacting comparability in the quar
ter were 
primarily related to a net gain recognized in connection with the closing of 
the transaction with Monster Beverage Corporation.
 
During the first six months of the year, we generated $4 billion in free cash 
flow, up 16%, primarily due to the effici
ent management of working capital 
and the impact of six additional days, partially offset by an unfavorable 
impact from currency exchange rates. We returned $3.8 billion to share 
owners in the form of dividends and net share repurchases during the first 
si
x months.
 
I'd like to take a moment to talk about working capital management, which 
we view as another key focus of productivity, as it is incremental to our P&L 
project and it adds significant value to the company and share owners by 
targeting cash flow i
mprovements.
 
In 2013, we initiated a program to better manage our working capital with 
an initial focus on our trade receivables and payables. As a result of this 
program, we have improved our cash conversion cycle, which resulted in 
$400 million of increm
ental cash flow for the first six months of 2015 versus 
the prior
-
year.
 
Turning to outlook, halfway through our transition year we are where we 
expected to be, recognizing that economic growth remains challenging in 
many markets; notably Brazil, Russia and
 
China. For the full
-
year 2015, our 
comparable currency
-
neutral outlook remains unchanged, although there are 
a few adjustments to specific items.
 
Our outlook for net interest is slightly more favorable, offset by a slightly 
larger impact from structural i
tems at the profit before tax line. We estimate 
an increase in the currency impact in the back half of the year based on the 
latest exchange rates, and after considering our hedge position, current spot 
rates and the cycling of our prior
-
year rates, we now
 
expect an approximate 
six point currency headwind on net revenue, 11 point headwind on operating 
income, and a seven point to eight point headwind on income before tax for 
the full
-
year 2015. And we expect net share repurchases for the year to be 
in the r
ange of $2 billion to $2.5 billion.
 
In addition, there a couple of phasing items you should consider when 
modeling the third quarter. Due to the timing of our fiscal quarter end, the 
benefit associated with the July 4 holiday fell in the second quarter thi
s year 
versus the third quarter last year. We expect structural items to be a slight 
headwind on net revenue and a one point to two point headwind on income 
before tax.
 
We currently estimate currency will be an approximate seven point headwind 
on net reven
ues, 13 point headwind on operating income, and a 10 point 
headwind on income before tax in the third quarter as we cycle more 
favorable rates from the prior
-
year. The variance between the currency 
headwind on operating income and on income before tax is p
rimarily due to 
the cycling re
-
measurement losses in the prior
-
year. Finally, while not a 
third quarter consideration, I wanted to remind you that in 2015 our fourth 
quarter will have six fewer selling days.
 
In summary, we are seeing initial progress based
 
on our plan to reinvigorate 
top line growth, while recognizing that we continue to operate in a 
challenging macro environment. Therefore, while currency headwinds are 
increasing, we see no change to our full
-
year comparable currency
-
neutral 
growth expecta
tions. Operator, we are now ready for questions.

Thank you, ma'am. The first question on queue is from Mr. John Faucher of 
JPMorgan. Sir, your line is open.
 
John A. Faucher

JPMorgan Securities LLC
 
Thank you. Good morn
ing. I want to talk a little bit about the advertising 
spending. There's been some questions 

 
and I've had them myself 

 
in 
terms of whether you're just sort of fighting a headwind in terms of trying to 
advertise the category. So, can you talk a little bi
t about what you're seeing, 
how you're gauging the success that you're having, and kind of what we 
should expect from an advertising spending increase as a percentage of 
sales as we look out over the next sort of 12 months to 18 months? Thanks.
 
Muhtar Kent

Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
Good morning, John. It's Muhtar here. I'll just say a few top line remarks 
about it and then also ask both Sandy and Ahmet to give some more specific 
details on their 

 
in specific markets. I'd say overall p
leased with our initial 
results, but as we've previously discussed and as I've just recently said it 
takes some time, anywhere from 12 months to 18 months, to realize the full 
value in terms of a return on those investments. We've found that 
disciplined qu
ality marketing investments drive growth better than any other 
strategy or action.
 
We're seeing good initial results in markets that have received the 
incremental media investment and also have improved the quality of 
marketing in our case, and the marketi
ng investments in North America is a 
great point, which is a clear contributing factor in the strong performance in 
the quarter 

 
continued strong performance in North America and the 
performance is getting better with 5% growth in organic revenues and 4% 
price/mix. That price/mix and that volume and that, therefore, growth in 
organic revenue would not have been achieved clearly without the infusion 
of that marketing and the quality and the quantity.
 
In China, also seeing positive trends, strong marketing a
ctivation, as I 
mentioned in my remarks. Sparkling growing at 7%, Coke growing at 
double
-
digits in the quarter, allowing us to gain 

 
continued to gain 
significant share in that market. And additionally, we're seeing accelerated 
trends in our value share g
ains, where you compare them against our trends 
a year ago.
 
So with that said, clear that it will take some time for the full benefit on a 
quarterly basis as these investments take some time to ramp up, also 
challenging consumer environment and macro envir
onments, and so, those 
are really what I would say.
 
And in terms of our results, you see year
-
to
-
date, our marketing 
investments are growing and our margin is expanding by 50 basis points. 
So, I think the key is to be able to achieve both, and we are confi
dent that 
we will continue to see more positive results. So with that, let me turn for 
some more specifics to Sandy and then to Ahmet for International example.
 
J. Alexander M. Douglas, Jr.

Executive Vice President & President,

Cola North America
 
Th
anks, Muhtar. And good morning, John. The core driver of our business 
across the world over time is the quality and quantity of our advertising and 
the related execution and activation by our bottlers.
 
And in the U.S., over the past 18 months, we've vigoro
usly pursued that 
strategy, increasing our advertising spend significantly, and you're seeing 
the payoff in the top line results that Muhtar just went through. But 
underneath that, a metric that you can watch also is just the price elasticity 
of our brands
 
and how volume reacts to price over time. And it's a good 
metric of the payoff of advertising, along with the efforts of our bottlers in 
the marketplace.
 
As we look ahead, we see advertising as an important proactive item to grow 
the business, but as you 
start to see in North America over the past few 
quarters, we're now leveraging the P&L, so that the infusion of advertising is 
coming from the accelerated top line growth and expense efficiency across 
the total business. So, net
-
net, it's part of our ongoi
ng algorithm and an 
important part of the way we intend to drive growth going forward. Ahmet?
 
Ahmet C. Bozer 
-
 
Executive Vice President & President, Coca
-
Cola 
International
 
Thanks, Sandy. Hey, John. We have a very similar story in Coke 
International. The b
ottlers and our teams have strong conviction about how 
better and more advertising drives top line. The examples that Muhtar 
quoted, there's more depth to that. I would add developed markets such as 
Germany and Spain to that list. I would add a developing 
market such as 
Mexico to that list. I would add an emerging market such as Nigeria as a 
good example. And there are other examples, where we increased media 
and we improved the quality of that communication, revenue results 
improve. Having said that, the h
istory of this increase is less than a year for 
most Coke International markets. I would caution that it is early days; but 
definitely, we're seeing the positive examples of this action.

Tha
nk you. Our next question is from Mr. Steve Powers of UBS. Sir, your line 
is open.
 
Stephen R. Powers

UBS Securities LLC
 
Hi. Good morning. Thanks. I guess, first, could you just, maybe I missed it, 
but could you just address the reduction in net buybacks 
for the year and 
what lies behind that? Is free cash flow coming in weaker, because that 
would seem surprising, just given your working capital comments, et cetera? 
Or is there a competing use for cash that we should be considering? Just a 
housekeeping que
stion.
 
And then a kind of a broader question on productivity, the update and the 
report card you provided was certainly helpful, but I was wondering if you 
could maybe quantify what those initiatives translated into in terms of 
savings in the quarter? And 
how far along you are, admittedly early, against 
that ultimate $3 billion goal? I think that would help just frame where you 
are in the overarching initiative.
 
And actually, if you could perhaps talk about other initiatives underway and 
what kinds of achie
vements we should look for on Q3 or Q4 report cards, 
that would be great as well? Thanks.
 
Kathy N. Waller 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
 
Sure, Steve. On the share buybacks; basically, we've given the range of $2 
billion to $3 billion,
 
so we're still in that range. We've looked at where we 
were for the first half of the year and then we looked at cash, particularly 
because of the currency getting worse in the back half, and just tightened 
the range. So, basically, we're still in that ra
nge, in that corridor, we just 
tightened the range.
 
And then on the second question, on productivity, we have basically stated 
that we are $500 million for 

 
we are on track. The working capital has 
allowed us to basically focus on share repurchase, even w
ith the significant 
currency headwinds, so basically the productivity initiatives we 

 
that we are 
on track.
 
We didn't give specific initiatives that we were working on for this year; you 
know about the people initiatives that we had, and we said we were g
oing to 
be on target with the $500 million for this year. They're still coming from the 
three areas, so we're still actively working on reducing our cost of goods sold 
and moving DME from more promotional activities into media spend. So we 
are basically on
 
track. I don't know 

 
I can't give you any other specifics, 
other than we are basically on track for the $500 million that we anticipated 
that we would have for this year.
 
Stephen R. Powers 
-
 
UBS Securities LLC
 
Okay. That's helpful. Is it fair to assume t
hat the savings build, and that 
there's more of an impact in the second half versus the first half? Or is it 
more kind of ratable throughout the year?
 
Kathy N. Waller

Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
 
You know, I don't know that I can qu
antify how they come throughout the 
year. Part of it was dependent upon when we started to see movement with 
some of the people, and we've not gotten 

 
for instance, Europe has to focus 
on the working 

 
had to work with the Work Council, so their initiativ
es with 
people are really just starting 

 
although everybody is aware, the movement 
of people is just starting. So part of that will be coming out, now that 
they've been able to focus on their moving people initiative, but I don't know 
that I can quantify 
the how and when it all comes through, because we focus 
on dealing with the work first. And we deal with the work first and then a lot 
of the other impact will kind of trail, making sure that we deal with 

 
that 
the organization is appropriately set up for
 
success going forward, which 
included focusing on the global organization and restructuring how we 
worked with the global organization. So all I can say is, we are on target 
with everything that we've done.

Just adding to what Kathy mentioned, Steve, I'd say that also, in terms of 
simplifying our organization, wiring our business units closer and more 
directly to the functional centers in our company, that largely has taken 
place.
 
We have es
sentially eliminated a functional layer in the company, allowing 
us to make faster and quicker and more effective decision
-
making in the 
company. That is already largely in place, and I think lots of continued work 
streams going on in COGS that will contin
ue to benefit and help us to deliver 
more than the $500 million in savings for the year.

Thank you. Our next question is from Mr. Mark Swartzberg of SFI (sic) 
[Stifel] (29:58) Financial. Sir
, your line is open.
 
Mark D. Swartzberg 
-
 
Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.
 
Yeah, thanks. It's Stifel Financial. But good morning, everyone. I guess, two 
questions here; one a region question, Muhtar, and then more a strategy 
question. With Asia Pac, at least v
ersus my model, the price/mix was 
disappointing. It's only a quarter, and you highlighted China and I think 
some product mix issues; but when you think longer
-
term about price/mix in 
Asia Pac, given the superior growth I think you expect from China, what's
 
a 
sound way to think about that region in the larger Coke system?
 
And then, unrelated to that, or less related to that, when you think about 
scale and bolt
-
on M&A, can you just update us on your thinking for the 
larger Coke 

 
how you're thinking about sca
le M&A and how you're thinking 
about bolt
-
on M&A?
 
Muhtar Kent 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
Yeah. First, Mark, good morning. On the Asia Pac, I think it pretty much 
came in line with what we were expecting, and it's related to timing, it's 
related t
o how you look at it on a year
-
to
-
date basis. And I'll have Ahmed 
comment on that once I finish. I'll just say a few things about the second 
question.
 
In terms of scale M&A and bolt
-
on M&A, I think you need to think, we will be 
again looking at bolt
-
on tar
gets that fit our strategic portfolio. That's the way 
you should think about our continued interest in any M&A, and how we 
target M&A.
 
Just the same way as you've seen us look at it in the last three, four, five 
years, how we look at the acquisitions that 
we made, in terms of Innocent, 
in terms of Honest Tea, in terms of ZICO, in terms of other bolt
-
on and then, 
more recently, the announcement from China that we had.
 
So essentially, bolt
-
on acquisitions that complement our current portfolio, 
and that give u
s an ability to also scale it up from a geographic scale, goes 
up from a geographic point of view, just like you saw us launch smartwater 
in other European markets more recently. That's a good example of how the 
scale
-
up continues, and how we've turned sma
rtwater into one of the 
leading premium waters in the world, both here in the United States and 
now in some other new markets. Ahmet, comments on Asia
-
Pacific?
 
Mark D. Swartzberg 
-
 
Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.
 
Can I just ask one quick one there as a follow
-
up, Muhtar? It sounds like 
what you're saying there this precludes an interest in scale M&A. The focus, 
just to be super clear, the focus is on bolt
-
on to the exclusion of scale 

 
and 
we could debate scale, I realize, but it sounds like that's the focus.
 
Muhtar Kent 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
I won't say it excludes anything, but I'm saying our focus would be 

 
I think 
you should assume that it would continue in that area. If there's something 
that 

 
obviously, the future, none of us know what th
e future holds, we can 
never be 

 
we're always guided by the past, the future as something, and 
there may come some opportunities that we will look at. But, right now, 
what I will say to you is, base it on what I've said, the past few years being 
an indica
tion of the future.

Mark, just to add on to the price/mix on Asia Pacific, the minus 6% was not 
a surprise to us. It was expected, and there was a lot of timing between the 
first and second quarters. If you look at the first half price/mix for Asi
a 
Pacific, we're in negative 2%, which is very much in line with what has been 
happening in Asia Pacific due to geographic mix and other channel mix 
issues. So, no surprises there.
 
Mark D. Swartzberg

Morning.
 
Dara W. Mohsenian

Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
 
So Muhtar, clearly very strong 4% pricing in North America. Can you run 
through how much of that was mix versus price, and then comment on the 
sustainability of higher pricing as you look out through th
e back half of the 
year once you cycle the higher pricing from last year? And longer term, how 
you think about any pricing? Clearly, we've seen a big improvement here 
over the last year, looks like it's worked well in terms of limited demand 
elasticity, so
me more longer term thoughts on pricing in North America?
 
Muhtar Kent 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
Yeah, thanks. I'd say look, I think, North America delivered strong second 
quarter revenue profit, value share performance, driven by better increase
d 
marketing, better marketing and a disciplined approach to both volume, 
price and mix management.
 
Few things; mix management is working in our favor, consumer is very 
much approving the smaller packages. Smaller packages are growing much 
faster than large
r packages, smaller packages have a higher NSR per liter, 
per gallon, per case; and therefore 

 
then when price driven by 

 
and the 
ability to keep the volume where it is and gain the price/mix, our historic 
best in terms of the past quarter performance in
 
the United States.
 
Why is that happening? More marketing, more focus on better marketing as 
well. So, the rate is coming through, mix from transactions and packs 
coming through, that is the general comment I'd make. And Sandy, if you 
want to provide more 
color to this?
 
J. Alexander M. Douglas, Jr. 
-
 
Executive Vice President & President, 
Coca
-
Cola North America
 
No, I absolutely agree with that, Dara. And our strategy is, as Irial and I said 
a year and a half ago, we were putting in place a strategy of build
ing strong 
valuable brands with accelerated quantity and quality of marketing, and we 
were going to take proactive opportunities to get our price in line with the 
value of the brand and to lead price up in a consistent and strategic way, 
working on the dev
elopment of packages that consumers want, in particular, 
premium packages, and the consumer is pulling very clearly to smaller 
packages, so they can enjoy the ice cold refreshing taste of one of our 
beverages, but in a portion size that they want.
 
The net 
effect, as Muhtar said, is that we have a benefit for mix, but our 
strategy as we look forward is to continue to lead. We see this strategy of 
disciplined price pack volume management underneath the brand building of 
strong powerful brand, as a long
-
term s
trategy and we continue to take 
action across our system every day to reinforce it, to grow our capability and 
to continue to grow our business in a very balanced and disciplined way.
 
Dara W. Mohsenian 
-
 
Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
 
Okay. So, it sounds like th
e way you approach pricing in North America 
going forward, you think you'll continue to see progress both from a mix and 
rate perspective, and obviously while we could see a sequential slowdown as 
you comp over this period you're pretty committed to the ef
forts longer
-
term. Is that fair?
 
J. Alexander M. Douglas, Jr. 
-
 
Executive Vice President & President, 
Coca
-
Cola North America
 
Absolutely. The strategy is very consistent and we continue to be optimistic 
about our ability to make the levers work because our
 
brands are strong and 
we're investing in them and because our bottling system is executing very 
well and we continue to get better.
 
I think one of the mantras in our team, Dara, is that we've got the right 
strategy, but we are just beginning to hit our st
ride from a capability 
standpoint and we have much more opportunity to improve than we have 
progress made so far.

Thank you. Next question is from Vivien Azer of Cowen & Co. Your line is 
o
pen.
 
Vivien Nicole Azer

Cowen & Co. LLC
 
Hi. Thank you so much for taking my question. I was going to focus on Diet 
Coke. While your total sparkling unit case volume growth was clearly 
impressive, Diet Coke continues to be challenged. And so, Sandy, 
could you 
please update us on what you're seeing in terms of North America? And 
then, Muhtar, if you could comment on any other geographies where you're 
seeing Diet present a challenge? Thank you.
 
Muhtar Kent 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
Sure, Vivien. Firstly, I'd say, the challenge is never taken for granted, but 
the challenge is broadly very much a U.S. centric one, so let me just preface 
that and then have Sandy comment on what's happening in the United 
States and also comment 

 
give yo
u some more comments on other diet 
drinks like Coke Zero performance and so forth.
 
J. Alexander M. Douglas, Jr. 
-
 
Executive Vice President & President, 
Coca
-
Cola North America
 
Sure. As we've discussed in several of these calls and in our interactions 
more 
one
-
on
-
one, the Diet and frozen parts of the food and beverage 
industry have been struggling for a number of quarters, it's getting into 
years now, as the consumer, the U.S. consumer moves really strongly to 
fresh. It's a good dietary change, actually, for
 
the country, but the impact on 
categories and particularly categories that are appealing to diet
-
oriented 
positionings has been pretty negative.
 
Inside our particular portfolio, we have brands growing and have brands 
struggling, Coke Zero, as Muhtar menti
oned, grew in the quarter. Diet Coke 
continues to struggle. Our near
-
term improvements, though, we're starting 
to see the consumer base stabilize. We have an incredible number of very 
loyal drinkers in Diet Coke that love Diet Coke, and our milestone that 
we're 
seeking to achieve soon is to level our revenue to match price and volume 
such that Diet Coke's revenue gets to flat and then starts to grow again.
 
As we look ahead, what I would tell you about Diet Coke is that we believe 
strongly in the Diet Coke f
ranchise. Diet Coke, the brand is the number one 
diet beverage in the United States and it will be for a long time to come. We 
also are looking at changes in the category. Our largest competitor is 
changing their formula and they'll be launching that in Au
gust and that'll 
create a lot of buzz in the category, some of it good, as the good science of 
the safety of non
-
nutritive sweeteners gets out in the marketplace and is 
reinforced.
 
We are looking at multiple programs to not only strengthen Diet Coke, but t
o 
offer consumers adjacent innovation in the Diet Coke franchise and we're 
excited about the long
-
term future. But, as we say around here, it's a work 
in progress and a lot more work to do, but we still are very optimistic about 
the long
-
term.

Thank you. Next question is from Bryan Spillane of Bank of America.
 
Bryan D. Spillane

Bank of America Merrill Lynch
 
Hey. Good morning, everyone.
 
Muhtar Kent 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
Hi, Bryan.
 
Brya
n D. Spillane 
-
 
Bank of America Merrill Lynch
 
Morning. So, just I had a question about geographic mix. I think you came 
up earlier that geographic mix was negative in the quarter. And is there any 
way you can outline for us if geographic mix also had a neg
ative effect on 
profit margins or profitability? I know there's a lot of moving parts in the 
P&L, but when you kind of look at it currency
-
neutral, you saw some margin 
expansion. My thought is, within that margin expansion, you actually had 
some negative g
eographic mix on margins. So, any help on that would be 
helpful.
 
And then I guess related to that, as we're modeling out the balance of this 
year and I guess it goes back to Mark Swartzberg's question about the 
Pacific region, should we continue to model i
n negative price, geographic 
price/mix into our models for Pacific in the back half of the year? Thank you.
 
Kathy N. Waller 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
 
Okay. Hi, Bryan. Yes, on the margin question, our margins were negatively 
impac
ted by currency and by structural. Obviously, there is always some 
negative geographic mix that plays into that, but if you look at our margins 
and if you look at Pacific gross margins first of all, and if you look at them on 
a comparable basis, we lost so
me margin; but then if you take out currency 
and then you take out structural, then we were at positive margins again. 
And the issue more is about gross margin, it's not so much about operating 
margin. Then on your second question, which was...
 
Bryan D. Sp
illane 
-
 
Bank of America Merrill Lynch
 
Just related to price/mix, price/mix in Pacific, should we continue to see 
negative geographic mix there?
 
Kathy N. Waller 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
 
It is normal in the Pacific to have negati
ve geographic mix, just because of 
the base of the country 

 
Japan, and then all of the emerging markets there. 
So, yeah, I would say for the remainder of the year, I would anticipate that 
we would have negative geographic mix in Pacific. Ahmet, do you wan
t to 
comment on that?
 
Ahmet C. Bozer 
-
 
Executive Vice President & President, Coca
-
Cola 
International
 
Yeah. I mean definitely not in the numbers that you've seen in the second 
quarter, but the general trend of 

 
around a couple of points of (44:11). 
However
, we do continue to aggressively implement our more balanced top 
line growth in terms of price and volume across the territory, and we are 
aiming to improve on that.
 
Bryan D. Spillane 
-
 
Bank of America Merrill Lynch
 
All right. Thank you. And if I could jus
t sneak one last one in for Sandy, if 
we're looking at smaller packs, the effect of smaller pack sizes in North 
America and just simply looking at it on transactions, I know it's kind of 
early, but is it incremental? So, if we were just measuring transacti
ons, are 
the purchases of those smaller packages, are they incremental to the base 
business? Or is it cannibalistic? Thank you.
 
Muhtar Kent 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
Yeah. Before Sandy comments on that, Bryan, let me just also say that 
also, 
in many parts of the Pacific, since your question was somewhat related to 
the Pacific and in terms of geographic mix, I think sparkling and particularly, 
Bryan, Coca
-
Cola, again with things that are happening around advertising 
and media spend and be
tter quality, is getting stronger. Whether you take 
Indonesia or whether you take Southeast Asia, whether you take China, 
sparkling is getting stronger, and momentum on sparkling is getting better.
 
And therefore, I think you're also seeing a positive shift
 
in category mix for 
us that is somewhat countered by continued geographic mix. So, I think 
there's a balance there, and I think we're happy to see that balance coming 
through.
 
I just want to mention that, that important this year, we see that balance 
begi
nning to come through 

 
more favorable balance coming through. And 
then, Sandy, if you want to talk about the smaller packages referenced?
 
J. Alexander M. Douglas, Jr. 
-
 
Executive Vice President & President, 
Coca
-
Cola North America
 
Sure. The growth in Nort
h America transactions is healthy, and that's 
coming from a number of things, but the small packages clearly are driving a 
tremendous amount of positive growth. Some of it is cannibalistic, but the 
cannibalistic nature of it accrues to higher margin; so th
e mix shift is 
positive, and then you have the incremental transaction growth that's being 
driven there.
 
And the primary reason is that the consumers want smaller packages. That's 
why they're buying more Cokes. Our marketing model is about more people 
enjo
ying more Cokes more often for a little bit more money, and that's what 
we seek to accomplish in the marketing and execution of our brands. And 
what you can see by the mid
-
teen growth of the smaller packages is, they're 
driving that transaction growth and 
transaction performance positive, so the 
net effect of it is that it's positive in net
-
net.
 
The other comment I'd make is that we have data in some of our retail 
partnerships that shows that moms, in particular, like small packs and are 
returning to the ca
tegory to use small packs as a way of giving treats to 
teenagers and others in the household, and it's a particularly positive thing, 
because moms can do that with a pack that isn't too big; whereas, for many 
years in the category, we marketed packages tha
t were too big, that were 
either wasted or over
-
consumed. Our package mix no longer does that, and 
it's one of the reasons why our growth is accelerating.

from Nik Modi of RBC Capital. Sir, your line 
is open.
 
Nik H. Modi 
-
 
RBC Capital Markets LLC
 
Yeah. Thanks for the question. So, I just wanted to go back to the bottler 
reinvestment question, and maybe, Muhtar, you can give us some 
perspective on where the 
bottling match and resourcing has been most 
significant, just so we can get an understanding of kind of where there could 
be potential leading indicators on that impact on volume growth?
 
Muhtar Kent 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
Thanks, Nik. Firstly
, I would say to you, as I mentioned in my script, in 
remarks, that we had a very successful global system meeting back in May, 
and I've seen much more improved engagement and also commitment by 
our bottling partners across the board: small, large, Asia, E
urope, Latin 
America, Eurasia and Africa, North America. So I'd say to you, it's broad
-
based; and I'd say to you that there is a great deal of excitement that is 
around our plans, particularly our reinvestment plan, and also great amount 
of commitment for 
better execution and more investment on the side of our 
bottling partners.
 
So, as I look at the pipeline of investment, I would say, I am much more 
encouraged today than I was, say, 12 months to 18 months ago. And I 
believe that that's driven by our plans 
and, basically, our belief in the future, 
and what is happening is yielding early results, and that is driving that 
engagement.
 
Nik H. Modi 
-
 
RBC Capital Markets LLC
 
And Muhtar, are we starting to see cooler placements actually hit the

t on the street? Or is this kind of bottler commitments 
on that they're going to do it at some point in the next quarter or two?
 
Muhtar Kent

Thank you. Last question i
s from Ali Dibadj of Bernstein. Your line is open. 
You may proceed with your question.
 
Ali Dibadj 
-
 
Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC
 
Hey, guys. Thanks. A couple of things I wanted to talk about, if possible. 
One is around top line and one is around asset bas
e. First on the top line, I 
think you guys have done a pretty good job explaining and playing out the 
pieces in terms of price/mix, which is great.
 
On the volume side, how would you describe the company trajectory right 
now, from a volume growth perspectiv
e? So, do you think we've seen the 
bottom, in terms of volume growth, after a series of kind of plus 1% and 
now at 2% and some easier comps going forward? So do you think we 
should be projecting kind of a turning point upward, in terms of volume 
growth for
 
the company going forward? And I'll come back with the asset 
question in a second.
 
Muhtar Kent 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
So, Ali, the algebra is volume times, price is what we generate as revenue 
and I think it's good that you ask that 
question and it's one of the important 
elements of the algebra.
 
I think we're encouraged by actions where we basically expected to be. 
We're cycling 3% and we generated 2% and I think the volatility, as I 
mentioned in Russia on the verge of a recession tod
ay, from a macro point 
of view or Brazil where there's still significant challenges in disposable 
incomes; China disposable income levels haven't improved significantly. But 
importantly, improving trends on share were an all
-
time high in many 
markets, valu
e share particularly which is very important and value share is 
driven again by the actions that we're taking.
 
So, based on your question have you seen the bottom? I'd say, we're about 
where we expected to be, and we see that what we're doing is continuing
 
to 
help keep that equation in place at an improving trend; equation being if the 
marketing wasn't there, the volume wouldn't hold up where it was and the 
price wouldn't hold up where it was. See it in that respect 

 
both being 
propped up by the investment
s that we're putting into the marketplace and 
those investments being driven by the zero
-
based work that we're 
generating.
 
Ali Dibadj 
-
 
Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC
 
Okay. Very helpful answer. On the asset side of things, if you look at 
Germany and India 
and Vietnam, (53:12) those continue to do quite well. 
Seem like they're improving.
 
In North America from discussions we've had 

 
this call, other calls 

 
it looks 
like that's getting better too. You know productivity and profits are actually 
growing finall
y. Do you think there are ways 

 
what are the hurdles given all 
those improvements for you not to be able to divest or re
-
franchise those 
assets more quickly and have a smaller asset base, which is a long
-
term 
plan even more quickly than you've laid out so
 
far?
 
Muhtar Kent 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
I think you said it, those are continuing to improve. As they improve, they 
become 

 
there's more that are getting in line for those assets and that's a 
good place to be. And I think basically we see t
hose are great markets, not 
just in our hands but in the right hands. And that's the way we see it. And I 
think that we are encouraged by the internal plans we have, and I think 
that's all I can say right now. We're in a place where, let's call it this way
, 
the fruit is getting riper.

Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. I'm here with James 
Quincey, our Chief E

reconcile certain non

I would also li
ke to note that you can find additional materials on the 
Investors section of our company website, including those that provide an 
analysis of our margin structure. In addition, this conference call may 
contain forward

looking statements, including stateme
nts concerning long

Now let me turn the call over to James.

Thanks, Tim, and good morning, everyone. So here we are halfway through 
the year, and we see good momentum in our business as we continue our 
tra
nsformation as a total beverage company. We gained global value share 
with a balanced contribution from both developed and emerging markets led 
by strong performance in our sparkling soft drink business. Organic revenue 
growth is up 6% year
-
to
-
date, includ
ing growth across all operating 
segments and with a good balance between volume and pricing. Worth 
noting, about a point of that is due to benefit of timing. The underlying 
results, though, are still ahead of plan.

anticipated 9% currency headwind resulting in 
comparable EPS growth of 3%. While currencies continued to be headwind, 
we are focused 
on achieving our full year EPS target through stronger 
performance in the underlying business.
 
Looking around the world, we delivered strong top line growth in the first 
half driven by both developed and emerging markets. In Asia Pacific, we 
grew organic r
evenue 4% during the first half of the year. Strong 
performance in emerging markets like India, Southeast Asia and China drove 
7% volume growth for the segment as we focused on underserved 
consumption occasions. This was partially offset by performance in 
Japan 
where our system continues to work through supply chain disruptions 
stemming from last year's natural disasters.
 
In addition, volume declined in Japan during the second quarter as our 
system implemented the first price increase to consumers in over 2
5 years. 
Looking ahead, we expect improving results in the back half as consumers 
adjust to the new pricing levels and we implement a robust innovation plan 
including Coke Energy and Innocent chilled juice.
 
Turning to EMEA. Here, we grew organic revenue 9%
 
year
-
to
-
date driven by 
continued growth in Europe and Turkey, improved performance in South 
Africa and the first quarter benefit from our shipment timing. Across Europe, 
revenue growth management initiatives and Zero Sugar innovations are 
creating sustain
ed momentum in the majority of our markets as shown by 
the 3% volume growth in our European sparkling soft drink portfolio. And in 
Turkey, despite the challenging macro environment, we are delivering a solid 
performance due to strong marketing and executio
n plans that are quickly 
adapting to the local conditions.
 
Turning to Latin America. Here we delivered 7% organic revenue growth 
year
-
to
-
date amidst a mixed operating environment. Brazil continues to 
deliver strong performance driven by better execution wi
thin a stable 
operating environment while Argentina continues to grapple with the 
economic crisis. Mexico's economic growth is slowing so we expect tougher 
operating conditions. However, we are adjusting our plans to ensure 
affordability, so that the busin
ess continues to grow sustainably.
 
Finally, turning to North America. Here, our results continued to mark steady 
progress driven by improved marketing and execution. Our performance was 
largely driven by consumer demand for No Sugar versions of some of our
 
best
-
known sparkling soft drink brands as well as for the smaller packages 
with less sugar. Retail sales of our No Sugar sparkling soft drink portfolio 
grew 6% in the quarter in Nielsen
-
measured channels. Strong revenue 
growth for our core sparkling soft 
drink brands continues to fuel and enable 
new innovations and investments across our expanding total beverage 
portfolio. For example, our premium water brands, smartwater and Topo 
Chico, are delivering healthy growth supported by the national launch of 
sma
rtwater antioxidant and smartwater alkaline and the ongoing strategic 
expansion of Topo Chico.
 
Across all of our markets, we are driving a platform for sustained 
performance through disciplined portfolio growth and aligned and engaged 
system and collaborat
ion with our stakeholders. Beginning with our portfolio 
growth. Here, we are making progress in operationalizing our leader, 
challenger and explorer framework consistent with the strategy we outlined 
last year. Within our leaders, the core sparkling soft d
rink business 
registered healthy volume growth of 2% year
-
to
-
date with trademark Coke 
continuing to perform very well with volume up 3% year
-
to
-
date and 4% in 
the quarter fueling our portfolio expansion. Importantly, we're seeing 
healthy household penetrat
ion growth for our sparkling soft drink portfolio.
 
Whilst also encouraging is Coke Zero Sugar is now in its third year of 
double
-
digit volume growth. Along with our focus on smaller packaging and 
premium innovation, year
-
to
-
date, we are growing trademark C
oke revenue 
faster than transactions, transactions faster than volume and reducing 
calories, what we believe is a winning strategy for the future. Our innovation 
pipeline. Our innovation pipeline for Coke Trademark expanded in April with 
the launch of Coke
 
Energy, offering the edge of a great refreshing taste and 
an inclusive brand. The energy occasion is fast growing and expanding in 
multiple spaces to satisfy more consumers. We remain fully committed to 
our partnership with Monster, and we believe there a
re opportunities to 
capture even more value in the energy category for the Coca
-
Cola system 
and to bring new drinkers into our rapidly evolving category.
 
The initial results are encouraging. In Spain, the first market where Coke 
Energy was launched, has al
ready captured 2% share of the energy category 
modern trade and it has achieved similar sales for outlet as the market 
leader with strong repeat levels that indicate good consumer acceptance. 
We're taking everything we have learned and applying these insig
hts as we 
rapidly scale Coke Energy across our system. We are currently in 14 
countries, and by the end of 2019, we expect to have Coke Energy available 
in 20 markets. Coke Energy, along with many of our other innovations, are 
being created to target speci
fic occasions and need states but in very 
different ways, particularly as we grow our challengers and explorers. For 
example, in Australia, we recently launched NutriBoost after learning from 
its success in Vietnam. NutriBoost is a nutritious milk drink wi
th zero added 
sugar that was designed for busy families looking for a mid
-
morning or 
afternoon energizing snack. With this, our focus on consumer
-
centric 
innovation, almost 25% of our revenue is now from new or reformulated 
products, up from 15% 2 years ag
o.
 
At the same time, we are taking a disciplined approach to curating our 
portfolio to ensure we have the capacity to focus on the right brands. So far, 
this year, over 275 zombie SKUs have been eliminated. We're also making 
progress on our plans to build 
a multiplatform coffee business. Since we 
finalized the Costa acquisition in January, we've been moving with speed 
across three areas: integrating Costa into our business, making sure Costa's 
existing clients are executed well and accelerating the opportun
ity to build a 
multiplatform business.
 
As we move forward on these opportunities, our focus is on accelerating 
three segments: the express vending machines, beans and machines for 
food service customers and ready
-
to
-
drink products. We've already launched 
r
eady
-
to
-
drink products in the U.K. with plans to roll out in additional 
markets in the coming months. And consistent with our other innovations, 
ready
-
to
-
drink Costa leverages a unique brand and product edge that will 
allow us to capture category growth.
 
W
e're also accelerating our plans to roll out more express machines across a 
number of markets. So far, this year, we've placed 1,200 new vending 
machines and have plans for many more by the end of the year. Finally, as 
you may have seen last week, we reach
ed an agreement with Coca
-
Cola 
Hellenic to launch Costa Coffee across a number of formats within all their 
markets over the next three years.
 
Returning to the overall view. Of course, none of this works without our 
bottling partners. Globally, our bottling
 
partners are aligned and energized 
and committed to building scale and investing into the future, and we're 
working with them to collectively raise the bar on our consistent execution. 
I've talked before about the revenue growth management initiatives, wh
ich 
are helping to drive increased velocity in our portfolio. Coupled with this has 
been a focus on expanding horizontal distribution through opening new 
outlets and placing more cold drink equipment. And we're making progress, 
especially in Asia where our
 
system opened over 750,000 new outlets so far 
this year.
 
However, gaining penetration is only part of the equation. Consistently 
measuring and managing our performance in existing outlets is the other 
part that drives sustained performance. So, we're work
ing to better leverage 
data and mobile technology in order to evolve our Right Execution Daily 
platform from a point
-
in
-
time scorecard into real
-
time integrated analytics 
capabilities that will drive faster and better
-
formed execution decisions 
across our 
system.
 
Before moving off our bottling system, let me quickly our address our plans 
in Africa. In May, we announced that we were stepping back from our plans 
to refranchise Coca
-
Cola Beverages Africa. Instead, we will hold onto the 
bottler until we move th
rough a period of political and economic change in 
the region. But to be clear, our bottling ownership philosophy hasn't 
changed. As with all our bottling investments, we will look to sell at the right 
time to the right buyer. In the meantime, we have a ne
w and energized 
leadership teams on both sides of the system, and we are already seeing 
promising results.
 
Finally, in order to deliver long
-
term, sustainable growth, we must 
collaborate with our stakeholders. One critical issue facing the world is 
plastic
 
waste. In 2018, we announced our World Without Waste goals 
through recycling, recyclable packaging and the use of recycled material. As 
noted in our earnings release, we are making progress against our goals. We 
used approximately 30% recycled material in
 
our packaging globally in 
2018. We now have 100% recycled PET bottles in the market in over half a 
dozen countries with more launches planned in 2019. And importantly, our 
system is also working to improve collection. We currently refill or collect 
equiva
lent of 58% of what we sell in the marketplace.
 
While global traction will take time given the need for infrastructure 
investments and various regulations by our market, we're actively working 
to lift and shift successful collection models such as PETCO in
 
South Africa, 
ECOCE in Mexico and Coca
-
Cola Amatil is already leading our collaboration 
to run a deposit return scheme across all of its territories in Australia. 
Ultimately, the heart of our success are our people. We've been working to 
continue to build
 
our growth culture because that is what will drive our 
performance year
-
after
-
year, moving faster, taking intelligent risks and 
learning from our mistakes. And I think this is beginning to show in our 
results.
 
So, in summary, we had a good first half of the year as evidenced by our 
solid organic growth rate. We're driving a platform for sustained 
performance through disciplined portfolio growth, an aligned and engaged 
system and collaboration with our stakeholde
rs. And the momentum in our 
business gives us confidence in our ability to achieve our full year EPS target 
and drive shareholder value.
 
Now I'll turn it over to John.
 
John Murphy
 
Thank you, James, and thanks to all of you for joining us. Before addressing
 
our performance in the quarter and our expectations for the remainder of 
the year, I'd like to start by discussing a few key areas that I believe are 
critical to the company, specifically, driving healthy top line growth, 
expanding margins across our busi
ness segments, improving cash flow and 
leveraging a disciplined capital allocation process.
 
James has talked about our revenue growth management efforts. This 
quarter, we've continued to scale our work in both Asia and Latin America. 
We're implementing bet
ter analytical tools and processes to develop 
price/pack architectures to meet evolving consumer and customer needs. 
And it's showing results, contributing to the robust organic revenue growth 
we've delivered now for the past eight quarters. Translating to
p line 
performance into sustainable margin improvement is where our ongoing 
productivity efforts and leader, challenger, explorer framework come into 
play. For the first half of the year, we delivered underlying operating margin 
improvement, a function of 
continued innovation, revenue growth 
management strategies and the effective management of our cost structure.
 
We've also advanced our efforts to improve cash flow and capital allocation. 
We're improving our working capital as evidenced by our year
-
to
-
date
 
cash 
flow increase. We're taking a close look at all assets on our balance sheet. 
For example, we're in the process of selling our building in New York and we 
recently divested our equity stake in our Peruvian bottler. And we are 
reducing the sizable cost
s related to our productivity program that were part 
of the transformation of our business. So, we're making progress, and we 
aim to do even better.
 
Turning now to our financial performance in the quarter. We delivered 
another solid quarter with broad
-
base
d organic revenue growth, underlying 
margin expansion and improving cash flow trends. Organic revenue grew 
6% with a healthy balance of price/mix and volume and a 1
-
point benefit 
from timing. Our developing and emerging markets drove strong volume 
performa
nce, which resulted in strong growth in our Bottling Investments 
Group. A continued rollout of revenue growth management initiatives across 
our developed markets resulted in good price/mix.
 
Comparable margins contracted in the second quarter due to the imp
act of 
acquisitions and currency. However, both growth and operating margins 
expanded on an underlying basis. This translated into 14% currency
-
neutral 
operating income growth, partially offset by an 8
-
point currency headwind. 
The currency impact to operat
ing income included a 2
-
point impact from 
hedging activity driven entirely by gains we are cycling from the prior year.
 
Comparable EPS grew 4% in the quarter, which was comprised of 13% 
comparable currency
-
neutral growth, partially offset by a stronger
-
tha
n
-
expected 9% currency headwind. And finally, year
-
to
-
date free cash flow 
was up $3.7 billion, up 87% due largely to strong underlying growth, 
working capital initiatives and the timing of cash taxes and capital 
expenditures. While we do not expect a simil
ar increase in the back half of 
the year, we are confident in our ability to deliver at least $6 billion in free 
cash flow.
 
Now looking at the remainder of the year. For the first half, we delivered 6% 
organic revenue growth, and as James noted, about a po
int of this came 
from the timing of shipments, which we expect to reverse in the back half. 
But after normalizing for the timing benefit, the best way to think about our 
underlying top line performance for the first half is 5%. Considering this 
strong perf
ormance, we are taking up our guidance on organic revenue to 
5% for the full year, which is translating into stronger underlying profit 
performance, and that better underlying performance is enabling us to 
maintain our full year comparable EPS guidance eve
n as currencies have 
gotten worse and structural changes are less of a benefit than we expected 
at the beginning of the year.
 
As you model the flow of the year, there's a few items to consider in terms 
of phasing due to cycling, the timing of shipments and
 
expenses, moderating 
currency headwinds and an extra day in the fourth quarter. We expect all of 
the comparable operating income growth in the back half of the year to 
occur in the fourth quarter.
 
Specific to currency in the third quarter, we expect a 6
-
p
oint currency 
impact to operating income. This includes a 3
-
point impact from hedging 
activity driven almost entirely by gains we are cycling from the prior year as 
year
-
over
-
year spot rate headwinds are softening. As we move through the 
back half of the y
ear, we expect the impact from currencies to become less 
of a headwind. Looking even further out at current spot rates and hedge 
positions, we expect a benign currency environment in 2020 compared to 
2019.
 
As always, our Investor Relations team will be hap
py to answer any 
questions as you build out your models for the year. So, in summary, we've 
had a strong first half of the year. Our strategies are driving strong 
performance in our business. Cash flow is improving, and we remain very 
focused on delivering
 
our full year EPS guidance.
 
Operator, we are now ready for questions.
 
Question
-
and
-
Answer Session
 
Operator
 
[Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Steve Powers with 
Deutsche Bank.
 
Stephen Powers
 
So, a very solid set of results today. I gues
s the question from here, 
notwithstanding some of the timing factors that may cause some movement 
in the back half, just is what makes you most confident that this momentum 
can continue, if not further improve as you look out over the next few years?
 
And p
erhaps as an underappreciated part of that story, how do you view 
improvements in your 
--
 
the current bottling footprint factoring into that 
momentum? I mean bottling clearly contributed this quarter. And I guess 
the question is that an aberration? Or do y
ou see bottling contributions as 
potentially sustainably accretive to total company top line and profit growth 
over the next couple of years?
 
James Quincey
 
Let me try and offer three thoughts, Steve. Firstly, I think we have in front 
of us a tremendous lon
g
-
term opportunity in the beverage industry. I'd refer 
you back to one of the pages we've used in one of the investor decks with 
the two bottles, the one of the developed worlds and the one of the 
developing worlds. With the developed world is a small port
ion of the world's 
population, 20% of the population of the world. Yes, there, 3/4 of what they 
drink is a commercial beverage, but we still have a relatively small share of 
that in aggregate and we're gaining share. So, there's huge opportunity for 
value 
growth in the developed world.
 
And yet in the developing part of the world, which is 80% of the world 
population, only 1/4 of what they drink evolves from commercial beverage. 
And again, our share has lots of room for expansion. So, the first point is I 
wo
uld reunderline the long
-
term opportunity for growth of commercial 
beverages in the developed and the developing markets, and that's a huge 
opportunity in front of us.
 
The second thought I would offer you is I think we're seeing not just 
momentum in the se
cond quarter or the year
-
to
-
date, and yes, leave aside 
some of the timing benefits, but what we're seeing is a sustained set of 
results over if you want to take the last four quarters and you average out 
the unit cases and you average out the price/mix of 
the last four quarters to 
just give you a year, I think you get about two in volume and about three in 
price. And if you were to do the calculation, I think you'd end up with a three 
on price with or without BIG. So, I think you're seeing sustained momentu
m 
of the core business over a 12
-
month period. And perhaps even more 
encouragingly, that is now lapping a period where we were also in the band 
we were looking for, for our long
-
term growth model of 4% to 6%. So, 
we've now got 5% in round numbers lapping 5
%. So, I think the momentum 
is now multiyear. I always encourage everyone to look at some multiquarter 
average given where we are in the supply chain and the timing effects. So 
long
-
term opportunities, and we're now building momentum that is called 
multiye
ar momentum.
 
And I think to the question of how much BIG can affect that going forward, 
yes. Look, we've clearly given the BIG team a mission to grow the top line 
and the bottom line. I think the countries that did well this quarter are 
--
 
happened to be t
he countries where we own the parts of the bottling 
operation. So that obviously 
--
 
that obviously was very helpful. But BIG is 
centered in a number of countries that have long
-
term growth prospects. 
They're largely in the bottle but is only 1/4 commercial
 
beverages. So, they 
have a lot of opportunity, and we've given them a clear mission to abandon 
the concept of the hospital ward. We should be aspiring for bottling 
operations we own to be just as good as all the other bottling operations, 
and obviously, w
e'll look to find the right owner at the right time. And 
therefore, yes, we should expect the BIG operations to do better in the 
coming years.
 
Operator
 
And our next question comes from Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley.
 
Dara Mohsenian
 
John, you 
opened up the door crack on 2020 earnings guidance with the 
benign FX comment. I know you won't give us an explicit guidance range 
today, but I guess just conceptually, besides FX, are there any big puts or 
takes we should think about for 2020 versus the t
ypical EPS growth 
algorithm you've outlined? And also, maybe perhaps you can discuss if FX 
were to worsen and become more unfavorable from the spot rates where we 
are today, are there any leverage can pull to offset that from the earnings 
growth perspectiv
e as you look out to 2020.
 
John Murphy
 
Yes. No. Thanks, Dara. It's still very early days to talk about 2020. As you 
know, there's a number of factors that go into how we'll ultimately perform 
in 2020. The global macro environment continues to be pretty vol
atile. 
There's a lot of discussions as to where interest rates will land. And in some 
of our 
--
 
the markets that are particularly important to us, places like 
Mexico, like Turkey, South Africa, Argentina, there's a lot of moving parts 
there. So, it's very 
early to talk about 2020.
 
I do think it's 
--
 
it is good to look at 2020 though in the context of currency. 
We think the dollar is at the 
--
 
towards the end of a strong cycle, and hence, 
we think that we're in for a benign environment over the next year, 1.
5 
years.
 
With respect to sort of managing the potential headwinds from currency, I 
think we're starting to connect the dots better across the world between the 
decisions that need to be taken locally to help us have a more holistic 
approach to dealing with
 
this topic because it's not going away. We 
--
 
the 
emerging markets represent almost 50% of our PBT. So, in the future, it's 
going to be a very important topic for us to address even better. So early 
days yet on that. But certainly, connecting the dots bet
ter, and as I said in 
the call, for the back half of the year, the upside on underlying operating 
performance is actually helping us to maintain our full year guidance.
 
Operator
 
And our next question comes from Bryan Spillane of Bank of America.
 
Bryan Spil
lane
 
I just wanted to dig in a little bit more on the strength in the Asia Pacific 
segment. It's been pretty good so far first half of the year. And so maybe, 
James, if you could just dig in a little bit in terms of what's driving that 
underlying performan
ce, and really what I'm after is, I guess, as we're kind 
of looking beyond this year, sort of some view of whether or not this type of 
performance is sustainable.
 
James Quincey
 
Sure. I mean clearly, we had a good quarter in Asia Pacific. I think we were 
so
mewhat helped by the kind of a later monsoon in India or the later start of 
the monsoon in India. So, I think one would be cautious in extrapolating one 
quarter into the future. But clearly, this quarter, we saw good growth in 
India, good growth in ASEAN, 
particularly in the Philippines, in Thailand, in 
Vietnam. We saw some good growth in China. Actually, that was despite 
deprioritizing some of the low
-
value water, and we're cycling the best 
quarter of last year.
 
But I think what is representative of is the
 
long
-
term continued opportunity 
for the beverage business. We basically 
--
 
most of the money comes in from 
the Americas, North and South America, Europe and Japan and Australia. 
But that's a small part of the world's population. Actually, if you take Afri
ca, 
if you take Indian subcontinent, ASEAN and China, that's the vast majority 
of the world's population, and we're only getting started. And that's where 
we're seeing good growth this quarter and we have been seeing it for a 
while. So, I think it's repres
entative of the long
-
term opportunity. I wouldn't 
say let's extrapolate this one quarter, but there's absolutely long
-
term 
opportunity in those four large population zones.
 
Operator
 
And our next question comes from Ali Dibadj with Bernstein.
 
Ali Dibadj
 
So,
 
one big controversy for investors around Coke is that as you transitioned 
from Coca
-
Cola of old to total beverage company, your margins will be 
pressured. And so, to zero in from that kind of broad controversy into the 
quarter, you provided this gross mar
gin and operating margin bridge set of 
charts. Can you just aggregate please the ""underlying green,"" i.e., positive 
bar more in terms of cost savings, one, negative sales mix, maybe 
geographic mix and price/mix, really with an idea of trying to get us 
comf
ortable with the sustainability and maybe positive momentum in 
margins. And particularly this quarter, we saw SG&A as a percent of sales 
improve, but that overall controversy remains on the margins. And then if I 
might, just a very quick clarification. You
 
mentioned Coke Energy rolling out 
to 20 countries by the end of this year. Is the U.S. on that list?
 
James Quincey
 
So, let me start. I'm not sure there's a controversy at all. I think we've been 
super clear on what we believe is happening on the operating
 
margins and I 
think, clearly, there's a couple of things happening here. And I would not all 
rotate on one quarter because of the movements of gallons and those sorts 
of things. I'll talk about the first half because that's 
--
 
I would prefer to talk 
about
 
four quarters rather than even two, but let's go in.
 
So, I think our messaging has been very clear: the mechanical changes to 
the operating income margin happened because of ins and outs, particularly 
of bottling operations given their very different cost
 
structures and the 
acquisitions, and I think that's clear on the chart. And I think what you can 
clearly see is we continue to execute against our game plan to improve 
operating margins over time. We've been tracking on that towards the target 
that we had
 
talked about, but given all the confusion, we've removed and 
had this bridge instead.
 
So ongoing improvement in operating income margin, that's been happening 
and it's happened again in the second quarter or the first half. It's clearly 
driven by the sum 
of the parts. We're getting improved pricing. Yes, some of 
those are in categories, which have higher cost of goods. But as you can see 
in the gross profit line, the gross profit basically in the first half was flat yet 
it was better in just the second qua
rter, but again, I prefer the longer time 
frame.
 
So, against the question, will expansion of new categories cause the 
compression of the gross profit margin, we had previously said yes, it might 
be a little, but it will be offset by productivity. What you'
ve seen in the first 
half is it's a wash. We've been able to drive the Coke franchise and the 
innovation and manage the portfolio such that the net impact on gross 
margin is a wash, which is a great result. And then obviously, we're getting 
some flow
-
throu
gh of our ongoing productivity efforts. Just because we 
haven't announced the new program, we are still focused on using resources 
effectively in the SG&A on the back 
--
 
in the back office and investing wisely 
with the marketing such that this operating le
verage is flowing through into 
the margin. So, I think the game plan is intact and we're continuing to drive 
against it.
 
Operator
 
And our next question comes from Judy Hong with Goldman Sachs.
 
Judy Hong
 
So, James, I guess, my question is just kind of looki
ng at the coffee and 
Energy opportunity, and you've laid out the plans for the year in entering 
some of the newer markets. I guess my question is how do you determine 
and so what's the criteria in determining which markets to enter as kind of 
the Phase 1 a
nd then over the next couple of years? And then I think Ali 
asked about a question about if the U.S. fits into that plan so if you can 
address that as well.
 
James Quincey
 
Yes. I mean just starting on the U.S., I mean we haven't 
--
 
the markets we 
haven't an
nounced yet, I mean, we're not going to announce until we're 
ready. Clearly, we're thinking about the U.S. market and when would be the 
right timing for Coke Energy. Clearly, it's a big market and a big opportunity. 
I think, ultimately, the way I would loo
k at it is we've launched in a number 
of markets and our approach is essentially to launch in markets where we 
know we have capabilities and a lot of strength and a strong Coke franchise, 
and therefore, we think would represent a robust good opportunity an
d that 
should give us an idea of what 
--
 
how well we could do. So, Spain would be 
an example of that. We have a great franchise in Spain. We have a great on
-
premise business there with the cafés and restaurants. We have strong 
relationships with the modern
 
trade and a very strong bottler. So, we know 
that if we do well there, that in strong markets, then we know what that 
would represent.
 
Then we've also launched it in some of the other emerging markets and 
some markets that our strengths are not as good as
 
the Spanish end of the 
spectrum, but it'll give us a range of learnings and experience in different 
types of environments. And that'll give us, in a way, a set of learnings on the 
1.0 of launching Coke Energy from which we can learn. And purely from a 
rol
lout perspective and a tactical perspective in something like this, it would 
probably suit us to have those learnings and have a 2.0 for the U.S., 
whatever tweaks that may be, whether it's taking the formulation tweaks 
and the graphic tweaks and the market
ing mix tweaks and the execution 
approach, because it's all about accelerating the learning cycle and driving 
that forward.
 
So that will be the conceptual approach on how we want to get it done. And 
that's kind of will be true, whether it's Coke 
Energy or Coke with coffee. 
Every time we've done it, we've tried to make sure we learn from the cycle 
of the 1.0 or 2.0 before we go to the next set of countries. Obviously, that 
means you need to go back at some point to the initial countries to bring 
th
em up to the latest thinking on what can be done.
 
And similarly, for coffee, there, of course, we're looking at which of the 
formats best establishes the brand and can work. And clearly, we think that 
rolling out with the express vending machines and being
 
a kind of a beans
-
and
-
machines beverage partner to the restaurants and cafés and the kind of 
immediate consumption channels is the way to a kind of drive the brand 
forward. And ready
-
to
-
drink coffee will play a part of that but not necessarily 
be the firs
t piece.

And our next question comes from Nik Modi with RBC.
 
Nik Modi
 
James, I was hoping you can just give us some context on the U.S. market. 
Obviously, the sparkling business is doing quite well. But maybe you could 
just talk about the still po
rtfolio. I understand there's some kind of gaps and 
weakness in that portfolio when it comes to the DASANI, POWERADE, Gold 
Peak. So maybe you can just kind of talk about those brands and kind of 
what the plans are there to get them back in the right direct
ion.
 
James Quincey
 
Sure. I mean, I think, again, I'll talk more about the first half than the 
second quarter because, of course, you get things bouncing around in the 
short term. I think on the side where there's more work to be done, the 
water brands, the
 
mainstream water brands like DASANI we're under 
pressure a bit so far this year as much as anything due to the expansion of 
retailer private labels and particularly in the larger formats of number of 
bottles in a case. So, there's some challenge there.
 
Th
e flip side of that is we continue to do really well with the premium water 
brands. So, Topo Chico continued its fantastic growth wave, smartwater 
continued to grow. So, I think you see a diverging set of performance in the 
water market between the mainstr
eam and the premium water brands.
 
POWERADE, again a bit of Tale of Two Cities. POWERADE, the main brand, 
has not had a good start to the year, faced some executional issues yet 
POWERADE Zero's growing, and I know the BODYARMOR is doing well in the 
Coke sys

category.
 
In terms of juice, again, it's a bit of a repeat. Minute Maid was flat, slightly 
soft, but we did really well in some of the new launches. And Simply was 
growing nicely. So again, I th
ink you see a bit of that contrast between some 
of the mainstream, in this case, more flattish or slightly negative and 
growing in the premium, especially off Simply and the smoothie. So, I think 
you see a little of a dichotomy going on there.
 
And I think 
it's worth talking about the second half. We really got a good 
program going into the back half of the year, a lot of focus on media and 
experiential sampling on some of those still categories whether it's 
smartwater or POWERADE or Gold Peak and some agree
d commercial 
activities with specific customers and market blitzes on merchandising as to 
kind of bring those back around. So, I think we'll see a lot of attention and 
focus on reverting some of those trends going into the back half of the year.
 
Operator
 
A
nd our next question comes from Caroline Levy with Macquarie.
 
Caroline Levy
 
James, it would be really helpful if you could sort of walk us around the 
world. You did mention a bit of softness in Mexico if I'm not mistaken, and 
you said Brazil was stable eve
n though you did better. And if you just looked 
at the state of consumer and the friendliness towards U.S. companies with 
China specifically being part of that question, could you just talk to us a little 
bit about how you see that around the globe? What's
 
getting significantly 
better? And if anything's deteriorating? Is the Middle East getting worse, for 
example?
 
James Quincey
 
So just going back to 
--
 
starting in Latin America where you mentioned 
--
 
the Mexico that I mentioned, the little softness in the e
conomy, Mexico, we 
still grew volume in the second quarter slightly, but we still grew volume in 
the second quarter in Mexico. So, I think it's more of a generalized concern 
of the environment. Brazil obviously did well. The Argentinian business 
suffered a
gain in the second quarter. I think there's a clear macroeconomic 
environment. We're very focused on what we can do in terms of affordability 
and execution, but you can't completely outrun a macro crisis. So, we're 
definitely seeing some of that. So, Argen
tina was very weak.
 
Middle East, yes, that was negative. Clearly, there's some struggle there 
across the Middle East and that was negative in the quarter. But then once 
you get out of that, I think it's a bit kind of the theme of the year, which is 
the clo
uds on the horizon don't quite arrive with the storm or the storm 
doesn't arrive. So yes, when you read the reports and look at the forecasts 
and listen to the news, you would conclude that things are worse. But there 
seems to be some calm underneath of th
at and I think that's what we're 
seeing. As we've executed against our plan, the macros have not been as 
bad perhaps as one had feared and that has allowed us to deliver strong 
operational results, and I think Asia Pacific is one of the examples of that 
wh
ere we continue to do well across a broad number of countries on the 
basis of great plans.
 
Operator
 
And our next question comes from Kevin Grundy with Jefferies.
 
Kevin Grundy
 
Congratulations on strong first half results. James, a question on North 
America.
 
So broadly, three consecutive quarters where volumes have been 
negative but not very consistent with the industry with pricing that's been 
put into place. But I guess the other key topic, of course, is that your key 
competitors ramped investment spending 
that started last year. This is 
continuing behind key brands like Pepsi and Mountain Dew and Gatorade. 
Arguably, to some degree, the strategic changes that they're making in 
North America will really be sort of a key watch point for investors whether 
this 
turnaround is, indeed, going to be successful. So broadly, if you could 
discuss sort of the competitive environment. And then the second part of 
that, whether you're comfortable with current investment levels in your 
portfolio going forward.
 
James Quincey
 
Yes. I mean, firstly, I think I would say that if competitors are investing in 
the category behind branding and rational pricing and trying to create value, 
that is ultimately good news. Yes, it means we have to be on the top of our 
game, but it's better t
o be in an industry where there's more consumer 
demand being created than not. So, I think that's a very important starting 
point that we think will be beneficial ultimately to the total beverage 
business in the U.S.
 
In terms of the volume, I mean, the vol
ume was slightly negative in the U.S. 
I think it's important to remember what we're trying to do in the U.S. 
business. We're focused on building the consumer engagement, and so a lot 
of what we've done, particularly in some of the sparkling brands, is have
 
a 
focus on some of the smaller packages and drive for transaction growth even 
if that means the volume's flat. We'd love a little bit of positive. But if it's a 
little bit of negative, that hasn't concerned us because we think we can 
stabilize the volume 
in the long term and have the value be created 
ultimately through the price/mix. So, more price versus volume. Obviously, 
like to see volume a little bit positive in the case of the U.S., but really 
sticking with the strategy of driving the consumer intera
ctions, heavy lean 
on smaller packages. Of course, the portfolio piece that goes with that is 
some of the Zero Sugars and the reformulation.
 
I think that's what you see turning into the strong revenue growth rates 
from North America. So, you're seeing Nort
h America do consistently over 
time well in terms of revenue growth, and they're gaining market share 
across a broad swathe of categories from sparkling to a number of the still 
categories.
 
So, we think it's a strategy that's working for us. We think the i
nvestment 
levels are good for what we're seeing at the moment. Of course, we 
constantly review all aspects of the business mix and the variables we 
control as well especially, and we will go up or down as we believe to be 
appropriate and necessary.

And our next question comes from Sean King with UBS.
 
Sean King
 
A question about the expanded launch of alcoholic beverages in Japan. While 
I recognize there might be market
-
specific competitor or maybe 
demographic considerations, why not look to o
ther markets besides Japan?
 
James Quincey
 
Well, clearly, this one evades a very Japanese logic we talked about when it 
launched regionally. The competitive set, we can face a set of local 
competitors in Japan, which operate in a multicategory, not just sof
t drinks 
and sparkling and stills, but wine, beer and spirits going to the same 
customers, and in the case of the Lemon
-
Do, competing for an occasion and 
a consumer which heavily overlaps here. So, there's a lot of logic in the 
context of the Japanese busi
ness and what you're seeing is a horizontal 
distribution expansion in the Japanese business, still very small in the 
context even our business in Japan.
 
The logic of taking it elsewhere has not been clear for The Coca
-
Cola 
Company. Of course, historically,
 
our bottlers have carried beer or been 
brewers so that in parts of the world where there's some distribution logic 
that it has been 
--
 
there have been relationships with our bottling partners. 
But the Japanese 
--
 
example where we own the brand is the Japa
nese 
example, and anything else would need to be considered very carefully and 
the business logic would be very clear for why we should do something 
different.
 
Operator
 
[Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from Bonnie Herzog with 
Wells Fargo.
 
B
onnie Herzog
 
All right. I actually wanted to circle back to your full year guidance. 
Obviously, your results so far this year were better than you originally 
expected given that you increased your top line guidance. So, could you 
maybe highlight or summari
ze for us the main drivers of this or essentially 
what was an upside surprise from your perspective? And then on the second 
half, comps are still tough, but could you highlight why you expect your 
organic sales to grow a point or two? Are you just being co
nservative with 
your outlook for the back half?
 
James Quincey
 
Sure. Look, the story I think ultimately follows the trajectory. We had, have 
and still have going forward a clear strategy with a strong view on what we 
need to do to capture the opportunity ah
ead of us, and we started executing 
that a number of years ago. And we were getting momentum and 
--
 
we 
were getting momentum coming out of '17. We had good result, top line 
momentum in '18.
 
We did at the beginning of this year like our plans still, but see
 
the macro 
clouds on the horizon and we're a little more cautious in our guidance in 
February from a top line point of view. The clouds, as we've talked about, 
are still there, but the storm never arrived. And so, we did better in the first 
half. I mean, u
ltimately, it's a result of executing the right plans and the 
right place and the headwinds not being there.
 
So, where have we seen the benefit? I think we've seen the benefit across a 
whole series of places doing that a little bit better, whether it's Asi
a Pacific or 
some of the parts of Europe and Africa. So, I think it's the flow
-
through of 
execution, but it just wasn't one place. As I talked about on the first 
question, I really do think of the first half more as a 5 than a 6 and there are 
lots of ways 
of getting at that answer whether you like the simple rule of 
thumb or just taking the average of the unit cases and the average of the 
price/mix and that gets you five, whether it's two quarters or four quarters 
or you can get into the minutia or the deta
il on the timing of the Brexit, 
gallons and all this sort of stuff. But ultimately, you come to the simple 
headline answer that it's basically a 5, and it's a 5 cycling other growth 
rates. So, there's really good momentum there.
 
And then when you count the
 
second half, the clouds are still there. The 
storm hasn't arrived. We have great plans. We have a strategy and a 
bottling system with momentum. And so, we think we can see our way 
through to delivering an underlying five in the second half. Of course, if 
those timing elements reversed, the reported numbers are going to be 
slightly softer than that in the second half. But that won't detract from the 
ultimate conclusion that it's a system that's creating momentum around five 
with a plan that's working.

And our next question comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays.
 
Lauren Lieberman
 
Great. I was hoping you could talk a little bit more about Japan because in 
the commentary so far that you've offered on Asia, you really highlighted 
developing and emerg
ing markets. And I think there were supply chain 
issues in Japan last year that we would have been cycling through. So, if you 
can just run through kind of what's doing in Japan and why that wasn't 
called out as being a stronger contributor.
 
James Quincey
 
Sure. No, Japan was a detractor there in this quarter and for some very 
specific reasons. Firstly, in the natural disasters last year, one of our 
important bottling 
--
 
one of the important manufacturing facilities of our 
bottle was knocked out completely l
ast year. So, we lost capacity just as we 
were starting to grow in the Japanese business, and they're working very 
hard to install new capacity. They're doing a great job in doing it, but one 
cannot defeat the laws of physics. And so that's going to be bro
ught online 
over the course of this year, and that has produced a constraint on the 
business this year.
 
The second reason, which is super important, is we have taken a pretty 
broad price increase in Japan in April, the first one in a couple of decades. 
So 
that's a big deal. And whilst our competitors did not follow us 
immediately, they did follow us by the end of the quarter. So of course, 
there was 
--
 
the price of leadership in those circumstances is we suffered a 
little bit of a volume hit in the second q
uarter. But of course, as they've gone 
up, too, we think that, that will normalize. And in the context of capacity 
constraint, we deprioritized some of the lower
-
margin water volume.
 
So, some very specific reasons in Japan, but we are focused on making the
 
right decisions to invest and drive the brand going into the future. We've got 
some improving trends in the vending channel. We've got some product 
innovation and some packaging and pricing stuff 
--
 
more stuff coming 
through with the digital platform as w
ell. So, we think that these decisions 
will allow us to start to really get some better results in Japan as the 
production comes back on track 
--
 
production capacity comes back on track 
as we go into the second half of the year.
 
So, we see it more as 
--
 
mu
ch more as a point in time, but we believe it was 
what was needed to be done given the natural disasters and it's the right 
decisions in terms of setting the business up for the future.

And our next question comes from Bill Chappell with 
SunTrust.
 
Grant O'Brien
 
This is actually Grant on for Bill. Just want to touch on free cash flow a little 
bit. Obviously, you guys are focused on it a little bit more. I understand 
some of that is timing year
-
to
-
date. But just wondering on some of the 
changes you guys have made a
nd maybe some of the initiatives in place 
going forward to improve free cash flow conversion and kind of room to run 
on that.
 
John Murphy
 
Thanks. Yes, this is a key area of focus and we've talked about it over the 
last few months as being such, and there's
 
a number of elements to 
improving our position as we go forward. One is in the area of working 
capital. We know that we can do better. We know we have opportunity to 
--
 
between where we sit today and where best
-
in
-
class is. And in this quarter, 
we made si
gnificant strides with 
--
 
in the payables arena, we've delivered 
almost $600 million of benefits to our working capital number in the quarter.
 
A second area that we've talked about is reducing the amount of onetime 
cash outflows that have been a key part o
f the transformation work, 
particularly with the refranchising in North America. That number is going to 
decline as we move forward and we saw a little bit of that impacting us in 
--
 
favorably in the second quarter.
 
And the third area then would be to get 
our CapEx, capital expenditures, in 
line with what we think the run rate should be going forward. That's going to 
take a little bit longer given the fact that we have taken back for the time 
being the Philippines and South Africa. And so, in the second qua
rter, in 
addition to the working capital improvements, the benefits from timing of 
cash tax payments in 2018, we did not have them this year. And our capital 
expenditure flow for the year is weighted more in the back half.
 
So good progress on working capit
al, some timing benefits in the quarter. 
But as we look to the second half of the year, we are very confident that 
we'll deliver the free cash flow guidance that we've given.

Ka
umil Gajrawala
 
Well done this quarter, everybody. I guess first on two things. One on Coke 
Energy now that it's been in the market for a little bit. Can you give us some 
context on source of volume? Is it really coming from Red Bull as I think you 
guys hav
e mentioned? And then is any of the growth coming from outside of 
Energy? And then the second question, John, I don't remember your words 
exactly, but I believe you said you felt the dollars coming to the end of a 
strong cycle, and I'm just curious if ther
e's something you're seeing that you 
could provide to help us kind of understand that comment.
 
John Murphy
 
Sure. Let me start with the second point. When you take a step back and 
you look at dollar cycles over the last 20 or 30 years, the current cycle is 
the 
longest one we've had, number one. And when you look at the 
--
 
both the 
macro indicators over the next 12 to 24 months plus some of the political 
commentary that has been in play around the world, it does point to us 
being at the high end of dollar str
ength. And hence, my comments on the 
environment as we look at it today based on both spot rates and the outlook 
that we see through a number of lenses to be a benign environment in 2020.

Muhtar Kent
 
Thank you, Tim and good morning everyone. First apologizes that for the 
stat of my voice I have a cold, so please bear with me. I'm going to start 
with some highlights from our first quarter performance and then review the 
progress we've m
ade against our 5 strategic actions, we laid out last 
October to reignite growth.
 
Finally, I will touch on our outlook for the remainder of the year, before I 
turn the call over to Cathy. To take you through more details on the financial 
results. Let me be
gin by saying that I'm pleased to report early momentum 
in the beginning of 2015, a year of transition for the company. We delivered 
promising first quarter results, especially in light of the significant 
macroeconomic volatility in many regions around the
 
world and the 
productivity and rewiring initiatives we are implementing this year.
 
For those of you following our Webcast, you can see our quarterly 
performance scorecard on Slide 4. Our performance was largely driven by 
the strength of our global brand p
ortfolio and the strong distribution 
capabilities of our bottling partners as evidence by our continued global 
value share gains and NARTB, sparkling beverages as well as still beverages 
in the quarter.
 
While certain markets face significant currency deval
uation economic 
slowdown or political unrest, our focus on improving our execution enabled 
us to deliver overall solid results. We grew our top line and bottom line due 
to initially improvements in the underlying business, the timing of Easter and 
six extr
a days in our fiscal quarter. Importantly, net revenues grew 8% on 
an organic basis driven by the extra selling days and positive 3% price mix 

price mix and the 2% price mix in N
orth America both ahead of full year 
2014 results. This price mix is the result of disciplined implementation of our 
price back channel strategies which is a key and consistent portion of our 
long term approach to creating value for consumers, customers, b
ottlers and 
ourselves.
 
Productivity initiatives, [benign] commodity cost and favorable product mix 
in key markets grew gross and operating margin improvement. As we 
continue to invest substantially behind advertising leading to double
-
digit 
increase in mar
keting spend. The bottom line result was double
-
digit growth 
in comparable currency neutral income before tax.
 
Now turning to the five strategic actions we laid out for this year. One of our 
key strategic initiatives is making disciplined brand and growth 
investments. 
As mentioned earlier we increased our media investments double
-
digits in 
the quarter as we work towards fully funded brand plan in markets around 
the world while at the same time enhancing the quality of our advertising. 
Great example of this 
is the new Coca
-
Cola marketing campaign during the 
Chinese New Year which helped our China business grow brand Coca
-
Cola 
volume 9% despite slowing economic conditions.
 

realize their ful
l value. So while we are seeing initial positive results, we 
even more encouraged by the knowledge that is still early in the process and 
we have tremendous runway for continued improvement in our top
-
line 
growth. We remain resolutely focused on driving co
st out of the business 
and embedding a culture of productivity into our DNA which is enabling us to 
fund our brand and growth investments. This change in culture is reflected in 
incorporating zero base work processes into all phases of our annual 
planning 
cycles. We remained on track across all spend areas to deliver 
more than $0.5 billion in savings this year and 3 billion in annualized savings 
by 2019.
 
The difficult, but necessary changes made during the end of 2014 are now 
accounted for in our budgets an
d tied to our objectives and goals. The initial 
implementation of our new operating model is on track and the previously 
announced headcount reductions associated with this change are well 

 

layer in many of our functions at the group levels in different geographies 
and linked our corporate center directly to our business units.
 
In R&D this means connecting our corpor
ate R&D efforts directly to our 
global development centers and linking both of these to service our business 
across 
--
 
business units across the world. So this allows us to scale our 
efforts in innovation, share new developments faster and accelerate 
devel
opment of new products.
 

clusters to drive speed, to drive efficiency and effectiveness. This will allow 
us to better leverage learnings from similar markets regardless of the 
geogr
aphic location and improve the quality of our advertising through our 
networked marketing model. Great example of this is how we are 
strategically leveraging the 100th anniversary of our Contour Coca
-
Cola 
bottle to drive our business forward through integr
ating marketing, 
commercial and innovation under one umbrella to reach approximately 140 
markets.
 
This campaign centers of the magic of drinking a coke with the emphasis on 

profitable
 
immediate consumption packages and purchase transactions. And 
as part of this campaign our system is investing in glass bottles all around 
the world while introducing the next generation Contour PET bottle and 
expanding the supply of our premium aluminum 
bottles in key developed 
markets.
 

networked marketing that has led to the creation of 20 marketing assets 
that markets can use leverage in more cost effective modular manner. Some 
of our markets will leverage the campaign throughout the year while others 
quarter
-
by
-
quarter. As a result we have significantly been able to reduce our 
production and development cost per gross rating point allowing more 
dollars to be focused against the 
consumer.
 
We're seeing initial positive results for the marketing that have already 
launched the campaigns such as South Africa, Australia and Latin Center. 
Across the entire company our deeper markets segmentation strategy is also 
starting to yield early 
results. Two examples are North America and India 
here. In North America we're focused on generating revenue through a 
greater reliance on price realization, increased media investments coupled 
with our segmented price pack strategies drove revenue growth 
in our 
sparking portfolio through a strong 3% price mix and a 1% increase in 
transactions. Simply put more consumers are enjoying our products more 
often and are increasingly choosing smaller packages including our iconic 
Contour bottle.
 
Where as in India 
where our revenue growth strategy is focused on 
expanding distribution and recruiting new consumers we drove double
-
digit 
unit case volume growth in both our sparkling as well as still portfolio. 
Turning to our focus on our core business model we continue 
to make 
progress on our North America refranchising efforts in the quarter. First, we 
remain on track with our previously announced territory transfers to existing 
partners. During the quarter we transitioned four territories to Coco
-
Cola 
consolidated and 
are on track to transfer additional territories in Kentucky 
and Tennessee to consolidated and current Coco
-
Cola client this year.
 
We are slightly ahead of schedule to close the previously announced 
transactions with new entrance into our bottling network. 
So territory 
transfers to both Troy Taylor in Central Florida and Reyes Holdings in 
Chicago are slated to close in the second quarter. Together the territories 
pending to transition to these two new partners will represent approximately 
5% of U.S. bottle
\
c
an volume.
 
Finally, just this morning we announced the signing of new letters of intent 
with the existing bottling partners for territories covering more than 5% of 
bottle
\
can volume. In aggregate territories transitioned to date and those 
covered by defin
itive agreements or letters of intent represent the little over 
15% of total U.S. bottle
\
can volume. Further as we continue to transition 
territories with are getting better and faster, which is why we are confident 
that our previously stated time line to 
have two thirds of bottle
\
can volume 
distributed by our independent bottling partners by 2017 is very much on 
track.
 
Looking outside of North America, we closed our joint venture in Coco Cola 
Amatil, Indonesia in early April. I was in Jakarta 
earlier this year with the 
Indonesian bottler to celebrate this new venture. This investment will help 
us capture the growth opportunity in one of the largest and most dynamic 
countries in the world as we enable our system to be even more responsive 
to con
sumer and customer needs.
 
So, we are off to a solid start in 2015 and we are on track to deliver against 
our full year of currency neutral EPS expectation of mid
-
single digit growth. 
Importantly, I'm encouraged by the progress we have made and we remain 
co
nfident that we have the right strategies in place to create sustainable 
shareholder value.
 
However there is still much work ahead of us, we continue to expect that the 
benefits from the announce initiatives will take time to fully materialize. 
Further we 
are operating in a very challenging environment, the cautious 
recovery in the U.S. is offset by our relatively sluggish expansion in Europe 
and Japan as well as weaknesses in emerging markets, notably Brazil and 
Russia, as well as China slowing down. There
fore we remain cautious in our 
outlook, so we will continue to focus on what we can control and execute 
against our strategic initiatives to emerge stronger and better positioned to 
capture growth in the global nonalcoholic beverage industry.
 
I would now p
ass the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Kathy Waller, 
who will provide you with a more detailed look at our financial performance 
as well as update on our outlook on our business for 2015.
 
Kathy Waller
 
Thank you, Muhtar. And good morning everyone
. As I'm going to spend few 
minutes discussing the quarter and then our outlook for 2015 as Muhtar just 
stated. Overall, we are pleased with our performance in the quarter and 
encouraged by some of the early signs of success. Our positive pricing 
continues
 
as we focus on driving revenue in the marketplace and our 
reinvestment in brand Coco Cola is staring to yield results.
 
Focusing on the quarter, organic revenue growth was driven by 5% growth 
in concentrate shipment and 3 points to positive price mix. The 
concentrate 
shipment growth benefitted from the six extra days in the period. These 
extra days will reverse in the fourth quarter so you will see a corresponding 
impact in that period. After adjusting for the six extra days in this quarter 
concentrate ship
ments lag in many cases primarily due to the timing of 
shipments in our international markets. For the full year we expect 
concentrate shipments to be generally in line with unit cases.
 
Consolidated price mix in the quarter was driven by positive pricing a
nd 
product mix initiatives across many of our markets. In addition, we benefited 
from positive geographic mix as markets where shipments lagged recorded 
unit cases were in lower revenue per CSE market. As we move through the 

a couple of points.
 
First we will begin to cycle better underlying pricing and second as we catch 
up from the timing up of shipments in international markets we will see 
negative pressure from geographic mix at the consolidated levels. Therefore 
while we r
emain resolutely focused on driving revenue in our market we do 
expect price mix to moderate from the current level. Our comparable growth 
margins improved about 75 basis points on a consolidated basis. This 
increase is driven primarily by better margins i
n North America due to 
positive pricing and business mix as well as moderately lower commodity 
cost.
 
As we think about the remainder of the year we will also expect many of 
these drivers to moderate as we begin to cycle more difficult comparison. 
Therefore
 
our full year outlook on gross margins has not changed from our 
prior guidance.
 
Comparable currency neutral operating leverage came in better than 
anticipated in the quarter primarily due the strong growth in gross profit 
driven by the facts I just mentio
ned. Comparable currency neutral income 
before tax grew 13%. The combined impact of structural items and the 
provision in Venezuela resulted in a three point headwind on income before 
tax which was consistent with our previous outlook.
 
Our first quarter co
mparable EPS was $0.48 which included a six point 
currency headwind. On a comparable currency neutral basis our EPS grew 
15% in the quarter. The six point currency headwind was slightly less than 
our original expectations primarily due to the benefit from 
foreign exchange 
gains associated with the euros denominated debt issued during the quarter.
 
Items impacting comparability in the quarter were primarily related to the 
early extinguishment of certain long
-
term debt, cost associated with our 
previously anno
unced $3 billion productivity program and charges related to 
our Venezuelan operations.
 
As many of you know the Venezuela government introduced a new floating 
exchange rate mechanism call SIMADI in mid
-
February. We re
-
measured our 
bolívar
-
denominated net m
onitory asset at the end of the first quarter using 
the new SIMADI floating exchange rate of approximately 193 bolívar to the 
dollar and translated our Venezuelan subsidiaries local currency income 
statement into U.S. dollars using that same rate.
 
We gener
ated $1.1 billion in free cash flow, up 72% primarily due to the 
efficient management of working capital, the impact of six additional days 

unfavorable impact from currency exchange rate
.
 
We returned $1.8 billion to shareholder in the form of dividend and net share 
repurchases during the quarter which is reflective of our commitment to 
return cash to shareowners.
 

w

a country. Turning to outlook, while we are encouraged by some of the early 
signs of success it is still early in the year and global economic growth 
remains constrained by challen
ges in many markets as evidenced in regions 
like Brazil, Russia and China. Therefore we are maintaining our underlying 
full year currency neutral growth expectations as previously provided. 
However we are updating expected impacts from structural items and
 
currency.
 
During our last call we said we expected the transaction with Monster 
Beverage Corporation to close in early Q2. We now expect closing to happen 
in later half of the second quarter as the parties are working to satisfy 
contractual closing consid
erations. However distribution of Monster products 
in the U.S. has already began transition into the KO system.
 
Finally, we are slightly ahead of schedule on close in the U.S. territory 
transfer to Troy Taylor and Reyes Holdings. We now estimate that the n
et 
impact of structural items on full year 2015 results will be a slight headwind 
our net revenue growth with no material change to our prior outlook on 
income before tax.
 
Therefore consistent with what we said in February for the full year 2015 we 
continu
e to expect mid
-
single digit comparable currency neutral EPS growth. 
However, we do see a slight change in the impact from currency exchange 
rates.
 
After considering our hedge positions, current spot rates and the cycling of 
our prior year rates we now exp
ect an approximately six point currency 
headwind on net revenue and approximate 10 point currency headwind on 
operating income and approximate seven point headwind on income before 
tax for the full year 2015. The currency impact on income before tax 
remain
s roughly the same as our previous outlook. As the foreign exchange 
gains associated with our euro denominated debt issued this quarter is offset 
by the effects from translating our bolivar
-
denominated profit as the SIMADI 
exchange rate as well as the cont
inued decline in several emerging and 
developing market currencies.
 
So when modeling the second quarter there are couple of phasing items you 
should consider. The timing of Easter benefitted the first quarter this year, 
while it benefitted the second quart
er of last year. We expect structural 
items to be roughly neutral impact on net revenue and a 1 point to 2 point 
headwinds of income before tax. And then finally, we currently expect 
currency would be an approximate 7 point headwind on net revenue and an 
a
pproximate 10 point headwind on operating income and a 5 point to 6 point 
headwind on income before tax in the second quarter as we cycle most 
favorable rates from the prior year. The variance between the currency 
headwind and operating income and net inco
me before tax is primarily due 
to that foreign exchange gains associated with our euro debt.
 
In closing we are cautiously optimistic about the progress we see in the 
business, which gives us increased confidence that our strategies and 
actions of working. 
With that said it is still early days in a transition year as 
we implement significant change in our company and amid a volatile and 
challenging operating environment. But we absolutely believe that the Coco 
Cola company is best position to capture growth 
in nonalcoholic beverages 
and to continue to deliver long term value to our shareholders.
 
Operator we are now ready for questions.
 
Question

and

Answer Session
 
Operator
 
Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Bryan 
Spillane of Bank 
of America.
 
Bryan Spillane
 
So, just I guess as we look at this quarter it just seem like some of the 
things that you laid out at the beginning of the year that were within your 
control have tracked inline maybe even a little bit better than expected, 
sounds like the refranchising an

faster, closing the Monster transaction is taking a little bit longer and it 
sounds like you are sort of tracking pretty well in terms of cost savings and 
redeploying or spending more on marketing.
 
I guess when we th
ink about the factors that are outside of your control 
which would be I guess some of the macro factors, the change in the 
Venezuela exchange rates, how some of the markets are moving and not 
sure if you have a great sense for maybe what's worse or what's 
better, so if 
you can maybe just sort of lay out for us versus where you were earlier this 
year when you initially gave us guidance in kind of what's better and what's 
worth, specially focusing on some of the things that are outside of your 
control?
 
Muhtar
 
Kent
 

start with North America. I would say that the outlook appears to be 
trending a little positive, raising hopes that potential ways growth and lower 
fuel prices could translate 
into consumer spending. In Latin America, 
Mexico's the best way I would say is relatively stable and continues to track 
closer to the Unites States because they are so closely linked.
 
Brazil continues to deteriorate faster than we expected, I would say tha
t. 
Venezuela continues to increase as a concern given to increase 
--
 
the 
growing difficulty on maintaining supply in the market place. And Argentina 
just continues to be challenging and Columbia is again as the kind of the star 
in Latin America in terms of
 
performance and macro conditions. So in Europe 
I think there are also some green shoots on the back of [indiscernible], but 
its early days, that just started.
 
But deflation still remains a concerned this year and overall consumer 
spending in Europe I woul
d say is still sluggish as it will take time for I think 
monitory easing to flow to the consumer pockets and translate into 
increased consumer spending. And then risk to recover remains a still 
volatile environment and then off course you got the possible 
Greece exit 
issue still lingering on. In Eurasia and Africa, Russia continues to see 
significant challenges, the Russian consumer and we expected it to continue 
to remain challenging throughout the year this year.
 
[Sub
-
Saharan] in Africa is a strong bright
 
spot and we're seeing that in our 
results and then Middle
-
East we've got some pockets where it's defined 
geopolitical environment, but overall obviously increased geopolitical risk 
there. And then in Asia and Pacific
-

--
 
the disposal 
i
ncomes, consumer spending, CFE in China continues to decelerate we saw 
that happening in Q1 versus the stated GDP of 7%, Japan remains sluggish 
I'd say similar to Europe although we are starting to see some green shoots 
in the economy and finally in Asia
-
P
acific India continues to be a bright spot 

 
So, though that's a sort of walk through in terms of 
--
 
and then the 
commodity environment again talking about what we can control and what 

ains fairly benign, compared to previous years, stable and 
benign. And so given that value growth for us is highly correlated to PCE 


stable.
 
Bryan Spillane
 

long, your voice is definitely under some pressure this morning. Kathy, if I 
can just 
--
 
one follow up on the commodity piece, the comparisons were 
little bi
t better in the first quarter, just looking forward is there anything that 
we should be looking at that could make it maybe more favorable as the 
year goes on? Like how much of it is locked in I guess and how much of it 
might move based on commodity moveme
nts? Thank you.
 
Kathy Waller
 
As Muhtar just said commodities are for us will be benign this year, as we 
have worked in this quarter [indiscernible] recycling higher prices a little and 
back half 
--
 
in the first half of last year and thinking about somethin
g like oil, 

basically are not going to see specific benefits there because 
--
 
and they are 
going to be basically benign.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Next question is John Faucher of JP Morga
n.
 
John Faucher
 
Thank you. I wanted to follow up on two questions related with the price mix 
number which is I guess one, if we look at the gallon variances you 
mentioned it skews a little bit more towards high revenue per case. So can 
you give us an idea 
in the quarter in terms of how much of that benefit in 

the balance of the year? And then going back to some of the comments that 
you guys made I think back in December about sort of a d
ifferent global 
pricing strategy in terms of really trying to find the right balance region
-
by
-
region, can you talk about the outlook for pricing in Europe, it was obviously 

some 
opportunities going forward. So what sort of the medium to longer 
term view on pricing in Europe? Thanks.
 
Kathy Waller
 

cases definitely when you mix the [adjustment] for days, ga
llons are behind 
cases and we got real moderate and 
--
 
but that will be based on as you just 
say that is what we see in the first quarter is the high revenue for CSE and 
so we did benefit from positive geographic mix, in our price mix. That will 
moderate a
nd we will start to see when that catches up. More of the 
geographies that provide a lower revenue per CSE coming through which will 

balance of the year.
 
And I think the second pa
rt of your question on the outlook of pricing, Sandy 
do you want to talk about it all in the North America price range specifically?
 
Sandy Douglas
 
Sure Kathy. Good morning John. The North America pricing situation is really 
the continuation of the strategi

year and half. Irial and I talked about this I think six quarters ago that we 
were going to focus our business on the sustaining strategy of disciplined 
price, combine mix to maximize revenue. With an emphasis 
on price as a 

what we continue to plan to do with a lot of discipline and focus.
 
As you look at the first quarter if you look at each business by themselves, 
we met our pricing object
ives in the first quarter. We saw a little bit faster 
growth in our fountain business which created a little bit of negative 
business mix, but net
-
to
-
net the year started according to plan and we see 
the outlook as being rational and our strategy remains v
ery consistent.
 
Ahmet, you want to talk about Europe?
 
Ahmet Bozer
 
Thanks Sandy. Hey John. Just a couple of comments in general and then 
Europe, we are following exactly the same strategy of managing our product 
mix and price versus volume around the market
s international, in fact we 
are getting some pretty good results in many of our big markets specifically 

aggressive pricing which resulted in our view somewhat of an imbalanced 
progression of
 
our business where we have lost some market share, but get 
--
 
got great pricing.
 
So we were saying before that we would be moderating that somewhat this 
year so that we have a more balanced growth of volume and revenue. So 
what you saw in the first quarte
r is the result of that sort of moderation, but 
we do believe that we would be achieving reasonable price mix in Europe in 
the course of this year.
 
Muhtar Kent
 

already mentioned 

marketing around the different clusters of developed, emerging and 

early results and I think our new marketing leadership is very c
ommitted 
and very much part of this new reorganization of our marketing around the 
clusters and I can say very clearly that marketing is playing an important 

an important takeaway
, I think.
 
John Faucher
 
Great, thank you. Feel better Muhtar.
 
Muhtar Kent
 
Thanks. I feel good, it's just my voice.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Your next question is Dara Mohsenian of Morgan Stanley.
 
Dara Mohsenian
 
Hi guys. So I'll give Muhtar voice a break and 
maybe start with Kathy. The 
quarter came in better than expected from a margin perspective clearly 
versus consensus, but with the extra shipping days and Easter shift its kind 
tough to judge your margin performance. So, I was just hoping you could 
give us 
some perspective on where margins and profit came in this quarter 
versus your original expectations and some of the key puts and takes in the 
quarter again versus as original expectations.
 
Kathy Waller
 
So, the price mix obviously is three points as I just 
spoke about, we did 
benefit from the positive geographic mix and 
--
 
in the first quarter and as we 
will get concentrate shipments and timing starts to catch up we will have the 
impact of negative geographic mix which is for us is not surprising, that it's 
kind of normal run rate for several of our geography. So we did get the price 
in the quarter and in the benefit and then we had decided that would be the 
cost and when you adjust for structural and you adjust the currencies, cost 
of goods is really in line
 
with concentrate shipments and then the other issue 

basically going to be benign for us and in the quarter we are cycling higher 
cost from full last year. So that was a slight benef
it and that's for the most 


by the cost that were better than prior year because we cycled a better
 
cost.
 
Dara Mohsenian
 
Okay and then when you put everything together would you say from a 
profit standpoint or margin standpoint where did the quarter come in versus 
original expectations at the corporate level?
 
Kathy Waller
 
So, and also would add, one of 
the thing is seeing addition in North America 
specifically we had better mix which basically was about our food service 
business. So for the first quarter in our transition year we are obviously very 
pleased with our result and I would say that 
--
 
I would 
expect pricing to 
moderate for the back half of the year and continue with the cost commodity 
--
 
the cost of [control] continue to be in line with the concentrate shipment. 
So we we're 
--
 
basically given the quarter in line with our expectations and 
we exp
ect to be in line with our full year expectations that we have 
provided.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Your next is Steve Powers of UBS.
 
Steve Powers
 
Thanks. Muhtar feel free to weigh in, but I'll also try to give you a break and 
direct questions to Sandy and Kathy.
 
So guys on North America the price 
utilization was solid but was actually a little lower than I at least had 
expected, just based on market data and I know you were lapping some 
fairly intense retailer promotion, so maybe that played a role, maybe it was 
again negative mix from still. I know you mentioned fountain dynamics 
Sandy, but I was hoping if you could expand on the trends there and 
whether you think 2% is a representative number for the year? This in term 
just the way you are charging it?
 
And then 
on a related note I was wondering if you also dimension for us the 
profit contribution to this price mix you are getting because clearly if it was 
all rates, Tier rate then it would sort of flow through 100% to profit all as 
equal. But given that lot of wh

just introduction of new package types. I'm wondering how to think about 
that profit contribution. Should we be assuming 50% as a rule of thumb 
roughly or are there reasons to be more optimistic or cautious rel
ated to 
extrapolating price mix to profit flow through?
 
Muhtar Kent
 
Steve the comment I make about overall pricing are to reiterate what I said 
earlier which is that on a business by business basis our pricing results in the 
first quarter we're solid, you 
saw in the Nelson very strong price growth, 
some of that was driven by wholesale improvement that we were achieving 
with our customers, some of that was lapping some really aggressive 
promotional activity that happens in the end of February and early march
 
and some it was our customers making more money in the category, so the 
net effect of it was a really good start to the year in line with our plan.
 
If you cross our business over into our chilled minute maid business, we saw 
price realization there. We la
unched some new items that drove some 
incremental revenue and then as I mentioned the fountain business was 
stronger than we expected at the beginning of the year which creates a 
business mix drag overall. What I say from a profitability standpoint is that
 

also pointed out that as we get into the second half of the year you are 
going to see more difficult pricing comparisons and we will continue our 
strategy of rigorous and disciplin
ed and focused price volume management 

little bit tougher comparison.
 
So net
-
to
-

 
Irial Finan
 




mentioned there is some channel mix impacts in ther
e, but generally 
speaking very much in line. We intend to say disciplined and [indiscernible] 
ordinarily be boring in terms of how we approach the business. We wanted 
to remain disciplined and focused and doing the right things in the business 
and we belie
ve we are on a good track. We intend to stand on track and I 

 
Muhtar Kent
 
Can I just add one more thing there, that what Irial just said then creates 
the environment for our small p
ackages to grow and the consumer is moving 

-
teens 
growth in those packages and all of which is supported by the impact of a 
step up in marketing which gives the whole thing more sustainabilit
y as we 
work through the more challenging comps.
 
Steve Powers
 
Okay. Maybe just follow up sort of related to seeing in different angle, 

profit to profit before tax, so 
regional operating profits or profit before tax 
consistent with the incentive changes you made. North American PBT was up 
like 100 basis points 
--
 
180 basis points or so but I was wondering if you can 
comment, A; if there was any material benefit from sub
-
bottling payments in 
the quarter and B; if OI margin trends would have been sort of 
--
 
would 
have mirrored PBT and then assuming so, how much of that 180 basis points 
improvement was driven by some of the better pricing realization, the better 
productivity
 
commodities that can kind of continue as a run rate versus 
timing benefits in the quarter related to the Easter and the calendar shifts? 

the real run rate that we should be think
ing about as sort of expecting 
margin improvement on the year? Thanks.
 
Kathy Waller
 
So the expected margin improvement over the balance of the year as Sandy 

very focused on continu
ing to be rational in price. We have higher comps in 
the back half of the year for pricing that we have to cycle. So as far as the 

from the sub
-
bottling payments and as you know if 
you look at it from an 

them out. We pull out the benefits so that we put it back on an apples
-
to
-
apples basis year
-
over
-
year.
 
So there is not a big difference at operating versus 
PBT in our North 
American operations at this point. So the margin expansion that is basically 
really good pricing as we get really good pricing in the fourth quarter of last 
year, they are very focused on pricing that will continue, but are cycling 
higher 
prices in the back half of this year.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Next question is Bill Chappell of SunTrust.
 
Bill Chappell
 


y a positive 


going forward at least stabilization. And then the second question, on the 
refranchising, any


--
 
may be you have more of an update later as we move to the year?
 
Sandy Douglas
 
Bill, on diet coke I would describe die
t coke still as a work in progress. We 
have done a number of things on the basics of marketing, graphics, 
adverting, packaging. We have some very advanced sort of big data driven 
customer relationship programs going on with consumers who love diet coke 
and
 
we are seeing some improvement in the year
-
over
-
year revenue. But 

But I would say this, the team and I and our whole system believes that in 

the long term, but recent improvement, 
that still work in progress.
 
On refranchising, the refranchising is going according to plan. It is a, as we 
said before a massive project. We are putting the entire system in the 
common ERP systems and refranchising t
he territories one sale center at a 
time to make sure that the capability that we build continues to grow and 

progress, We have a plan in place that we expect to meet or beat and 

always looking for opportunities to accelerate it but not at the expense of 
really high quality customer servicing capability.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Next question is Ali Dibadj from Bernstein.
 
Ali Dibadj
 
Hi, guys. So, throughout the press release and y
our commentary we 
pleasingly had heard and read about marketing increases so that's a good 

reference to cost cutting benefit offsetting or funding some of those asset 
point, the only
 

savings this year. But we're not hearing or seeing a lot of that flowing 
through even offsetting things, I'm not saying all the way to the bottom line 
but at least offsetting from your invest
ment. So when can we start hearing 
more about that savings offsetting your investments?
 
Muhtar Kent
 
Well Ali, this is Muhtar. First if it wasn't for the savings we would not be able 
to be 
--
 
to do what you see us doing, in terms of generating net increase 
marketing, generating all the other things that's basically are part of our five 
point strategy of focusing on revenue, focusing on productivity, focusing on 
better and more marketing rewiring the organization for better impact and 
focusing on our core whi
ch is the franchise that we talked about.
 
So I just sat to you, had is not being for the productivity we certainly would 
not be able to enable our organization to generate the kind of momentum 
that you see beginning to come back in that's clear there is no
 
question 
about that. And so this is not a four or five sequential kind of compartments, 
these are very integrated sort of approach to how we bring more momentum 
into our business and everything that I mentioned is happening at the same 
time, better more 
-
-
 
better wide organization, better marketing, marketing 
that works around clusters, more infective marketing linked to social media 
as well as into a better cost per GRP.
 
All of that funded by incremental productivity and so I think that's how you 
need to 
see our entire sort of different bucket of our strategy coming to life.
 
Ali Dibadj
 
So, a follow up on that and separate question for Irial, just a follow up on 
than Muhtar if you could, is particularly in terms of the headcount reduction 
and the saving the
re off. Should we see that ramping up throughout the 
year and at risk of being cut off let me turn my second question here on a 
separate topic is, we do keep hearing Germany, India, Vietnam bottlers and 
BIG continue to be actually quite well and I always p
ause whenever I see 

Germany. But when is the right time to divest those and get them out of 
hospital ward and what are you looking for to make sure that happens or 
potential buyers are 
looking forward at this point to commit to buying them?
 
Muhtar Kent
 
First, I mean I'll just say that I agree with you that they those bottlers are 
doing really well. Germany certainly is staring Europe. Southeast Asian 
bottlers are doing well particularly 
Vietnam the big one that we are running 
and I think it's important to keep in mind for you that Germany was not in 
the position to be refranchised until after 2012 because the consolidation 
was still taking place, so it's really being ready for the last so
rt of, it feels 
like 18 months to 24 months. And it has been the real bright spot in the 

get the 
--
 
find the right home and the right structure and the right value and 
so I coul
d be clear with you that Germany is not a long term 
--
 
strategic long 
term holding and the right moment will be found. None of our, if you bike 
BIG operations are in a way long term strategic hold. So, that's what I would 
say about your question, Irial, yo
u want to add anything to that.
 
Irial Finan
 


performing very well now and we've been very transparent about 
r

refranchise at the right time, Germany we've clearly said is ready to 
[indiscernible] in the meantime it continues to perform exceptionally well.
 
We have a fantastic group up of associate
s and managements in Germany 

not get over paid but get fair price for territories because we owe that to our 
shareholder and we take it from there.
 
Muhtar Kent
 
Just to build on 
what Irial said, we are looking for three things. So in terms 
of the right partner 
--
 
description of the right partner; one, proven 
management team; two, a strong financial capabilities and three, willing to 
invest in the business and growing the business.
 
So those are the three 
things and then I'm confident that we will reach that goal. On your 
--
 
finally 
on your question regarding head counts reduction, I think you've heard 

said.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Next question is Ian Shackelton of Nomura.
 
Ian Shackelton
 
You announced the deal in China last week and I was just keen to get a little 


th the more recent deals with Monster or [indiscernible].
 
Muhtar Kent
 
Ian, its Muhtar. It fits right into the strategy of what we said, is bolt on 
acquisition where they make sense. And we will look at them with 
--
 
and 
where we believe that they fit 
into our portfolio, where they actually add 
value, where we can generate value for our bottling partners through that 

 
Ian Shackelton
 
Okay. Thank you. But just follow up for Kath
y, I know it can be quite volatile 
with equity income this time has almost come to zero, is this something 

 
Kathy Waller
 
Our equity income is impacted by currency. So we actually have 
--
 

out all of the c

of our locations they have 
--
 
their geography, they have many geographies. 
So when we report we take the main currency and transact that into U.S. 
dollar that means that there is still often a lo
t of currency impact in those 
numbers. So I would read into it that is a very, very difficult currency 
environment out there at the moment.
 
Ian Shackelton
 
Okay. So this is not a case of it being something one
-
off in terms of the 
equity holdings there?
 
Kath
y Waller
 
No, there is nothing one
-
off down the way of the equity holdings.

Thank you. Next question is Bill Schmitz of Deutsche Bank.
 
Bill Schmitz
 
Is there any way to sort of strip out what the benefit in the quarter was on 
the operating profit si
de from the extra days?
 
Kathy Waller
 
So I guess the way I think about it is if you take our unit case sales of one 

and you take pricing of three in terms of pricing and then I would
 
say that 

half of the year. So I guess I would think of it using this price mix in average 
sales in unit cases.
 
Bill Schmitz
 
Except that there was no fixed cost leverage or anythin
g with the extra days 
that might help the growth in operating margin?
 
Kathy Waller
 
So the days or the operating expenses, I would say no there was nothing 
specific in operating expenses that would help by the six days and then the 
sales and distribution ex
penses are impacted by the six days so they kind of

over
-

t 
and how sustainable is it?
 
Kathy Waller
 
So again [indiscernible] but then, we did benefit from the size of the 
geographic mix. So I think the only thing I would say in terms of this it will 
moderate in the back half of the year as we will get more of a n
ormal run 
rate of negative geographic mix from concentrate shipment. And then Sandy 
talked about the impact of the business mix with the food service business in 
North America. So I think those are things that basically will say that that 
number will moder
ate over the back half of the year as we are still in a 
transition year.
 
Bill Schmitz
 
Okay, great. And then just lastly very quickly, I mean the delay in the 
Monster transaction, I mean 
--
 
is there any more color you can give us on 
why it 
--
 
and I 



 
Kathy Waller
 

close, we always expected 

that we have to go through that is delaying the close. We fully anticipate 
that it will close.
 
Bill Schmitz
 

very much for the time.
 
Kathy Waller
 
Certainty.

Thank you. Our final question comes from Judy Hong of Goldman Sachs.
 
Judy Hong
 
Most of my questions are answered. So just the couple of P&L questions 
Kathy, one just in terms of the structural items 
impact this year, it sounds 
like a quite negative on revenue now as oppose to the prior call. So just a 
little bit of clarification on sort of the puts and takes on the revenue impact. 
Sounds like the impacts on bottom line is pretty minimal. And then on t
he 
FX you have the re
-
measurement gain in Q1, that was about a little bit more 

outlook for PBT impact being at the low end of that 7% to 8% that you had 
pulled out that time?
 
Kath
y Waller
 
Hi, Judy. So on the structural, the structural is impacted by the timing of the 
Monster transaction and then anytime we accelerate in the refranchising that 

structural guidan
ce. And then on the re
-

basically when we re
-
measure that euro debt that impacted currency 
positively and so that is what changed the outlook for currency over the 
back half of the year. I would also join in the impact of Venez
uela and 
change using the SIMADI rate going forward.
 
Judy Hong
 
The timing of the Monster transaction though, I mean the deal itself is 
delayed, but you are getting the distribution into your bottling in this 
quarter, so that would be still a positive in te
rms of revenue benefit. But is 
the refranchising pacing really what's striking down in terms of the revenue 
impact?
 
Kathy Waller
 
So, the distribution is starting to transition, it has not fully transitioned, so 
that transition will take place over the year
 
and so we at various turns and 
that's not something that's really under our control, that's really under 

--
 
we put in the 
estimate of how we think it's growing to transition. So it's not something 
th
at's already into our numbers, and that slower 
--
 
that's what slowing us. 
So, it's slower than expected because we expected it to start earlier.
 
Judy Hong
 
Nice thing. Okay, that's cool. Alright, thank you.

Thank you. I would now like to turn the c
all back over to Muhtar Kent for 
closing remarks.
 
Muhtar Kent
 
Thank you, Kathy, Ahmet, Sandy, Irial and Tim. In summary we're seeing 
initial progress in our plan to reintegrate top line growth. However we still 
have much to do and the full benefits from th
e announced initiatives are 
going to take time to materialize. 2015 is a transition year as we transform 
our operating model for sustainable growth, amidst a challenging global 
consumer environment, while the macro environment remains challenging in 
the ne

and the long term dynamics of our industry remain promising. Our clients 
and our global system are un
-
parallel we are fully dedicated to strengthening 
our position as the world's leadi
ng beverage company.
 
As always thank you for your interest. Thank you for your investment in our 
company and for joining us this morning.

Quarter 2019 Earnings Results Conference Call. Today's call is being 
recorded. If you have any objections please disconnect at this time.
 
All participants will be on 
listen

only mode until the formal question
-
and
-
answer portion of the call. I would like to remind everyone that the purpose 
of this conference is to talk with investors, and therefore, questions from the 
media will not be addressed. Media participants shou

Cola's 
Media Relations Department if they have any questions.
 
I would now like to introduce Mr. Tim Leveridge, Vice President and Investor

Tim Leveridge
 
Thank you. Good morning and thank y
ou for joining us today. I am here with 
James Quincey, our Chief Executive Officer; and John Murphy our Chief 
Financial Officer. Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that this conference 
call may contain forward
-
looking statements including statements 
c
oncerning long
-
term earnings objectives and should be considered in 
conjunction with cautionary statements contained in our earnings release 
and in the company's most recent periodic SEC report.
 
We've posted schedules under the Financial Reports and Inform
ation tab in 
the Investors section of our company website. These schedules reconcile 
certain non
-
GAAP financial measures which may be referred to by our senior 
executives during this morning's discussion to results as reported under 
generally accepted acco
unting principles. Finally, during today's call, when 
our senior executives refer to comparable performance, they're referring to 
comparable performance from continuing operations.
 
Following prepared remarks this morning, we will turn the call over for you
r 
questions. Please limit yourself to one question. If you have more than one, 
please ask your most pressing question first, and then reenter the queue.
 
Now, let me turn the call over to James.
 
James Quincey
 
Thanks Tim and good morning everyone. 2019 is of
f to a good start with 
strong underlying performance as we leverage our transformation as a total 
beverage company. We continue to win in a growing industry. The non
-
alcoholic ready
-
to
-
drink beverage industry grew value 4% in the quarter and 
we gained glob
al value share with a balanced contribution from most 
developed and emerging markets led by strong performance within our 
sparkling soft drink business.
 
During the quarter, we delivered 6% organic revenue growth, cycling 5% 
last year. Growth was broad
-
base
d with positive performance across each of 
our operating segments.
 
Of course there are often timing impacts on a quarterly basis and we did see 
a net benefit in this quarter which John will cover in more detail. But to be 
clear, we delivered strong topline
 
growth in the quarter which we converted 
into 16% comparable currency
-
neutral operating income growth and 
comparable EPS was up 2%, which was comprised of 13% comparable 
currency
-
neutral EPS growth, partially offset by an 11% currency headwind. 
So, our di
sciplined growth strategies are working well and we're on track to 
deliver our full year guidance.
 
As you know our industry continues to evolve and our approach to 
addressing this encompasses our system acting with discipline to drive 
growth. First, innova
ting and investing in our core categories and brands as 
well as in emerging spaces. This encompasses everything from massive 
categories like hot beverages to emerging ones like Kombucha and it allows 
us to proactively address innovation opportunities that 
stem from blurring 
category lines.
 
Second, we're looking at how we operate as a company from our existing 
geographic segments to our new Global Ventures segment. Third, our 
system is aligned and engaged with improved execution. Our bottling 
partners are in
vesting for growth including cold
-
drinks equipment and 
incremental feet on the street as well as implementing more segmented 
revenue growth strategies. At the same time, we're investing in digital 
capabilities. We engage with consumers, interact with our c
ustomers, and 
reduced costs across our enterprise.
 
So, starting with our brands, constant innovation is crucial for sustained 
growth. Brand Coke, which includes our flagship product and its many 
variants, has momentum because it has been continually update
d to 
maintain its relevance.
 
Over the past three years, innovation has helped accelerate global retail 
value growth each year including up to 6% growth in 2018. This growth is in 
large part because of the success of Coke Zero Sugar which didn't happen of 
c
ourse overnight. We refined and expanded Zero Sugar over time and we 
see more growth ahead.
 
Coke Zero Sugar succeeds because it builds on the brand edge of original 
Coke, on its taste, its upliftment, on the energy boost that the product 
provides, all thes
e in a product that doesn't have calories or sugar.
 
So, what's next for brand Coke? You will see us to continue to innovate to 
capture additional consumption occasions and need states. One example 
that I've talked about before is Coca
-
Cola coffee which we 
tested in several 
Asian markets last year. Coke coffee was designed to reach consumers 
during specific occasions and channels like the mid
-
afternoon energy slump 
at work. We've learned from these pilots and we now plan to launch in more 
than 25 markets aro
und the world by year end.
 
We're also pursuing another logical extension on the Coca
-
Cola brand with 
our test of Coke Energy. This takes one of the original brand edges of Coke, 
its energy boost, to a new level and a new taste. This product is designed to 
the white spaces where the energy category isn't well
-
developed.
 
But our approach to innovation is not limited to brand Coke. We're taking 
other brands and pushing into new spaces to offer consumers what they 
want by leveraging the brand edges. For example
, Innocent, our leading 
juice business in Europe, expanded into plant
-
based beverages. And within 
our Challenger brand, Simply, our premium juice brand in the U.S. recently 
launched a new line of smoothies.
 
We're also improving the way we operationalize ou
r innovation pipeline. 
Within our Explorer brands, almost half of our country category 
combinations are growing volume double
-
digits, which is up from about a 
third a year ago.
 
While we often talk about innovating in products, our evolution is just as 
much
 
about changing how we work. Our organizational needs are ever
-
changing, as our portfolio and competitive environment become more 
complex around the world. So we're adapting.
 
One example is the creation of a new operating group Global Ventures. The 
goal is
 
to accelerate some of our businesses, like Innocent and Costa Coffee 
that have the potential for growth across traditional borders.
 
While the acquisition of Costa Coffee plays a significant entry point into hot 
beverages, it's also more than that. Costa i
s a platform in coffee overall. This 
requires more and better connectivity than ever before.
 
We spent the first three months ensuring the transition from Whitbread went 
smoothly while building connections within our existing business units. And 
Costa is pe
rforming in line with expectations. As we look to the second 
quarter, we'll be launching our first ready
-
to
-
drink Costa products; expect to 
hear more about that in the weeks ahead.
 
Turning now to our geographic performance, we saw good results in many 
mark
ets around the world. Our emerging and developing markets are 
growing organic revenue double
-
digits. And our developed markets are 
performing well, delivering mid
-
single
-
digit organic revenue growth.
 
In EMEA, we grew organic revenue 14%, driven by continue
d growth in 
Europe and Turkey, and improved performance in Russia. We also benefited 
from our European bottlers increasing their inventory levels as a safeguard 
for a potentially disruptive Brexit.
 
Across Europe, revenue growth management 
initiatives and Zero Sugar 
innovations are creating sustained momentum in the majority of our 
markets. Not only has this benefited price/mix, but unit case volume was up 
4% for our European sparkling soft drink portfolio. This performance is 
balanced with 
growth in our tea and hydration categories as we broaden out 
the portfolio.
 
Turning to North America, our results continue to mount steady progress 
driven by strong marketing and execution. Organic revenue was unfavorably 
impacted by 2 points for one less 
day in the quarter and the Easter shift, 
and grew 1% driven by disciplined price pack management and solid value 
growth within sparkling soft drinks, juice drinks, and value
-
added dairy.
 
Our sparkling portfolio benefited from the continued strong performan
ce in 
Coke Zero Sugar and new flavor innovations like Orange Vanilla Coke, which 
helped drive 6% retail value growth for brand Coca
-
Cola in our flagship 
markets.
 
Unit case volume declined by 1% in North America as we continued to focus 
on providing consume
rs with smaller pack sizes, for example, mini cans 
grew 14% in the quarter contributing to transactions and our [pacing] [ph] 
volume while driving significant value for our system and our customers.
 
In Latin America, we delivered 6% organic revenue growth 
in an increasingly 
difficult operating environment. Argentina's economic environment 
worsened, the high inflation increased the salary gap and impacted private 
consumption. The volume here declined double
-
digits, but we gained value 
and volume share by adj
usting the price pack architecture focused on 
transactions and maintaining our consumer base.
 
In Mexico, we're working with our bottling partners to ensure our revenue 
growth management initiatives continue to drive momentum. And Brazil, 
Brazil is on upwar
d trajectory. Our turnaround plan is working with volume 
up 5% and transactions up double
-
digits in the quarter. Incremental cooler 
placements and increased availability of our refillable packages are helping 
to drive this acceleration.
 
Finally, in Asia Pa
cific, we saw good performance in China and India along 
with accelerating momentum in our Southeast Asia business unit, which 
drove 4% organic revenue growth for the segment overall. Execution around 
Chinese New Year was strong, contributing to 9% volume g
rowth and 
double
-
digit transaction growth in China.
 
In Japan, our system continues to deal with the supply chain impact from 
natural disasters last year. Manufacturing capacity remains tight, but is 
improving, with additional lines ramping up in the second
 
quarter. So we 
expect this to ease the capacity shortage, but full recovery will take until 
next year.
 
In Japan, unit case volume was even. New product launches drove 
momentum in tea and coffee during the first quarter while we cycle the 
benefit of a stro
ng innovation pipeline in sparkling soft drinks last year.
 
So, in summary, we had a good start to the year. Our strategy of being 
more consumer focused and creating value for our customers is working. 
And we are confident we will deliver our full year targ
ets and drive 
shareholder value.
 
I'll now turn the call over to John.
 
John Murphy
 
Thank you, James, and thanks to all of you for joining us. Today, I'd like to 
cover three topics. One, our financial results in the quarter; two, our outlook 
for the remainde
r of the year; and three, I'd like to say a few points on our 
currency hedging program.
 
So starting with our financial performance in the quarter. As James said, we 
got off to a good start to the year. You'll see that, the composition of organic 
revenue gr
owth in the first quarter was the inverse of what we saw last year 
driven more by price/mix than volume. Price/mix was 5%, cycling 1% and 
trending ahead of our recent run rate driven by strong price/mix in North 
America, EMEA and Latin America. Our concent
rate shipments grew 1%, 
cycling 4%, adversely impacted by one less day in the quarter.
 
Of course with a portfolio as diverse as ours there will often be variability in 
timing from quarter
-
to
-
quarter. The largest timing impact we saw was in 
Europe, where ou
r bottlers increased safety stock in advance of a potentially 
disruptive Brexit. This benefited both global price/mix and concentrate 
shipments, since Europe comprises high revenue per case markets.
 
After normalizing for the estimated two points timing ben
efit and impact 
from one less day in the quarter the best way to think of the underlying top 
line performance in the first quarter is 5%.
 
Over the remainder of 2019, we expect a more balanced volume and 
price/mix. Importantly, I'm really encouraged by our 
organic performance in 
the first quarter and the sustainability of that growth going forward.
 
Turning now to margins for both growth and operating margins, we 
delivered another quarter of underlying margin expansion. In line with our 
expectations, our geog
raphic groups were the primary driver, a function of 
continued innovation, revenue growth management, strategies and the 
effect of management of our cost structure. However, comparable margins 
contracted in the quarter due to the impact of acquisitions and
 
currency.
 
At the gross profit level, we saw underlying gross margin expand about 30 
basis points. Currencies and net acquisitions impacted gross margin by 
about 100 basis points and 80 basis points respectively. This was expected 
with the impact from net 
acquisitions driven, primarily by bottler 
transactions within our bottling investments segment.
 
At the operating profit level, a continued focus on productivity as well as the 
timing of certain expenses drove a 240 basis point expansion in underlying 
opera
ting margin. But this was offset by about 130 basis point impact from 
currencies and about 130 basis point impact from net acquisitions.
 
As James noted, comparable EPS growth grew 2% in the quarter which was 
comprised of 13% comparable currency
-
neutral gro
wth, partially offset by 
an 11% currency headwind. Finally, we generated free cash flow of $335 
million in the quarter in line with our expectations. Strong underlying cash 
generation was offset by the impact of currency headwinds along with an 
increase in
 
capital expenditures and cash tax payments.
 
Looking now at the remainder of the year. We are confident we can deliver 
the full year guidance we have spoken about previously and is included in 
our release. We do expect the quarterly phasing to be a bit une
ven. So let 
me just highlight some considerations to factor into your models. The timing 
benefit we received from bottlers stocking up in anticipation of Brexit was 
roughly $0.02 into the first quarter EPS. But as we move forward, we expect 
this to reverse
 
this year. This is a fluid situation, but our current estimate is 
that our bottlers will hold their safety stock through the second and third 
quarter. So for modeling purposes I would take the $0.02 out of the fourth 
quarter.
 
Before giving a currency outl
ook, I'd like to highlight a few points. Since 
CAGNY, we've taken a close look at how we manage foreign exchange in 
over 70 functional currencies. For developed market currencies, I believe we 
have the right hedging strategy to mitigate fluctuations to cas
h flows. This 
approach has provided a significant cash flow benefit over the past five 
years, which is important for our company given our large domestic cash 
obligations including the dividend.
 
Our challenge is emerging market currencies given the increas
ing 
importance of emerging markets to our earnings base. While we have not 
underperformed versus other approaches there has been a limited amount 
we can do to hedge this exposure in a cost
-
efficient manner. Going forward 
we will continue to evaluate our ap
proach to optimally manage this area. 
We'll provide insight if and when that approach evolves.
 
I'd also like us to a better job on overall communications. So going forward 
in quarters where it is significant, we will begin calling out hedging as a 
componen
t of the overall currency impact so it's clear what gains or losses, 
we'll be cycling next year. For example in the first quarter of 2019, the 
currency impact to operating income was not materially affected by hedging 
activities and is primarily the result
 
of a change in spot rates. We will also 
provide preliminary currency outlook for the following year once we have 
better insight into our hedging activity for the latter year. I expect this to be 
on the third quarter earnings call.
 
Returning to our near
-
te
rm outlook. In the second quarter, we expect a 7 
point currency impact to operating income. This includes a 2 point impact 
from hedging activity driven almost entirely by gains we are cycling from the 
prior year. We are hedged through options near current 
market rates for the 
G10 currencies as well as for certain emerging market currencies. So we 
have downside protection in the quarter and some upside opportunities 
should the dollar weaken.
 
As we move into the back half of the year, we expect the impact fro
m 
currencies to become less of a headwind each quarter. However, while we 
are hedged on the hard currencies through the end of 2019, we do have 
some exposure to fluctuations in emerging market currencies and our 
currency outlook will reflect this according
ly.
 
As always our Investor Relations team will be happy to answer any questions 
as you build
-
out your models for the year. So in summary, organic revenue 
growth is strong and is broad
-
based. Currency and acquisitions impacted 
margins in the quarter, but pr
icing and productivity are driving underlying 
margin expansion. And we are confident in our ability to deliver our full year 
guidance.
 
Operator, we are now ready for questions.
 
Question

Answer Session
 
Operator
 
Thank you. [Operator 
Instructions] Our first question comes from Steve 
Powers with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.
 
Steve Powers
 
Great. Thanks. Good morning.
 
James Quincey
 
Good morning.
 
Steve Powers
 
I guess 
--
 
James, congrats on the quarter. I think the prepared remarks 
g
ave a lot of clarity. I wanted to start actually stepping back and talking 
about a bigger picture issue, just in terms of innovation. You've talked a lot 
about incremental innovation, I mean, how you work and how you introduce 
new products since you've tak
en over as CEO. And about the need to try 
more not be afraid of failure, but also when you do fail to 
--
 
fail fast and fail 
cheaply. And I guess my question is as you step back, just how do you 
assess your progress against those innovation objectives?
 
You 
cited some things in the prepared remarks that have shown promise. 
But what metrics are you specifically tracking when it comes to innovation? 
And maybe if you could, could you share some of those with us? Is it simply 
a matter of accelerating the number o
f new product innovations and 
introductions? And if so have those in fact accelerated? Or are there other 
metrics in terms of success rates or product contributions to growth or the 
balance of innovation across categories and geographies? Just a little bit
 
more context around how you're approaching the measurement of 
innovation success?
 
James Quincey
 
Sure. Let me offer you a couple of thoughts, Steve. I think one is to 
--
 
one 
metric that we track, and I think, we've put some numbers in our CAGNY 
presentatio
n if I remember correctly, is looking at the contribution of 
innovation to overall volume or revenue growth or gross margin growth. So 
just tracking quite simply what was existing and what was new and what's 
contributing to the base. And that is useful to 
us not just to know what's 
new and what's existing, but on the thesis that the most important thing is 
to work out how to stay relevant there are innovations which are about new 
products, but there are innovations about marketing and packaging, which is 
al
l aimed to help us stay relevant.
 
So innovation shouldn't be seen just as narrowly as the physical liquid 
product. It needs to be also seen as the packaging and the marketing. So we 
do measure the narrow, which is the product but we're also [interested] [p
h] 
in the broad. And ultimately what that ladders up to is driving the framework 
we've talked about, which is the leader, challenger, explorer and the 
zombies.
 
So in the end, the innovations in the product, the packaging, the marketing, 
the execution, the 
co
-
brand it's all about getting more quality leadership 
positions. And so we're measuring there how many of the leaders are 
growing faster than personal consumption. Are they expanding their 
leadership position? How many of the challengers are gaining a de
cent 
amount of value share each year, because if they don't gain a decent 
amount of value share each year, they'll never arrive at being leader. And 
how many of the explorers are growing double
-
digits? We called out in the 
scriptures then that with half th
e explorers are growing double
-
digits, so 
there was only one
-
third last year. So innovation should be seen as in 
service of creating quality leadership for the brands and that's the highest 
level metric that we look at in the end.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. And o
ur next question comes from Lauren Lieberman with 
Barclays. Your line is now open.
 
Lauren Lieberman
 
Great. Thanks, good morning.
 
James Quincey
 
Hey, Lauren.
 
Lauren Lieberman
 
The volume performance in Asia was really notable this quarter. And so I 
know in th
e release you mentioned China, Southeast Asia and India. But 
could you just walk through specifically what's driving the performance? 
Even like just talk about it in a sequential acceleration. And also I'm sure it's 
quite small, but you did mention this au
thentic tea house launch in China. 
And I just know that's been a tough country category combination for you 
historically. So if you could just comment on that, because if you put it in 
the release it must be worth talking about. Thanks.
 
James Quincey
 
Yeah.
 
Okay. I think the first thing I would say is that the Asia Pacific volume 
growth in the first quarter was very much in line with the volume growth in 
2018. I think the question that was out there was in the fourth quarter when 
it softened a little was tha
t a blip or was that the emergence of something 
else? And I think at least with the first quarter, the fourth quarter looks 
more like a blip.
 
So I think it's a retaking of the momentum we have in 2018. Specifically 
what was driving it was, for example, in 
China we had very strong 
performance by the whole Coca
-
Cola trademark, as well as emphasizing 
single serve water and the recreating value in the water category that has 
been an ongoing theme for us in the China business. Obviously all of that 
was wrapped t
ogether with a good Chinese New Year. Tremendous 
activation on the marketing programs there. So, really a solid quarter by the 
Chinese business.
 
In India, we did well, good performance by the sparkling but we also had in 
the case of India really strong gro
wth in the juices. Maaza, which is the local 
mango centered juice business, was up very strongly along with some of the 
Minute Maid local Indian fruit flavors, so a nice performance there.
 
We also saw Southeast Asia do better. Philippines, Thailand, Indone
sia, 
Vietnam they were all in double
-
digits, so a really good performance across 
Southeast Asia. And Authentic Tea House, I know it made it into the release 
and I think it's starting to continue to do well. So we are pleased with the 
initial results. It's 
going to be a very 
--
 
it's definitively in the category of 
explorer. So it's growing. But I think there's a long, long road to go before 
we are happy with where we end up in tea in China.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. And our next question comes from Bonnie 
Herzog with Wells 
Fargo. Your line is now open.
 
Bonnie Herzog
 
All right Thank you, good morning. So I had a question on your margins. The 
underlying margins were quite impressive in the quarter ex FX and 
acquisitions. So I was hoping you could help bucket 
some of the key drivers 
behind the strength in the quarter. And then maybe give us a sense as to 
how much of the benefit you got from productivity savings versus the lift 
you might be getting from some of the strong pricing you're seeing? Thanks.
 
John Murp
hy
 
Thank you. Let me start with a quick walk forward on gross margin first and 
then I'll cover operating margin. As I mentioned in my remarks, the 
underlying margin expansion of what's 30 basis points in gross margin was 
led by EMEA. And the benefits of Br
exit was clearly part of that, but there 
was also a positive benefit of geographical mix overall. And this was partially 
offset by North America due to growth in the finished good businesses.
 
I think importantly, we need to take into account the currency h
eadwinds 
and they were particularly related to the Argentinean peso. And we also 
were cycling some hedge gains from prior year. In addition to which we also 
had a structural impact mainly driven by the acquisition of the Philippines 
bottling business. And 
there was a slight offset there on the kind of the 
bottler refranchising.
 
On the operating margin front, the underlying expansion of 250 basis points 
was due to EMEA and the Brexit impact where we have a higher revenue and 
would've had no expenses there an
d North America also due to productivity 
in the 
--
 
across
-
the
-
board and the timing of some expenses. We also saw 
though the headwinds on operating margin on the acquisition front and the 
currency headwinds due to the peso and hedging gains I mentioned befo
re. 
So underlying margin expansion net positive, but purely been impacted by 
the headwinds on currency and acquisitions.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. And our next question comes from Judy Hong with Goldman 
Sachs. Your line is now open.
 
Q 

 
Judy Hong
 
Thank you. Good
 
morning. So James, I guess I'm just trying to get a little 
bit more color just in terms of your organic revenue growth outlook for the 
full year. I think in the fourth quarter call, you talked about some of the 
cautions around some of the macroeconomic vo
latility in markets like Middle 
East and Argentina. It seems like first quarter certainly came in a little bit 
better even setting aside some of the timing noise. So how are you thinking 
about the 4% number? Do you feel like there's maybe some cushion as y
ou 
kind of think about the volatility perhaps being a little bit less or certain 
markets actually doing a little bit better than you thought? Thank you.
 
A 

 
James Quincey
 
Sure. I mean, I think firstly, it's certainly encouraging to come out of the 
gate in 
the first quarter with a strong start. And as you say taking the timing 
aside, I think we can call the first quarter a five. It's obviously our smallest 
quarter. So there's still a long way to go in the rest of 2019. And I think it's 
still a question of th
e macros versus what we can execute against ourselves 
very much as it was in the last call.
 
I think since we last spoke, the IMF has come out and reduced its forecast 
for the year again. So I think the macro environment remains of a lower 
level of growth t
han it was in 2018 and a degree of uncertainty as to how 
some of the bigger issues around trade are going to play out. Depending on 
the week, it can be blowing a little. We're optimistic, a little more 
pessimistic, but I think fundamentally, the macro envi
ronment remains very 
similar to what we have been planning against for the last number of 
months.
 
Obviously what we are focused on is the execution against our strategy. We 
think we have a strategy that's right for the consumers and the customers 
for 2019 
and well into the future. We and the bottling partners are focused 
on executing against that. We're going to have to deal with the ups and 
downs in some of the trickier parts of the world whether that's Argentina or 
the Middle East or other places that are
 
under pressure. But we think we 
have a plan that's going to work. So I think in the end, it comes down to. 
We are confident in our guidance. We had a good start in the first quarter, 
although it's the smallest quarter. And we will continue to focus on 
man
aging what we can manage to deliver a good result in 2019.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. And our next question comes from Ali Dibadj with Bernstein. 
Your line is now open.
 
Q 

 
Ali Dibadj
 
Hey guys. So I was just wondering about the SG&A improvement. It looked 
pretty 
strong in the quarter, notwithstanding some of the gross margin 
impact and FX impact. What's underlying that in particular given a little bit 
of detail John a moment ago? But I guess, I ask in the context of the $3.8 
billion restructuring target that was s
et a few years ago and whether there's 
an opportunity to up that number. It certainly seems like you have more 
room there understanding a lot of moving parts. And then, the second thing 
is related to Coke Energy. You mentioned it James in your opening rema
rks. 
Do you have any detail further about the opportunities there? That would be 
helpful as well. Thanks.
 
John Murphy
 
Thanks. Ali on SG&A, we had a slight increase in comparables at 1.1% and 
there's a couple of things in there. One, it does reflect the int
egration of the 
new businesses, but it's offset by currency and the structural impact. So, 
when you look at the comparisons take those into account. We did have 
some savings in SG&A during the quarter, a benefit of the ongoing 
productivity work that we hav
e been doing, plus some timing of expenses in 
North America.
 
And as we look to the future, I quote our ongoing work on productivity in 
under the whole margin expansion arena, where we would be embedding 
into just the way we operate a critical focus across 
the enterprise on driving 
costs at every line our cost to sales line. We see opportunities to continue to 
drive, or concentrate supply business more efficiently through harmonization 
of formulas et cetera. There is ongoing opportunity in the OpEx arena, to
 
drive more efficiency particularly with some of the digitization initiatives we 
have underway. And then finally, there's always ways to I think be more 
effective and efficient, with our marketing spend and that's a key area of 
focus going forward across t
he enterprise.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. And our next question comes from Bill Chappell with SunTrust. 
Your line is now open.
 
Bill Chappell
 
Thanks. Good morning.
 
James Quincey
 
Good morning.
 
Bill Chappell
 
Could you talk a little more on the innovation 
especially on the coffee side? 
Just trying to understand, I guess one how the Coke coffee works with 
Costa? And also, kind of timing of some of these launches? Will they be in 
North America? Will they have an impact in 1Q, 2Q, 3Q? Just a little more 
color 
on how that flows through the year would be helpful. Thank you.
 
James Quincey
 
Sure. I think firstly, the way we are seeing the opportunities for innovation 
in a product sense is in a way at the blurring edge or partly at the blurring 
edge with some of the 
categories. So the opportunity to have a Coke and 
coffee variant of Coca
-
Cola is really at that juncture of what are the benefits 
that people see in Coke versus what are the benefits they look for in coffee, 
especially perhaps in some of the markets where 
the occasions are less well
-
developed. Said another way, in the developed economies three
-
quarters of 
what people drink is already a commercial beverage. So they have a certain 
view as to what drinks go for what and what occasions. But in the emerging 
econ
omies only a quarter of what they drink is a commercial beverage.
 
So there's still a lot of in a way creating of the occasions and connecting of 
brands and benefits to certain occasions. So, there is opportunities to 
expand categories and to leverage the b
lurring of the edges. And I think 
Coke coffee is a great example of that, started out in Southeast Asia in that 
afternoon slump, and really married the benefits of Coke with coffee in a 
very unique way and has done most. And there's nothing about that that
 
detracts from some of the more direct coffee drinks that we launched.
 
Obviously, we've got Georgia coffee, we've got some other coffee drinks in 
the U.S. with partners, and we see a great opportunity to bring Costa ready
-
to
-
drink to the marketplace. We wi
ll be doing that later in the second 
quarter. So as we do that, of course, it's likely that will be concentrated in 
the markets where Costa already is and we'll be coming up with that later in 
the second quarter.
 
And then as for how we foresee the rollout 
of the coffee platform not just the 
ready
-
to
-
drink, but the vending and being a beverage partner with beans 
and machines that we'll come back to later in the year as we have time to 
really solidify the expansion plans with the management of Costa.
 
Obviousl
y, we closed the acquisition well ahead of schedule. The integration 
has gone well and is ahead of schedule taking the business and the services 
out of Whitbread and connecting them to the Coke system. And we're 
currently working through the various stages
 
of the synergy plans we see 
ahead.

Bryan Spillane
 
Hey, good morning everyone.
 
James Quincey
 
Good morning.
 
Bryan Spillane
 
John I guess just a c
ouple of questions, balance sheet
-
related questions for 
you. One is, if you look at the, I guess, long
-
term debt in the quarter went 
up and even net debt went up. And I know part of that is with the Costa 
acquisition. But it was a little surprised to see n
et debt that was going up. So 
if you could just talk about kind of the evolution of the balance sheet and 
debt balances going forward, first?
 
Then second, just related to your comments earlier on currency hedging. 
Can you just give us a high
-
level view of 
what the trade
-
offs are? So 
hedging 
--
 
the currency hedging has been a part of Coke for a long time. So 
if you decided not to do it, I guess, with the emerging market currencies just 
what's the trade
-
off? What benefit do you derive from doing it now that y
ou 
might have 
--
 
you might give up, if you'd change the policy going forward?
 
John Murphy
 
Okay. Let me start with the balance sheet question and just a few key 
highlights from the quarter. First of all, our cash, our balance is slightly 
lower and that was 
driven by the acquisition of Costa. We saw an increase in 
our non
-
current assets $7.2 billion also driven by Costa and CHI. And that's 
affecting two line items. One is, the intangibles increased by $5.5 billion. 
And secondly, there was an increase of $0.5 
billion in our plants and 
equipment line.
 
We do have lower short
-
term debt balances driven by lower commercial 
paper balances. In the first quarter, we did issue a long
-
term euro debt, 
which combined with those lower cash balance that I mentioned is drivin
g 
net debt slightly higher.
 
So our net debt
-
to
-
EBITDA is at 2.7x slightly above our target of 2.5x. But 
we do expect to get that back to within range. So that's on the balance 
sheet.
 
With respect to the hedging questions, I think, there's a couple of point
s to 
consider. First of all, we 
--
 
when you look at why we do it in the first place 
and why we've taken the approach, we've taken, we know we have U.S. 
cash outgoings slated in the course of the year. And then it's important for 
us that we have certainty w
ith respect to the inflows in order to cover those 
obligations.
 
So having that certainty is really important and is a key factor. Historically, 
we've also wanted to smooth the impact over time periods. And when you 
take the long view on that, I think the t
reasury team has done a really good 
job on it. We did 
--
 
over the last few weeks, we did actually take a look at 
what would have happened over the last 10 years if we had deployed other 
approaches. And for developed currencies, I think the hedging program 
we 
have in place by far delivered a better outcome than if we had done nothing 
or if we had been sort of more inactive in this area.
 
The area and I mentioned it in my remarks, the area that's a challenge will 
be working with our emerging currency portfolio
. And as you know the cost 
of hedging, the more volatile currencies sometimes is not worth doing. And 
we don't have, I don't think anybody has actually a perfect model or system 
to cover the risks implicit in, filling in a more volatile emerging currency. 
So 
that's an area that we will continue to work on. In the short to medium 
term, we do have some positions, which we believe are prudent and again 
give us more certainty in the short
-
term and allow us to minimize the 
downside.

Thank you. And our n
ext question comes from Andrea Teixeira with 
JPMorgan. Your line is now open.
 
James Quincey
 
Hi, Andrea.
 
Peter Grom
 
Hi, good morning, everyone. This is Peter Grom on for Andrea.
 
James Quincey
 
Hi, Peter.
 
Peter Grom
 
So I just wanted to ask a quick 
follow
-
up on Coke Energy. So James in the 
prepared remarks you talked about launching in white spaces where the 
energy category is not yet developed. Is that more looking at specific 
countries across the world? Or are you speaking to maybe a particular sub
-
segment of the category that you think is underdeveloped? Thanks.
 
James Quincey
 
Yeah. I mean, Coke Energy the 
--
 
again this is something that debase the 
dynamic of the blurring of some of the categories and the boundary between 
some of the categories. So 
there's 
--
 
with every category in energy is no 
different. There's a very core to the category, a central proposition that 
everyone understands the category to be.
 
And then as the boundary of the category people have made innovations by 
adding other ingredi
ents and starting to connect to benefits from other 
categories. And in the case of the energy category there has been a lot of 
growth in the central core of what the category stands for and that's what's 
propelled the category forward in largely North Amer
ica and Europe and a 
few other parts of the world. The energy category in itself is still in 
development in many emerging markets.
 
And, therefore, there's an opportunity in complement to the core brands 
within the energy category to work at the boundary. A
nd Coke Energy is 
based on that dynamic. I mean, it's got the credentials and some of the 
origins to be able to connect to some of the energy need states. So we see 
that as a space where the energy category can grow. And we see that across 
our whole series
 
of geographies. And we're going to experiment with Coke 
Energy and see how it works and then, obviously, refine the proposition. And 
we think it will help complement the other brands that sell successfully in 
this category.

Brendan Metrano
 
Good morning. This is Brendan Metrano for Robert. John, a quick follow
-
up 
for you. Could you quantify the benefit to gross and operating margin from 
that concentr
ate build in EMEA?
 
And then for James, I'm wondering if you could expand on trends in Brazil 
and Mexico and some of the initiatives that you're implementing in those 
markets. Brazil seems to be turning for a while. The staples company in 
Mexico is, obvious
ly, an important business for you guys. Thanks.
 
John Murphy
 
Okay. Let me take the Brexit question. Yes, the timing benefit to margins on 
Brexit was 70 basis points in the quarter.
 
Brendan Metrano
 
And that was for gross and operating?
 
John Murphy
 
Operating.
 
Brendan Metrano
 
Operating?

Yes.

Our next question comes from Kaumil Gajrawala with Credit Suisse. Your 
line is 
now open.
 
Kaumil Gajrawala
 
Hey, good morning guys. I wanted to ask a little bit for a little more detail on 
the Coke brand. And maybe specifically you've had Coke Zero Sugar for a 
period of time. Now you have orange and coffee and energy. How do you 
know y
ou're not overextending the brand and maybe the underlying 
business becomes less stable and a lot more reliant on the newest 
innovations?
 
James Quincey
 
Yeah. Great question. I think there's a difference between what's central to 
the brand and what are inno
vations that are likely to be either in or out or in 
a way noncore to the identity or the most central part of the brand. And so I 
would see brand Coke and what it stands for, and therefore Coke Zero Sugar 
as a key part of what the Coca
-
Cola brand is.
 
Now 
things like coffee that's at the beginning we'll see how that develops. 
Clearly, that's a product variant that's crossing over into another category 
with coffee. And obviously, there is a danger there as you say that it 
becomes 
--
 
it starts to change the n
ature of Coke itself. Orange and Vanilla, 
I think is a flavor. We've had some history with flavors. Whether it will 
ultimately end up proving to be one of those ones that endures and is 
available in the market that doesn't get support or not time will tell
. There 
are a number of them and they are different in different countries.
 
And I think they add some interest and some connection to the brand. But 
they are ultimately not marketed in that sense and really driven by 
availability. In the end, what we have 
to steward is the vibrancy of the total 
brand. And of course, those variants that make up the core of the brand. We 
do that through a whole series of metrics, whether it be consumer metrics or 
in
-
market metrics. And I think that is a key challenge and an i
mperative, not 
just for the brand teams, but for the management as well.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. And our next question comes from Brett Cooper with Consumer 
Edge. Your line is now open.
 
Brett Cooper
 
Good morning. I was wondering if you guys can talk about the 
process of 
expanding information or innovation from the original market, particularly 
interested in whether it is pushed from the center and pulled from the 
country. And then, what happens between test and further rollout? And I 
guess the final thing is ju
st can you talk about the speed of doing that? And 
is that where you want it to be? Thanks.
 
James Quincey
 
Well I think the nature of being in CEO or in corporate management is 
nothing is ever as fast as you'd like it, but that's a challenge on how to 
impro
ve its speed rather than something you can live with philosophically. I 
think look the reality is that you get a bit of everything. When there's a 
successful innovation in a market there's a very high likelihood that one of 
the neighboring markets will hav
e seen it and moved on it before anyone 
from the center needs to say anything.
 
In the end, we have to set up a system that allows that. Why? Because it's 
impossible for an enterprise as large as Coke to have everything directed 
from the center. It's just n
ot possible to know everything and it's not 
possible to issue enough instructions to all the different markets. The system 
has to rely on the center focusing on the highest
-
leverage decisions. That 
could be moving in innovation around the world or ensuring
 
that an 
innovation stay in a certain form. But it tends to be directed at a few big 
decisions and then a focus on talent and culture and a system that can allow 
an organic amount of self
-
generation.
 
So to take the example we've talked about so far today C
oke with coffee. 
That started out in Asia Pacific. They came up with one variant. The next 
market then started to move on it before it was really something that the 
seller was worrying about or looking at. They actually then updated the 
formula, so it alre
ady went from 1.0 to 2.0 by the time it went to the second 
country based on some of the learnings. And then as it got moved out 
further, yes, there have been further evolutions of the formula.
 
Obviously, one of the things we've done from the Corporate Cent
er is try to 
make sure there's some unity in how the variant is being thought about and 
how the formulas are being developed. Because ultimately, we have to push 
against the trend that every market thinks it necessarily has to make the 
thing better and tha
t we'd end up with 200 versions of everything. It doesn't 
have to be one version, but 200 is also probably the wrong answer. And so 
we do apply a process of pressure to get into a corridor that we believe is 
appropriate to both satisfy local consumer diffe
rences, yet drive the growth 
of a global brand and an efficiency of an overall supply chain.
 
Brett Cooper
 
Thank you.
 
John Murphy
 
And I'd just add 
--
 
if I add one additional comment. Just from my experience 
over the last couple of years, Brett is that I thi
nk we've moved from more of 
a hub and spoke model to a network model. Our R&D center is now 
reporting into local operations. We have one in Shanghai, Tokyo, Brussels 
and Mexico. And they're very much wired together and connected to our 
business units. So t
he speed at which stuff is moving around has increased a 
lot over the last two years, not for what we would ideally want it to be, but 
it's certainly a key part of the overall profit that James just referenced.

Thank you. And our next question com
es from Laurent Grandet with 
Guggenheim Securities. Your line is now open.
 
Laurent Grandet
 
Good morning, James. Good morning, John. I'd like to focus on Coke Energy 
again. I mean, could you please update us on the Coke Energy launch in 
Europe? The receptio
n from bottlers and retailers and maybe already from 
consumers? If sales are incremental to the Coke franchise or if it's taking 
share from competition? Any update on upcoming launches outside of 
Europe? That will help. Thank you.
 
James Quincey
 
Yeah. Sure.
 
I think that the headline unfortunately Laurent is too early to 
tell. It's only really just gone 

 
it's only really just been launched. The first 
sales are only just being made. It seems to have resonated well in the first 
couple of weeks. And so given ho
w early on it is, it's not 

 
we're not at the 
stage where we can really make a good call on where are the incremental 
sales coming from. So they're still small at this stage. So I think it's very 

 
it's too early to tell. Obviously, we'll be looking at it 
in the coming weeks and 
months, and we'll be able to become clearer as we go forward.

Thank you. And our final question comes from Amit Sharma with BMO 
Capital Markets. Your line is now open.
 
Drew Levine
 
Hi, everyone. This is Drew Levine on for 
Amit. Thanks for taking the 
question. I just wanted to ask about the competitive environment in the U.S. 
Your main competitor said that, they are at least not losing share on their 
cola brand anymore. So I just wanted to see what you're seeing in the 
marke
t, if you're happy with your market share performance in cola. And 
then kind of related to that in sports drinks any plans to expand the scope of 
BODYARMOR or additional support for the sports drinks given some plans by 
your competitor to increase spending
 
on their own brand? Thanks.
 
James Quincey
 
Yeah. We've got a good strategy in the U.S. focused on investing in the 
brands, building out the portfolio, working with the new network of bottlers 
post refranchising to execute the strategy in the marketplace wi
th a 
packaging approach a smaller packaging. We have a standing strategy in the 
U.S. that has been successful in allowing us to help the industry to grow for 
our customers, and for us to be able to gain share within that total industry, 
and that again play
ed out in the first quarter this year.
 
So we think it's a 

 
our strategy that works for us. Obviously, as other 
parties large or small invest in the industry, I think it says two things. One it 
says, the industry is attractive, because it's got growth and 
profitability. 
That's why people want to enter. And it says, we need to up our game 
because the industry is going to become more competitive. And I think 
that's in the end good news for The Coca
-
Cola Company and it certainly has 
been over the last number o
f years in North America. We've been focused on 
driving sparkling beverages and that's continuing to do well, particularly our 
Coke Zero Sugar. BODYARMOR had a good start in the sports drinks 
category. It's certainly been one of the things that's been driv
ing growth in 
that category. So we're going to continue to invest. We're going to stick to 
our overall game plan. And we'll focus on working to make our brands as 
relevant for consumers and our plans as value creating for the customers, so 
we can remain co
mpetitive in this attractive industry.

Thanks, Tim, and good morning, everyone. In 2017, we completed another 
solid quarter of operating performance, capping off a successful year. The 
nonalcoholic beverage industry was a
 
little soft during 2017, as the 
emerging and developing markets slowed slightly from prior year, but the 
developed world continued its growth strategy.
 
We continued to gain global value share for both the quarter and the year. 
And importantly, we achieved
 
or exceeded the guidance we shared with you 
at the beginning of 2017. Full year organic revenue grew 3%, with four out 
of five category clusters delivering top
-
line growth, led by our sparkling soft 
drink portfolio.
 
Underlying PBT grew 9% versus our goal 
of 7% to 8%, as we accelerated 
the capture of certain productivity savings. And we delivered comparable 
EPS of $1.91, which was ahead of our plan. While we did what we said we'd 
do, it's still not as much as we aspired to. We need to be growing revenue 
and
 
EPS at a faster rate.
 
Now looking around the world. All of our operating segments delivered 
positive organic revenue growth. We saw solid growth in our developed 
markets, particularly in Europe and North America, driven by improving 
execution in recently 
refranchised territories and enhanced pricing and 
packaging strategies. Our China business built momentum in 2017 even as 
we refranchised our bottling system.
 
Other emerging markets were more challenging, especially in the first half of 
the year, but we sa
w improvement in key markets like India, Argentina and 
Brazil as we moved into the second half. We accomplished this growth while 
driving significant change at our company as we accelerated our 
transformation into a total beverage company with a broad, con
sumer
-
centric brand portfolio and an asset
-
light business model.
 
First, we implemented a new operating model designed to enable an 
accountable, performance
-
driven growth culture that we believe will result in 
greater returns for our shareholders; a lean mo
del with employees who are 
externally focused, empowered, quick to take action and willing to take 
smart risks. To accomplish this, we made significant changes to our 
leadership team, corporate structure and updated both our incentive metrics 
and compensat
ion philosophy.
 
Second, we implemented new digital platforms to support our leaner 
operating environment and improve the employee experience. This lays the 
groundwork for initiatives like the SAP implementation that will take place 
this year.
 
Third, we exp
anded our consumer
-
centric product portfolio, scaling wins 
from market
-
to
-
market, leveraging M&A and embracing more of an 
experimental test
-
and
-
learn approach to marketing new products. For 
example, we entered the fast
-
growing U.S. ready
-
to
-
drink coffee ca
tegory, 
capturing over 7 points of value share by the end of the year. We lifted and 
shifted two of our leading U.S. brands, Honest and smartwater, into multiple 
international markets and acquired AdeS, the leading plant
-
based beverage 
brand in Latin Ameri
ca with the intension of expanding it into Europe in the 
near future.
 
More importantly, we launched Coca
-
Cola Zero Sugar in 20 markets, with a 
clear four
-
point playbook of a great
-
tasting reformulated product, evolved 
marketing, new packaging and upgraded 
execution. And we saw very 
positive results with the brand growing revenue double digits, including a 
meaningful acceleration in Coca
-
Cola Zero Sugar strength in the U.S. since 
its launch in Q3.
 
Of course, it's not just about large brands. We balance rolli
ng out large
-
scale 
brands and keeping an entrepreneurial focus on emerging consumer trend 
and identifying products that meet those trends. This is about developing 
brands, channels and points of engagements with our consumers. For 
example, we adjusted our 
pack price offering to adapt to the explosion of 
online ordering in China. And we're leveraging a decade of learnings from 
North America's Venturing & Emerging Brands model to approach 
opportunities in international markets. As I mentioned last quarter, we
 
launched a unit in Central and Eastern Europe to test premium brands in 
high
-
value outlets and channels through a separate route
-
to
-
market. And of 
course, while it's still early days, the unit has met our expectations, and we 
are moving quickly to expand 
coverage to another seven cities in Europe.
 
Fourth, we focused on converting portfolio expansion into stronger revenue 
growth. This can clearly be seen in our EMEA operating segment, where 
organic revenue growth accelerated from a 3% run rate over the past
 
few 
years to a strong 5% in 2017. We accomplished this in part due to the 
revenue growth management initiatives that focuses on small baskets and 
pack sizes. These initiatives were phased into several EMEA markets over 
the year, and we will continue to ro
ll them out in additional markets in 2018 
and so expect to see continued momentum this year.
 
And finally, we reenergized our system for future growth. Over the last few 
years, as you well know, we have been returning ownership of our company
-
owned bottling
 
operations to independent companies around the world. In 
2017, we accomplished major milestones in three of our most important 
markets. We sold our bottling businesses in China, creating two strong 
bottlers with contiguous territories. Our two largest bot
tlers in Japan merged 
creating a single bottler, covering roughly 85% of our system in that 
important profit pool. And most importantly, we completed refranchising of 
our U.S. bottling operations. At the same time, our North America business 
continued to d
eliver top
-
tier FMCG performance with 3% organic revenue 
growth.
 
Ultimately, all of these strategic and tactical changes mean something very 
important. We are assertively shifting our culture, the way we operate, the 
way we look at growth opportunities and
 
the way we engage with our 
bottling system. It's been a lot of change, and much of it is only just starting 
to show tangible results, which is a good thing when you think about future 
performance.
 
Looking ahead, 2018 is shaping up to be stronger than 2017
. We are well 
positioned to accelerate our top
-
line performance based on the actions we've 
taken, the impact of new U.S. tax legislation on consumer spending and the 
improvement in the global economy. And while the economic environment in 
key emerging mark
ets like Brazil and Argentina may not yet have tipped into 
a tailwind scenario, they are also not causing the same level of headwinds 
they did last year for our industry.
 
With that as a backdrop, we feel confident that the revenue growth 
initiatives we've 
launched in multiple markets, coupled with the strong 
rollout of brands like Coca
-
Cola Zero Sugar, FUZE Tea, AdeS plant
-
based 
beverages and smartwater will enable us to deliver 4% organic revenue 
growth. We will balance productivity with reinvestment to de
liver significant 
underlying operating new (10:48) margin expansion for the year. And our 
refranchising effort's largely complete and a benign currency environment, 
we expect to grow comparable EPS 8% to 10%.
 
Now, of course, many of you have asked us 
how U.S. tax reform will impact 
our business. Overall, we view this as encouraging for the operating 
environment. Clearly, tax reform will make investing in the U.S. more 
attractive and should spur economic growth. We are currently evaluating it 
and expect
 
our system to accelerate investments to capture further 
opportunities.
 
The tax reform also eliminates a long
-
standing distortion due to the former 
U.S. worldwide tax system, which will make it easier for our company to 
manage its cash and debt balances. H
owever, in the short term, there are 
puts and takes to the financial benefit. Over the next eight years, the lower 
effective tax rate will mostly be offset by the annual payment on the tax 
charge we took during the fourth quarter.
 
Now, while we are focused
 
on delivering this year's plan, we must also keep 
an eye on the long
-
term health of our business. In order to have a healthy 
business, you need to operate in a healthy community. One of today's 
biggest problems is packaging waste. And over the decades, Co
ca
-
Cola has 
done a lot of work on recycling. We made most of our packaging fully 
recyclable, and we've invested a lot in R&D around reusing plastic. And now 
we're doing more. Our system is fundamentally reshaping our approach to 
packaging, with a goal to c
ollect and recycle the equivalent of 100% of all 
the bottles and cans we sell by 2030.
 
We're also increasing the amount of recycled content in our packaging, and 
we're working to make all of our packaging finally 100% recyclable. In a 
world where packaging
 
waste, especially plastic waste, is a growing problem, 
we are working to make sure that no bottle is ever a single
-
use bottle. 
Through recycling, it'll have more than one life.
 
This is the next step in our ongoing sustainability efforts, building off our 
success in replenishing 100% of the water we use in making our beverages. 
We must grow with conscience and, therefore, becoming a total beverage 
company that grows the right way because it is the correct thing to do for 
the consumers and our business.
 
So f
inally, to recap, we had a successful year. We implemented a culture 
shift, which is ongoing. We made large scale changes to strengthen our 
bottling system, met or exceeded our financial guidance and delivered top
-
tier FMCG organic revenue growth. And we a
re encouraged that 2018 will be 
even stronger.
 
With that, I'm going to hand over to Kathy.

Cola Co.
 
Thanks, and good morning, everyone. As James said, 2017 was a good year 
as we met or exceeded our financial guidance during signi
ficant change at 
the company. Our press release covers our fourth quarter results in detail, 
so I will focus on the implications from the U.S. tax reform, two accounting 
changes that will affect our operating margins and our 2018 guidance.
 
Starting with th
e U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, while I won't touch on every 
element, I think there are three important factors to review: the impact to 
our underlying effective tax rate; the tax liability on our foreign accumulated 
earnings; and capital structure implicati
ons.
 
First, based on our expected earnings split between U.S. and international 
locations, we estimate this will lower our global effective tax rate to 
approximately 21% in 2018 compared to our 24% rate in 2017 and our 
previously expected 2018 tax rate of 
26%. However, we expect increased 
variability from quarter
-
to
-
quarter, as future interpretations of the law and 
updates to the related accounting guidance could have an impact on our 
effective tax rate for 2018 and beyond. Therefore, the 21% effective tax 
rate 
estimate is just that, an estimate, and will be subject to change. As we go 
through the year, we will update you on any potential changes.
 
Second, in the fourth quarter, we recorded a one
-
time non
-
cash charge of 
$3.6 billion associated with the enactm
ent. The charge encompasses several 
elements, including a one
-
time $4.6 billion tax on accumulated foreign 
earnings and a primarily offsetting net deferred tax benefit of $1 billion.
 
Despite being recorded in the fourth quarter, the one
-
time tax will be pa
id 
over an eight
-
year period, as stipulated by the Act. So the cash flow impact 
from the $4.6 billion charge will fall in future periods, but will be more than 
offset by the accumulated cash benefit from the lower ongoing tax rate after 
a six
-
 
to seven
-
yea
r payback period.
 
While the accumulated impact is a benefit to free cash flow, the tax 
payments impact the company's free cash flow conversion target over the 
next eight years. At our Investor Day last November, we introduced a free 
cash flow conversion ta
rget of 95% to 100% of GAAP net income, adjusted 
to exclude non
-
cash items impacting comparability.
 
While the lower effective tax rate will benefit both earnings and cash flow by 
the same amount, the tax on historical foreign earnings will only impact our 
free cash flow. So this has the mathematical effect of lowering our free cash 
flow conversion. Since the impact of tax reform was not anticipated when we 
provided the guidance during our Investor Day, we are now adjusting our 
target to 90% to 95% during th
is eight
-
year period of tax payments.
 
Turning to implications on our capital structure and cash repatriation, now 
that the U.S. has moved to a modified territorial regime, it will make it 
easier to manage our cash and debt. As a result, we are providing a 
few 
updates to our capital structure. First, we have a target of 2 to 2.5 times net 
debt leverage, as we believe this provides the right balance between 
reaching the optimal capital structure and preserving financial flexibility as 
we move forward on strat
egic initiatives.
 
We currently operate at 3.9 times gross debt leverage and 2.2 times net 
debt leverage, with a credit rating of AA
-
 
from S&P and a Aa3 from Moody's. 
Since we are already operating within our target net leverage range, we 
intend to use appr
oximately $7 billion of our cash held overseas to repay 
gross debt. This will allow us to reduce the spread between our gross and 
net debt levels, support our credit rating and continue to access the 
commercial paper market and reduce our net interest expe
nse.
 
The remaining cash will continue to be invested overseas, as a significant 
portion of it is non
-
remittable because of local regulations or is required for 
working capital purposes. Another portion is required to support our 
commercial paper program, a
nd then some of the cash is earning a good 
return in certain overseas markets.
 
And finally, our cash priorities remain the same. We will continue to reinvest 
in the business, grow the dividend, fund acquisitions and use any remaining 
cash for net share rep
urchases. As we move forward, we will periodically 
reevaluate and balance our opportunities with our cash flow needs. At times, 
and as appropriate, if we have excess cash, we could use that cash to buy 
back shares above our previously stated goal of offset
ting any equity 
dilution.
 
Moving on to changes in accounting standards. The FASB, which is the 
Financial Accounting Standards Board, issued an accounting standards 
update on revenue from customer contracts. Based on classifications 
provided by this new gui
dance, we will now be required to account for a 
small number of contracts differently in the future.
 
While there are various considerations, the primary impact will be that 
certain revenue and costs and contracts that were previously netted 
together in rev
enue will now be grossed up into the revenue and cost of 
goods sold component going forward.
 
Further, as this change is prospective, meaning there is no restatement of 
prior results, this will result in an estimated increase in net revenue growth 
of 1% to 
2% and an increase of 3% to 5% in cost of goods sold in 2018. 
Importantly, there is no material impact to our consolidated profit or EPS as 
a result.
 
However, the math of this accounting change does result in operating 
margin compression. This change impac
ts the operating segments in 
different ways, and it causes a timing difference, which impacts the 
quarters. Supplementary materials with additionally details on the impact to 
our operating segments and our quarters are filed on our website, and our 
Investo
r Relations team can cover any additional questions with you.
 
The FASB also issued an accounting standards update on pensions and 
postretirement benefit costs, which requires companies to split out net 
pension expense, keeping the service costs and SG&A an
d moving the other 
components of pension expense to other income.
 
As this is simply a re
-
class on the P&L, there is no impact to profit before tax 
or EPS. However, there is an impact to operating margins. Taking these two 
accounting changes together, we ex
pect approximately 150 basis points of 
operating margin compression going forward.
 
Turning to full year 2018 expected performance. We expect organic revenue 
growth to accelerate to 4%. We expect comparable EPS to grow 8% to 10%, 
with the majority of earnin
gs growth coming from the second half of the 
year. And we expect cash from operations of at least $8.5 billion. This 
represents over a 20% rebound as we cycle certain cash costs associated 
with refranchising activities and with the restructuring of the org
anization in 
2017. We will continue to follow our capital allocation priorities, starting with 
an expected $1.9 billion in capital investment. This is higher than our long
-
term expected spend due to investments we are making in 2018 to enhance 
digital capa
bilities.
 
And we will return our free cash flow to share owners through dividends of 
approximately $6.7 billion and approximately $1 billion in net share 
repurchases. As announced yesterday, our board increased the dividend for 
the 56th year in a row to an
 
annual equivalent of $1.56 per share, up 5% 
from $1.48.
 
Now let me touch on key considerations and assumptions embedded in our 
outlook. We expect continued portfolio lift and shift initiatives such as Coca
-
Cola Zero Sugar and FUZE Tea, strong marketplace 
execution like we see in 
EMEA and a slightly improving macro outlook to result in stronger top
-
line 
growth. Along with some improvement in emerging markets, we see 
commodity prices rising. However, continued solid pricing and a focus on 
expense management 
will more than offset higher raw material costs.
 
As such, we expect to deliver 8% to 9% underlying operating income 
growth. As mentioned previously, the accounting change for customer 
contracts will result in a 1 to 2 point tailwind to net revenue and a 
3% to 5% 
increase to cost of goods sold, with a minimal effect on operating income. 
The pension accounting change will require restatement to our 2017 results, 
and given the amount of the reclass, we do not expect it to impact our 2018 
guidance on operatin
g income.
 
Turning to structural items. We will continue to see a structural headwind in 
2018, primarily due to the timing of when certain bottling operations were 
sold last year and the planned refranchising of bottling territories in Canada 
this year. The
refore, for 2018, we expect a 17% headwind to revenue and a 
2% headwind to operating income from structural items.
 
This will result, however, in an approximate 500 basis point benefit to 
comparable operating margins on top of solid underlying margin expans
ion 
in the core business. We expect currency to be a 0% to 1% headwind to 
operating income, as improving spot rates will be offset as we cycle hedging 
gains from 2017.
 
Below the line, we expect modest deleverage. While we plan to repatriate 
approximately $
7 billion of overseas cash to pay down debt, higher interest 
rates will result in an increase to net interest expense. These factors, along 
with our updated 21% effective tax rate, will lead to expected growth in 
comparable EPS of 8% to 10% in 2018.
 
As we 
model the flow of the year, there are a few items to consider in terms 
of phasing for the year. We expect earnings growth to be back half 
weighted, primarily due to the timing of expenses and productivity 
initiatives.
 
Moving specifically to the first quart
er. The first quarter will have one less 
day than the prior year first quarter. We expect a 6 point headwind from 
structural items and a one point tailwind from currencies on operating 
income. And we expect the change in revenue recognition to be a 1 point
 
tailwind to revenue and a neutral impact to operating income in the first 
quarter.
 
Now I realize that was a lot to cover. And as always, our Investor Relations 
team will be happy to walk through each of these elements in more detail as 
you build out your 
models over the year.
 
So in summary, we delivered against our guidance in 2017 during 
tremendous change in the organization and our broader system. We believe 
we are well positioned as we enter into 2018 and expect accelerated 
performance.
 
And then, finall
y, abating headwinds from currency, macros and structural 
impacts, along with an improving tax outlook, will allow a significant 
acceleration in our comparable EPS versus the past several years.

So James and Kathy, you both touched upon this in y
our prepared remarks, 
and I'm sure you'll speak to it in more detail next week as well. But can you 
just, perhaps, expand a bit further on what makes you confident in the 4% 
organic growth guide for next year? It's clearly a solid number. It 
benchmarks rea
lly well against what we heard from peers and the 
momentum that you have coming out of the fourth quarter helps, I think, 
put it in perspective.
 
But what are the relative tailwinds that your system may have that other 
companies may lack right now? Because 
I think there's probably a bit of 
skepticism, maybe some concern out there today that 4% growth may be 
just be too aspirational, just given what we've heard from others this 
season. So I guess the question is really why is 4% the right call for Coke 
when t
he rest of global CPG seems anchored to more like 2% or 3% growth 
right now? Thanks so much.
 
James Quincey 
-
 
The Coca
-
Cola Co.
 
Thanks. So a couple of thoughts that I think can underpin our expectations 
around the 4%. I mean, firstly, look back to 2017, cle
arly, we were making 
sequential improvement as we went through 2017, as we were finishing the 
refranchising, as we were building out the greater portfolio plans, we were, 
as you said, the fourth quarter was good and so was the third quarter in 
2017. So I t
hink the first point is, we were seeing some sequential 
improvement, so we were coming out of 2017 into 2018 with a better run 
rate.
 
Secondly, we talked on the Investor Day that what we needed to do to get 
back into our revenue growth rate range for our lo
ng
-
term model, there 
were a number of things we need to do on the portfolio, on some of the 
clusters, on some of the revenue growth management strategies and also, to 
some extent, an improvement in the macro environment in the emerging 
and developing marke
ts. So there were things that we had to do, and there 
was some of the environment that would get us well into our range of the 
4% to 6%.
 
So I think what you're seeing is a good 

 
another good step forward in 2018, 
of us executing events what we need to exe
cute, particularly the portfolio 
expansion and some of the RGM work. And you can see that some of that 
coming through in the fourth quarter. So I think the actions are in place.
 
The results are starting to come. The momentum is building. We're not out 
of 
the woods in 2018. The world still remains uncertain and volatile. But I 
think the momentum's in the business and the momentum's in the actions 
that we laid out that needed to be taken, plus a little bit of an improvement 
in the emerging macros, makes us c
onfident that 4% is a good number for 
2018.

Want to talk a little bit about EMEA. So really solid price/mix, obviously, so 
revenue growth management showing through would seem for both 
develop
ed and developing markets. And yet, you had margins down pretty 
considerably. So could you just talk a little bit about what went on there that 
quarter? And how we should think about that looking forward? Thanks.
 
James Quincey 
-
 
The Coca
-
Cola Co.
 
Sure. Fir
stly, on EMEA, I mean, there's a couple of things. Clearly, we were 
executing against our plan to expand the portfolio, and I think they've got 
good growth and good launches, particularly coming into 2018, preparing 
the ground for the FUZE Tea launch and t
he AdeS plant
-
based drinks launch.
 
So I think there's a lot going on, on the portfolio in EMEA, which is very 
encouraging. They have been executing a lot of revenue growth 
management approaches, some smart packaging, some different choices on 
pack sizes an
d driving transactions. I think you all have seen that come 
through in the results of both Coke Hellenic and Coca
-
Cola European 
Partners in the last few days. So there's a lot of good work going on in 
revenue growth management, and we 

 
a bit back to the p
revious answer 

 
we see that carrying through into 2018.
 
We did have some places that weren't perfect. We had problems in Egypt 
and in South Africa, more to do with the macro environment in Egypt, the 
disruption of the supply chain. So my point of referenc
e there is when we 
lose volume in some of the emerging markets, it kind of has a mechanical 
benefit on the price/mix.
 
And I think the last thing I would say, so actually, really strong start in 
EMEA, also end to EMEA in 2017. And the other thing that's dri
ving the 
margin is the Innocent business continues to perform really well in Europe. 
And given that that's finished
-
products business, it appears to create margin 
compression, but it also drives top
-
line and good results.

Can you talk a little bit more about North America? I mean, since you have 
and continue to look like you will outperform your competitor and there's 
been, at least in the scanner data, more pricing promotional pressure
. I 
mean, is that a risk, or are you seeing any real change in terms of more 
aggressive pricing to try to win back some share?
 
James Quincey 
-
 
The Coca
-
Cola Co.
 
Look, I think, a couple of things. Firstly, we're very happy with our strategy 
in the U.S. We'v
e been executing it for a good number of years. The team in 
North America, CCR as it was and now many parts that transferred to the 
bottlers, have been executing a great plan and winning in the marketplace 
and driving top
-
tier revenue growth.
 
We've 
always said that it won't necessarily be a straight line in terms of 
pricing. However, I don't think the wheels have come off pricing in any 
shape or form. I think in part it's a question of comparisons. If you look at 
the two year run rates, you start to 
see much less noise than you do when 
you look at just versus prior year, and that includes ourselves where we're 
lapping a very strong price/mix from the fourth quarter of 2016. So I think, 
it appears to be more action than it actually is.
 
We think that ou
r focus on driving value for our customers, and ideally, 
helping beverages grow faster than their average business, is what's 
creating the environment where there's a lot of value creation for everyone, 
and I think that strategy continues. And I think it's
 
being successful and 
we're continuing to drive it forward. And so I think while it's not going to be 
always a straight line, I think it's still good.

Hey. Wanted to go back to the top
-
line organic sales growth, so the 4% that 
you mentioned for 2018; back in November 16 you said, 4% to 6% long 
term. I guess, do you wish you'd said 3% to 5% longer term? And if not, 
how d
o you build up to the 4% to 6% longer term in terms of price/mix, 
volume? And also even the 4% for 2018, how do you build up the price/mix 
and volume? And then a sub
-
question of that, hoping you'll take two 
questions, but a sub
-
question of that is you ment
ioned changes in 
compensation metrics. Can you talk about how that ties to that 4% to 6% or 
4% for 2018 from a top
-
line growth perspective? Thanks.
 
James Quincey 
-
 
The Coca
-
Cola Co.
 
Okay. Well, I do appreciate that you're all trying to talk me down from th
e 
revenue guidance. But let me lay it out. I mean, the 4% to 6%, couple of 
points. Firstly, we always said we were looking for a balance of price and 
volume. So in the long run, to get to our 4% to 6%, we know that that's 
going to be a mix of price and vol
ume and in some degree of balance.
 
Clearly, what we've not had enough of in the short term is volume. Although 
it's worth saying, as a consequence of our focus on smaller packages, 
transactions are growing a whole point faster than volume. So we see that 
t
he strategy is driving us to the right place, but over the long term, we 
would expect to see some degree of volume growth necessary to be 
comfortably in our range of 4% to 6%. And no, I don't regret not taking it 
down to 3% to 5%. And so that's what needs 
to happen. And it's not 
something that needs to happen tomorrow morning, but over time, yes, we'll 
need volume growth to balance out the pricing. And I think that's what we 
aim to do.
 
Now, in terms of getting there, I would refer back to some of the materi
al on 
the Investor Day, and we'll talk about it again at CAGNY on Tuesday. 
Clearly, what needs to happen to get comfortably into the 4% to 6%, and 
2018 will be a step on that journey, which is why we're calling out 4%, 
which is the lower end of the range b
ecause we know, kind of, as I was 
saying on Steve's question, we know we need to do some more things on 
the portfolio. We're really driving expansion across the clusters.
 
I mean, in the fourth quarter, our initiatives were about half coming out of 
sparklin
g and half coming out of the other categories. So we're starting to 
see more of the portfolio there, more of the way (35:26) to driving growth. 
And we know that we need to continue with our revenue strategies, 
particularly around smaller packages; referenc
e my previous comment on 
transaction, but also improving macros. I mean, the emerging markets need 
to come back. I called it out in the script.
 
The good news is Brazil's gone from being a major headwind. Actually, it 
was broadly flat in the fourth quarter.
 
Over time, that market will come back 
and so will some of the other markets that have suffered. But it'll take time.
 
And so I think it's the right journey. We know what we need to do. We know 
what macro environments need to improve. We can see a path in t
he long
-
term for the 4% to 6%, and we've got back into the range for 2018, and I 
think it's a solid estimate for 2018. Of course, the world could be volatile, 
uncertain, but I think it's a good estimate. I reference you back to 2017. We 
made a realistic as
sessment of what we thought would happen in 2017. We 
called it, and we basically hit it or slightly beat it in 2017, taking the actions 
we needed to take. And I think we got a strong plan in 2018, and it's robust.

I have a question on margins. Very impressive growth during the quarter, so 
wondering if you guys could drill down a little bit and quantify the different 
drivers of this, especially how much your refranchising contributed versus 
some o
f your other productivity efforts. And then separately, could you walk 
through how much of a contributor productivity will be to your structurally
-
adjusted operating income growth of 8% to 9% in 2018? Thanks.
 
Kathy N. Waller 
-
 
The Coca
-
Cola Co.
 
Sure, Bonni
e. Good morning. So if I were to, first of all, disaggregate the 
gross margin expansion, the majority of that increase is, in 2017, was from 
the structural change and from pricing. Gross margins are under some 
pressure from various finished goods businesse
s, and we also faced a slight 
headwind from currency and some incremental costs from the hurricanes 
from last year.
 
Having said that, however, then pivoting over to our operating margins, in 
the fourth quarter, the margins expanded over 500 basis points. S
o we 
delivered very strong comparable margin expansion, and the primary driver 
of that again being the refranchising. And again offset by some of those 
costs and a donation that was made by corporate. So the majority of what 
you're seeing is driven by the 
refranchising, but at the operating margin 
level, a significant portion of that is being driven by the productivity 
initiatives, particularly the lean center initiatives.
 
In 2018, the margin expansion will again be 

 
gross margins will continue to 
be under
 
pressure as we are moving to other categories. However, we will 
offset that with the productivity, particularly, lean enterprise initiatives, and 
there will, again, be more expansion due to the refranchising.

So the question I have is on costs, just kind of 
following up on the last 
question. How much of what you've identified is really just kind of corporate 
versus what's going on in the region? So I'm just trying to get an 
understanding of how much have you explored in all of the regions in terms 
of what you
 
could possibly do in terms of a cost out perspective? Thanks.
 
James Quincey

The Coca

Yeah. Nik, hi. James here. We've been exploring what can be done in 
corporate and across the whole enterprise, including the field. We've been 
building this mo
re as a culture than an event or a series of events. I think 
we made a lot of progress over the last number of years, going back to the 
start of several of these programs. So I think we have a clear line
-
of
-
sight to 
all the productivity initiatives we need
 
to hit the targets we previously laid 
out.
 
So there are no stones that are unturned. We not necessarily can address 
everything at the same time. Some things depend on systems being put in 
place, and you can't get everything done in the same day. Having sa
id that, 
I'll repeat myself, we have clear line of sight to what we need to drive the 
productivity that's embedded in the margin expansion, because ultimately, 
we're driving productivity, but we're also reinvesting, we're also covering 
some inflation. So a
ll of that is netted into the margin expansion that we're 
driving.

I'd li
ke to follow
-
up again on this, what seems to me, I mean, a weak profit 
guidance for this year. When we did the math, our initial reads suggest that 
the operating profit and EPS growth guidance is weaker than expected. So 
you said EPS would grow 8% to 10% f
rom fiscal year 2017 based of $1.91, 
which, as we understand, it includes the benefit of the tax reform. So as tax 
will decline to 21%, that's roughly a seven

point benefit to EPS by your 
math?

So our tax rate in 2017 was 24%. And we are estimating, and I underline 
Kathy's cautionary comments on it's not a fixed r
ate, so it could vary and 
particularly vary between quarters going down to 21%. So our year
-
to
-
year 
change in tax rate is 3 points, which, when you take it on the 76% of the 
cents on the dollar we were keeping, is a 4 percentage point headwind. So if 
you w
ant to look at it that way, you can take 4 points off the EPS growth 
due to the tax changes. However, I would also point out that we have called 
out comparable EPS, so that includes the fact we're selling some of our 
bottling businesses, which is worth 2 p
oints of growth. So you can net those 
two together. So actually, I think it's a pretty strong number off a 4% 
revenue growth in an environment where interest rates are increasing.

So on Latin America, one, just in terms o
f the price/mix improvement in the 
fourth quarter, it was quite strong, so just wanted to get a little bit more 
color there. And I know you touched on this, James, a little bit earlier about 
Brazil getting better, but wanted to just get a little bit more c
olor just in 
terms of some of the initiatives that you had in place in the price pack 
architecture initiatives. How far along are you in that market? In contrast, 
Mexico softened a bit in the fourth quarter, so just trying to get a better 
sense of the outl
ook in that market within that region?
 
James Quincey 
-
 
The Coca
-
Cola Co.
 
Yeah. I shall go in reverse order. So I think Mexico did weakened 

 
softened 
a little bit. I think it's largely the macro environment in Mexico is getting a 
little softer at the momen
t, and I think that'll likely play through a little bit, 
at least into the first half of 2018. But I think that's largely macro.
 
Of course, we are adapting and looking to execute some initiatives around 
affordability, around packaging, around launching new
 
products. We did de
-
prioritize in the fourth quarter a little bit of the low
-
margin bulk water, so 
that is part of the story but not the full story. So there a little bit of softness 
in Mexico.
 
Now driving the price/mix in the fourth quarter clearly got b
etter, and in 
part, it was due to the ongoing improvements in Brazil, where we had clarity 
been executing a plan through the year to improve affordability and focus on 
smaller packages that are more affordable but actually helped from a 
price/mix point of 
view. Plus we have the benefit of some of the price 
increases and incidence increases that flowed in in the back half of the year. 
So I think it was a pretty strong year of actions to drive RGM.

Great. Thank you very much. You mentioned earlier on that transactions 
were growing 100 basis points faster than volume, which is terrific. I was 
wondering if you could just give us 
any more thoughts on that. Do you think 
that is the likely outlook going forward in terms of 100 basis points? Do you 
think that can expand? And how does that number compare on a geographic 
basis? Are there some areas where transactions are down or other a
reas 
where transactions are up much more than 100 basis points? Just more color 
around that would be helpful. Thank you.
 
James Quincey 
-
 
The Coca
-
Cola Co.
 
Yes, sure. So I think our objective and recent history is have transactions 
growing ahead of volume o
n an aggregate basis. So clearly, it's something 
that we are pursuing actively because we are pursuing a strategy of smaller 
packages across most of the geographies, whether it's through affordability 
or whether it's around helping people with portion cont
rol. There's a lot of 
places where we're trying to drive transactions ahead of volume.
 
Now, the U.S. is one of those. Clearly, we've had the strategy around this 
area for some time. We made great progress. The mini cans were in double
-
digit growth in the f
ourth quarter, and the U.S. absolutely had transactions 
more than 100 basis points ahead of volume. So we were very pleased with 
the execution of that strategy in the U.S.
 
Similarly, the other parts of the world that most of the countries' 
transactions are
 
ahead of volume. Not everywhere, and that can sometimes 
be because we're trying to increase the affordability of the multi
-
serve 
packages, and that just happens to have a mechanical effect. But I would 
call out, as the kind of the lead ones in really driv
ing smaller packages very 
assertively, are some of the developed markets led by places like the U.S., 
Australia, France, some of the places like that. And then in the emerging 
markets, it kind of depends on whether we're driving affordability or not.

Was hoping you could speak to the repackage and flavor expansion of Diet 
Coke in the U.S. if you could just talk about your objectives there, what 
should we be expecting to see in Nielsen? What's the picture of success? Is 
this cutti
ng the volume declines in half? Is it getting the brand back into 
growth? Anything you could offer would be helpful. Thanks.

Sure. I mean, clearly, and it's one of our points of dissatisfaction in 2017 is 
we were not able 
to turnaround Diet Coke. I think the team have come up 
with a strong plan for 2018 with the new flavors, the new can design and 
size and some of the marketing. And I think we are going to have hopefully 
a better year in 2018 in terms of Diet Coke.
 
I think 
we're finding a path forward. Clearly, part of the story in 2017 
towards the end was we started doing even better with Coke Zero Sugar as 
the relaunch of that drove almost 10 points of growth in the fourth quarter 
on Coke Zero Sugar.
 
Nevertheless, we want 
to improve Diet Coke, too. We had a strong start at 
the beginning of this year with the launch of new program. Clearly, we would 
love to at least stop declining, if not get into growth. I'm not sure just the 
flavors and the packages will get us there, but 
it's certainly going to be a 
good step in the right direction.

James, you mentioned in your script about the tax changes in the U.S. and 
its impact on U.S. consumption. Can you talk
 
a little bit more about that? 
Where do you see most impact on consumption? How much, if you can 
quantify that? And then just tied to that, what's the expectation for the U.S. 
business in terms of 2018 top
-
line growth?
 
James Quincey

The Coca
-
Cola Co.
 
Wel
l, I think the first thing to say is, the tax reform has just come in, and so 
we're not actually seeing the effects into the economy yet. Clearly, as the 
investments behind more opportunities, because of the lower tax rate, start 
to occur, that will lift a
ggregate demand. But in the end, we are a broad 
enterprise. And so, lifting of consumer income ultimately is what's going to 
flow through to us.
 
As confidence returns in the economy, often you see increases in people 
going out and in foodservice, so you'd 
start to see it occur there. But we are 
ultimately going to benefit as the broad
-
based economy does better and 
more money flows into people's pockets.
 
What was the second half of the question? Oh, North America. We don't 
provide a guidance number by group,
 
but clearly, we've got a good strategy 
in North America. We believe that the sorts of revenue growth rates we've 
been delivering, like in 2017, put us in the top tier of FMCG. And we want to 
stay in the top tier of FMCG.

My question is on the fountain business. It's just a two
-
part question, very 
simple. It's a large part of your volume, about 35% in the U.S. Why has not 
been that refranchised, or 
will it be? I suppose that bottlers would benefit 
from that volume. And the second part to your question is, you've done a 
great job in terms of moving into smaller RTDs, garnering increasing 
revenue per case, higher growth there. I suppose that in some ou
tlets, over 
time, you can ship from fountain to literally smaller PET bottles, and that 
could be very profitable for the whole system. So just can you give us a 
sense of how that can play out in the future? Thank you.
 
James Quincey 
-
 
The Coca
-
Cola Co.
 
Sure
. I think you said the fountain was 75% of the volume. I'm not sure I 
heard you correctly. But just to clarify, the fountain business in the U.S. is 
about a third of the U.S. system volume, not 75% if that was the number 
you said. So it's about a third of 
the U.S. volume. It operates in a very 
different way to the bottle
-
can business. It requires different capabilities, 
both in the supply chain and the customer. And it operates largely with the 
national chains of customers, even more so and much more so tha
n the 
grocery retail and the mom
-
and
-
pop business and the convenience store 
businesses or the kind of the brick
-
and
-
mortar store.
 
So I don't think that there's any likelihood of us doing that in the short
-
term. 
I'm not sure I see the acceleration of perfor
mance advantage in doing so. 
And so I think we will stick to the strategy that we have.
 
And then, in terms of fountain versus smaller PET, what we're focused on is 
making sure we're delivering the consumer experience that they are after in 
the outlet in wh
ich they're buying and optimizing that and providing that in 
the package form that best fits that consumer experience with the customer 
that they're at. So we're not trying to artificially drive the packaging 
structure one way or the other. We're trying to
 
optimize the consumer 
experience.

Hello. Yeah, so good morning and thanks for taking my question. I wou
ld 
like to just focus on FX outlook. I understand that now it's becoming a 
tailwind, finally. And how I understand that in the past was obviously a 
major drag to EPS. So how would you think for pricing and your ability to 
take more risks in innovation, let
's say, in Latin America or even reinvest 
more in products that are less 

 
like you quoted Honest Tea 

 
on products 
that are less margin accretive in the beginning, but would be very growth 
accruing in the future? Thank you.

Okay.
 
James Quincey

The Coca

I'm not sure that we link the two pieces of the question you're putting out. I 
mean, we
 
largely have an approach where we drive our business in local 
terms. The world's not one
-
size
-
fits
-
all. So we look at each marketplace and 
say, what do we need to win in this marketplace with these consumers, 
working with the customers to create value for
 
them. And the company is, in 
a way, the sum of all those local actions.
 
Now a year ago, we talked about we were going to take some extra effort to 
make sure the sum of all that turns into positive comparable EPS growth in 
U.S. dollars, which it hadn't don
e necessarily for a few years. And we got to 
flat last year, and we're going to drive for some good growth in 2018. But 
the variations in FX, assuming they're not completely wild, don't drive our 
operational local market decisions. The expansion of the bra
nds like Honest 
and all the other innovations are really driven by the market.
 
And so, therefore, pricing is really driven by those local opportunities of 
launching the portfolio and local inflation. So to the extent that, I guess, FX 
somehow theoretically
 
is linked to local inflation, it comes to play. But we 
start at the other end of the equation, which is what does the local market 
need in terms of products and pricing, and then work it back.

Yeah, if I can just add. W
e talked about the tailwind in the first quarter, 
however, remember, we have a hedging strategy and that so whether it's a 
tailwind or a headwind, and we're really guiding towards more of a 
headwind, is because of our hedging strategy that we have employed
. And 
so we're cycling some really good hedging gains from last year, which is 
causing most of that headwind for next year.

Hi. I guess, question for you, Kathy. I just wanted to 
follow
-
up on some of 
the comments you made about free cash flow and the effect of the tax code 
change. We think about two things, gross debt and then, I guess, net 
interest expense, understand that the free cash flow conversion maybe 
comes down a bit, but 
seems like you had more access to cash. So I guess, 
over time, forgetting about what's going to happen this year, will you have 
the ability to maybe take gross debt balances down over the next few years 
is the first question? And then related to that as we
 
think about interest 
expense, with rates rising and then whatever you may do with gross debt 
balances, just how we should think about net interest expense, both for 
2018 and beyond?
 
Kathy N. Waller 
-
 
The Coca
-
Cola Co.
 
Hi, Bryan. So gross debt balances wil
l 

 
are initially going to come down 
about $7 billion, as we said in our remarks. And that will allow us to then 
kind of balance out our spread.
 
Over the long term, yes, we have 

 
tax reform gives us the ability to have 
flexibility with our cash. So we wil
l employ the right capital structure for us. 
We're going to keep a net leverage position of 2 to 2.5 times and as we need 
to, yes, we could potentially bring down more gross debt. The focus right 
now is maintaining that net debt leverage position.
 
Interest
 
expense is, obviously, we're in a rising interest environment, and 
our interest expense will be going up, even though we are going to pay 
down some of our gross debt. And over time, I guess, you asked about 
specifically the longer
-
term kind of outlook for
 
interest expense.
 
Today, we only have about 20% floating. As we are, I guess, moving over 
time, more into 

 
we will, I believe move more into a floating rate 
environment, as we see the benefit, and that will hopefully help us to temper 
that interest rate 
expense increase. But for now, interest rates are going up 
as we have continued to move our debt into longer
-
term maturities over 
time. And because of when we bring back the $7 billion, we will take out 
some of our commercial paper, which has a lower inter
est rate.
 
So basically, I would say we'll take a look at the capital structure, always 
manage it over time for now. We believe the right thing is to bring back the 
$7 billion, pay down gross debt, manage to a 2% to 2.5% net leverage 
position. And that does
 
impact our interest expense going forward. And over 
time, we'll continue to manage that as well.
